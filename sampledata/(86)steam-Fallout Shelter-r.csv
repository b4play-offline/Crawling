18,pretty cool game
19,addicting but gets boring after a little while
20,I found this game to be fun to a point. That point would be if you plan on building up your shelter and sending the survivors out into the fallout to wander around finding stuff and killing creatures to level up or you might want to be like myself and keep every one on the inside of the shelter and only letting ppl come in from the outside. I guess you can do whatever your little heart desires in this fun little game. All you have to do is push play.
21,pretty fun if you're bored of other types of games
22,THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!! way to hard WAY WAY TO DIFFUCUTLY. I AM MAD why did they make it so hard other fallouts easir buy a long shoot it doesnt make cents not worth the gameplay or time.

41,"It's a good game,
Oh, so your saying that micro-transactions ruin it? Oh contrare! Since the game is not stored on a server you are capable of hacking into it with a simple save editor that can be found online, and then you can guve yourself infinite of anything, you can also change the skin color of any of your characters to something outlandish, like hot pink, or lime green, or blue. You can give your characters any weapon or apparel in the game, and food/water/energy will no longer be a problem! So yeah, I just play this game for the missions where you go out on expeditions."
42,"Fallout Shelter is a fun game about creating a fallout shelter as the title suggests. The game has a very creative aspect to it creating a layout and ideal arrangement for a fallout shelter. In the 'Fallout' game series this is the only free game available, I suggest this is a great start for someone who wants to get into the fallout games. There are vast differences to this game and the other Fallout games as it is entirely cartoon like unlike a more realistic game in the series such as 'Fallout 76' or 'Fallout 4'. I would highly recommend this game to anyone including people that might not show interest towards a post-nuclear destruction game. I hope that if you play this game you'll have as much fun as me!"

There's no reason not to give this a go if you're looking for a unique and relaxing single-player experience."

54,micro transactions scam
55,"Game freezes every time it is opened, just have to altF4 then open again because autosaves so not a big deal.
Game offers beginners pack but only once so when someone deletes your save you never get another beginner pack.
Game has removed menu that it once had which allows user to look at things that are equipped so good luck finding that one outfit with the right stats for the job or the gun that someone has that can save your dying dwellers in time by clicking each dweller across your base one by one while they run around during emergency but oh no...
Double clicking on dweller will slowly zoom camera into room instead of selecting dweller.
While camera control is commandeered during zoom of any kind for any reason, sometimes automated and sometimes endlessly looped by border glitch, any camera manipulation attempted by user is resisted by the game.
Mysterious stranger cannot always be clicked on while zoomed out because perspective shift distorts camera location and this effects mouse detection for some reason.
Camera takes forever to zoom in so mysterious stranger is usually gone by the time the game lets me click on him.
No control over which rooms will lose power during brownouts.
Athletics score does not effect running speed, is used for attack frequency.
Not immediately clear what stats are needed for manufacturing rooms."

59,"""This game compacts fallout in to something so simple, its amazing."""
60,"On Android I would recommend it, but on Steam tech it's functions are obnoxious and annoying."
61,Addicting
62,"I do enjoy the base building mechanic as its simple yet effective. Having main rooms like Power, food or water is effective but this only truly works if you invest cash into the game to get yourself a Mr Handy as they can collect these whilst being offline. Overall it is fun because you can meet youre favourite characters in the game, for example Piper, Mr Burke and Mr Tenpenny and many more, You can also send out your Vault Dwellers to go collect items such as caps, clothing, weapons and Junk (which will be useful later on). But if you can best to send them out with Stimpacks, and Radaway (25 of each) will say that they level up as well when outside the vault, which i found to be a quick way, the max level being 50. Best stats to get to 10 because you can train your dwellers with special rooms (example being a gym for strength), Strength, Endurance, Intelligence and Luck. Endurance being the key one as it allows your dweller to have more Hitpoints.

Overall fun game very simple, Good Overseers"
63,"Great casual game, highly addictive and good if you got little time to play and just like to dip in and out.

64,Fun little break from the grit of the Fallout games.
65,"This game has been out for years, for free, and on multiple platforms.  I love the Fallout series in general, but like that this is a little more of an idle game.  I like to play it when I'm mostly just trying to chill out and relax after a long day."

Really funny game and great details.  I played for 9 hrs straight."
74,"The short version? 50 million people downloaded the game on Android, before it even got to PC. So get it already. It's free.

The longer version. A serious warning up front. This game seems like a walk in the park - until it suddenly isn't. You can lose an entire vault, the fruits of months of realtime work, within minutes. So, let's avoid this, or more precisely, let's talk about how to avoid the possibility until you feel able to face the challenge.

Resources (energy, water, and food) are produced in production rooms. Rooms need energy, dwellers need water and food. The value of the production room does not give you its actual output. So, 20 dwellers do not need production rooms showing 20 food and water. Instead, every dwellers has skills (in Fallout normally called attributes, ""special""), and the skill of the dweller in a production defines its output. More skill means more production, even if the room is not upgraded. In consequence, get a feel for what your vault needs by keeping an eye on your resource storage. If it fills up, however slowly, you're peachy.

This game has clearly defined progressive danger steps. Every tenth dweller adds a new threat (most notable until the 60th). So when you work on getting the feeling for production, I suggest doing so with nine dwellers.

Now that you know how to handle resources, let's go back to the core of the game, rooms need energy. If the energy storage of your vault even once falls below the line on the storage meter, you are in the process of losing your vault. Don't say you weren't warned. The reason why energy is more important than food and water is simply that there is no food and water without energy.

Getting a feeling for resource storage is not rocket science, so the real problem are the dangers. First, on the uppermost level of your vault build your first power room. The dwellers in it need strength for production, which also gives them resilience in a fight. Until you become really good, this is your best line of defense against intruders.

However, the true danger is random fires and infestations. With one exception, both fires and infestations do NOT spread diagonally. I am aware that 50 million people ignore this and every ""best vault build"" on the net tells you otherwise, but develop your vault keeping this in mind, and you cannot lose your vault...

... until you willingly and purposefully choose to have your 50th dweller !!!

The second your vault has fifty dwellers, infestations include radscorpions. They teleport. They not only rot out every dweller they find, they drain your energy storage even while in an empty room. So as long as you are not an expert in the game's mechanics and as long as you do not have the proper equipment, one of two things will happen. The merciful version kills all but three of your 50 dwellers and you may have a chance to start from scratch. Accent on ""may"". The cruel version kills only fifteen, but leaves you with an empty energy storage.

Well then, now that you are spared the nasty surprise, let's talk about the fun factor. FOS is a blast. Could there be more contents? Sure. Could some things be done better? You betcha. But FOS has that elusive ingredient, which once upon a time made Sid Meier's Civilization legendary. You start the game to do nothing more than the half hour of maintenance - and then your tummy rumbles, because, hey, you didn't even sip some water in the last eight hours.

Oh, one more technical tip. Unlike what the FOS wiki states, a higher Luck skill outside the wault does not give you better items, but more caps. Perception rules item quality in loot.

At the end, a word about shop items. If you don't buy items on principle, you can stop reading here.

The starter pack and the lunch boxes contain resources. The game sometimes asks you to collect a certain amount of resources. The ones from the pack and the boxes do not count towards this goal. So, the only obvious use of purchased resources is emergency fill-up after a botched radscorpion infestation. Throwing money at this problem would most certainly help, but given the hit dweller corpses cause to happiness, don't presume it will solve the pronlem all on its own.

The early value of the pack and the boxes is twofold, skilled dwellers and the chance for a rare or better weapon. A single rare or better weapon in your energy production room guarding the vault entrance makes a huge difference early on. Skilled dwellers before having the rooms to train them yourself are sheer gravy. There is a catch with both, though.

Part of the game's fun is to figure out, which items are worth keeping and which aren't. When you buy boxes, make sure you have the item storage space - and remember, a dweller, who loots the wasteland, may come back with 40 items.

The catch of skilled dwellers is a little tricky. You want your highest level dweller to roam outside for loot. The starter pack gives you a brutal advantage to this end. However, when you just started, your average vault level will rise significantly with the starter pack. So don't forget to give one of the weapons coming with the pack to your guard room. Raiders are not much of a trouble throughout the game, except this early.

I hope that this short review gives you a fighting chance without the frustration of a vault wipe-out."
75,EPIC GAME :)
76,"Game itself is simple, uses a lot of Fall Out references to add humour, plot, and characters from various versions of the game. Had an ongoing issue with game crashing and losing file save so ultimately abandoned game. Got extremely frustrating to continually lose progress as achievement progress isn't cumulative and must be restarted at every new game. If you don't care about that it's a pretty fun game, but I wouldn't recommend if that's important to you."

97,"It's a relaxing and casual game. If you're the type to base build and love to find loot, this could be the game for you.

The biggest issue I have while playing with this game is the Radscorpion Attack (I had the Radscorpion spawn twice in a row, with a 30 second period in between). Please remove them from the game or at least delay when they would start spawning until most of the vault has good gear. They're really annoying to deal with since they have a high amount of HP, They constantly move every 15 seconds, and they suck out more power leaving your entire vault powerless the moment that thing is finally killed. Combine this with the fact that it's very clunky to assign dwellers into a room to deal with the radscorpion and you'll get the greatest troublesome experience."

119,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

141,"You may wonder why someone would post a negative review with over 100 hours logged into the game.

Well...I enjoyed the game.  Played it waaaay back when it first came out (both on mobile and the Bethesda app), and after a recently replay of Fallout 4 fired it back up and have been having fun with it.  Got lots of dwellers.  Bought a bunch of stuff on sale (just to admit my level of investment).  Had just started leveling some max-stat characters and was about to start running them on quests...

And my save is corrupted.  Game crashes when trying to load my vault.  It looks like this is something that can happen when using cloud saves, which I did because I'd bounce between my desktop, laptop, and Steam Deck (which played it well).  I looked around for possible fixes, and nothing I found worked.  So all this time and effort (and a bit of money) put into this vault, gone.

It's a shame.  This is a fun little time-waster of a game.  But losing it all like this stings a little."
142,"CRASHES CONSTANTLY
I was enjoying it, it would crash randomly every now and then. Then logged in and had 3 people walking around randomly, if I click on any of them the game auto crashes. So that save is now gone, luckily I never spend money but if I had brought any in game micro-transactions they would of been lost"

Overall, if this game is your thing, go ahead and get it. If you hate it, you can just delete it and technically get a refund of 0$ (unlike FA76)"

¬Ω tsp bicarbonate of soda
¬º tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ¬Ω tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¬º tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8‚Äì10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you‚Äôve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don‚Äôt leave them too long or they‚Äôll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking"
159,"I love the game, its fun and a good way to pass time. It has a few downsides, glitches, bugs and the lack of an  auto collect when offline so its fairly easy for things to get low even when you're not running the game, but it's still good and I'd say great for people to play if they don't have expenses for the actual games."
160,"It gets repetitive. But for some reason, I reinstall it and replay it form time to time over the years."
161,good game if you have a decent amount of free time
162,"Ported over from mobile for the achievements.
Honestly no idea how i spent 59 hours in the game. It's good, but after maxing out on money and facility before missions were a thing, i was only after the 20 legendary dwellers achievement, which is 100% pay-to-get."
163,"Colonel Autumn has 5 children, with 5 different mothers. I randomly put them into a room just to see what happened, I felt my eyebrows raise, and my jaw drop, I then began to laugh so hard I fell out of my chair. Thank you, Bethesda.

10/10 Would let curiosity strike again."
164,"Good game, new content is unlocked at a steady pace, although make sure to bear in mind that there is quite a bit of waiting and doing nothing early on but my n.1 tip would be - always have someone out exploring for loads of loot and caps"
165,"its a good game to veg out offline and engaging while online
"
166,Addictive and fun..
167,"Amount of clicking: 11/10
Loot to collect: 10/10
Temptation to use real money: 8/10
Art: 10/10
PC requirements: able to power on

If you ever got addicted to the Cookie Clicker game but wanted more loot and optional strategy, this is the game for you."

176,"uhm, it has basic mechanics, simple gameplay and it's easy to run. I wouldn't recommend it for hardcore gaming, pretty much in the relaxed and chill genre area. I only play [b]Fallout Shelter[/b] once every 2 weeks to release any built up stress and see how my vault dwellers are doing.

200,Crawl out through the fallout baby
201,
202,"cool little fallout based city builder, an underground vault city. seems not entirely p2w, like most are these days. time consuming, but worth it if this is your kinda thing"
203,"I used to really love this game and play it all day long on my phone and PC. Despite the huge bugs and issues with difficulty cliffs causing your colony to collapse and lose weeks of progress, it was fun.

Then out of the blue, years after release, the devs replaced core features and gameplay balance with microtransactions.

They've taken a perfectly good idle colony builder game and gutted into a money-grubbing mobile game that's a serious hazard to anyone vunerable to gambling addiction or financial exploitation."
204,kind of like the sims meets fallout
205,"gr8
"
206,"the best way i can describe this game is fallout for people who don't like fallout

give bethesda your money"
207,I get addicted to this game for like 3 weeks every 2 months
208,good game
209,omg just like minecraft
210,yeah
211,Nuclear Holocaust
212,fun ngl
213,wonderful game love the story overall great game its pretty hard but i love it
214,yes good game
215,"god
"
216,"Played this a ton on my phone til it broke. So whatever time it says; add about 500 more hours on top of that. Great game for killing 15 minutes or a few hours. You need to be able to resist the microtransactions though because they do be lookin foine. Other than that it's the perfect blend of Sims and ""I-can't-be-bothered-picking-out-what-kind-of-toaster-I-want"" merged with Fallout."
217,"this game is probably, almost definitely, objectively garbage

yet I play it so idk what to tell you"
218,"This game is pretty fun to play, the graphics is nice and the atmosphere of the game as well, it is free 100% recommended."
219,i like anything fallout

really good still to this day"
223,its ight
224,Nice game to grind
225,"Simple but fun, a nice thing to casually play when you're stressed out.  Cute art style and humor."
226,Yeah
227,Still better than Fallout 76.
228,radroach
229,yes but boring after a while
230,"It's pretty adorable art-wise. If you're looking for a weak version of the original game this works. I'm not a fan of micro-transactions inside games but I do understand this is a phone game, that is free and so they're trying to make money somehow. Arguably it's justified."
231,i have mods so it fun
232,"yes
"
233,"amazing game. there are so much things to do in this game, upgrade rooms, get pets, go into the wasteland. great game."
234,Good game -_-

243,good
244,Micro transaction grinder
245,piece of mobile trash
246,Skinner's Box with a Fallout skin that I'm sure saddens the designers of other Fallout games. Don't waste your time or money on IAP trash.
247,it is a good game and really addictive
248,It's a good game to play every now and then while your watching something.
249,Loads of fun has yo u play god with your inhabitants lives. Just flip a coin and decide to kick someone out to the wasteland because there breathing to much of your recycled air or just send them off to fight for there lives. The fun never ends with your all those little pixels in your hands.
250,I can't stop
251,"very good vault overseer/god simulator!
I do recommend this game."
252,"very fun, if you like this kind of stuff"

255,It good
256,"Nice game, easy, and most important it is free. People should try this game and give it chance."
257,"yes
it fallout shelter"
258,"If you are playing on PC make sure you disable the controller option. I was getting desperate because it was almost impossible to play with controller, but once you play with mouse and keyboard is excellent."
259,"A cute fun Fallout game, if you like Fallout I'd at least try it."
260,epic game
261,"I've been playing this game since I was a little kid, and it is still a work of art. Bethesda, you've done it again!"
262,"cash money
tres gucci"
263,Its fine
264,"Its all fun unil raiders show up #NERFRAIDERS
"
265,It's fun to kill time.
266,"A fun little game. its more made for fallout fans. and if you are one you will love this game. theres alot to do and collecting all the cool characters from your favorite games makes it 10 times better. if you like fallout i highly recommend this game, even on mobile!"
267,"Pretty simple game play, nothing complicated."
268,:)
269,"Good game, but its better to have sync between phone and pc throw gplay or FB. So I will pkay this only on my phone."
270,A unique fallout experience. For all fallout fanboys
271,really fun
272,"help  ive been raded like 40 times in a row
 and i have goten  mole attacks and roatch things
 HELP ME
"
273,grindy micro-transaction trap
274,Dont bother buying anything on here cause theres a website where you can just get the stuff for free

288,This game is nice to relax with.
289,"A fun way to pass the time. It can be played in the background of other miscellaneous tasks, or it can be your primary focus - if so, it is easy to lose an hour maintaining a decently sized vault."
290,"it's a pretty good game, sometimes hard to get into but still enjoyable.

I'm a little disappointed you cant rush the living quarters because the idea of someone failing so hard at flirting that you summon radroaches is hilarious."

Personally...*sigh* I don't want to spend my time grinding for money to buy resources for my people. Sure, that shows signs of terrible leadership, maybe I'm just not meant for that though?"

311,One of best Simulation Game
312,Its easy to learn but there is strategy to the game. Surprisingly very addictive.
313,Yeah it's pretty fun!
314,pretty good game if you have time to kill
315,.
316,it is kinda like trying to kill yourself
317,
318,"Honestly the only idle game that has forever caught my eye, played it on my ipad years ago then on switch now i decided pc is better. 10/10 since you don't REALLY need to pay for anything if you just have patience and skill reguarding the daily quests and so on. One of, if not the best idle game i have played."
319,"An idle game. The only interesting thing about it is the Fallout stuff. The gameplay itself is mostly waiting, which I hate."
320,I Love it
321,"perfect
"
322,"its fun
"
323,Good. But it become better with hacks.
324,"Fallout Shelter is a simple, addictive and amusing mobile phone game with a lot of grind and RNG. The gameplay is a timed experience in the exact same vain as those farming games that you see on mobile phones.

I'd never recommend spending money on it but yeah, as a free to play game that helps passing time when you're indecisive on what to do next, yeah I'd recommend it."
325,"my whole play through was destroyed by invincible roided up rad roaches, 10/10 experience would do again"
326,"10/10
"
327,"It's Fallout, what's not to like
"
328,I like eggs ü•ö
329,Time killer. Fun little side quests. But it can take many hours to get to the next level. Just sit and wait.

331,i play when waiting on squad it okay i guess (dont have minesweeper)
332,why is obama not a character here
333,It is quite interesting
334,DINKLEBERG!!!!!!!!!
335,Too many raiders attacking me
336,"fix bug please, weird bug is father gave birth"
337,lol yall gonna starve lmao
338,It's basic and simple.  If you want a game that will give you a bit of mindless fun this is the one.  The only thing I wish were changed is the drop rate on rare characters....it's much too low.  I've been playing for a while and yet to get even one.
339,it sucks you in.
340,Great fun game but its too grindy. Perfect for mobile causal gaming though
341,"I've played this game off and on since its release on multiple platforms and, it is a good time sink with no absolute need to buy anything. You can pick it up and put it down at leisure."
342,"my main game rn, you'll start to like it more when you know stuff ab the game."

354,i like hot mamas
355,"It is a great idle game, if you like that. They are a terrible time sink, so beware of that. Also, if part of the game were not meant as an idler I would keep playing it, there are great mechanics, but too much dependent on constant attention."
356,"Me gusta mucho la tem√°tica, hay juegos similares, pero este es el que me ha gustado m√°s."
357,fun
358,okay I guess

361,Simple yet Great
362,"[h1] I finally did it [/h1]

After 60 hours on pc,
and according to statistics 60 more hours on ipad
120 hours into the game on my main vault i have finally 
reached two big goals, achievements and Story.

[h1] Vault stuff [/h1]

The vault 370 (which was named after my Gamer Tag Kons37 at the time)
was created on ipad in 2016 (presumably).
It started with a dweller (which name i dont recall) who is now named first
dweller. There is a also a dweller named One year fallout shelter, but
he isn‚Äôt that interesting, I don‚Äôt plan on making a 6 or more year dweller
but maybe if the vault reaches 10 years.

[h1] Little Device History [/h1]

As mentioned enough times, the world was created 
on iPad Air 2 in 2016, I have 60 hours on iPad, but
i stopped playing Fallout shelter once I transferred my progress
in 2021, I transfered to my current PC witch had :
[b] Ryzen 3 2200g, a 1TB HDD, 8 gb of ram. [/b]
Soon after I got a gaming PC where I played for about three months on,
this is also where I started playing with mods, the pc had :
[b] Intel i7-4700k, an RTX 2070 super, 32gb ram,
an M.2 boot drive and an HDD Storage Drive [/b]
I sold that pc, and then finally got my one and only main PC
running. It consists of :
[b] Ryzen 7 3700x, an RTX 3060 TI, 32gb ram, 
1TB Dual M.2 storage, 6TB Surveilance HDD storage and 
a lot of Fans. [/b]
This is where I am currently playing fallout shelter on,
and I‚Äôm not planning to upgrade anytime  soon, so it‚Äôs 
to be expected I shall play a lot longer on this pc.

[h1] Dwellers [/h1]

I currently have 9 of the 23 legendary dwellers, and 200 dwellers total.
I wanted to collect them all, but i did start optimizing ressource output 
and scrapped tons of Legendary Dweller outfits and weapons and replacing
them with rare counter parts, i will soon start re-aranging rooms for a third
time and probably be done with the vault layout.

(100 M / 100 F)

My main dwellers are currently ; Kons, Leon, Andrew, Elizabeth.
Kons, Andrew and Elizabeth we're my first and best quest team i had,
they started out with legendary Raider outfits and Raider swords,
after i gave them heavy merc gear and gave one of them a minigun.
Then i gave them power armor and varius Laser Gatling-guns.
Now i finally gave them all X-10 Mk 6 Armor with ""Revenge"" to all my
Dweller's living in the highest floor.

[h1] First Feat [/h1]

I also reached all Scrap Items but that isn't a big feat.
Tough it was one of the first big things i reached, i didn't document it
but it was a big moment i presume.

[h1] 100% Achievements [/h1]

I have reached all achievemnts recently, it wasnt super hard
but also required a lot of waiting for raider attacks, lot of weapon
upgrading, scrapping and changing to maximise my defense.

[h1] 100% Quests [/h1]

Then i completed all quest's, i reached 100 quest's a while ago
but it didn't update the achivement when transfering from ipad to pc.
So i did a lot of side quest's too, most of the times waiting for mr.handy quest's.

[h1] Legitness? [/h1]

I haven't paid for anything till 2 days ago, where i bought the starter pack
because i wanted to have that aswell, i also have been using the ""Fallout
shelter modpack"" from Nexus mods. Link here : https://www.nexusmods.com/falloutshelter/mods/2
I have been using it to get 100% scrap rate and more mr.handys per etage,
also that nuka cola factories produce nuka quantum [b] LIKE THEY SHOULD [/b]
while some may find this cheating i was already a long way in and the game's
limitations are really frustrating, that i can only hold 100 items when
exploring doesnt make it any better.

I never used any mod to give me unlimited ressources or materials, tough 
this mod has the ability to do that, tough i never used it, you can change 
settings to make it easier / cheesier.

[h1] Continue playing? [/h1]

I am planning on finishing the game, tough i might publish a save file
someday if somebody want's that.
First gotta work on the room layout, storage is a big thing, get all 
dwellers respectably max stats for the dedicated room and have most 
if not all reach level 50.

[h1] Pet‚Äòs and Pet names [/h1]

I have a lot of pets (tough only 31/98) unlocked.
I only sold one pet this entire time (accidental)
but have kept every other pet i have found, 113 
so-far, minus one.
I named a few pets after pets of my family or friends
They are mostly with named dwellers.

[h1] More Vaults? [/h1]

370 isn't my only vault, but it's my best one and
will be till i reach 100% where i will make a 60
Dweller vault, till then i will continue crafting recycling
and producong more weapons till my vault has reached
perfection.

goodbye."

366,"A breath of nostalgia, just as I remembered it. Nice mechanics, wish you could binge the game more without waiting for cool downs and wait times. Same eccentric touch as all Fallout games."
367,good game!
368,good
369,I uh... I like
370,great game
371,"ooh yea yea
"
372,it good game to able leave it running while multi task sometimes hehe
373,chill
374,Pretty calming game for when you have no internet access.
375,"boring, but simple"
376,"This game is both entertaining and frustrating; filled mostly with the tedium of watching an ant farm as the survivors in the shelter go about their tasks of ensuring their collective survival, interspersed with either random attacks from the surface or disasters from within such as fires or pest infestation burrowing through the ground."
377,it is good for the money you paid
378,"this is so fun and time consuming fr good game to pass time
"
379,"yall know its a good game, no need to mention"
380,very good
381,"...
"
382,"my people died
"
383,I spent a lot of time on this game and one day it just randomly deleted my saves. Never been able to get into it again since then
384,its a great game for people who like fallouts valts
385,good game to chill
386,"This game is an amazing game. It's a good way to by-past time quick and easy, - I recommend it if your intressted in these type of game.

9/10 from me!"
387,I would 100% recommend this game I love it so much there is so much to do within the game! :)
388,Good game
389,its fun i guess
390,Kinda sick forcing people to have babies when you cant even get bitches yourself.
391,The game is designed to extract money from you. Not very fun.
392,It's cute.  And it can keep you interested.  Big time dump and designed to make the player engage in micro transactions.  But it's fun and engaging.  More enjoyable I think than Fallout itself which I've never been able to get into.
393,idk if i have done incest in this game or not????
394,Its fun however just be careful when you have children dwellers they'll consume resources but wont work so you must have enough resources if you want children.
395,Kindly please re-adjust or nerf the radscorpion pls it too much op
396,cant believe this game is as old as it is now. This game is available on pretty much every device you can think of. I like playing it on PC the most out of anywhere as this game is most appreciated on a large screen. However it also plays very nice on touch devices. Especially iPad.
397,i wish i could be in the living quarters to make a family
398,:D
399,YES
400,Unironically the best Fallout game
401,Fun...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................for three hours
402,Yes
403,This Shit is ADDICTIVE
404,"This is too addictive. 9/10 do not start it up, you'll be anxious about your Wasteland Explorers getting killed for days straight.

Otherwise, there are two irritating quirks:
1) non-retroactive HP bonus from Endurance on level-up - it is annoying and should not have been like this - but there is a savegame editor which helps;
2) difficulty (slightly) dependent on average level of the Dwellers with level-up marker-buttons preceding all other action-markers on characters and being easy to click on uninteded - guess this is due this game's ""mobile"" nature."
405,"This game is fun and somewhat addictive. It is fun to go on quests and hunt for the little guy in the trench coat; also, I enjoy strategizing to make the most of the limited caps (funds) provided to begin with."
406,funny
407,its fun
408,"uhhh, idk really"
409,"good game. just get lots of guns
"
410,game good :)
411,This game is fun
412,The game is really fun but the best thing about it is that...its just good and that's all
413,giant waste of time
414,"Pretty good, if you have enough patience"
415,can get very annoying with random spam attack events mid to late game but its pretty fun with the adventures
416,"Despite being a promotional maneuver for upcoming Fallout 4, it is way more fun and balanced than the game itself.
Jokes aside, it is a good managemnt game and selfless dictator simulator. Latest updates made the game even better with all these quests and new enemies & mechanics and all this stuff. It can be played if you're stoned or drunk af and want to chill for some time, having some music or video playing in background. Probably can cure insomnia too. There are minor issues with this game being a PC port and UI though, also odd game design choices with radscorpions being more dangerous than deathclaws (who became too smol) and same stuff on Wasteland Log that you can read (oh no the Vicious Dog is too dangerous, but taking down a goddamn Yao guai is fine)
Nonetheless, this game can be both challenging and relaxing, so I can recommend it to everyone."
417,noice
418,"What if it was fallout 4, except without any of the content that made fallout 4 good, except for the base building, and then made it base building.

If you understood any of that, then congrats! You're fit to play fallout shelter."
419,"Quite fun if you need to pass time quickly, first started playing it i thought i only played 1 hour, Nope, it was 3, Seems i get carried away with this game.."
420,benovica
421,probably one of the best free to play games i've played in a while
422,make people suffer
423,"fun
"
424,"Steam's review character limit is too low to aptly encourage somebody to try this game. It's truly a certified hood classic.

As an idle game it excels in all aspects with excellent active playing content, good offline grinding, not to mention the great quality of not going overboard on pay-to-win mechanics. One should note, however, this game is a rather large time commitment and it really is a long term project. Don't go into it expecting to be able to grind for as long as you want, when you want, because it simply does not function that way. In all honesty the game's design is genius because it forces recurring active gameplay or you cannot progress.

Lastly, the game is a great creative outlet as you're more or less able to do whatever you want. 

Oh and it's free. Just get it. :)"
425,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
426,great game
427,I love it

437,"very buggy,  will just end up frustrating you in the end,  at least it's free."
438,"A nice base management game set in the Fallout universe. You don't have had to play Fallout games previously to understand this, but obviously you get a bit more out of it if you have. Manage people, build the vault and allocate jobs and quests. You can focus on the game or just check back every once in a while."

446,a very good game!
447,good game
448,"Loved it on mobile, also loving it on PC! The quests and Wasteland missions make the game so much more enjoyable than a simple classic idle game. Very easy to play and to go through without spending a single penny on the microtransaction."

454,"I made my entire female population pregnant, only to have them be completely decimated by a deathclaw attack. The men were off scavenging. The robots put up a valiant effort, alas futile. There were no survivors. The look on the faces of the men when they came back home were indescribable. I have failed as an overseer and as a person. I feel deep shame and regret.

470,"Its fun idk what to put
"
471,Have played this game on and off for years. It's great for a pick up and play when I get board.
472,fun game
473,"I used to think this was good because i'm already a fan of Bethesda Games but you should:

1) Worry about any program that doesn't provide any means to uninstall it. There are no uninstall options for this on my system anywhere including the expected traditional places and tools i am using like IOBit Uninstaller.
2) It really is a bit of a scam designed to encourage people to spend lots of money buying pointless lunchboxes that offer mostly crap, and once you have done it once it doesn't much serve any future purpose."
474,"I think for what this game is (effectively a mobile game), and the time I spent in this game I can somewhat recommend this. Essentially this game is a base building simulator with people and tasks you micromanage, and for the 12 hours I played I found it to be engaging. I liked the quests where you travelled out of the bunker, and the loot you could get, but with the long waiting times on the way and back it sometimes took a while to get stuff done. This is where microtransactions came into play as specific currencies could speed up processes. I never bought into this crap, and I managed to build a halfway decent place for my people. I think overall I'd recommend this as it's free, and I got a little bit of joy out of it, 5/10"

494,Love Fallout Series

519,"Fun, if somewhat shallow, game, with a bit of that dark humour and Fallout charm. Gameplay does tend to get samey rather quickly, and once you've got to grips with the gameplay it's unlikely to pose any particular challenges, outside of survivor modes. Frequent bugs can prove frustrating."

533,"This game hasn't been designed for computers and definitely not for offline playing. I had about 100 crashes when I tried to play it offline, it went fine when online. Which is absurd, this is a computer game, not a phone game. Also, I dislike that game time passes even when the game is off, because this makes no sense, I may not want to play for a week without my game suffering. Also, I had some kind of emergency while I was  away from the computer, when I returned, I had 7 of the 23 dwellers I had alive. Everyone else was dead. I got angry and quit the game, thinking I can revive them later. Nope. When I turned on the game today, surprise surprise, I have only 7 dwellers and nobody to revive. So basically my game went from fine to zero just because I wasn't on the computer for 15 minutes. Well, thanks but no thanks. This is nothing worth wasting your time on. It's something a 10yo may enjoy, but grown ups usually can't."

563,game good
564,Good game if you don't have much time to play
565,iz fun
566,I‚Äôm on the fence about this one. On the one hand it‚Äôs a cute little sims style game I played loads of on my iPad. On the other everything is behind a timer (I know you can skip it but it‚Äôs still there). It does get quite repetitive after a couple days. I think I probably won‚Äôt recommend it even to fallout fans. If you like fallout you should play new vegas or something.

579,"Still best Bethesda Fallout.
Negative for monetization of last achievement. "" Blast from the past"", you need to get twenty unique characters, u can get 3 from quests, other 17 can be get from loot boxes. U receive them  pretty rarely, few from in-game quests and achievements, 1 guaranteed in a week. From forums a learned that it takes from 120 to 650 loot boxes to collect them all. For me the number was nearly 600, huge amount of money ( 40 cost	$19.99, so from 60 to 325 $) or time ( from 3 to 15 years). For me it looks a bit too much.
Lucky, the saves for game are local, so you can find them. Some one got mad so hardly, he made fallout shelter save editor. Really hope Microsoft stops Bethesda from fucking the corpse of fallout."
580,"yes, its pretty good"

584,"good but old

585,piss
586,very gut
587,yeah
588,OK... so i have very mixed feelings about this game. one is that it is fun to see your little vault transform into a booming civilization but on the other hand it gets a little boring because you have to wait a lot and its a lot of rinse and repeat but other than that the game is really fun and i would suggest getting it if you aren't impatient like me :)
589,"Honestly really good, but apparently too hard for little kids to understand. (my brother)"

598,Its an alright game. I only really play it when im stoned and cant seem to aim in fps. But lemme tell you something.. taking 9 hot dabs isnt the move. This review took me a while to right since i had to make sure that it was readable. OH SHIT my dwellers are getting attacked gotta go
599,good time sink very addictive

601,Always gonna love this game!
602,
603,you can make babies
604,"Game is a lot easier than it was from 2015-2020. (I max'd out on mobile)

You gain way more caps, lunchboxes, and dwellers. Revive costs and unlocking rooms/cost of them are very cheap. Daily objectives are very easy and give very generous rewards. Game is not pay to win in anyway, spending money is just a quality of life. You can easily play this game and enjoy every bit of content without spending a dime.

I would recommend this game to any Fallout Franchise lovers. Good graphics, quests, items, pets, weapons, armor, etc. There is even a crafting system for weapons, outfits, and armor like Fallout 4. It's like sims, but post-apocalyptic.

Near end-game content becomes a grind and rng for completing your storage collection of all the legendary items (There are a lot!). So you may be max level with everything, but you may have not of gotten that Fatman or T-51 Armor.

Replay ability is really only necessary if you are trying to play the game a certain way and restrict yourself. This is kind of a *makes single save file* kind of game."

621,"I love this game. I've played it on several platforms. With that being said, the Steam version is absolutely the WORST version of Fallout Shelter. It's a dumpster fire. Bugs & glitches galore. Half-implemented lazy garbage mouse controls. Controller implementation is a joke compared to Console. Touch controls don't work at all compared to mobile. Missing details. Crashes. freezes. I love this game, but play it on any other platform. Don't waste time on the Steam version - it's a lazy port and it shows.

I gave it over a year to see if it improved. What happened? It got even worse."

643,"A very addicting human ant farm, generating a near constant need for attention exacerbated by the game continuing to count the hours even when you're not playing. Generations rise and explorers die if you step away for dinner."
644,"Fallout Shelther is the best game I have ever played!!!!! Except for Red Dead Redempti0on 2, of course. I only wish nothing happen ed to the dog! :( So so so so so so sad Buyt overall a very good gamer


Edit: My daughter wrote this review. You're welcome."
645,It's a free game. Fun and simple. A Fallout game. What more can you ask for?

657,"While there are many options for spending money, the game also provides adequate in-game ways to earn the paid for items. There is one achievement where spending money will probably be necessary, gaining 20 Legendary Dwellers, as there are few ways to earn them from quests and the drop chance from the lunchbox items is tiny.

Overall I recommend the game for Fallout fans and Casual gamers alike."
658,good game
659,It may not take up much memory but it's a very good game :).
660,"Before I played this I had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
661,"This is definitely a game that is mostly uneventful. It's a game that you play while you're doing other things. It is a simulator game, so a lot of things are done for you. I like it to relax at night before I go to bed."
662,It can take some patience but it pays off this game is free and a bunch of fun!

678,"Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play mobile game where you build and manage a Vault and take care of the people inside it, even though 99% of Vaults in Fallout were sinister experiments. There's microtransactions to skip the inevitable waiting times that come with doing anything, or to get better loot. It initially came out in 2015 as part of a marketing campaign for Fallout 4.

The gameplay is puddle-deep and mindless once you get to understand it, as F2P mobile games generally are: simple resource management, building rooms, and sending out Vault dwellers to scavenge or do quests. Most of [i]that[/i] is just waiting around for bars to fill up, unless you buy the microtransactions. There isn't any story or endpoint at all, which oddly enough means it has better story than Fallout 4, which is an RPG with 90% bad writing and a stupid plot where most of your problems are only solved by shooting at them.

There's a recurring problem of people's saves being deleted or corrupted, with no apparent way to get them back even if you spent money on them. Bethesda took an RPG franchise about the nature of post-apocalyptic society and turned it into a Skinner box that doesn't even work right. The art is pretty good though, so I'll give it that."

692,I HATE LEGENDARY CHARACTERS I HATE LEGENDARY CHARACTERS
693,Perfect game if you want a real time burner game to kill some time. Don't expect to grind it out but you can pay to play. But I think its better as a time burner
694,"This game is free and very fun, even more so if you are a Fallout fan. It is NOT pay to win, there is plenty of gameplay to be had without spending a dime. Have some patience, learn the mechanics, and once you unlock the quest content, there is no reason to ever pay to win."

Build your bunker/vault and maintain a  perfect balance between security and happiness.It's really cool, it's available n mobile andpretty much any computer can handle it. Also haven't encountered any bugs so far.
That's it, very cool."
724,Fun to play whilst multitasking.
725,"I played even more on old laucher. In general you will find this bit like Facebook browser game, but in Fallout word. As free game it is really great and you should really try it. You build your underground vault making neceserry resourses and send expeditions to surface. Vault can also face disasters or invasions to deal with. In the end you might end up with crowd of 200 dvellers all with crafted or found items and trainable stats. It is very important to begin properly or you will have to live with starting mistakes whole game time, but tutorial explains all. Graphics are simple but beutiful you do not need good PC. You need to raise your vault to 18 dvelllers before you can start quests making it far more interesting then."

FUN LITTLE Game.
Mobile game to pc port for sure.

Fun quick and Simple.
But way better with the unofficial PC Game fixes.

But the Fall out creators should have just done 
Fall out: Shelter 3D
Open World, with Build it yourself options.

OH Wait the real boss/ owner's of Microsoft owns Bethesda now
So I'm PRETTY SURE THE Corporations Operations OFFICER. 
(NOT currently public listed) Has ordered a FALLOUT Galaxy reboot.
Which includes reboot the fall out story and allowing players to go from into the vault (playable prologue)
build and rebuild vaults. then  back to fallout 76's kinda premise HAHA.


In case you didn't know Microsoft has been partaking in social ablelism and grand larceny for the past 10 years.
AND THEY ARE NOT A USA COMPANY ANYMORE.

767,"[h1]Ingame purchase not received and no help from either Steam or Bethesda - FRAUD[/h1]

I am no stranger to this game as I played it 6 or 7 years ago when it came out on mobile.  Where I really screwed up was assuming that Steam and/or Bethesda could complete their obligation of a $3.99 in game transaction.

After installing the game recently and playing it, I remembered how useful the Mr Handys were for maintaining my shelter.  I went to the store to buy a 5 pack of them for a very affordable $3.99.  I bumped up my Steam Wallet to make the purchase, the purchase went through... and I never got my Mr Handys.

No problem, file a ticket with Steam to let them know what happened, right?  Yeah, I did that, and in the reply to the ticket, Steam said there was no refund for items consumed ingame.  Great, except that I never received them and they do not exist in my game.  How were they consumed, exactly?  Problem is that you have no recourse in these circumstances as you cannot get an actual human to look at the facts and examine what items are present ingame.

Filing a ticket with Bethesda was fruitless too, as they advised me to request a refund from the retailer that I got the game from.  So, if the publisher of the game (Bethesda) cannot help me because I purchased the game item through a third party distributor (Steam), and the third party distributor refuses to help, why would I even bother with the third party distributor?  Why not just go directly to the publisher of the game?

That is what I suggest everybody do since it's apparent Steam will not assist in broken ingame transactions.  I've been a Steam user for years and have spent thousands of dollars on the platform.  Glad it only took a $4 transaction failure for me to learn to not trust them.  I hope they enjoy the $4 as that is the last dime Steam will see from me, ever again."
768,this game takes way to long to progress just a waste of time
769,"I've played Fallout Shelter for years on a tablet. I loved it there. (Although, I found the increasingly aggressive attempts to monetize it annoying.) Now, I've attempted to run a vault on the PC. (Full disclosure: I played in Survival Mode. In my opinion, it's the best version of the game.)

I HATED it. The ""current"" PC version is clearly an old buggy build that time forgot. It saddles you with an insanely steep learning curve that stonewalls you unless you pay. I guess when they couldn't monetize the PC  version of FS the same way as the mobile version they gave up on it.

Don't waste your time or bandwidth on this relic. If you think you'll like Fallout Shelter then download the mobile one and resist the ads option when speeding up your rooms. You'll be a lot happier."

785,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
786,More enjoyable than Fallout4.

824,"Probably not the best introduction for the franchise, but here goes.

The game is self-explanatory and easy enough to jump right into with little guidance, a little trying on your first run, but consider that as the initiation to the game, as the second run you should have almost everything laid out mentally for a successful run.

-	Not really an idle game, especially at the start of a new game, but you set yourself up for minimal work later.
-	Personnel leveling, again you get them to level 50 s fast as you can and when you have the facilities and equipment in place you ‚Äòreplace‚Äô them with better developed level 50 personnel.
-	Quests are recycled and get monotonous (for me personally)
-	Base building is limited and storage even worse the more advanced you get

It was a short-lived venture with this title, as even in the background for me became tedious, not to say others won‚Äôt enjoy it.

Recommended : ‚ÄòErk‚Äô yes
Replayability : Droning but there
Drawbacks : Limited in where it could have gone

-Universal Gamer"
825,"I freaking love this game. I have more fun with this game than I do with Fallout 76 these days. Tho I do have 200+ hours into 76.... And I STILL play it.... Lol
But the pc version is so much better. This is the first day since 2017 that Ive played this game, as Im typing this. I load up my vault and its like I never left.
On the phone, my vault would've been loooong gone and destroyed...."
826,"Great passive play, a long play type game for sure! Not fast paced and takes long term strategy for big gains. I've been playing off and on since its release, and not much has changed as far as updates. With it being a Bethesda title be sure to expect an in-game store ""Gotta love Tod's Micro-transactions!""

883,Time waster. Don't get it if you care about 100% games though cause you'll have to give Bethesda a ton of money for the legendary dweller achievement. Still better than Fallout 4 or 76 though.
884,"Neat Little game
"
885,"I mean, its ok"
886,"Pros: You build out your own Fallout Shelter and manage the dwellers, power, food, water, defense, etc. Basic game that anyone can play. Not overly complicated. Does provide something come back to and keep growing, but keep in mind this isn't a game you just sit and play for hours on end as there are timers. (See Cons)

Cons: Definitely has a pay feature to speed things up so you're not waiting sometime hours for completions on quests, skills, etc. The wait times on quest traveling and training can be rather long and have that mobile game feel to make you come back hours later. This is not a game you sit and just keep playing all day as eventually you will run out of things to do besides collecting items your base produces."

Yes. I would recommend this game despite the occasional mouse selection problems I have encountered when picking a human, robot, or special character (like Bottle and Cappy). There is also the rare mission bug that throws you out, but it's easy just to restart the game and to get back in the swing of things. Plus, some of the achievements will be unreachable for a long time unless I guess you dish out some cash to hopefully gather the legendary quest objects you need."

This only happens on the Steam version, not my mobile one.  I've watched other processes(found no anomalies), temperatures(not getting too hot), RAM usage(normal), moved its install location from my 2.5"" SSD that seems to have a bad cable(intermittent connectivity) to my NVMe SSD, & even went online temporarily to VERIFY the ****ing files!  WTF STEAM?!  Works fine if it's online, but most of my game-play is offline where I'd have to tether my phone & use limited(by price) mobile data just to keep it happy. That's ****ing pathetic!
PLEASE FIX!!!
Many Thanks for making this free to play ^_^ ... not so much for making the offline experience suck ****. -_-"

1005,"I forgot why I stopped playing this game on the bethesda launcher, but now that its come to steam and I have had a 60 hour refresher I can review it.

First its just your standard free-mium, whale-user hunting, base building game with a fallout skin on it. 
Second radscorpion attacks that you can't fight because they jump between rooms too fast and will drain your base's power so that you can't do a damned thing about it.
Third some of the room skills and clothes that help with them DO NOT aesthetically mesh.

This game has a random emergency event system that has fire, ghouls, animals or raiders attack your base, and most are fine and defensible.
Most come through the vault door, so posting a strong guard helps a lot, but some can happen in any room like fire, molerats, or radscorpion burrowing in and draining your power.
The molerats are fine as long as you don't ignore them and send settler there ASAP they will be contained and dealt with, but the radscorpions do not wait.
They burrow in and by the time that you can move a settler from an upper floor or even across you vault they will have already moved to another room.
Basically you are out of luck unless they burrow into an already populated room with good enough weapons to kill it and their absurd health pools.
I don't know how many times my vault became unplayable because of too many radscorpion attacks that either killed my residents, or made it so I couldn't feed, water, or heal them.
I seriously have an easier time fighting off and/or dealing with the aftermath of deathclaws that can near one shot my settlers invading my vault than these things.

As if that wasn't enough the armor stats and which outfits help you in what room is all weird.
You would think that a radiation suit would best help with a settler assigned to a nuclear reactor, but it doesn't. It only helps with water production and only battle armor and military clothes help with power generation.

Worst part is that bethesda has basically given up on this game in favor of whale hunting in china with Fallout Shelter: Online, so this game with stay the unforgiving sh*t show that it is."
1006,decent game

1019,"Julia might have had sex with the Dylan brothers, and got pregnant twice. Lost track of whom the father is. Sorry bud."
1020,"[h1]The more invested you get, the worse it becomes.[/h1]

The hit boxes on characters and rooms are AWFUL! I've often tried to click on a dweller to check on them, only to accidentally send them to a room on a different floor. The larger the vault became, and the more things I had to micromanage, the more annoying this got.

Also, there are ""tasks"" which you get rewarded for completing, such as ""put out so & so fires."" The problem is that the progress count sometimes resets on me. The only correlation I've noticed is when steam cloud isn't quite synced, which happens often. And some of these tasks can take a long time and depend on chance.

To make things more annoying, after my vault reached a certain size, the game would frequently have Deathclaws attack. It became much more frequent than attacks by Ghouls or Raiders. It had gotten so common, that I just felt annoyed each time.

Between the sheer amount of things to micromanage when your vault gets bigger, and the sloppy or otherwise buggy game mechanics listed above. I eventually got disgusted and uninstalled this game.

And no, I'm not gonna spend money on the Nuka Quantum. (read: freemium currency) They do nothing to mitigate any of the problems listed above anyway."

So far I haven't given it any but that doesn't mean the game can be called fun. It just means it's effective. Don't play free to play games. If they were good games they'd be able to charge ten bucks and call it a day. Maybe try Final Fantasy Tactics on your phone, or just Fallout 1 & 2 on steam? Those are good games."

1082,"Fallout Shelter is a fine game if you want something simple to play. It is mostly an idle game, so you don‚Äôt need to give the game your whole focus to play, but it has some sections where you need to pay a little more attention. The game also has a lot of pay to skip mechanics, where you can skip waiting long periods by using items you can purchase with premium cash (real money). You can also get the premium cash by playing the game, but that is rare.

If waiting is not something that bothers you, and you already like idle games then this could be for you."

1092,"it's fun, but getting caps in annoying."
1093,"This game is mostly fun but has some dramatic flaws which aggravate me. Power generation is this game's primary flaw. It seems to have some arbitrary scale between how many power generation stations you create, and how much power is needed to run the vault. As an example, say you build 8 of the most powerful power generation modules available in the game. Which should be MORE than enough to maintain the balance of power (so to speak). Well, your power bar remains at 50% no matter what you do. Then, you have a random radscorpion attack on say, a water module. Your dwellers successfully kill the scorpion, and all of a sudden, your power bar is down by 75%. I do not see how my many hours of power generation to maintain the status quo, is suddenly destroyed by an attack on a water module.
Next most painful flaw in this game is when you click on a toon to check it's status. Out of nowhere, the toon immediately runs to exit the module (room) it is in, attempting to escape to who knows where? I want to check all my toons in a room to ensure they have the best armor/weapon available to them ... but I have to chase the SOBs to the elevator, to catch them and place them back in their proper location.
I suppose my primary complaint is that I have to click on each and every module (power, water, food) in order to ""harvest"" that module's output. Like some fricking clickfest, every 30 seconds I have to sweep across the screen with dozens of mouse clicks to ensure the (power, water, food) is delivered. Fricking Farmville
I could go on, but I need another beer. Like so many games before it, this is a love/hate relationship. The flaws are major and annoying. The positives are diametrically enjoyable and fun.
As a completionist, when I finish this game, I will then never play it again."

1100,"Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play game in the Fallout series; the player to creates their own vault and acts as the overseer. It's a resource management game - you have to make sure there is food, power, and water for your vault dwellers.

Each vault dweller starts with a vault suit and their fists as weapons. These can be upgraded as you discover/manufacture better weapons and outfits. items can be found outside of the vault. Additionally, you can build rooms that allow you to manufacture items.

As the game progresses, you build more rooms in your vault to allow your residents to develop their attributes, and assign them jobs based on those attributes to make each room run efficiently.

You can also send up to 25 vault dwellers out into the world as explorers, to bring back money and items. And you are able to send parties of dwellers out to go on quests. The quests yield higher values of loot, and have fun little storys.

There are microtransactions within the game - you can buy bonuses that speed the game along, but they aren't really necessary. This is not a game you play all at once, it's a game you play for 10 minutes at a time and then come back later to collect on the outcomes of your decisions.

For example, you may choose to develop a vault dwellers strength attribute but putting them in a gym. That will take X amount of time in real time to achieve. The higher the attribute, the longer it takes to develop it. The same is true for manufacturing weapons and outfits, and your key resources (water, food, power).

Should you buy it? Yes, absolutely, it's free!

Is it fun? It is, but it's also an exercise in patience. The way I play it is I get up in the morning, put in my 10 minutes or so, and close it up until after dinner. A friend called it ""the game you play between other games.""

As of this review, this game has had over 100 million users over the various platforms it supports.

It's fun.
It's addictive.
It's amazing.
It's got so much to do. It's got a hard mode basically. It can be a challenge. It gives you freedom. There's no set way to play.

10/10

Game is old and imo underrated, it's actually really fun."

1115,"Well... No more than 30 minutes passed before my cosy shelter was attacked by a couple of raiders with rusty swords. And first of all they broke through the outer metal door. Yes, the exact door that presumably protected vault dwellers from nuclear apocalypse. At that moment I realized that this game only has ""Fallout"" word in its name and some details of Fallout style, but no real spirit or logic of the Fallout universe. Developers could give it any other name, but they didn't because they wanted to make money of it. And of course this game has cash shop where you can buy almost everything. Very disappointed."

1124,"So I was casually playing Fallout shelter when I hear my doorbell ring. I wasn't expecting any friends, so I looked out the window, and saw a man standing at my door, and I didn't recognize him. So, I went on over and answered the door.""Hello there"" I said nonchalantly. He responded with ""Hi, I was wondering if you had a few minutes to hear the word of God?"" So I said ""Unfortunately, no, not right now. I'm a bit busy, but if you give me your address, I can swing by later tonight and I can tell you about Atheism."" So he says back ""Well, sir, um... I don't want to give my personal information out to random people..."" So my response is ""What? Why? You don't want a random stranger knocking on your door in the middle of the day and trying to shove their religion down your throat? Kinda hypocritical, don't you think?"" He just looked completely befuddled as he turned away and started walking down the street, off to his next house. As he stormed out, a couple of the passerbys started to whistle and cheer, soon my neighbors joined in and even some drivers. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment."
1125,"Awesome

~Quandale Pringle"
1126,"This game is a really fun, phone type game. It's one that doesn't need much attention, and can just be running in the background whilst you watch something."
1127,"Pay wall, pay wall"
1128,"So I've played games like this before, like Tiny Tower and Doomsday Preppers on Android, and oh my lord did I play them... Being fairly new to Steam, I knew what to expect from this type of game more or less, but would like to catalogue what types of games I do enjoy on my cloud profile, hence now playing this game  after I've spent hundreds of hours on previous other games like this before of which there are no more records....

Anyways, this is Fallout themed and perhaps the most polished version of these type of games I've played or seen so far, to the scope of my knowledge. It is however a very popular type of genre that has been cloned before frequently.

That being said, I would advise people against going in on too much of these games other than enjoyment. I've started playing this mostly because, as with many of my gaming experiences, many of it has gone undocumented, so this is probably one of the last of these types of games I'll play unless something greatly more advanced or rewarding comes along.

Its a semi-idle clicker type of grinding game... You can have it open while watching a show on the other screen and it keeps one interacted and engaged in a relaxed manner off the side. However, I'm starting to develop an aversion to, above anything else in games, especially in free-to-play, I'm fighting the clock. 

I always imagine developers thinking that their player bases grind so hard for things they can add with a few command buttons but they are waiting for the spenders to purchase things on merit of enjoying the experience and looking to advance. So that brings me back to my point on enjoyment. In future when markets are more competitive in rewarding consumers first in blockchain platforms fighting the clock will see a re-emergence. We need a net-zero economy principle to drive these type of markets. Because eventually these games become a subverted clock watcher while you wait 20 hours for a quest to finish while you endlessly farm food, water and power as events script you to net-zero pre-meditated progression, which is a perfect metaphor for farming in real life.

Anyways... give this game a try, its pretty good for a time-waster, and its a bit more involved than some of the other similar games in the genre that I've played and experienced before."
1129,"simple to play and addictive as hell - but I liked it better on phones for its short and noncommittal gameplay

Having had a maxed out vault on my phone already, I cannot find a reason to play this game again with the inconveniences of booting up a PC and logging in to steam

recommended? Yes but only if it is your first playthrough"

1142,"Game is highly unstable, will crash suddenly and randomly and in the process delete your saves. Furthermore, any online purchases you may have made also get deleted. Steam support refuses to even broach the conversation when this happens, Bethesda support will, eventually, provide some in game rewards to make it right (which are just at risk of getting deleted next time the game crashes). Better off playing on console, much more stable and you can back up to the cloud to save your progress (steam cloud auto backs up the corrupted files on crash, making the could back up also useless_"

1184,"a bunch of roaches kept spawning in my base and killed everyone, I think my game was... bugged... :(

1185,Better than playing it on phone
1186,"A fun game that is free to play. Money helps speed up the game, but is not the only way to win. Like a farming game you grow and gather things for your characters. After you make the headquarters you go on quests. It moves slowly sometimes, but keeps being action packed in the end. It is dark because of the end of the world factor, but manages to keep that part funny and low key."
1187,"Instead of gushing about how this is the greatest idle game of all time, I'm gonna share with you some major tips and tricks that will definitely help you out when planning your vault.

[b]1.The population sweetspot for the early-game is 30 Vault Dwellers[/b]
- A vault population of 30 will unlock the four essential training rooms for raising the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats necessary for critical resource production (Strength for Power, Perception for Water, Agility for Food, and Intelligence for healing items), while also keeping your vault easy to manage and preventing the more difficult emergencies from spawning. This way you can focus on building up a core team of well-equipped, well-trained dwellers in preparation for the mid-late game and won't have to worry about being wiped out by Radscorpions or Deathclaws the first time they attack your base :3 

[b]2.Expanding or Upgrading a room increases the threat level of dangerous incidents that occur in that specific room. [/b]
-Expanding rooms increases the danger level linearly to match the higher worker capacity, meaning it's generally always safe to expand rooms as long as you have enough dwellers to fully staff them. 
UPGRADING rooms is where it gets tricky: upgrading a room DRASTICALLY increases the health and damage output of infestations that occur in rooms. 
- A radroach infestation that occurs in a level 1 room can be safely dealt with by workers wearing nothing but their jumpsuits and wielding their bare fists. 
- To deal with a level 2 infestation with the same level of efficiency, you'll want all of your workers to be wielding actual weapons like shotguns and rifles, which deal 6-7 times more damage than bare hands. 
- For fully upgraded level 3 rooms, you'll want your Dwellers to not only be wielding top-shelf weapons, but be a high level with decent S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats as will. 
-- This becomes especially noticeable when dealing with mid-late game threats like Radscorpion attacks. A Radscorpion that tunnels into a small level 1 room can be solo'd by a level 1 dweller with a sawed-off shotgun. If that same Radscorpion tunnels into a level 3 room, it can potentially wipe out a full team of level 20 dwellers armed to the teeth with laser rifles if you don't keep an eye on their health and radiation levels.
-Threats that can move between rooms (such as the aforementioned radscorpion) will scale up or down to match the level of the room they're currently in, so you don't have to worry about threats from high level rooms killing low-level dwellers in low-level rooms.

[b]2.Re-roll Vaults for better starting gear! [/b] 
- Lunchboxes can contain literally ANYTHING including Legendary-grade Dwellers and equipment, and you're guaranteed 3 Lunchboxes at the start of each game via some very easy-to-complete overseer objectives that you can finish in the first 5 minutes of gameplay (sucessfully rush one room, collect 50 water, and level up one Dweller). 
The game has save slots for 3 separate vaults, so if you pull something decent but think you can still roll better, you can still keep the first vault while rolling a second and third. 
- 7 out of 9 starts gave me starting equipment I was happy with, although I could just be really lucky (yes, I'm running 7 vaults at the same time - 4 on the Switch and 3 on Steam). Below are some examples of notable loot I've pulled.
Vault 502 (switch):  Two Rare Dwellers and a Rusty Laser Pistol (one of the best common-grade weapons)
Vault 619 (switch): One Rare Dweller and a Gauss Rifle (very good rare-quality weapon)
Vault 777 (steam): -Giddyup Buttercup and Military Circuit Board (Legendary junk, but useless during the early game except that they can be sold for 200 caps each)
Vault 420 (steam) - Bespoke Attire (+4 end rare outfit) and a Missile Launcher (extremely good legendary weapon)
Vault 619 (steam) - Bittercup (Legendary Dweller) 
Vault 777 (steam - rerolled): a Guided Missile Launcher (insanely good legendary weapon) and some Nuka Cola Quantum (used for speeding up travel time and training) 
Vault 000 (switch) - rare junk and 500 bottlecaps x3
Vault 422 (switch) - James (legendary dweller), Advanced Labcoat (+5 int rare outfit), Commander Fatigues (+7 str legendary outfit)
Vault 916 (switch) - Hardened Shotgun (decent rare weapon), Lincoln's Repeater (legendary weapon), Star Paladin Cross (legendary dweller)
- Personally I recommend re-rolling until you have at least one Rare Dweller and one Rare Weapon so you can immediately start going on wasteland expeditions right out of the gate, since that's how you'll be obtaining the vast majority of your equipment for the rest of your dwellers. 

[b]4. Don't waste caps upgrading your Vault Door![/b]
The Vault door slows down attacks that come from the surface (raiders, feral ghouls, and deathclaws, but NOT radroaches, molerats, or radscorpions), however it doesn't keep them out completely, nor does it weaken them in any way, and you'll always have to fight off the attack regardless in order to resume normal gameplay.
Surface invaders will always move through your vault linearly from top to bottom, engaging any vault dwellers they come across and skipping over unoccupied rooms. Stationing your strongest fighters on the first floor and your weaker dwellers on the lower levels is a good way to stay safe. 

[b]5: Managing Dweller Happiness[/b]
- Your entire vault receives a production bonus based on the overall happiness of the residents, and some of the random Overseer objectives you'll receive will ask you to max the happiness of a set number of dwellers. 
- Dwellers start with 50 happiness by default and gain happiness when assigned to the job that they're best suited for, up to a minimum of 75, and slowly increasing with work performance.
- Dwellers can lose happiness by failing at rush jobs, spending a long time at low health, or by suffering from radiation poisoning. 
- Making babies will immediately max-out the happiness of the couple to 100.

[b]6. Assign Dwellers to training rooms and expeditions before logging out![/b]
- Time will continue to pass even when the game is closed, and dwellers will continue to gain progress towards S.P.E.C.I.A.L. training, item crafting, exploration, and child development for as long as you're offline at the same rate as they would if you had the game open, only stopping when the task is complete. However, resource drain is limited to a fixed amount while offline (I think it's capped at 10 minutes worth of consumption) so you don't have to worry about your dwellers dying from starvation or dehydration while closed out. 
- This is the main reason why I can run seven vaults at the same time; this is a true idle game that allows you to make significant progress without having to leave the game open.
- Incidents and invasions will not occur while the game is closed, so your everyone inside the vault will be safe while you're away.

[b]7. In-game Purchases are not necessary to enjoy the game![/b]
-Turns out, everything that can be purchased for real $$ can be earned in-game for free - however, some like the Mr. Handy robots are exceptionally rare (I've only found ONE so far across all seven of my vaults, and it was as a random quest reward).
Mr. Handy's will automatically gather resources for you and will assist with vault incidents without requiring food and water like regular dwellers do. While definitely convenient, they aren't at all necessary to progress through the game, and my main Vault on the Switch gets by just fine without using any. 
- There is a $5 starter pack that contains a guaranteed Legendary Vault Dweller, legendary weapon, legendary pet, a load of caps and Nuka-Cola-Quantum, AND a Mr.Handy robot, which personally I think is a VERY solid deal if you don't want to re-roll vaults.
- I uh, wouldn't recommend gambling on regular Lunchbox purchases unless you're the kind of person who REALLY enjoys gambling, or loves the Bethesda and wants to support the devs with $$."
1188,yes
1189,"It's a good game. It's mostly an afk game but its just fun to me, the sound, music, etc."
1190,"I always wanted to be a Mole Person, this game allows me to be just that, a dirt eating, irradiated Mole MoFo FTW! I can kill weird shit, i can build shit, it has it all, and for FREEEEEEEEE REEEEEEEE!!!"
1191,yes
1192,Game files get corrupted all the time
1193,"Surprising for a free to play game with monetary transaction, this fallout inspired base builder survival game sets itself above the rest. It does this in a lot of minor ways, which enhances the overall game including such things as romances, finding new settlers in the wasteland, training your resident's skills, sending out your team for missions, invasion from wasteland creatures, romance, gear making and much more. Tapping on the huge lore and world building of fallout, the scenarios and missions are on the funny and humorous side, enough to make you appreciate the wit but not enough to dumb it down. In the end you will be spending a lot of time balancing your resources and managing your residents. While these plus points are among the attractive bit to keep you invested, it is still a freemium which you can pay to get exclusive and higher powered cards in the form of gear, resources and even people. However despite that, you can still not spend a cent and yet still enjoy the game for quite a while with the content packed into it and storyline. There are daily and weekly challenges that keeps the game going and fresh."
1194,"Every time I come back to this game, it always is enjoyable. It may be slow and may allow for micro-transactions but, honestly, I never have spent a dime while having gotten quite far in the game. The game is timeless, I would know I got it on my phone before I got it on pc and have had a fairly similar experience. It is different than much of the rest of the Fallout franchise but I still love it anyway!"

I dont recall if they ever figured out cloudsaving, its one thing I always disliked about the game if you had to reformat a drive or something you lose all that progress. Mouse controls can be rough on trying to check on characters' status without moving them. Too often I look at a character and the system sends that selected to another room for some strange reason."

1223,"This game is the single greatest thing to ever grace our plebeian existence. It moved me to tears, made me laugh out loud, question authority, and commit hate crimes. The art direction is masterful, the colors more vibrant than my LSD-induced visions. I met my wife playing this game (she was eaten later but I digress); I was playing this game on my Steam Deck one night at the local bar. She came up behind me and said, ""Is that Bethesda's hit MMORPG Fallout Shelter (2017)?"". I said, with a smirk, ""what else?"". We went in the back and she gave me a pity kiss on the forehead. Fast forward a year and we get married. I also got a promotion after my boss realized I played this game.
All in all, a masterpiece that everyone should revere and worship as the greatest game of all time."

1226,meh it's ok?
1227,"Well this is very nice time killer, plus if you are into Fallout like I am, this comes as G.E.C.K.O. :)

As usual what I am looking to get from Fallout franchise is dark humor, morally challenging situations and options for outcomes and even tho this type of game isn't best example of that this still hits all check boxes with me! LOVE IT!"
1228,even though its free i still feel like i got ripped off. DO NOT INSTALL. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. DELETE FOREVER.
1229,pretty good
1230,nah
1231,"lc waikiki reclama

1232,"great game but need more update
"
1233,Its very fun in the beninging but i got bored after a while.
1234,Just a game
1235,having more fun here then in the fallout1
1236,great game
1237,basic gameplay that anyone can enjoy as a time killer
1238,"This game has all the hallmarks of the softer side of Fallout. I like it because you don't have to play for hours in order to accomplish something - if you don't want to. It's fun to play for a little bit and then put it away and come back later. Sometimes, I feel like sitting and waiting for the resources to complete and that can be pretty cathartic."
1239,jui
1240,Gut Gam
1241,Very Fun for like a game to run in the background but not needing to keep open. Really gets interesting around objective room.
1242,very good gameüíÄüî•
1243,Awesome
1244,20 legendary dwellers achievement - Cannot be achieved under 163 hours of free game play (To be updated)
1245,For a free game its fine it is a fallout based  '' hotel manager game ''  in the beginning  it's a bit boring but later in the game it becomes more fun with all the quests
1246,vgg
1247,Really good and fun :3
1248,Really fun! I spent over 30 hours playing this in less than a week. It's really addicting. I love my vault and my vault dwellers so very much!
1249,"a simple game play but not without the need to think before you act .the only disadvantage is that you can not long term save what you played,if for some reason loose the game(damaged pc,new device) you start from scratch.But never the less,i have started it every single time again because it is fun :)

scratch the last comment,as long as you play throught steam at a PC you can play your game at multiple devises and at download it a new ,so one problem solved :)

i do not know if it is the same for android since you are downloading it from playstore 
"
1250,Whopper
1251,it is really fun
1252,
1253,Cool game I even tried Fallout 4 very good game!
1254,yea its it
1255,hgfhdfhg
1256,Fun escape from reality.  Simple yet rewarding base building mechanic.  Addition of quests and pets very welcome.  Well rounded game but requires patience unless you have money lying around to buy lunch boxes.

1258,Great idle game you can sink some hours into.
1259,"for a free game, this one is premier"
1260,"First impression - it is not that different from all the other underground bunker building post-apocalyptic games out there. This one just happens to be part of a well known series.

Decent gameplay with easy to understand mechanics, obvious pay to get loot sections (honestly playable without), stays with original fallout stories, and simple but quality graphics.

A simple game with simple interactions nothing special, but a cute casual play addition to the Fallout series."
1261,"you get to kill roaches
"
1262,i fw it i play it while i wait in valorant qs
1263,Fun little time killer.
1264,I can't believe they didn't screw this up
1265,good
1266,"Good, only downside is I had a vault with 22 people and lost it due to lack of reacorces sadly, but I also had a fire that lasted for a solid 3 minutes. Good game, 10/10"
1267,"Prolly better to just get it on your phone. Phone gives you tons of extra rewards with ad- watching. Every 4 hrs you can watch an ad and get either free caps, nukas, lunchbox or pet carrier. can watch ad when you tap stranger to get 2k caps instead of 200. Can speed up wastelander time, guarantee rushes. All of that is missing from steam version. I understand the no ad thing but it offers nothing as compensation for losing out on all those free rewards/bonuses.. By comparison ive been playing both the last few days. I have over 70 nukas on phone and i have been using them. I have 8 on steam version. and have been trying to NOT use them. 2k caps vs 12k caps. 1 pet vs 3 pets, 1 legendary dweller vs 3 legendary dwellers. But all that aside I still play both versions."
1268,it's fun
1269,its a good game to relax with if you're out and bout
1270,.
1271,"Because it is free to play I bought the starter pack to support the game as I think they did a good job with nice visuals and good game play, this game needs a bit of attention at the beginning, but once you are further along it is pretty much a check on it when you feel like it game, you gather resources over time allowing you to expand your base and also levelling up is time based so there is no pressure. Only complaint is when you try to grab a character to move them to another room to deal with a threat and it thinks you want to move the camera around, a bit frustrating, but its my only issue with the game."
1272,"Games good if you""re a fallout player"
1273,GOOOOOOOOD!
1274,"Fun game, when you hit level 300 your God in it"
1275,"reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"
1276,very good
1277,Great game but got so far and now will not boot up. I have lunch boxes but after you get 200 players that is all the lunch boxes give you is more players that hang out side of your vault. Can not seem to get Nuke a cola so have to wait hours to go from one mission to the next.
1278,Cappy Thicc. Life good.
1279,Plants vs Zombies 2.0
1280,"It's pretty fun. A bit challenging getting everything organized the way you want it. No BS to deal with. Jst a good, fun game."
1281,addicting if you know how to play it
1282,is gud
1283,"Its okay
"
1284,It has many hours of fun especially if you are new to fallout and just want to see what its all about.
1285,"no, thanks"
1286,"this game exists only to get your money . it's a mobile game on pc , the gameplay is timers , it's not fun .  You send you dwellers on a quest , guess how long to get to the quest ? 19 hours . don't play"
1287,fun
1288,fun
1289,"Overall the game is pretty good. The only issue is that if the game so much as crashes, your vault is gone. Unrecoverable. Wiped of the face of the Earth."
1290,Good
1291,"This game is fun... On mobile.
I suggest that you keep to playing this game on mobile, I spent hours and hours recently and got all the achievements in this game on xbox. It hurt my soul."
1292,fuck radscorpions tho
1293,It's fun and passes the time. Although it seems to be harder every time I create a new vault.
1294,its fun but hard
1295,the only good fallout game
1296,"It's a simple game to pass time. Yeah, your dwellers can get attacked, but once you get a good set up, it's just a casually play. 
Also, used to play this on the phone and Xbox before, so it was nice getting it on my computer again."
1297,its is fun
1298,"Playing without paying anything is fun and steady.... 
Until the game crashes every time you try to load your save that is. I started again and the same thing happened after several hours. There are tools that lets you give yourself everything you lost and more, but it's not perfect. It feels wrong when it's too different from the original vault I had, so I quit playing.

Imagine paying for the loot boxes and loosing everything..... I'm glad I never did that. 

It was fun while it lasted"
1299,very fun
1300,Pip man
1301,"Funny time killer
edit 1: Game is still fun in year 2022"
1302,"gud

- vault boy"
1303,"the mobile game but on pc, its basically a port"
1304,i like this game
1305,"It's Fallout Shelter! Has that classic Fallout style and casual idle management gameplay with some point and click quests. It's fun to login every now and then, set my people up then go play something else knowing my little vault is busy being busy. 

I enjoy it, have has some crashes though which is weird. 
But it is fun!"
1306,"I hated this game with the passion of a Shakespeare damsel... hated it.  Turns out my actions were at fault.  But, if you stay with it and play through the difficulty it's a pretty fun game."
1307,this game got me too addicted. best AFK game ever :D
1308,BORING GAME BUT GOOD
1309,Good
1310,Great Strategy game
1311,This was an ok game i guess but even for a free game this is slow. this would be better on mobile devices but its not on them. you cant even close the game and leave because everyone will probablly have died or something like that.
1312,thjs game changed MY LIFE!!! i was on the way HOME from WORK when i got text on my CELLULAR tele tell me to instal and play game. nother message come on PHONe say go Back to house and i find i can play on my personal computr TOO!!(also my pregnant wif died:(.
1313,Good game. Fun and addicting. I would definitely recommend it.
1314,"HUH??????????

1316,FUN
1317,its fun
1318,pls add better Mountain
1319,gg
1320,I only play using mods because I basically just want to get the achievements and play easily lol
1321,got really boring real quick

1328,"yes
"
1329,"Spent money on several in game items. Only to have Radscorpions trash the entire place 
and make a mockery of all progress.
That is how they treat paying customers, I can only imagine what others go through.
Garbage game. Waste of cash for a quick click."
1330,epik
1331,i left a guy outside for a week and when he came back he had enough weapons to supply the USSR 10/10

1343,"good game but you need to focus on what you do
"
1344,"smeg smeg smeg
"
1345,It's actually a great sim civ like game. Progress is pretty quick... also a decent background game. :) semi auto
1346,"Announced during E3 2018, it seemed to be only a ""sparring partner"" to the long-awaited Fallout 76 but over time it is proving to be a real highlight of the Bethesda library.
The main rule is: build only according to the inhabitants and not vice versa.
The game is to all intents and purposes a management challenge in which energy, water production and food management require constant monitoring to ensure that the level of happiness among the inhabitants remains high, constant threats such as fires, invasions of cockroaches and mole rats, incursions of raiders regularly undermine such happiness. The main feature are the ""sprints"" that is forced accelerations of production in a given plant. If the vault-boy shows the thumbs up, the sprint has been successful with increases in happiness and production but if the outcome is negative then the aforementioned dangers take over. The inhabitants suffer damage from radiation and generics, treatable with stimpaks and radaways if present in the warehouse, if they are not there they can also die but at the price of a handful of caps the inhabitant can be brought back to life. The external missions are the interesting part of the game, they activate after the construction of the overseer's room but it is better to get a good amount of Nuka-Cola Quantum."
1347,vault go burr
1348,"Fun Game, lots to keep in mind. challenging to keep everyone happy, and busy working."
1349,YES
1350,wow
1351,"you can send people crazy and bully them to death 
100/10"
1352,Wonderful game. Good builder and resource management but a bit micro manage. Like the graphics and the play story of finding useful items in the wasteland so to speak. Like 2 games in one. easy to learn and follow.
1353,Mobile game on PC. I love it!
1354,total pay to win
1355,there's a point where you're overwhelmed with things to do but it's handy for the task-master gamer
1356,Honestly better than 4.
1357,if I ever kill myself this will be at the top of the letter
1358,Classic game I always come back to every few years. It's a perfect cute little handheld fallout
1359,FUCK BETHESDA
1360,"Absoulutely love the thing when you get a vault dweller to the wasteland, its so exiting!



the Game is pretty good, but its kinda grindy?, i guess
anyways good game."
1361,It's cute and fun..oh and it was FREE.....i just wish they had more rooms and places
1362,Never disappointed. except Mystery Tone could use some work.
1363,It is a great game.
1364,It is a very good game if your ok with sitting there and not doing much for a while
1365,very good game for passing the time when your board
1366,avg Idle game
1367,"good and free
"
1368,Tbh this game sucks
1369,Great time killer
1370,very inspirational
1371,
1372,Best Fallout game Bethesda made
1373,Spent hours upon hours in my vault just to lose it for no reason
1374,"I only play this to throw people into the outside armorless and gunless to see how long they can survive. 50 minutes max ive gotten, all these people are pussys"
1375,Good Game
1376,good game challenging
1377,good
1378,I'd rather spend real money on this than buy crypto.
1379,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
1380,Had fun
1381,"A surprisingly good game, it's great how you build your vault with little men, the missions are great and I like how you always have to find new weapons and costumes."
1382,"So it's fun, but it's just a port from mobile so it has a lot of a just waiting around for stuff to happen"
1383,dead game
1384,"It's a good game, played it many times on my phone. The only problem is time, I hate waiting for things to happen. But still I love this game 10/10"
1385,I'm pretty sure I forced fathers and daughters into sex and my idea was to keep it in the family.
1386,Simple and fun
1387,I like clicking boxes very satisfying
1388,ptw bruh
1389,It's surprisingly good.
1390,Fun game i pass time playing this while I clean my house also I play the mobile version too.
1391,"If you like resource based strategy games, this is a good one. Bonus points for Fallout universe."
1392,"Kind of slow at times, Takes awhile to really get anywhere in the game. Fun nonetheless!"
1393,Game way too hard
1394,"Been playing Fallout Shelter for a few years now, long before I saw it here on Steam and I have enjoyed playing it - though I must admit that I have not been able to make it very far in the progression of things but it hasn't stopped me from playing it and trying to do better every time I restart playing it. 

Id recommend this to any one who likes a challenge in managing assets and personal - because it is something that you have to do other wise you easly run out of things and trying to balance it out I've yet to be able to accomplished."

1402,good
1403,love it
1404,good soup
1405,"Look at me, I AM THE OVERSEER NOW. Surprisingly addicting and a nice game to sit back and relax with after a long day of raging at competitive games. Also great for lovers of the Fallout series as there is good amount of callbacks to the actual games."
1406,Good game.
1407,hehe survivor is now preggers
1408,Money trap
1409,Nice free to play game!
1410,"Some of the reviews for this game don't seem to realize that this was a throwaway teaser for mobile devices that came out with the announcement of Fallout 4. Subsequently it had the unfortunate effect of really selling Bethesda on the power of microtransactions, but hey, that's on the public, and not Bethesda (for once). 

You could play this for free while you waited for your oil change, almost completely oblivious to the fact that spending money on it was an option. As far as I know you can still play the game, such as it is, for free, and in no time at all, you will have spent more time than it took them to develop it. The fact that modern generations will bankrupt themselves on ""fidget spinner"" games is not Bethesdas fault (for once)."
1411,it's a really great game to play when you're playing it on the side while waiting on something in a different game.

1415,"playh it
"
1416,Dope
1417,.
1418,"good
"
1419,if you like fallout and like being lazy asf this is for you. you get to send your dwellers on quests you can finally see and you get to force your dwellers to reproduce which you can't see unfortunately. a couple of talking objects named bottle and cappy are these home invaders from the original game that every now and then invade your vault just to do their lil dancey dance and leave which is an amazing feature. it can be quite fun staring at your screen for hours a day clicking the collect button on each facility so your dwellers don't die. however one time i left my game on and went on a walk and met up with mates which resulted in me coming back to a vault of dead dwellers. i would recommend this game if you are idek but i like it. it is one of those games where you send your dwellers to do stuff and come back like a day later for loot. its FUN AS FREAK!
1420,"I like it, and it's challenging. Fun. :)"
1421,Great game... if it was working. Literally every attempt of playing ends either in CTD or Steam Cloud Error
1422,Everyone is dead. The vault is on fire. Rats are eating the corpses of the fallen. Anything valuable has been stole- Oh look! My dweller came back from his trip with his dog and brought back ten rubber ducks and a cool hat!!!!
1423,GREAT!!!!!!GAME!!!!!
1424,Just do it you'll love it1
1425,"i love this game, but micro-transactions are evil"
1426,"Great game to pass the time with, would recommend to anyone."
1427,Kill
1428,"Well, they've definitely got the addictive psychology down."
1429,"Its a fun game, Not as good as FO New Vegas though"
1430,Because it so god
1431,"Was good fun until i hit 60 settlers then I was getting attacked by radscorpions and radbugs every 10 minutes in seemed so i couldn't keep up with power production. Turned from good fun to all pain once i hit settler #60. Stopped playing it at that point,"
1432,Pay 2 Win
1433,Veary Good Game i realy like it
1434,Too grindy
1435,"This game is simple and available on any device. Certainly don't come in expecting a full blown Fallout sized journey. However, for an idle game, it's quite fun. It's got a number of unique mechanics and themes dedicated to the Fallout games like wasteland exploration, the mysterious stranger, SPECIAL stats, and much more. You might not be constantly doing something, as again, it's an idle game, but even if only for 5-10 minutes a day, I'd say it's a well made game that feels rewarding and fun to progress through. I recommend checking it out if you haven't already."
1436,yes
1437,collect bottle caps

1439,I made a steam account not long ago and have already logged far too many hours playing Fallout Shelter. Mindless and sorta addictive game.
1440,"Fallout Shelter is an iOS and Android game that was ported to the pc based off of the Fallout franchise. The game has you managing resources such as power, food, and water as well as sending dwellers out to the wastes to collect supplies such as weapons, armor, junk, and bottle caps. The junk that you gather can be used to craft gear that you will occasionally find blueprints for and the caps allow you to expand your vault and revive dwellers if needed. You will eventually be able to send dwellers out to complete quests that payout with bigger rewards such as Nuka-Cola quantums and lunchboxes, this games form of ""loot boxes"".

The game itself is a fun time waster and doesn't require you to spend any money on it if you don't want to, however if your a completionist expect this game to bog down your completion score for quite awhile. In order to 100% I had to resort to some ""unconventional methods"", I would guess it would take no less than a couple of real world years and a small fortune to do so otherwise.

I would say the worst part of the game is the shameless use of loot boxes and the achievements that encourage you to buy them.

The game nails that Vault-Boy aesthetic and lets you collect some familiar characters and gear from Fallout 3 & 4. I would say that once you reach late game it losses it's appeal with no real end game, I would compare it to staring at an ant farm if the ants where wearing X-01 power armor. For the all time low price of free, it's worth checking out if your a fan of the franchise."
1441,"Fun, play it."
1442,Love this game
1443,"great game,i hope there will be more fallout free to play games like fallout strip club-i mean good game!"
1444,"I remember the day this was launched. Epic day. 

Between all of my phones, my iPad, and my PC... This is easily my most played game. 

I wish we could get a Fallout Shelter 2."
1445,"Another one of those games where you need to put a lot of time into it as time goes on. While that in itself is not a problem if you are into that kind of think, I do have a problem with the game greedily pushing micro-transactions in your face. Also I was unable to AFK before the game would ""pause"" making it so I had to pay attention all the time."
1446,It's not really that fun honestly. Sure I can return to this sometime soon to collect achievements and to be honest that's the reason why I installed it but I can't see myself playing this regularly. If this is your kind of game then go ahead and play it but it's just not my cup of tea.
1447,A pretty fun game. A solid singleplayer experience. You can even leave it running and do other stuff and then go back to it if you are luck to have that kind of attention.
1448,noice
1449,"Could feel repetitive sometime, but good and fun game! I've been playing this on my phone before and have reached around 111 dwellers, and now I try it on PC. Too bad I still couldn't find a way to open/move my saved game/vault into PC. But it's not really a problem to starting a new vault though.

Edit : I've found a way to export my save file from my phone to PC!"
1450,Da
1451,Ho-ho-ho...........Yes
1452,"good for a free game
"
1453,I've played this game a great deal more on mobile and can safely say this game is quite enjoyable. I would personally recommend the mobile version over PC because I believe it fits that role much better. A very solid game to tote around while at work for whenever you need a moments respite.
1454,I got a PC just to play this
1455,Try it out
1456,"easy to idle and receive trophies. also an easy way to kill a few hours
"
1457,Good time-waster. Slow at first but picks up as you gain dwellers.
1458,Snazzy game. Definitely a good one.
1459,Great Time Killer
1460,"Put two women in the kitchen and got an acheivement for ""putting two settlers in the right place"". 10/10"
1461,.
1462,"Had sex, got her pregnant, then ran away to wasteland to get some nuka cola, and never to be seen again. 

"
1463,Good time killer
1464,"Had a good vault, had some great dwellers lots of pets lots of Mr handy's went on it today everything is gone, quizzed my daughter was not her looked on discussions turns out it happens randomly great stuff thanks for that."
1465,"Amazing and Fun!
"
1466,Good game I like it cause of the franchise and how you can personalise your vault to your liking. Does get grindy later on so prepare to spent some time grinding those caps
1467,"If you're familiar with the mobile version, you've got nothing to worry about with this version, they are identical. I absolutely love Fallout Shelter and even thought there are elements that require hours of waiting and can feel bizarre playing on PC, it became something I enjoyed hopping on every day kind of like Animal Crossing New Horizons or Clash of Clans but fits well on PC even with the simplistic gameplay/control elements. I highly recommend Fallout Shelter if you played it on mobile or if you enjoy Fallout, it is absolutely worth playing and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
1468,Awesome game
1469,Nice time waste in the FO universe
1470,Thumbs Up
1471,"good
"
1472,It is a very fun game its not pushy about buying packs it gives you free packs for playing the game which is nice. I have put over 100 hours in so far and I play it every day I am loving this game highly highly recommend!
1473,"Ran out of Food and Power. 10/10, Lore accurate to Fallout as a whole.

Don't take that seriously.

Game is fun, its a good time waster on steam, or on mobile."
1474,capatalism
1475,good
1476,so good
1477,"For a Bethesda title and a mobile game this is pretty good. I don't feel the need to sell a kidney to keep playing the game. I just pop in every few hours, collect some stuff, make some progress, maybe do a quest, and I've simply never hit a paywall.

This may seem silly because I only have around 6 hours on Steam but I've sunk a lot more time into the mobile version and yeah, it just keeps a steady pace. Not fast but never stagnant."

1480,"it is very difficult to make a working shelter, but that is what makes it a good game"
1481,"I remember spending several hours on this game every day when I was younger and had only a cheap tablet to pass my time. Back then I must admit I cheated a lot by changing my in game date and time. However when I discovered that it was on steam, for free, I decided to start again and not cheat (I'm unsure if it works) and had a blast! It's surprisingly fun and still lives up to my nostalgic memories"
1482,I
1483,It's annoying how you have to check in everyday or else it's almost impossible to get your vault stable again. Other than that... It's pretty alright!

1492,"If it was just a mobile game, it would be great. It was designed for mobile and it's visible everywhere, starting with mechanics, ending on controls. Here it is annoying and frustrating and I cannot recommend it."
1493,"This game is SO addicting. You are the ""leader"" of a vault and have to train your dwellers to do jobs to help the vault stay alive. Dwellers can have children, fight, work and have funny things to say. If your a kid and don't like scary things, the monsters can be creepy, so maybe 10+. I recommend this game to everyone. Its hard to keep your vault alive which is a downside."

1521,.
1522,The amount of time you wait for things to happen is so long... it's a good game if you need something to do while bored. You can place your characters in a room to work and then close the game and come back in 30 mins and maybe they will be leveled up. Just wish there was a little more to it. 5/10.
1523,"The best game, if you would like to build bunker."
1524,yes
1525,"It's a serviceable mobile game ported to PC. Now, while I have a ridiculous amount of hours in this game, I tend toward repetitive behavior so bear that in mind.
Honestly, this is kinda just ""Waiting: THE GAME"". It has lovely visuals, definitely has the Fallout vibe going for it, but ultimately the bulk of your productive time in this game is you being AFK. It's a mobile game gambit of letting you pay real money for rewards you'd have to spend tens of hours to earn through gameplay, or otherwise waiting days while items get crafted. Dwellers can leave the vault and explore the wasteland to collect randomly generated gear and loot. But the longer they are out there, the longer it takes them to get back. To get some of the best drops, they have to be out there for literal days, then  take yet more days to return. 
The most fun I had with this  game was honestly when I modded in the ability to skip the waiting on almost everything. But when you take that away you realize there's only a shell of an experience here. The combat system is frustratingly slow, and your only active role is healing your dwellers as they DPS. 
It's decent at very best as a short experience, but I honestly can't recommend this game to anyone."

1538,Just over 24 hours in. Will update when I am able to craft the Cola. Spent the $20 on the 40 lunchbox deal and the $5 on the Boost pack. This will be all I spend and $25 for a game is not a bad deal. So far good loot and easy enough to make caps for upgrades.
1539,Once you realize you can change the time on your computer things get a little dicey
1540,so fun but there is a bad bug which is after u play the game for a while without leaving the game it becomes laggy
1541,This game is a lot of fun. It can be really challenging and and makes you have to think. It is easy to fall into this game and play it for a long time.
1542,It's Fun!
1543,free so i thumbs up
1544,Fun game
1545,This game sucks but I like it. You should not get it; it's objectively a waste of money and poorly made and my enjoyment of it should not take away from that.
1546,love it

If this was a $20 full game to buy that would have been great. Instead, it is a free game designed to sell you random worthless junk that masquerades as useful items. This is a classic example of creating problems to sell solutions.

Not to mention the UI isn't very smooth either. You can't even auto un/equip your dwellers, which means a disturbing amount of clicking to give guns each time you rush different rooms and get attacked by raiders. 
You know what's the worst? When you want to rush a room and then arm your dwellers if the rush fails. If they are injured you need to use a stim-pack first... I mean, come on. The whole game is designed to waste your time in a parasitic predatory manner, making you feel the pressure to spend real money to speed this tedious experience up. 
I had SO MUCH FUN playing quests. Only to do a few and then be stone walled from doing more. Real life hours to travel to the quest, log out, login, do the quest, real life hours to travel home, log out, login later, collect items. What a chore. No real game does this. This is not a game. This is a time wasting machine that wants to sell you time saving items.

I wanted to play this game and every time I get on I get to do things for 30 seconds-5 minutes and then that's about it. 
Play any further and you'll be punished by the game. 
It is a very frustrating trickling water style experience, which greatly encourages spending real money to make things go faster. This, of course, is a trash way to play a game. 
I feel sorry for the addicts this game reeled in that spent thousands on cola. Truly depressing when you think about it.

What the absolute f*%k is Bethesda doing to such an awesome franchise? Between this, TES Blades, ESO (Doesn't even have Oceania servers LOL) and FO76 the whole lot may aswell be dead. They do not care about your deeply invested interest in the Fallout or TES universes, they only care about sucking money from your wallets. It is utterly depressing because if they gave us actual games people would spend so much more and not be disillusioned about Bethesda's crap marketing.

Fallout Shelter is not a game."
1554,"Though it is a free Fallout- series game,  yet the experience is bad, especially when population reached 10-20. When you got 10+  Dwellers,  The new dwellers  will stop coming for a long time. Slow-pace gaming gives you a false appearance in extending your Valut. The worst result is dropping your Valut happiness if you extend too much rooms but no extending your populations. What's more the game needs more patience and wise strategies. Maybe I will recommend this game If the game can pace up its game pacing, but it didn't, and maybe it fits the players who has a lots of free times and patience, but not me :)"
1555,Best game ever
1556,"Sweet FREE game, it's kinda similar to old school tycoon games like fish tycoon but more involved. Only negative is that the game does freeze up frequently as you build your settlement, but what can you expect, all the games these guys make are known to crash frequently,"
1557,its good for a free game.
1558,ANOTHER RAIDER ATTACK GODAMNIT
1559,I made one guy have sex with every woman in my shelter
1560,Lol gave it a try in 2022 lmao doesn't hold up that well. Combats awful. Leveling up characters doesn't do anything. My base got demolished by a single mole rat . LOL so done with this game.
1561,very nice
1562,"Honestly, a huge time killer and coming back to it after all these years, its a blast. I hope for some more content but I don't see that happening anytime soon. Regardless, a fun game."
1563,Yep
1564,Why yes no
1565,"Keep in mind this game has been ABANDONED by Bethesda. It came out in March of 2017 and there was a single update in May 2017. That's it. No support. This game was created to bleed whatever micro transactions they could get out of it. 

Now, with that said, the game isn't terrible. In fact, it's kind of cute. Especially since it's free. If your strong enough to not get caught up in the micro transactions and just play the game for free, that is. :)  I literally play it on my laptop while watching tv. it's that basic. 

Did I mention it's free?

So just have fun with what it is, have no expectations and you'll enjoy it!"
1566,"A fun time killer game based off, obviously, the fallout universe. Be the Overseer and build an ever exapanding vault. Keep your dwellers alive, fend off enemies and scavenge for resources. Go on quests and find new dwellers to join you. It's fun but can get boring quick.. Originally a Mobile game, the port is pretty good. There are micro-transactions, but really not needed."

1596,"I was immanently frustrated by the micro-transactions facing way the mechanics work, I quit and uninstalled when I realized the primary way you augment an NPC's stats is artificially constrained as to what NPCs you can use what augmentations on. There's no in game reason and it adds nothing, it was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. It is a good game for what it is, a base-builder so casual you can let it run in the background, but whatever you do don't spend any money in game, it's not worth that."

1682,I can't recommend this game because it has a bug that spawns devil claws faster and faster until your vault is wiped out.  Usually 4 respawns will take out enough of my 60- 80 ppl that my vault fails.  This is very disappointing I have had this happen 3 times now and find it very frustrating.  Save yourself the frustration of 100+ hours only to die horribly by a respawn bug intent on wiping you out.  It is otherwise a fun if a bit cheese little game to pass time on a rainy day.

1706,"So I wake up in the middle of the night in my 2 bedroom apartment. I find me roommate passed out face down on the wooden floor. I think nothing of it and go back to sleep. The next morning I wake up to go to work and there is a homeless guy asleep on my couch. My roommate woke up still drunk and had made friends with a bum. And this is the second time he let a stranger off the street just stroll in and pass out. Great.
You are probably thinking what does this have to do with my arts and crafting.
Well I bought this product and proceeded to cover everything my roommate owns in glitter. Every T shirt, every book, ever pair of shoes, his bed... I covered his entire life in glitter. He will have glitter in every crevice of his existence until he dies.
Did some track out all over my apartment? yes. Does the carpet look like a care bear farted all over it? Yes. Did he threaten to kill me? Sure. But will he ever let another stranger sleep on the couch? No Will I ever have to worry about a random guy off the street murdering me in the night? No

1713,"I played this game on the computer years ago and enjoyed it. I like taking care of the vault and growing the environment. I have been able to really improve and grow my vault this time. The Steam version runs smoothly and is easy to operate. If you enjoy apocalyptic themed games and constructing environments, this could be the game for you."
1714,"Please fix the rad scorpions, they are ridiculously overpowered."
1715,this is not only just another cheep pay to win mobile game. but also i take issue in the resource management in that this game never pauses so if your screwed when you close the game your even more screwed by the time you open it back up. over all i love fallout but this is disgraceful.

1721,the best
1722,ITS IN THE GAME
1723,ok
1724,"First off, I'd like to simply say, yes this game is fun.

I will start at the most basic level. This is meant to be a pay to win game. You buy loot boxes, and pet boxes, Mr. Handy boxes, and you can buy a starter box. But don't kid yourself. The only box with anything in it worth buying is a Starter box for $5, and you can only buy 1 of them (in their store). Also the game's mechanics make it bonkers with how faster, and much difficulty scaling is. It's just at some point you feel like at end game, even with the best gear (named legendaries like Dragon's Maw, or the named Gatling Lazer, etc) mixed with either the +4 to 4 attribute items or simply X1 VI Power Armor you're basically just bringing Stimpacks/Radaway sitting there just literally watching the game use terrible AI for you to kill enemies with insane amounts of Health. I'm not even kidding, I've played level 50 missions before running them solo, and in groups of 3, it feels very much the same, only solo takes a little longer, and you expand less healing items. But you still sit there killing Alpha Deathclaws for like 3-5 minutes regardless.

So here is the biggest issue I have: You're exploring, and let's say you're lucky enough to get a pet that spawns the Mysterious Stranger 2-7.5 times faster. You see him more often, and get jackpots, and start building. But, here's the kicker, you finally get your workshop going and you can only make basic items, or you have to wait several hours or days to make a legendary (in theory early on) so while you're waiting, you get radroach attacks, radscroption attacks, one of my least favorite vault door attacks, feral ghouls, and then you're in shock, because you had pushed to far too fast by mistake or ignorance, and a group of Deathclaws rip through the vault doors, and kill everyone. Because let's say you have your best people in the wasteland doing runs, and you can't call them back in time, or you made your best female characters pregnant. Also let's say you had no idea about those periodic Deathclaw attacks. So that's just usually 3 of them, and you go through like 10 attacks. (If you're playing for a few hours a day during a Legendary item crafting process) Most new people can't survive one attack, let alone like 10+. So your game is dead, you wasted money on the store, and got nothing. Of course all Bethesda says is ""Thanks for the money.""

There are methods to make the game easier in game, such as doing story missions, and using the various SPECIAL buffing things like the Academy, and so on. You have to sit there for about 50 hours per attribute x 7 per character to fully max out a character. Having max Strength is usually always important unless you get a Rusty Weapon, or something with a high low end damage (like 14-15, etc) If you have Rusty Weapons, Strength becomes meaningless, so invest in Rusty Plasma Rifles mid game, they have a flat 17, which allows any character to just deal that damage regardless of Strength. Strength also does not increase damage over the limit of 17. So plan out how you want each character designed. 

I would have to say the most useless, and important attribute is Luck. But Luck is so random, and situational that it almost appears to do nothing. But end game, I've pulled 3 legendary items in a single room, where the mission only said 1. They were also too random to be part of the mission, and I have done said mission multiple times, and never duplicated it. I have had 4 end game files. I can honestly say two big things: Attributes can go beyond 10 (from item bonuses), but I think that may simply be for stuff like the Reactors, Restaurants, etc. I haven't seen much in the way of improved damage during missions from items beyond a 10 natural Strength.

Also important to note the weapon you choose to use. The highest end damage tends to be, and this is simply my opinion: Bad. I mean, yeah, you can get Fatmans, and Rocket Launchers, or Plasma Throwers, or even melee, probably the most two common melee weapons are the Baseball Bat, and the Pickaxe. But be warned: 1) Area damage seems incredibly nerfed, it can be split up many ways, and it feels like enemies take less and less damage from it. 2) Melee weapons are incredibly restricted, and your dweller using it, can end up doing nothing during combat if two other dwellers decide to engage in the monsters face with firearms. Why? Who knows. Why it's a good idea to use a Sniper Rifle, Laser Rifle, or Plasma Rifle point blank I will never know. But it blocks all melee dwellers usually from attacking at all, and they reposition far away doing nothing, except standing there. All throughout this time you could be fighting Deathclaws in the vault that hit the entire room, or Rad-Ghouls, Scorpions, etc that constantly cause radiation damage. So that melee dweller can actually die from not being able to engage and attack - That's bad AI.

In closing, I feel like this game's combat mechanic system is so poorly made, it was designed for a top down game that became a 2D side scroller. You can see the way the dwellers constantly move to different angles, or go around obstacles that would normally be easily ignored in 2D. This is one of the biggest issues with this type of combat mechanic. A Dweller may try their best to attack an enemy, and instead of remaining in position to help quickly kill an enemy, they reposition, and sometimes in an extremely bad way. They can literally let enemies get an entire round of attacks off, because they chose to reposition, which to the viewer seems literally meaningless, because it's a 2D game. But the game treats the environment as 3D top down, so it makes moves and actions that seem strange sometimes. - Well, I hope you enjoy this pay-to-win - high difficulty paced scaling game. Because if you play the way it seems designed, you'll be spending a lot of money getting set up, unless you find ways around this."
1725,"Great idle game, entertaining, but stressful üòâ"
1726,"Fun for 2 hours to pick up now and then. If you're ever bored , i'd recommend playing this game. Fun but only for short amounts of time."
1727,I'm addicted
1728,"Mole Rats wiped out my entire vault after 2 weeks of good play. WTF Bethesda?! Aside from that learning experience, I restarted a new vault and did not upgrade any room past the initial build level. The mole rats are manageable now, I will upgrade the rooms once my dwellers are armed to the teeth. It's a good game."
1729,"I mostly played this on my phone, but its worth reviewing here. Good game if you need something to do between flights or work trips. Simple and easy to pick up and put down.

1755,"This is definitely one of the more fun little survival game. For someone that maybe hasn't played a lot of the Fallout series it is still enjoyable to go along the story line with. However... I think this might be a little more fun if you play the actual Fallout games. Simply because it has certain references and even the little game show that asks you questions that previous game knowledge would cause it to make more sense. Either way - this is definitely a time consuming little game that can keep you on your toes. 

Achievement hunters: This game can be a bit of a grind - not going to sugar coat it. However, if you are down for the challenge it is very rewarding. This game can definitely sink a lot of time - for any ""completionists"" out there there is 1 achievement that will give you heart burn and that is the collection of 20 legendary dwellers. You can gain a couple from quests, sheer luck from a new dweller at the vault either radio station or found in the wasteland... not great chances. All I will say is you get a free lunch box every 7 days - do with that information as you will. Oh - Raider attacks, the count will only accumulate on a single vault, personally I did a survival vault and had a 20 dweller population (anything over starts other events other than raiders). Good luck!"

1763,this game is pretty good

1765,i was bored then i became more bored after this game
1766,nice
1767,dammit i need another power plant
1768,"[h1] Fallout i mean its ok [/h1]
Game is good for people who likes simple, VERY simple managing games. However, in terms of combat and the mechanics it's outright shit due to how stupid the ai system and how they over-extent or just don't follow at all. Overall, the game is generally good and enjoyable, for me at least."
1769,cool
1770,"Very simple and pretty fun. Occasionally frustrating in some parts, and I argue that we could've had a better combat system, but besides all that, it's just a decent casual experience. Not to mention, I haven't encountered a single bug, and everything that you can purchase in-game with real money can be earned just by playing the game."
1771,its good
1772,This game is really addicting.
1773,lost two vaults due to game crashing and i am not starting again what a load of crap all purchases gone just a money eater

1775,"greatest game ever!!! super cute guys and from an actual fllout player this is awsome!
"
1776,This game is not perfect but certainly worth playing!
1777,very good
1778,Addicting and fun. I enjoy the retro art style and simplistic game play. It makes me want to know even more about the lore behind the Fallout series.
1779,"I pressed the nuke button in the menu and the game closed and doesn't work anymore, but it was fun while it lasted."

1804,epic game
1805,"Simple, fun, and addictive! Micro-transactions are only needed if you are a person that doesn't like to wait."
1806,Building a sustainable community while attempting to keep the rest of the world out and exploring to find the supplies you can't build. One of my favorite types of games! You (and your vault dwellers) are depending on your managerial/decision making skills.
1807,nice game
1808,Its actually fun.
1809,"you start a new game, you play for 20 hrs in one world, you loose all the mats (water, elec and food), everyone dies, you start a new game..."
1810,great game to kill some time...
1811,"This game is simple, fun, yet addictive; You get roped in with the basic mechanics at the start of the game, but there is a point where it starts to feel a little like you need to grind- and that's where Mods come in. Modding the game is fun, but there's really not that much to mod, so I haven't touched them much on this account. There's a great amount of fun that you could find in this, and is simply a Terarria-esque New Vegas in my personal opinion.
"
1812,"fun little time waster with story, love, scandal, intrigue, romance, adventure, WAITING and characters youll grow to know, love or be speculative of, immersive yourself in this forefront of its own genre of shelter based rpgs."
1813,"if you know a tiny bit of how to play the game, you cant actually have fun and progress quickly. just dont do what i did, and purge your vault with a rad plague."
1814,pretty decent and simple
1815,"Perfect game to have on in the background as a windowed format. Really like the new quests they added, as it has kept me from deleting the game. (i.e. didn't have it long when it first came out for smartphones) Far different from the typical RPG Fallout experience, but the theme is on point, and inspires reminiscing the Fallout games. Got me back into playing Fallout 4. Also going to replay NV."
1816,I like reproducing :)
1817,nic gam
1818,"No one playthrough is the same, sometimes its a breeze, sometimes you get attacked by raiders when you have 10 dwellers with no weapons, struggling to get basic resources. Best strat honestly is send 1-2 dwellers in the wasteland, just to get some weapons and outfits going. Once you start rolling, you can only go forwards. After a while of playing, the gameplay does turn in about 5 minutes of getting resources, assigning dwellers to their tasks, sending them to missions. Then you wait a few hours and repeat. Eitherway, the progress is liniar, makes sense. I can keep on ranting about this awesome game, but I think you should spend your time elsewhere, not reading my honest opinion about this game. Peace. :')"

1827,"Only good thing are quests.
Mr. handy are necessary for maintaining health of dwellers while offline.
After having many dwellers harder enemies start to attack your vault , you can sometimes dodge this by leaving without saving."
1828,"All round fun game, always something to do. Anytime you're bored you can start this game up and casually play for a little."

1860,"The game has it ups and downs

The down side being too far long to finish, its a good game to come to like 5m a day and never pick it up again."
1861,"Let‚Äôs be honest - things generally don‚Äôt go very smoothly for the humans living within the Fallout universe's underground vaults. Bethesda‚Äôs Fallout Shelter for iPhone and iPad gives us the opportunity to try our hand at doing better, to (hopefully) provide a better life for the citizens of the post-apocalypse. Balancing the need to produce food, water, and power - all while fending off radroaches, raiders, and other dangers is a good challenge‚Ä¶ at first. But oddly, once you succeed the fun fades away because of the lack of a planned-out endgame.


What could possibly go wrong when putting us in charge of a vault? In Fallout Shelter‚Äôs earliest (and most fun) moments, it turns out the answer is pretty much everything. The core gameplay loop is easy to understand - as new citizens are born or recruited into your vault, you must dig into a mountain to construct Living Quarters for them to sleep, as well as Water Treatment Plants and Cafeterias to produce their food and water, and Power Plants to keep all these factories operating.

Things build instantly, but you do have to wait to earn enough Caps to pay for construction - and Fallout Shelter commendably doesn't try to make us to pay to speed things up. In fact, you can't.

Citizens, who are drawn in the signature Fallout Vault Boy art style, are assigned to work in specific factories via simple drag controls, and they earn resources more rapidly if you correctly match a citizen‚Äôs stats to the factory in which they work. It‚Äôs satisfying to get everyone working in the perfect job and see your vault begin humming along. The catch is that for the first few days you never feel like you have enough people or enough resources to man every station you need manned, and that shortage creates the interesting decisions of Fallout Shelter. Do you want your shelter to have clean drinking water, or enough food to eat? Can you scrimp and save for another housing room?

It‚Äôs a fun game of trade-offs. Every time it feels like you might be getting ahead, a random raider attack, fire, or radroach invasion has the potential to knock your perfectly planned equilibrium out of whack. It kept me on my toes and kept me coming back, and so did the constant obscure references to Fallout Lore and amusing (albeit sparse) writing. The cheesy lines couples say to one another before obediently heading off-camera to make a baby are a particular highlight.


Unfortunately, the bigger your vault grows, the more this thoughtful balancing act fades away. Fallout Shelter gets easier the bigger your vault is - not harder. It feels backwards. My 150+ population vault has more than 25 people with no job at all, just wandering the floors. I no longer need to optimize my factories, because I have an excess of all resources. My citizens want for nothing, and I have no more buildings to unlock or goals to work towards. I can expand my vault deeper and build a sixth Power Plant or third food-producing Garden, but that would just give me an even bigger resource surplus. Have I won? Is this it?

Fallout Shelter is desperately in need of a set of endgame goals or resource sinks to look forward to and build towards, or else players will see all the game has to show us in around a week of steady play."
1862,hours of fun
1863,Played this in mobile way back early 2000s. Great time killer.
1864,good game 10/-10
1865,great gale if you are into base building games
1866,this is my favorite game on steam
1867,"Not bad for a free game. Building my own vault was pretty fun, wish you could have more settlers and more room to build."
1868,"This game is FORTNITE!! this is the short version of what i have to say. 

The Good things about the game:
-Good characters and world drawings. 

The Bad Things about the game:
-It take F 8 IRL hours to deliver a baby.Like WTF WHO THOUGHT THIS IS A F GOOD IDEA.

-Auto-Zoom(It makes you wanna Auto-Zoom the one who thought it's a good idea to have it and not be able to turn it off.

-you can't pick up the loot while the team is fighting and if they are standing over the loot you can't get it,unless of course you decide to move them to another room and bring them back.

-when you try to select/move a charcter and there is elec to collect or he has to lvl up you can't move him and if you try to drag him by force the camer moves insted.

-Random Fires 

-You can't build multible buildings at a time you have to build it ONE BY ONE.
----------------------------------------------
I've never raged in a game even if it's very hard but this FORTNITE VERSION OF ""This War Of Mine""is FORTNITE and i'm insulting Fortnite by combaring it to this game."

1878,in all its a fun game its just the felling of dont let them die they rely on u
1879,money begger like them all
1880,"Very fun game! Awesome for content creators as it is a nice cartoon styled game for kids and anyone.

The mechanics of the game are incredible! If I were to add one thing it would be multiplayer to verse other people and raid their vaults! Install this game now! IT'S FREE AND FUN!"
1881,fun
1882,I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS AMAZING
1883,efff uuu steam
1884,"good game

7/10"
1885,"I clicked on a button to destroy my vualt, it takes me to a website, my portctor automatically moves the files of the game somewhere where i cant find them, and now i can tplay the game at all! Soo... yea good game of the year 10/10"
1886,"Great time killer. Not much depth to it though, and its been a longgggggg time since the last time they updated it so it is what it is. But its free so I can't complain, sure there are micro transactions available but you don't need them at all to enjoy the game in small doses."
1887,"yes
"
1888,It's like Skyrim but with shelters.
1889,i can play the game while watching youtube & chill...
1890,Fallout shelter is a very fun game where you can imagine what its like to work for vault tec and make a vault. you can imagine your the designer for vault tec and making a safe places for people after the war. this game is great and so is all the fallout games.
1891,grape
1892,Even better free
1893,"I like it. Its a great time passer and effort was put into this. However, it isn't a masterpiece and it can be a bit boring at times. Wish it had immense replay value."
1894,sgfwsrhwsrtyqr
1895,"this game is so phattt, its juicy as"
1896,.
1897,"Fallout. I love the series, love this game even...
but...as so many others have noted, this game is riddled with issues that cause either players to have ""failing"" vaults, or create an inability to actually 100% this game. I have put in 48 hours and essentially ""beat"" the game. I have a successful vault with no issues on resources and a increasingly powerful amount of dwellers who roam the wasteland and complete missions with ease...yet...I have only ever received 1 legendary dweller.
I also apparently have only been attacked by raiders around 20 times.
This creates a really annoying problem that Bethesda does not seem to care about. I continually get death claw attacks and fight them off with ease...so what am I supposed to do? Leave my vault/game on for endless hours just to finish that annoying RNG spawn of raiders? The legendary dwellers just did it in for me. As I have played the game for almost 50 hours and complete numerous, numerous missions, opening loads of chests, I have received 1 legendary dweller. This leads me to believe that even if I DID spend hundreds of hours, micro managing every little mission to excellence, I could still inevitably end up never completing that achievement. This means it is a money grabbing achievement...and thus is just blatantly distasteful."
1898,its kinda meh
1899,Really cool sandbox game.Its so chill and relaxing to play in the night at Friday.

1907,"When there's nothing left to do in the game except get 18/20 of the legendary dwellers that seem no where to be found... its time to write a review. 

This game would totally have my recommendation if I could get to 100% without playing for YEARS longer just to get the last achievement. Psshhh... free game, cool... but that was such a let down at the end. WHY would anyone want to grind out that last achievement?! Ugghhh... I didn't want to give up 6 months ago but I still haven't made any progress on it.

Surprisingly, they do update the game with holiday-themed missions and costumes for dwellers. It is still very anti-climactic once you have the last achievement. (Maybe even the second to last achievement you'll inevitably have left to complete; clearing 100 objectives. Sounds easy, right? Sure... at about 100 hours of gameplay, you will be about halfway there.)

I do not recommend the end disappointment to anyone. If the last achievements were more reasonable, I would have all my Steam friends on it. If you could visit your friends vault and give them some kind of daily boost or help, that would be cool. I know its a free game but I honestly don't find that to be a valid excuse compared to my other free Steam games."

1914,"If you don't want to spend real money, the progress is EXTREMELLY slow and you can lose everything pretty quickly.

I've waited for DAYS to max out LUCK  in 6 of my dwellers. 
(It took almost A WEEK to max out only ONE  S.P.E.C.I.A.L. in 6 dwellers) 

Then a Deathclaw raid killed half the population IN SECONDS and I don't have enough CAPS to revive all of them.

1919,"A getting a good start and daily game play, this leads to a casual never ending vault. NO CASH NEEDED.... but if you want a JUMP on the game, sure buy some stuff..... but you don't need to. If you are struggling with events/raids, try keeping your vault population low/lower, and work with smaller groups, learn the progression before increasing your population."
1920,"Great game, gets pretty challenging further you get."
1921,10/10 would recommend this game if you like the Fallout Franchise and just great games in general.
1922,"Good game, but for me when I was starting out (As of writing this I still am.) it seemed as if I have to buy a lunchbox or the starter-pack to get weapons to be able to explore because I didn't have anything else to do, good game if bored but if you don't get lucky with a gun in the first 2 lunchboxes you get your going to probably need to buy lunchboxes or the starter-pack."
1923,"Good game play, enjoyable, not too difficult to get started"
1924,Eh. It was worth what I paid for it.
1925,Is good
1926,Great game.
1927,I HATE CHILDREN
1928,Saved data won't import. 44h dead. Tried to make a new game; they force the tutorial and make you build a sub optimal shelter.
1929,It's so good that ads are making knock-offs.
1930,It's cool
1931,Idk why but I really am enjoying this game
1932,it crashed to many times i lost a lot of time playing this game and a lot of money
1933,"Really addicting, simple, free game that doesn't take much of a PC to run. I have it on my phone too. It got me to redownload Fallout 4. Here we go again xD"
1934,cheese
1935,good but didnt allow me to commit war crimes
1936,

1938,hiding from the fucking liberals
1939,gg just pop in do a few things and leave. come back when the earliest task finishes rinse and repeat
1940,"good 
"
1941,"One of those time waster games. not much to the gameplay. Also there are really annoying help tips in the game that will sometimes pull you away from what you are doing causing you to lose out on the man in the trench coat who gives you free stuff. 

The animations and interactions couldn't possibly be any worse. often times raiders will run right by your fully armed guys just because the game decided it's time for them to change a room. then good luck getting your characters to go where the raiders go. 

there is ZERO point to upgrading your vault door it makes no difference AT ALL...basically it's a broken feature of the game they don't care enough to fix. Which seems like it could be a good description for MOST of the game. 

Was this game made during a 24 hour game jam!?!?!? It's UTTER trash.

EDIT: the more you play the more pissed off you will be that you continued to play. I wanted to unlock the nuka-cola plant thinking that maybe it would allow you to make nuka-cola...given that's the FREAKING NAME OF THE ROOM!!!! But that would cut into their scam income...so no it's just another resource room that by the time you unlock it you will not need. 

Really drives home how shallow this game loop is. it's basically click on everything. wait for something to happen click on everything. occasionally send your dwellers on ""quests"" which basically amount to waiting extortionate amounts of time for them to arrive, clicking on rooms and hoping you brought enough stim packs with you to finish.   

Don't EVER send a dweller out into the wasteland and log off...they will be dead when you log back in the next day, no matter what you gave them to take with them. 

What a PATHETIC cash grab this game is. Couldn't even be bothered to develop a basic RPG turn based battle system, or give some sort of tangible goals besides click on things and do quests that basically a drooling idiot could complete. 

I wish I could give it more than 1 thumbs down. what a waste of time..."
1942,"very fun and strategic, it takes time to get good but either way, once you start to get good then stuff really happens, more wasteland trips, up to 3 to 4 i would recoomend, quests and alot of fun"
1943,"Game is addictive and its fun, you can easily play and watch yt or netflix in the background. 9/10"
1944,"An idle game except more complicated, and by extention, far more fun.
also the dialogue is reeeeally funny sometimes"
1945,Nice game
1946,"Fun and relaxing game, finisih it once before as all 200 in power armor, but still fun stuff"
1947,shelt

I've played it on Android, and the overall experience was nice!"
1959,simple and fun... would be a great minigame for long load times in the bigger universe of fallout. why isnt there a movie? Survival horror barely enough supplies and then bingo... a lockpick and tools enough to construct a kit worthy of a long life in the worst bowels of hell itself?...

2002,"It's a good game, but very much built for mobile. In this case, that means a lot of the conveniences and design language of desktop games aren't incorporated, (blocky, touch-oriented menus, limited organizational ability, etc.) and the play style is in many ways designed to continually draw you back and keep your attention in a way desktop games don't. The gameplay is... insecure, almost. As though if you leave and don't have a pressing reason to return, you won't come back- and thus, rather than adding depth and nuance to the mechanics or devising a compelling narrative reason to see the game through-it has daily quests, and incident timers, and...

It's okay. Decent, or alright, even. 

For a desktop game, though- competing against games that do more than the mobile-oriented gameplay of acting as a time sink through repetitive and grindy surface-level mechanics- it's outcompeted. Once I round out the last (5, at time of writing) few achievements I've yet to get, I fully expect to uninstall the game shortly thereafter and never play it again. 

For what it is, it's decent enough. If you like that, you'll like it. If you don't, this game is not going to change your mind, just because it happens to have the aesthetic of a fallout game."
2003,A fun and simple game.
2004,It's good. i guess

2027,"This game feels like a ploy to force players to make purchases. You either have to wait a really long time for something (getting any kind of resources, building things, playing the game in general), or make purchases through their game to speed things up. Attack events are enraging because your citizens don't defend, or once they try to attack, the enemies just up and leave so you can never defeat any opponent. You also can't leave your browser open in the background killing time while you do other things because it just pauses the game. From someone who plays civilization management and base building games, this could've been a great game, but falls short through design. I would caution anyone interested in playing this game to be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting, or just be okay spending money for every little thing."
2028,"Great game honestly, good for passing time or playing a fallout like game if you cant buy or run the others."
2029,super fun

2050,Yes
2051,"It‚Äôs a fun game of trade-offs. Every time it feels like you might be getting ahead, a random raider attack, fire, or rad roach invasion has the potential to knock your perfectly planned equilibrium out of whack. It kept me on my toes and kept me coming back, and so did the constant obscure references to Fallout Lore and amusing writing. The cheesy lines couples say to one another before obediently heading off-camera to make a baby are a particular highlight."
2052,gg
2053,its a free game

It is very tricky late game but its easy surpass it"
2055,i play it in class a lot when i'm bored
2056,i like it
2057,"Fallout Shelter is a shallow AFK game with a goofy and light Fallout sprinkle, no story.

""I have done nothing but collect resources and modify dwellers for 3 days!"" Seriously the amount of managing dwellers and collecting resources gets tedious. 

The Missions, accessed by the Overseer Command Centre, aren't the most thrilling either. Exploration consists of setting up a party of 1-3 dwellers with your best weapon/armour, waiting real time hours for travel, then dragging them from one room to another, clicking to heal and collect loot. The crit system is cool

The ""Fallout"" aspect itself is weak too. There is no story in any missions, examples being ""help BoS"" [Bethesda sucks BoS d***] or ""find grate ingredients with cheesy puns"" 

Overall, once you've felt like you've experienced everything, you'll find nothing's worth replaying, and the secret is the micro-transactions to speed up your progress and make it less of a slog (I assume) 

[Go and buy isometric Fallout games you crap computer owner]"

2068,"This is a light strategy game that rewards players who can plan ahead and build some redundancy in both offensive and defensive capabilities, while building sustaining resources -- food, water, electricity.  It is fun and relatively easy to play."
2069,It's a fun casual way to get your Fallout fix.
2070,"A slow game that you can check in on once a day to keep up. Does not have content to play for longer time in one go, but a solid 15min can be used pr sitting."
2071,funn
2072,"Eat or be eaten, any good survival works.  More fun than I was expecting!"
2073,Great

2075,yes
2076,Great !
2077,nice
2078,"Nice little free-to-play game but if you're going for 100% completion, don't do what I did and progress too much too fast. The ""stop 50 raider attacks"" achievement becomes very hard to obtain otherwise."

2095,the game is great but when i got the overseers office it forced me to do a quest without packing anything and it killed my best dweller and lost me almost 500 caps and 10 nuka colas
2096,The Fallout series never gets old.

2104,"This game is something I dedicate my time to due to how well it keeps me captivated no matter how long I have to wait, although recently whenever I try to run the program, my Avast Anti-Virus flags the .exe program as something that‚Äôll fish my information; is this happening to anyone else?"
2105,Yah
2106,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of 24
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and 19 more
One and 19 more

Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
20 men had tried to take him, 20 men had made a slip
21 would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was 20 past 11 when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip"

2116,"This game is simple but addicting game it 
is a good game to play every now and then."
2117,"Got 31 hours in on Steam.  Been playing this since it came out for android.  Cool little game whatever the platform you're playing on.  Hard to believe, still, that Bethesda made this and essentially gave it away as a bonus to the fan base.  That is Bethesda though..   Nothing to buy, though I admit that I bought lunchboxes once just to throw something back to the studio as the work deserves it.  Enjoy earning your game addict perc ;)"
2118,Bro...this game gave me no life... i love this game too much now. Would reccomend playing it.
2119,its good
2120,soo cool
2121,I think that this is a good game in my opinion because the other fallout games a mature this is only teen there are many things that you can do in the game.
2122,the game really fun and i hope they release Fallout Shelter online on pc i hope they release it.
2123, Funner than funn
2124,"This game is great! I highly recommend it as a fun game to play. The late game content isn't the best, as after a while you can't build further. Also the maximum amount of dwellers is 200, which I dislike because I want a giant vault. 

My solution to these issues (if any devs are reading) is to add a drill. A drill would cost a lot of caps and be worked on by several fully SPECIAL dwellers. It would dig deep but take a long time to work. With the drill new rooms could be added.

Also for the dweller issue. I believe if you expand further you should be able to get more dwellers, possibly up to 500 or even a thousand. I love the dweller aspect of the game, leveling them up, and making family trees. 

If these issues were fixed then this game would be excellent. I love this game so much and if they added some more features it would be even greater."
2125,"The very short reward loop keeps you interested, while the ability to manage all you need to in short order also respects your time. A very enjoyable builder with the best parts of Fallout style and humor."
2126,Absolutely love this game!

2128,"Fucking fun af, mate. G,g,g,g,g-unit.....dotcom"
2129,The least buggiest Fallout in the series
2130,does get a little boring after a while but over all. it does alright
2131,This is a great game to pass the time.  Very simple and easy.  I always come back to it when I don't know what else to play.
2132,gud
2133,It's a fun little time waster if you're bored.
2134,"Fallout Shelter is your typical, freemium, time sink based idle game. That is to say, you make a few decisions then wait in real time for resources to collect and tasks to finish and then make some more decisions, and the process can be sped up with real world dollars. 

I remember being told this was a fun little time waster and that is more or less true. It is uncomplicated and made a bit more fun by things occasionally going wrong. But in this day and age there is a million idle games out there and I don't see myself recommending this one over any of the others. There is no real gimmick (except its set in the fallout universe) and maybe looks a bit better than your average idle game, but at the end of the day it is so bog standard. There is nothing really here to either make you think, or wow you, or feel anything other than that little dopamine hit you get from the numbers going up.

More over, I think the timing of things in the game makes it actively worse than many other idle games out there. Playing this game there is a bit to do early on, but then it peters out to a collection or decision roughly every few minutes with nothing to do in between. In my opinion idle games either have to have significant breaks in between clusters of decisions, so you can log out and do something else and maybe come back in a few hours or a day, OR little decisions actively flow in every few seconds so you having something to do. Fallout shelter tries to take the middle road, letting you collect things and make decisions every few minutes. What exactly am I supposed to do for those 2 minutes? Its not long enough to leave and not short enough to just sit there.

But, as is always the case with these sorts of games, that is the point. It keeps you hooked but also bored so you spend money. You want to leave, but to make any real progress you need to sit there and either find something else to do, or just be bored. 

Bottomline, there is nothing special about this grindfest of a game and I cannot recommend it. There are more interesting games out there, even for free."
2135,Buggy as hell
2136,While you can spend some time on this game it's quite evidently pay to win with the various in game purchases . Many of the aspects are spend real world money to bypass timers
2137,"fun, good and addicting"

I absolutely love killing an hour or two every few days on this game"

Sound design is fantastic, and easter eggs and humorous bits are fun. However, I can't recommend playing this game with a trackpad on a laptop. Mouse precision is required since some inputs are occasionally wonky due to this being a port of a mobile game."

2190,My game randomly got deleted dont waste time with this
2191,"Paying for stuff is optional but effectively required for long term vaults, in my opinion it's just a little too hard, buggy and over all pretty boring... don't get me wrong, it's pretty alright but it's quite frankly: just not for me."
2192,I am giving a bad review to  get luck
2193,"got sub-10 happiness, tried again, ran out of water, everyone died, tried AGAIN, raiders killed everyone. this game sucks."
2194,im a fallout fan so you do the math
2195,"This game is an online game, which still runs when you are not playing it. I was able to play it off line some, but every time it would get laggy and  just stop working after like 5-10 minutes. You cannot pause the game and events will happen if you are afk doing something else. If you do not mind this aspect, just be sure to not leave anyone out in the wastes when you quit, because you will return to find them dead. You will want to get them at least enroute and returning before you exit. Even though this game is free to play, I do not like games that are online only and for sure do not like games that still run while I am not actually playing them.

I have played this game some more and am changing my review. If you play this game you need to realize it is a game that you play for about 1 hour or less at a time. Then you save & exit. You will not return to the game for however long you want, but it will be at least 3+ hours later usually. Some pointers that are not laid our very plainly. 

Pregnancies take about 3 hours to happen. Children mature after about 3 hours. DO NOT EXIT THE GAME WITH PEOPLE GOING OUT EXPLORING, OR TO A QUEST. You can exit after you set them to return to the vault. If you exit while they are on the way our, they will be dead when you log back in. If they are set to return before you exit, they will be at the vault when you log back in."
2196,It's to much time consuming then you're limited on stuff you can and can't
2197,Very adicting
2198,"ah yes, my dwellers love making children, and i do to, with ur mum"
2199,"All in all a fun and challenging co-op game. While the game could be played without cards, the card selection allows players to tweak builds and create different skill sets to accomplish goals: Grenade deck, Melee build, DPS build, Medic deck, and Speed build to name a few of the more common skillsets.

Recruit mode is easy, a casual player can bust through this. Veteran offers challenges to a new player, but a seasoned player should breeze though it. Nightmare setting is the first major hurdle. It has gone through several iterations and is currently playable and challenging if the player does not use an exploit. With exploits--all levels are easymode.  Though Nightmare setting was unplayable through the middle quarter of 2021, the devs patched it into a workable game (as of Jan 2022). With a good team that understands their roles, communicates with each other, and is generous with what the game provides--you'll have a challenge (some failures) but also some epic wins.

There are glitches.
There are cheats.
There are exploits. And if you play that way, fine by me. Play your own game, have your own best experience whatever that may be.

My only real complaint (besides the Stalker family being really OP) is that the DLC is releasing so close to the release of the game. It's as if by design the devs were already working on the DLC at the same time as the core game--in which case it should have been included in the core game. It is a bad industry standard to set, kinda feels like designers are just squeezing players for any $$$ they can as fast as they can."

2269,"Some indie game company stole the idea from the well known Company: Bethesda Game Studios, they had an underground game called Fallout Shelter 76...

And made a Hustle Castle clone out of it.

How can they even sleep after such a crime?!

10/10 would play again

"
2270,its good and nukes are fun yes
2271,It just works.
2272,"This game is a symbiosis of simulation and strategy where you literally ¬´dig¬ª your way underground for a better life. 

That's why it reminded me of ¬´Diggles: The Myth of Fenris¬ª videogame, where you also build your life underground with the gnomes.

We are given the role of overseer of the shelter and equip it. The main resource is the dwellers. Each has its own unique skills, which can be developed in the game. Dwellers can work, learn, go on quests and have families.

The only thing that might irritate, that this game is sessional. Collect resources, complete quest, came out and repeat. The reason for this is the time to do the job. Craft weapon or a costume can take more than a day, depending on the skills of the dwellers.

Also, the quests themselves can seem tedious because the firefights with the enemies are in turn and can last quite a long time.

Conclusion:
The game is good. I liked the cartoonish gameplay design, which is based on the image of a ¬´Vault Boy¬ª. It looks very organic. I recommend it to all fans of the Fallout universe."
2273,"If you like the waiting game, this game is for you. Most of the time, that's all there is to do. Wait for resources to be available, wait for kids to grow up, wait for dwellers to reach their quest destination. Ugh."

2302,The mental game they use in this should be illegal. They push you away once you have been on for awhile to make it more addictive. They are acting like drug dealers to kids. Sad part is that it is a nice game but I cant condone the use of such evil tactics. Before you play learn about this game.

2313,"sick as a dog. cant focus for more then a few moments at a time. the pace of this game makes it pretty easy to keep up with so I am not so bored I want to scream but to tired to scream.

I do however recommend that you get all three of your vault slots going and rotate through them. once you get over 18 dwellers that will cut down the downtime by a ton. its very forgiving and getting the premium currency is pretty common and easy especially after you unlock the overseers office.

it has its flaws and rng can kick your ass. and if you over commit and put in to many rooms than you got dwellers to keep up on or two few rooms and not enough caps because you upgraded to many rooms to early it takes some time to recover from that blunder. but thats a good thing there needs some risk management xD game has a lot of depth if you start chasing steam achievments.

the dwellers commentary is A+ if you zoom in enough to see it lol"
2314,yes.
2315,"I love this game as a casual game. You can have things going while you're away without worry of everything catching on fire. I like playing this game while I'm studying because it doesn't need constant interaction, just occasional clicking, save a few times where the whole bunker catches on fire or gets infested with radroaches. Would recommend!"
2316,"Cool simple no-sweat little game to play mid/long term. Not overly-complicated community sim, funny mood with all characters being the pip boys/girls from Fallout franchise; Open it 5/10 minutes once or twice a day to see the community growing or just a bit more if you're sending out dwellers doing quests.

For what it's worth, i'm recommending it."

2332,Very entertaining game but is pretty luck based.

2344,good
2345,"Great game, but I think it could be a bit easier with pregnant settlers, if they add a nursery room for pregnant settlers to make the pregnancy progression faster after they have become pregnant in the residence room, instead of being forced to wait a while for the settlers pregnancy to finally end. Including I think they could have added an optional chapel room for settlers to get married before pregnancy to give it a bit more realism. 

Also, they sorta messed up on the size of how large the vault can be. Since on the left and in middle you can add a room of three merged, but on the right side you can only add two merged."
2346,its simply fun
2347,24/7
2348,yes
2349,vault
2350,yes
2351,.
2352,"honestly i have made like 5 vaults and it is challenging
but you just have to keep trying and maintain the vault"
2353,"If i want to waste time and have nothing else to do, then the fallout shelter on my phone always comes in handy. Let's be honest, it isn't a bad little game it offers a lot of replayability and challenge."

2363,It's a fun game managing a Fallout vault.
2364,good
2365,"Vale lembrar que o jogo tem aquela mec√¢nica padr√£o de jogos de celular, tempo para receber recursos, porem, esse tempo eh bem OK e n√£o deixa o jogador impaciente. J√° no caso das miss√µes, existem aquelas com tempo de espera menor e outras maiores dependendo do n√≠vel e da dificuldade de cada uma, podendo ser usadas moedas para acelerar esse tempo de miss√£o. Existe sim a op√ß√£o de compra de moedas, porem, n√£o h√° necessidade visto que existem miss√µes que recompensam o jogador com tais moedas. 
     Em resumo, eh um jogo muito bom de administra√ß√£o de recursos no universo Fallout, divertido, muito viciante, mec√¢nica f√°cil e bem explicada com um gr√°fico ador√°vel . √ìtimo para passar o tempo !"

Not saying theres anything wrong with that.."
2368,good game recommended for mobile
2369,"A funny game with what the npc's say and a cool game where you run your vault you start by choosing the vault number and it gets better from there and even better when you get the overseer room and weapon room 
it takes a while to complete (I'm not even close to finishing)."
2370,had fun playing this game

It's free.

 10/10 Fits into the Fallout franchise well."
2387,Nice game when u have nothing else to do ^^
2388,good game
2389,"[h1] When in doubt... Save editor it is. [/h1]
This game is as fun as waiting for my McDonalds order to be done... It's horrendous. In original Fallouts you can find stuff easily and get places fast! Here? Wait 12 hours to get there, wait 24 hours to atleast get something decent! I'd rather play Fallout 3 without an ability to run or shoot than play this!"
2390,You would be better off playing on a mobile device. Or a touch screen device. This game is not PC/mouse friendly. Clicking on a dweller with the mouse often causes they to try to move to the floor above or below their current location. Clicking on Cappy is the worst! Without paying to get further in the game expect it to take a month or so to get your vault full.
2391,"Fallout Shelter is one of those games that's easy to tweak forever‚Äîgetting more CAPS by rushing rooms, recon figuring your vault, making babies happen‚Äîbut it's also helpful to play it for a few minutes and walk away."

2400,fun idle game for people who have a lot of free time
2401,brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
2402,"A more casual, laid-back Fallout experience. It's easy to learn and has a surprisingly long lifespan: after 20+ hours, I don't recall feeling bored. Give it a try!"
2403,"Fun simple game that kills time. Obviously not the greatest game of all time, but still very fun."
2404,"very nice game, i like it, i play from chieldhood"
2405,It's a nice time killer while you wait for that [strike] thot [/strike] Twitch streamer. Remember to give a dweller all your stimpacks and radaways and throw them out.
2406,Plz fix game bad current need more content :O

2425,"Finally my chance to prove my post apocalyptic skill by being the overseer of a vault. And my science teacher said I would never do anything to advance mankind. I decide where and how many water generators, electric plants, and food developing plants to make. I get to determine who will explore the wasteland, who will breed, who will die. Ha Ha Ha. I am the god of the wasteland. 

I feel a need to make a few additions to this review. This game is free. Since no one but clergy men and saints work for free , the developers have to get their money somewhere. Bethesda gets their money through the sale of lunchboxes, quantum cola, and other accessories. 

Do you need to buy any of this stuff? Only the box of robots seems necessary. Without these robots you will not be able to collect resources when you are out of the game. This can cause real havoc on your vault. These robots cost $5.  If you can't afford $5 you probably should be looking for a job rather than playing this game. The lunch boxes give you extra caps, weapons, or vault dwellers, but these can be acquired through playing the game. The quantum cola lets you skip irritating wait times, like the 5 to 10 hour wait before you can do any quest. If you have the patience you need never use a quantum cola.



conclusion:

though the game is free, you will probably land up spending $5. If you are patient, you need not spend a dime more. If you don't mind chaos you won't need to even spent the $5."
2426,i can sentence my dwellers to an eternity in the wasteland with nothing but a pool cue
2427,good
2428,better than new vegas
2429,This is agreat game a little on the time side so I play on mobile So if you read this and you want the game get it on your mibile device its worth the install.
2430,"Yuh, four more achievements to go"
2431,my childhood game
2432,amazing
2433,hmmmmm
2434,fantastic
2435,no im not giving you my money for some nuka cola quantoms todd howard
2436,"I played this a little bit back in 2019, i think but i gave up because i wasn't good at resorce management games, especially ones that took lots of time to play. now, i'm more patient and have a better understanding of how these games work, i'm ready to try again."
2437,"among us

2438,This game some ass
2439,Fun time waster.
2440,new society
2441,stressful
2442,"Stupidly slow, but it does get fun.

The quests and monuments you find while out on the wasteland is what sets this game apart from others in the same genre.

There are some QOL upgrades when you buy Mr. Handy's and such, but I wouldn't recommend anyone spend money on this (unless you want to support the devs).

If you are patient and take the time to develop your vault it becomes quite a satisfying and enjoyable experience."
2443,sure
2444,"Plays more like a mobile game than a PC game. Has the basic currency with premium currency economy that is popular in mobile games. Even though its a free game, play it on mobile, not PC."
2445,"Cutest witto Fallouty game in the wurld! Love the music! Quests! Interesting weapons. Too much rapid clicking, but hey i get it. It's a free game, but I for-sure recommend buying the starter pack, which was only $5 when i bought it. I don't buy stuff like this, but i did not mind buying some of the options. If you like Fallout at all, you might be immediately addicted to this."
2446,Pretty fun to play and good memories
2447,Everyone is dead
2448,Pretty good.

2492,"This game is really fun for a 2D cartoon art style game. There's a lot of stuff to do, do quests, build more, get more dwellers, get clothes for your residents and a lot more! Though once you gett 200 dwellers the only thing(s) you can do is arm every one of them with the best weapons you can get, give the the best clothes with boosts for their S.P.E.C.I.A.Ls or just send them to rooms specified on a skill to level them up. You can also create more Voults and then start all over again. Once you've done everything that can be done, then start all over again, or you can just compete with your friends of who has a better Voult in design or in the Dweller's S.P.E.C.I.A.L, maybe even both, or you can compete in who gets the maximum amount of Dwellers faster, who builds a Nuka-Cola Quantum factory first. There several possibilities! All-in-all this game is fun. I really recommend trying it."

2521,Fun simple game that doesn't require that much dedicated time or money. Rare to see a good Bethesda game now a days.
2522,what a good game
2523,"The best thing about Fallout Shelter is that it is free, and actually more fun to play if you keep it that way, imo. I'm obsessed with checking on my vault for 5-10 minutes here and there in my free time. Classic funny dialogue, cute, and entertaining."
2524,The Fallout Series Is A Very Good Series And Fallout 4 Is The Best But Fallout Shelter Is Right Behind Fallout 4 So Check This Game Out
2525,Torture.
2526,Very addicting!!  Free to play and I haven't had to buy any of the extra items.  Very enjoying.
2527,The best part of this game is when I didn't have to play it anymore
2528,Hmmmm :(...
2529,"I absolutely love the game!
It's easy to learn, easy to play, and the dwellers are each unique in their own way.
You play as the Overseer and can build your Vault to your standards."

Fallout shelter is a well rounded game for a fallout spin-off title. this game have quite a bit of progression the diverse number of different rooms, weapons and items will have you sink a lot of hours for fallout shelter. 


Pros: 
the game has lots of buildings for the player to unlock 

the wide variety of weapons and items keeps the player interested


Cons: 

items are behind a paywall using the lunchbox system 

mobile game architecture 

lunchbox can restrict the player from getting certain items

the game has a downtime system where there is really nothing to do for certain times.

overall this a fallout spin off game that's really a mobile game ported to PC and console."
2531,Fun.
2532,
2533,good game
2534,"this game it very fun just throw some music on and play your time  playing 
"
2535,fun game when you don't feel like doing much
2536,"It captures the Fallout feeling you look for, it can be relaxing, stressful, annoying. Whatever you can find in this game it's satisfying. It's a 2D game and the art style is like Fallout Boy so it's easy on the eyes, I would recommend if asked. And Steam asked so i said this. Not too much storage space needed. Shitty computers can run it. Lots of challenges to keep you busy and, on top of all that... IT'S FREE with some in store purchases but great game."

"
2550,A mobile game with saving problems
2551,"A mobile port with non-existent gameplay. Wait hours or buy premium currency to speed things up. Do you like watching the screen where basically nothing is happening and you can't do anything to progress other than sit and wait? This ""game"" is for you."
2552,PC port of mobilde game. Absolutely free and fun to play. Good IDLE game. Great work Bethesda!
2553,"Had more hours on my phone, fun if you can time manip."
2554,"Despite it starting out as a mobile game for Fallout 4's prelaunch, it is still a very good alternative to a basic cookie clicker game. It handles very well, no lag, graphics are decent, it essentially does its job. You can also basically play it without buying anything, so overall its worth it being free."
2555,good game
2556,"nice old classic game
"
2557,"My vault has been deleted in the game.
I contacted support, but all the steps that they told me to work on either do not work or the steps are already done before, but to no avail to restore the lost vault.

Unfortunately, this is the third time this has happened to me. This is the third account that gets deleted and my money goes with it.
So deleting is in progress. I advise extreme caution when dealing with this game."
2558,"You can easily exploit this game by changing the date and time of your machine, both pc and phone. Just change the current time to the time required in game to finish and voila, you don't have to wait anymore. But with this method, it still takes too much time to get all achievements. Hope this help :D"

2568,"To this day, Shelter makes for a decent time-waster on the go, and can get pretty addictive if you have the patience to collect decent gear. It's got a bit of a bad rep, but it's not bad for what it is: a time-waster."
2569,yes

But f2p base building where you have to keep your basement dwellers alive from all the dangers out there. but most annoying thing are ALL THE FUCKING DEATHCLAW ATTACKES THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND TAKE 5 MINS TO DO.

But dont use real money tho, since you can just edit windows time or find some save editor online probably.

2577,"I'd only play the mobile version of this, kind of a waste of space for your steam library"
2578,was kinda fun to start with but as soon as i started to actually build up my vault and arm my vault dwellers a single deathclaw attack will kill literally every dweller in the vault. ok whatever try again...with the same result. and when that exact thing happens twice in a single week and i cant actually play the game without constantly spending tons of money on micro transactions then fuck your game..thumbs down and removed
2579,Better than Fallout 3.
2580,Yep
2581,very addictive plus very hard
2582,"""My great great great great grandmother never has been so hot before. 10/10""

-Nick Valentine-"
2583,A very fun casual village-like game
2584,"Played this game a long time ago on phone. It is no doubt a great game. Good for passing time

Relaxing Game-play
Almost no bugs
Absolutely not a pay-to-win 

Just play anytime whenever you want"
2585,Calming yet adventurous.
2586,"If you have enough time to game, but not hard time gaming. There is lootboxes to get resources, characters, and others to help speed up your vault. I recommend it those who are interested in Fallout series, basic base management, and willing to grind or whatever.
"
2587,mhm
2588,95 hours. No Preston Garvey. I'm disappointed.
2589,Better base builder than fallout 4.
2590,"Personally i thought i was going to hate this game, but i was really suprised after playing.
The building system is enjoyable but at sometimes mildly annoying,
The combat system is pretty well made and if you lose a fight its probably because of bad weapons, armor, 
etc
Quests are diverse, unique and they give alright rewards which help you do more advanced and harder quests.
All around i found this game very enjoyable. 9/10"

2593,"I've played many hours on phone, it's a nice game to relax to and check in on when you want to spend a minute. It has a lot of depth and holds the vibe of the fallout games."
2594,"I'm not in to that 
"
2595,Doesn't look as crap as Fallout Online.
2596,"yes its dope
"
2597,.
2598,unlucky as hell never win the speed ups but fun time waster
2599,"good game, just get it on your phone tho imo, kinda feels not practical on here"
2600,i coundent even pass the turorial it was so bad
2601,Great game!
2602,good game
2603,"I originally played this back in 2017. This game is brings back memories from when i maxed my vault out on my Xbox. I have now created a new vault on my PC and having so much fun. In my opinion this game is one of the best free games out there.

‚Ä¢ I rate this game a  9/10
"
2604,"I think it's pretty good, good concept, fun idea for a spinoff fallout game like this. Wish we had access to Fallout Shelter Online (basically the sequel to this) but no... they had to make it exclusive to the commies in china, so that's pretty upsetting. Otherwise, great to kill time and enjoy fallout at the same time."
2605,i love this game its so fun to play and as you level up you get cool things. so i recommend this game to everbody.
2606,"Many people write that they got bored of the game after a few months... it is because we as humans are impatient by DNA and the way we are programmed growing up.
Many things you do not know.. or may not have discovered are below... if you do know.. have you revisited the game to see all the additions over the past year?
[list]
Did you know....
[*]If you stay logged in while dwellers are out, they can find secret locations?
(14 mini interactive search, seek and combat missions in one hour)
[*]The Overseer office now have tons of quests currently 24 not including X-Mas ones.
[*]Your vault has bonus skins for the rooms. Christmas Diner  is really cool!!
[*]On all holiday's now they have endless quests all levels of difficulty
(CHRISTMAS IS AWESOME!)
[*]Combat and choices have increased in dialog based on level of dweller
[*]New rooms now added with more planning of vault
[*]More weapons, gear, and animal companions and blueprint fragments!!
[*]Found 22 Nuka-Cola in one hour of play. No need to pay but helps move along if you do.
[*]Found 18 Lunchboxes in 2 hours of play. No need to pay but helps move along if you do.
[*]Found 2 animal quests and containers from roaming dwellers deployed.
[*]Found 2 Discover Only legendary blueprints. Unlocked a new special room!
[*]New DISCOVER ONLY blueprints from roaming dwelling quests.

Take in account when I did the set it and forget it style of play... I was bored quickly.

So I said you know what, lets watch a movie, play for 2 hours and see what happens.

[h3] Suddenly 4 hours had passed and so many things popped out and just kept coming [/h3]

I only write this to advise many, that I played this game on its release, a year after and now two years after. Each time more refreshed, entertaining, and if you can be patient, the new discoveries are really neat and well done. Not easy at higher levels and tactical for sure.

So be patient, do not close the game and then suddenly expect to be amazed.
Do NOT let it run with ""Set it Forget It"", then  walk away because you can miss so much.
This is not made for those who want now now now... it is a grind at times, and other times s9 much to do. Evaluate the risk, have patience, and get rewards.
Fun for all ages."
2607,Loved it!
2608,"The game is fine for killing some time, and the fallout universe fans would definitely appreciate the setting. Considering that the game is free to play, it is surely not a bad acquirement."
2609,It's a trap!
2610,"Fun clicker. The missions get repetitive, but all in all, a solid game."
2611,funny
2612,"So this game hates to love me, I have wasted real life money twice on this game, Cus i have massive issues. 
Either way, Nice game and I would play more but I got the achievements, So I am done =D"

2617,good game :D
2618,its cool and all but the boring part is that you have to wait for fucking hours to do some shit
2619,"its a browser game at best, if you want to waste money play it but if you dont then dont you will be wasting time on something thats really REALLY boring"
2620,"This game is some nice management fun. You can get it to pretty much take care of itself and just check in a couple times a day for 5 or 10 minutes, or you can have 3 vaults running at once and spend hours just switching between them and managing things. It's only as fun as long as you find something you want to do, but if you are into management and enjoy the references to other Fallout Games, then this is a nice little side game for when you have a couple minutes to burn."
2621,Simple and strategic
2622,"Fun game. As it is free, the few bucks you'd spend on the starter pack is worth it."
2623,"It feels like a silly game, but man is it addicting; just like its mobile counterpart. A perfect balance for casual gaming. If there is one thing bad to be said, it is that the saves aren't shared with the mobile versions at all"
2624,Yes.
2625,Passes the time.
2626,"Fun idea. Get's boring, grindy, and repetitive quickly."

2679,"Game play is fun when everything works, but the UI is janky and often zips about when trying to click on a certain thing or grabs and drags a dweller when trying to move the screen. At least on PC it is. On mobile, well I havent played on mobile for several years now. But back then it had the same issue. If you dont mind the stated issues, then by al means play it as it can be quite fun"

2686,I'm addicted.. help.
2687,"What a fun little game!

Wow... that sounds condescending as hell, but I don't mean it to be.

I've enjoyed the Fallout series for years, and this game definitely captures the spirit of the series.  I've always loved the 'retro-futuristic' look of the game.  They perfectly captured what the future would look like through the lens of 1950's America.

This is a casual game, but it is designed to entice you to buy in-game boosters to speed up the pace.  You don't *have* to do that but, if you don't, you can expect things to move at a snail's pace.  This isn't really a big deal for a game like this - it's not like it's non-stop action.  But, it does require patience to see any real progression.

It's fun and a pleasant distraction.  Just don't expect much instant gratification."
2688,"Lots of fun. Pretty easy-going game. Not a lot to do in a single sitting, but a great click-based game to play with your morning coffee! One year of Fallout Shelter with my coffee building the most complete shelter I could imagine!"
2689,good to cure boredom
2690,"I love this game. I mean, it is fallout. It does not consume a lot of time, as it is heavily based on timers that tick away while you are not even playing. You mostly have to occasionally pop on for 10 minutes or so, collect resources, spend your caps, expand your vault, check on your explorers, and you are done. Best of all it is completely free, and while there are loot boxes, I find it that you can play it very well without spending anything. You can also earn some nuka cola and loot boxes by various finishing tasks and quests. I understand this kind of game may not appeal to everyone, but I enjoy it and strongly recommend it!"
2691,hmmmmmmmmm ham

2696,Its an alright game
2697,hee hee i use save editor
2698,You can mod this version.
2699,It is a very good relaxed game to come back to once in a while. I recommend it because i've put a few hours into it and the best part is playing the game while watching something else. For people who like to do multiple things at the same time (watching youtube and gaming).
2700,Really cool game! A lot of fun for all the Fallout fans!

But then you get to the absolute nightmare that is the RNG that rules over some aspects of the game, specially when you have to rush rooms to get the resource they produce on a shortage. 25% failure rate or less? Automatic failure which could lead to desastrous results."

2749,NICE GAME RELAXING
2750,"Fallout Shelter does a good presentation of the series' ambiance (especially Fallout 4) and universe, with a new kind of gameplay that's obviously more suited to mobile gaming, but still functions well on PC. 
The whole ""managing of your Vault"" deal sets this game as a drastically better version of Fallout 4's Vault-Tec Workshop DLC. 
Overall a nice little game to kill time.

It has a tendency to crash frequently though, so be aware of that."
2751,"I mostly played Fallout Shelter on my phone, but enjoyed it on PC as well. Overall it's fun being the Vault Overseer. Definitely kept me entertained when I had to kill time."
2752,Good game
2753,Yes.
2754,It's okay I guess
2755,Bethesda should make open world game on mobile  rather than this sh!t
2756,intresting
2757,It a great way to build a vault and explore the waste land. Wonderful game play.

2761,Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product...
2762,one of the most fun games
2763,Its fun and addicting. Its also pretty challenging early on.
2764,Midless fun
2765,i wish that fallout games were free like this one! i just love this fallout! 11/10
2766,It's a fun gimmicky Fallout themed game.
2767,"this is a smooth and simple base building-esque game, very straight to the point. basically you can get anything in this game without microtransaction by doing quest and missions.
perfect for wasting time, especially if you a fans of fallout franchise. 7/10."
2768,my parents divorced when i was 6
2769,"Great for relaxing without doing much. Not quite an idle game, not quite an active game. Lots of references to Bethesda games."

2773,Very good game

2775,This is an addicting little game that's a lot of fun as long as you don't fall into the microtransaction pit.
2776,Fun
2777,"meh its alright
it got microtransactions tho (WHO WOULD'VE TOUGHT!!!)"
2778,gotta be very patient

2782,Shitty time-waster
2783,don't resist it. you know it's a fun game.
2784,They just made the exact game I wanted to play.
2785,best
2786,"I'd give it a sideways thumb if those were a thing on steam.

When I started this game for the first time three weeks ago it was just the thing I needed. A slow, not too complicated management game that you could hop on and hop off whenever you had a few minutes to spare. It can't be binged since it's one of those phone/facebook games based on timers and that's good. I never really felt like spending real money on microtransactions and I guess people that might want to force it to be binge-able are the only ones that will.

The games management side can be fairly addicting, and that's how it felt for about 30+ hours but eventually the repetetive nature of it, especially the questing minigame caught up with it and it became more chore than fun and relaxing.

I've just gotten to where I could build the final type of room and I think I'll call it quits here."
2787,fun or not fun that is the question... kinda fun :)
2788,"fun theme, decent f2p game that is still fun if you don't buy anything"

2790,"Addictive, loads of hours soaked into this only to have a common error corrupt my save and all progress gone in a heartbeat."

2823,simply addicting
2824,its good
2825,Used to play this back in the day when it was released on mobile. The PC version hold up surprisingly well.
2826,Entertaining
2827,good
2828,i  REALLY LIKE HOW THE GAME IS REALLY REALISTIC
2829,"cool, entertaining, good for wasting time or occupying yourself for long periods of time."
2830,"Pretty nice game if you're a Fallout fan and like micromanagement games. The game is pretty easy to understand due to it's beginner-friendly mechanics, but the biggest set-back of the game is sorrily the microtransactions which are surprisingly cheap for a Bethesda game."
2831,Its a classic.
2832,Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Allans card.
2833,amazing
2834,so cool

2838,Game is simple and fun
2839,"It is worth all the money you will spend on it. There are zero updates, zero real story, zero real progression, but then again you most likely will spend zero dollars on it, and it will be worth that. It is a nice game to play on occasion and forget you have and lose nothing for it."
2840,"I recommend this game 10 / 10 . It`s simple and fun to play , you can play it on your phone too , and it is very cool over all!"
2841,"f u n
"
2842,I am hooked!
2843,Only for patient people
2844,Very good casual game. I first played it on mobile when it first came out. I've had no problems with the PC version. It takes a minute to get used to using a mouse instead of tapping.
2845,"good game. you need practice to coordonate what to do, because in the later game, one mistake and your hole vault would be destroyed by anything"
2846,"tldr: if you are willing to spend some money the game is fun, otherwise i hope you are VERY VERY patient

this is a direct port of the mobile game with some changes to speed-up options and an improved UI (imho). the game is a ton of fun if you enjoy base-building/adventurer management. that being said, if you dont want to be waiting for hours to progress every step then you're going to be buying alot of nuka-cola quantums (ncq), unless you are very lucky with the lunch-boxes you get from quests. without ncq's the game would be EXTREMELY slow. while there are[/] things you can do while you're waiting for quest-runs, item crafting, stat training, etc etc etc, without ncq's you'll be doing a TON of waiting and staring at your vault."

2856,"A really good clicker. Those narratives were created out of the player's own mind. No story line, but the whole concept is cool enough. No difficulty. interesting small talk dialogues between the dwellers. Definitely recommended for a free to play game. :)"
2857,"chill game. If you need nuka colas then just pay for it. It takes like 2 bucks to get 70 nukas. (which is pretty much all you need) Unlike, shall we say team fortress 2 where hats in that game cost like 5 bucks when you can get the hat for free and for minamal effort. the prices are fair, its free and its fun to play. my only gripe with the game is when you are starting out it takes awhile to get the overseers office (i think that's the name) which is where the fun begins. besides that fun game."
2858,"Only thing that is missing is cross platform play. If you could have this exact vault on mobile phone and it would update on both devices, it would be far better."
2859,"Complicated,Great Game
"
2860,I think this is the best game to spend ur time if u dont know what to play.
2861,"This game totally sucks. I bust my hump trying to make it work and rad roaches come and wipe out my whole vault not once but twice in the first two days. I bought the radio station and even upgraded it and like one person has came to my vault. Forgetaboutit! No wonder why it's free. You most likely have to spend some loot to make it work and then how much to do have to feed it? I see this being a pay to win type game. It seems like you don't get ahead, once you do, something happens....fires...rad roach attacks, something to where it takes a ton of caps to bring your people back to life. What a scam. Bethesda has really gone down hill. I even showed them how I had bought Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition on disc way back. I just wanted a steam code so I could put it in my library here. Did they hook me up? No....they game me some BS excuse. I'll never buy a thing from those bunch of Charlatans! Don't waste your time on this mess."
2862,this is a good and fun resource management game
2863,"Oh boy Bethesda...this game is a total nightmare, very few enemies, slow paced gameplay, and worst of all....microtransaction!!!!!!!"
2864,nice game

2878,"This game is fun for about 2 hours.
The game is literally built to force you to use real money to continue playing it.  If you try to play the game for more than 2 hours without spending cash on it, it will be an awful experience.  Unbalanced and unrewarding.  Pay to win, through and through."

2892,"It's a fun take on the fallout franchize. For those who played fallout 4, with the vault 88 DLC, this is like building your vault 88 but then smaller. 

(Actually shelter was first... WHen I played Vault 88 DLC for the first time, I was like: ""Just like Fallout Shelter!"") :p"
2893,Amazing game u should definetly get it!

2917,a basic game but oddly addictive
2918,I played this game on every platform that I've been able to. It's one of my 3 platinum trophies on Playstation. I really liked it. I'll probably buy the excellent looking board game at some point as well.

2926,"This game is a terrible waste of time. It does a good job of carrying out the Fallout theme but it's just an awful time waster. I might tinker with it every once in a while, but the pace is slow as molasses. I would rather buy the latest actual Fallout game at full price than spend a penny on a game that insults me and my time like this one."
2927,nice game
2928,"Pretty much pay to win.
Grind a lot else."
2929,Fun game if U are patient
2930,Ok.. so After 10 Hours.. i can review this game.. So Fallout shelter is good.. its not perfect but its good.. One Positive is that... well its free.. now there's more positives its not just that its free obviously.. i love the fact that you can send people out to the wasteland and another positive is that you can EARN caps more easily then buying them.. Its Not Essential to Buy them with real money so goes with lunchboxes and everything else.. i feel that if your bored and want to play a great free game.. This is a good Option.. the reason why its not perfect is that after a few hours into the save file it feels more needed to buy lunchboxes.. i know i just said that its not essential.. and it isn't but its harder to get lunchboxes then caps on purpose.. but for what this game is.. its great. 7/10
2931,it is a good game but it could us more stuff

2943,"I love this games simple but addictive game play. I can put it aside for several days and when i go back to it i find myself playing for hours. A great feature is that it doesn't shove ads or pay to win garbage in your face like other free to play titles. This is just a good simple game for fans of the fallout series. Now I have to go, Preston Garvey needs me to protect another settlement."
2944,"I played this a few years ago when it first came out on mobile and I wasn't a fan.  That being said, they've definitely added to it. So all in all, cute fun free game. My vault is thriving this time around."
2945,yep
2946,189 hours from my and my family playing it is a good game if you like clickers. Fun for the whole family

2951,"Addictive! and free to play, if patient :) You can purchase items to increase the speed at which your progress happens, but I find it just the right speed to spend a little time here and there and return to see progress through the day... unfortunately, once you start, if you leave it too long your resources deplete and it takes a lot of effort and time to balance them again... it's a commitment! but enjoyable :)"

2962,"This little game is slowly restoring my love and passion for fallout. Allow me to elaberate my testimony and experience with fallout... The first one i played was 3 but i was 12 years old at the time so i didnt understand much or have the time to play much. Years later i join the Army and learn about 4 and New Vagas. Quickly my passion for it grew I played and I played the fallout games. Then fast forward another few years i get married and 76 comes out so of course i get it! I loved the game but i hated the community and people in the game they started to slowly kill the vibe I had for fallout. Then a few months later I'm scammed out of my only few legacies by a couple of teenagers. I uninstalled the game a hated fallout for a long time. I've taken a good break from it and the xbox so i got a pc and here i am. So far I'm absolutely loving this. The soundtracks, the mechanics, the equality of it being challenging and fun is what makes it even more fun. It gives me a fallout 3/4 feel so I can appreciate that. Plus it was free cant complain about that. So i guess what I'm saying is thank you."

3001,"I played this out a lot,, but once I learned how the pay to play system works the game gets a lot less fun. There are some mechanics that are functionally impossible to complete without paying. There are other ways to complete these but this has ruined my fort, much to my dismay."

3005,"This game brushes so close up to perfection that I cannot believe they do not charge real money for it. I did a massive tips video on this game, and I finished it with a glowing review: [url=https://youtu.be/eOH4xiunf-g?t=6261]Full Review and Tips Guide[/url]

The biggest upside of this game is that it favours a drop-in drop-out style of playing, so you can play it through the day without having to invest hours at a time. Also, I super super super love the fact they don't make you wait for buildings to construct.

The only downside is that once you have a vault full of super dwellers, technology, weapons, tech and caps, the challenge sort-of goes away. After around 80 hours I was breezing through objectives and vault attacks. But, getting over 100 hours of fun out of a free game is still amazing."
3006,++++
3007,"great game, recommand"
3008,I dont know very boring but it was nice
3009,raiders :(
3010,"I just started the game, but it looks cool"
3011,"Very complete and entertaining simulation game, unlike many of this type of games, you don't actually need to use money to advance in the game, the game itself gives you quests that give you the rare weapons, etc. I really loved this game and it's pretty addictive, I highly recommend give it a try."
3012,"At least in this game I'm not constantly harassed by Preston Garvey because another settlement needs my help
10/10 would recommend"

3020,"it's a stupid fun resource management game. i love playing fallout 4 with my boyfriend and im not good with the shooting part lol. but i am hella good and settlement stuff and making things. it's super fun it's a side scroller which is nice. it's pretty user friendly and easy to get the hang of. i know this because i didn't realize the 20 page help me starter guide in the pipboy. i struggled a bit but i got it. i did buy a few of the extra things from the store but even without those i still would of done really good. would definitely recommend if you like managing things and quests.

well this is all still true but expect to be disappointed when your 190hr save file corrupts because the game crashes consistently. it was always a mild inconvenience but like its a bethesda game so i figured whatever its just a thing you have to deal with from games from them but now i'm beyond angry. i tried every troubleshooting step and contacted support and received nothing back. i feel like i wasted my time and the money i spent in store. i was three achievements away from 100% fuck this game"
3021,haha baby making go brr
3022,"actually a fun, relaxing, and enjoyable game. good chance to learn a little about fallout when you dont have it or cant afford it"
3023,Fun game. Nice casual game. Once you figure out the strategy its a pretty easy game and gets a little repetative. It would be nice if they made an expansion pack of sort.  But for the price you can't beat it.
3024,Nice game :)
3025,"Honestly just a good game to pass time with, play for a while, forget about it for a year or two, and play it again, repeat."

3033,i just wanted an easy 100% perfect game. I have been running this game 24/7 waiting for RNG. I can't wait to wash my hands of this game

Inside maintenance."
3040,yes
3041,Its good for a mobile game
3042,"Its a fun game plays like your average mobile game but with less intrusive aspects good to play if your feeling quite bored. Gets repetitive quickly at moments usually during periods of waiting but you can counter act that by just leaving it for a few hours or so. Its PTW mechanics arent the most annoying only problem being that they come in the form of a loot boxes, and most legendary items you get tend to actually be legendary scrap (like come on its scrap how could it be legendary!). Other than that its all right and is probably one of the better games you would find in its genre or whatever."
3043,"Fun game,"
3044,"No. At the beginning the game is fun - even addictive, but later it's just clicking the same actions over and over."
3045,It's a fun base builder. Gets hard don't get slack!

3047,is good
3048,"Been playing on and off since it's release and I still find it enjoyable. I wish Bethesda would update the game other than holiday updates. Add more traditional Fallout enemies, and weapons. I do appreciate the updates they have given us such as the Quest one and the random encounters while exploring. It's come a long way since 2015."

3078,Really good time waster. Yes there is the store to spend cash but you don't need to do that to enjoy the game. Need to waste a few minutes or hours while waiting for you friends to jump on? Here you go.
3079,"Addicting vault building game set in the Fallout Universe. Assign your vault dwellers to different rooms that require different S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills, speed up production if you're feeling risky, send dwellers out into the wasteland or make sure they are ready to defend your vault from raiders, radroaches, and even deathclaws! Attract new dwellers with the radio room or just leave some dwellers in the living quarters and let nature take its course. Great little game that can suck hours of your life away!"
3080,Cool concept game to just click around for 20 minutes a day but eventually just gets old with no real feeling of pay off or feeling engaged. Only can be recommended as a time killer.
3081,"This game cannot be paused and it keeps running in the backgound even when you turn it off, forcing you to check regularly (e.g. on your waste land explorers who will die in your absence). This is a well known concept to make games more addictive and to boost micro transactions. Such game concepts should not be supported."
3082,"Has a fairly easy learning curve. Be prepared to wait for the people to become better skilled. No real need to spend additional money, but it can help to have lunch boxes at the beginning. Some pets are helpful some not so much. Crafting takes along time. Get three quests going with the level 3 command centre to speed things up."

3095,best game
3096,"I started playing it without realising it's was a mobile game ported to PC...so yeah most of the time I just wait for the timer to run out. I'm not pointing it out as a bad game just tedious. Building up stats takes weeks, literally. I don't think anyone can ever complete it, it's pretty much a simulation program where you just keep testing different possibilities.

Few things that makes the game a bit annoying at times is - First the camera auto focus during incidents or when you click on a room make me misclick on dwellers pulling them out of the room or level them up by accident. Second the Level Up button has quite a bit of area to trigger and is prioritised over every other menu or buttons or even through the floor, so in case a dweller is right underneath some menu you can actually level them up by accidental clicks. I want those Level Ups to help them refill their HP, with limited number of weapons it became a requirement for me to micro manage each dwellers equipment.
One the plus side it's a trap, the game can be addicting for some. It's difficulty is casual with detailed visuals, making it enjoyable.

I'd recommend the game because it was fun...until the timer went out of control. Also you need to be really patient to gather all the achievements, could take a year or so. Go through some guide to make things a bit easy on yourself before plunging in deep, some mistakes can be expensive."

3124,"Right off the bat, looks and feels like a mobile game (apparently there IS a mobile version, so there you have it). This might turn off many gamers, but it's not without charm, and hey, it's free. 

Doesn't require any expense to slog through, but it definitely is a slog! There are huge time sinks employed, painfully (and annoyingly) obvious attempts to encourage in-game purchases to boost dwellers and speed up progress. However, not a sore point if you're patient and just treat this like any other idle game. Let your citizens and Mister Handies do their thing in the background, or close it down and drop by the vault later.

[b]Passable. 6.5/10[/b]

A worthy addition to the Fallout-verse. I probably would NOT have found this as quaint if I hadn't enjoyed previous Fallout games as much as I did. There far better games of this category out there, free or otherwise."

Would be a 10/10 with a multiplayer update where you can do everything as in the normal game but you can also visit others vault, raid others, and have a Nuka Cola pub where you can chat and do other interactive stuff with other players. Still love it"

3154,Fun game to have as a time killer.
3155,"It has an ironic 50s look and feel. The concept and its development are cute, but the interface is kinda frustrating, especially when trying to move around the dwellers and put them in the correct rooms (at least in the rooms we *actually* want them in): it is a somewhat capricious drag'n'drop. After a while, one just ceases to play that game, in order to safeguard their wrist :P"
3156,"First played this on my phone. First week I wouldn't drop my phone cause I was invested in the life of my people. You don't really need to pay to be good, just be active or do all the quests you can do.
It gets a bit boring once you are maxxed out and enemies are ridiculously strong while you are stuck at that point but I guess it's worth it considering it's free and ""cute"". Also the dialogue and the logs of exploring the wasteland are funny and Fallout themed."

(much better then using the time skip method) 

Why you shouldn't time skip wasteland wandering: 
From my personal experience. 
Messes up the game's internal clock, for some reason causing more and more raid events, lack of wasteland items. 
How to fix lack of items- reddit says wait until the time you set in the hack, there's no other way apparently 

Hope this was helpful, 
take care.

3165,fucking love it!

3167,Good Game

3169,Fun little game that is free :)  Not alot to it but still worth playing.  Entertaining as a game should be.
3170,Love playing Fallout Shelter! It is so much fun to build your vault and train up your people. The Halloween changes are awesome and I hope more changes come with other holidays.
3171,It's good but gets a bit boring and tedious once your vault get to a certain size but it is free so definitely worth getting it for a few hours of enjoyment.

3199,"One of the best free games on steam. Yes you do need to pay for some advantages, but not having them is all part of the fun.

It's a good game to kill time when you have nothing to play. It also doesn't require continuous attention which is a big bonus. After I got started and built a decent vault, I often only opened this game for a few minutes twice or three times a day just to check on the dwellers that went on quests. 
The game is fairly entertaining and didn't disappoint me in terms of content.

For a free game I highly suggest downloading it. It's not your typical free simulator where you harvest and build. This game lets you work towards success as your vault grows bigger and bigger. Along the way you will find some challenges that may wipe out half your vault, but that's whats fun.
Enjoy your game-play. üòâ"

3205,"Fallout Shelter is a beautifully simple game from a structural point of view. You have a vault. You can build rooms in the vault, and people can do things in the rooms. Your main resource in Fallout Shelter are bottle caps. You can earn these by completing achievements, leveling up dwellers, rushing production, sending dwellers on missions, and etc. For those that want to speed things up, there is also the option of purchasing bottle caps via micro-transactions. Each of the rooms will require a certain number of bottle caps to build. Because of this, it is very important to plan your Vault in order to optimize production rates and minimize costs."
3206,.
3207,‚ô•
3208,"If you're into base-building and resource management, but don't have the time or patience to sit and play for hours on end, this game is probably for you. It's one of those game that you can pretty much pop in and out of as you please. (Just be careful so you don't forget any dwellers out in the wasteland.) It's not the most complex game, but it has enough layers to keep me entertained. The art style is very iconic and appealing, at least in my opinion, and really lends itself well to this kind of game. Yes, there are micro-transactions in the game, but they are completely optional (as they should be). You can still get nuka-cola speed boosts just by playing the game and completing quests. Also, it's free to play, so what do you have to lose?"
3209,"It's pretty fun but if you want to progress faster just get a few pets and lunchboxes. Just know that everything is on a timer such as when you can get resources from rooms or when your dwellers return from the wasteland, its a good game to play a little then close it."

3220,this game good to play
3221,Not bad.
3222,"I've played this many times. This time I've started over about 4 times and just played my first vault to over 100 folks.
To be clear I have spent about 50 bucks on the game. A set of Mr. Handys each vault. A bunch of 32 pks of Cola, and 1 starter pack.
I had no complaints --- frustrated with the mouse at times and toons that just take of running when clicked upon, or the automatic zooming in continually.
But the worst was when I hit 100 toons and for some odd in my own head reason I assumed that a Nuca-cola plant would produce bottles of cola periodically.
What a fool ---- you get food n water.
I was assuming a loyalty type bonus so as to not have to continue to pay to play too much.
Shame!
For this reason I say no --- don't waste your time or especially your money.
I went from tossing a couple of bucks in as like a video arcade game ( feeding quarters ) to feeling downright scammed.
To be fair I  wasn't promised anything, however I expected more from Bethesda."
3223,"i do love the game but my laptop decided to error out and i lost my whole save, having to start all over with no cloud access kinda sucks when you put time and effort into a game you enjoy only to lose it all that quick is stupid."

3231,"Overall nice, simple game

minuses:
-obvious money scam, processes take hours but you can speed them up with nuka cola quantum (that you can buy for real money of course) also loot boxes with rare stuff
pluses:
-there is save editor that can easily and legaly give you infinite amount of nuka cola quantum without need to pay those bethesda leeches a penny. 

Virgin, greedy bethesda scammers vs Chad players and save editor"
3232,"If you're a patient person with no life and constant feeling of pain to live, this game it's the perfect for you, fabolous to enjoy while you're immerse into the abism of  L O N E L I N E S S"
3233,Don't buy the Lunch Boxes because you can get them for free by changing the code in game.
3234,"Honestly, not a bad game. I barely show my addiction on Steam, but I do have more hours into it on my phone. It feels like it's a modern Interplay fallout game that's using Bethesda's Vault Boy artstyle. It's a generic room tycoon game at first, but once you get more into the game, then the meat of it starts to show and you can somewhat feel that old fallout gameplay.

It's small and simple, but the content does pack a punch. Decent work judging that this is manufactured by Bethesda. Also, the game is not protected by save modding, and I have saves on the PC version that had been modded to have unlimited lunchboxes and caps. Having that ability to easily mod a Bethesda game gives it a higher ranking for me."
3235,"very great game for passing time, love the fallout series myself and id say this game despite not being a fps like the later games, or dnd style like the early games, is one of the best"

3238,"for a pay to play game it's quite good about being able to move around without dealing with prohibitive lack of progress (e.g. dnd's phone app). a couple bucks for a starter pack gets you a beefcake and crazy pet. mr. handy can help you not worry about collecting resources for 3 bucks. close the app, come back in a day, everyone's stronger and missions are complete. low-fi meditative animal crossing for 6 bucks. there are story and holiday quests that will likely run out, but it remains amusing 24 game hours in."

The legendary dwellers achievement it's inhumane if you don't buy starter packs but you can get them with a save editor. Good luck!"
3243,"Always a good game to have going in the background. I should consider starting up a vault again, it's been very fun to watch them progress and I've played on many platforms, unfortunately I always end up straying away because it's very easy to lose your entire vault while offline."

You start building, menage power/water/food/living-space, fight off invaders and fire, send dwellers in expeditions, then start doing quests and encounters, then craft weapons, gear up, train dwellers... all that happens under 4 hours. After that it's just repetition with bigger invaders, bigger loot, more resources to manage, but nothing really changes."

3257,I really love eating BREAD
3258,"Enjoyable, though it's easier (fewer raids) to just set it and log off.  Also, you'll advance much faster on a version that allows you to accept ads for freebies, such as on your phone or tablet, but visually, this version is easier to see (assuming your computer screen is larger than your tablet's).  If you like Fallout and enjoy a slightly tamer version of their humor, this game is worth your time."
3259,"I've played this game multiple times in my life and got into it again. Not much as really changed from the base game, which is amazing since it wasn't even broken to begin with. It's a perfect time killer for anyone that's a fan of the Fallout universe. It is nice to see that the quests are still being updated for all the current holidays! Show's that the developers haven't given up of this game yet. :)"

3324,Kinda mediocre when playing this game. Fallout Shelter makes you experience how it is to become an overseer of your own vault but fails to deliver. The main game is filled much in-game microtransactions that recommends you to use your wallet to do well in the game without waiting. I while playing this didn't mind this but am concerned of the save data of the game. Today i started up the game on steam but noticed my save game missing. I quickly checked my files and search online for any info to find/recover my file but to no avail its gone forever. All the progress i done is gone and can't be recovered. I know this is a free game and all but Bethesda come on why do you do this bullshit. Overall if you want to play this game I recommend a big fat No because it sucks.
3325,It's enjoyable enough but the amount of time/money required to unlock the 20 Legendary Character achievement means I can't recommend this. I have purchased hundreds of lunchboxes and still haven't managed it. I just bought 40 today in the sale and out of the 40 I got ONE legendary character. I've had previous batches of 40 and haven't gotten any at all. Please improve the drop rate and I will recommend the game.
3326,good

3339,"We all know Bethesda Softworks love to torture their users, and with this game they start to show mastery in the art of inflicting pain and agony on the world.

The game starts off slowly but soon you're getting into it and the achivements come rolling in;  You're hooked. Then, just before you complete your shelter, just before you complete that 97% tough-to-get achivement, just as you see all remaining achivements on a single row on the community page they strike: They corrupt your savegame.

So simple, yet so brilliant.

You can still start the game, you can still load the shelters you made when you first started playing. But you CAN NOT load your main shelter.  Oh, no. Try that and the game crashes.

You'll uninstall, throw your computer out the window and sulk in the corner. Then when you randomly see the Fallout Shelter logo in your Steam Library two years from now it will still hurt. You'll be reminded of the shelter you will never get to finish, the achivements you will never get and the money your st**d ass sunk into this pile of festering bitrot before Bethesta Softworks finally lifted the vail from your eyes and showed you who they truly are.

Brilliant! Brilliant, I tell you!

There are no backup saves.  Once this happens you have no way to fix it.  It is at this point that it stops being fun.

The game runs fairly stably on Windows 10, but on Windows 8.1 not so much.

3374,"Originally played this on Android and decided to try the Steam version, which I actually like better since it runs smoother and has more screen space. The game's economy is corrupt though and I would never recommend spending a dime on this game since you can literally use a save file editor to get everything or just enjoy the game for free. Definitely not the first Fallout game one should play though as I feel this does not best represent the franchise and is designed to be more ""mobile friendly"" for brainless consumers.

3401,"It's great and fun to spend some idle time.  However, if for any reason the game or your computer crashes.  You lose your game.  It's happened to me 3 times.  I'm done.  Glad I didn't spend any money on their store.  Don't play or dedicate time to this game unless you are willing to lose said time and money."
3402,"It's fun but I've kept a notebook of successes and failures. After several hundred rushes, the failure rate was 54% over all. Rushes were attempted at between 15-39% chance of failure. 

Power room was the worst by far at a 61% failure rate when the stated percentage chances were between 15-39%. 

Water and food were far less severe than power but were always higher than the displayed percent chance. I wonder if it's to frustrate people into buying lunchboxes since those can give resources.

Don't get invested into the game. There's so many guides for min-maxing and the like, min-maxing in a free to play, non-competitive game is a loser thing to do. The game isn't that hard. It barely needs to be opened except to do the out of vault quests.

Don't spend money on the game. If they're willing to fudge numbers to make things work against you more often, they'll lie about other things. Plus spending money in a F2P game makes you part of the problem. Don't be part of the problem and don't be a min-maxing loser in a single player game.

Play it for what it is and it's a decent enough way to kill some time.

3403,"MOM, LOOK! I've completed Fallout Shelter without buying a single Quantum Cola!

Short: awesome in the beginning, total f–∏cking drag once you finish building up the base, and completing ~half the main green Qs. Elsewhat, it's just another gud ol' money garnering automation. But guess what.

I HAVEN'T SPENT A SINGLE CENT, –íITCHESDA, LOAL!"

3407,"Few games are this good when they are released alongside other 'triple A' games as was the case with this game when it was released on the day fallout 4 was announced. The dialogue is peak fallout wit and humour, and there is a lot of it, and for some reason I've never grown tired of it even when I read the same thing over.

It's even so well constructed that you can play multiple playthroughs and have your vault organised in completely different ways. I've played on the bethesda launcher and FS was also the last game I played on mobile. Even though I still have my saves and found out there was a guide to transfer saves from android only, which I still have, I kept wanting to experience the early playthrough of creating a vault from scratch. Really fun and comfortable time playing. Sometimes the game plays itself and is still enjoyable as a management sim, plus it is one of the best games I have played while still being free and not ever feeling like the store is being thrown at you to use it.

and seriously..if you don't end up checking this game out at least try to find some of the things the dwellers say in a video somewhere...it's so charming."
3408,cool game
3409,"Have time to kill, then this is a good filler.  Start it up and start your vault or spruce it up.  Cant believe there is no official sequel to this game."

3417,epic
3418,I love this game
3419,"I love this game, but some aspects of it are annoying. LOTS of waiting and i wish that we wouldn't have to wait hours to do quests. Definitely a fun relaxing game, but take it slow. If you build too big or breed too much you'll fail horribly. One more thing... ITS FREE TRY IT OUT"
3420,Pay to win dookie from papa Howard. Don't pay for anything in this game its not worth it at all.
3421,funny but a bit time consuming
3422,Siuuuuuuu
3423,"Neat game, didn't realize I wasted like 3 hours for the first time playing it, just that level of addiction. It's fun but it get easier the more you play it. Worth grinding first 50 hours, after that I just wanna complete the Steam achievements. Still fun seeing your dwellers growth tho~"

3430,played for along time  pc crashes one time  deletes vault permanently  i dont recommend this game to anyone its a waste of time
3431,Very good i recomend
3432,a good time waster
3433,"just a time waster, could have been good but goes nowhere"
3434,Epic game. more epic if you play multiplayer (sharing screen on Discord) with your relatives

3440,"fun but could have more stuff to do when your stuck like me
still fun"
3441,Too god damn addicting
3442,Solid waste of time and the microtransactions aren't too extreme.
3443,"I really dont have a problem with this game. The concept is great but the execution is so minimal and hamstrung by hours of bloat and waiting that clearly its just to demolish your time. Which honestly all this game seems to accomplish is to drag fallout's name through the mud. I'm sure I'll plug an embarrassing amount of hours into this game but I'm a big fallout fan and this game was clearly not made for people like me. I sink time into games as a hobby, not something I flick at occasionally on my phone. This game exists as a fishing net litmus test to see if your willing to pony up in order to get the content you want.  I dont know. I see all the time and care that went into the art and game systems, the loving recreation of iconic characters in vault boy style, and I'm left wondering if that time and resources could be better spent.

Edit: I've played 35 more hours and yea this stands."
3444,all of my people died when i left to put my dog out
3445,"You have to play a few times to get the hang of it and so your vault doesn't die but overall its a pretty good game.

3456,Yes
3457,fallout shelter has the greatest RPG elements out of any bethesda made fallout game and thats not even that great. bethesda is just kinda dogshit at their games
3458, it is a very good game
3459,Very good for a free game. I played this for many hours on my phone and this version is just as good
3460,great game to relax and play. 7/10
3461,"The game is easy to understand. Just give dwellers to appropriate jobs and suits. Take care of their illness and happiness and see them. Exploring is the way to get more weapons, suits, also junks to craft other things. Recommend for all level players"

3470,"surprised that I have as many hours in this game as I do, but it's definitely worth it. I haven't played any of the other fallout games, but honestly this game floats my boat. My all time favorite simulation games. It is very easy to get the hang of and just gives me a lot of satisfaction when i'm ready to put another 10 hours into it.

8.5/10"
3471,"Enjoyed the mobile version, and still enjoy it here. Good game just to kill time."
3472,Great way to pass time
3473,"It's decent, but not to my liking. It's a good time killer I suppose, but not as addicting as most people make it out to be, or at least for me. It's basically just AdVenture Capitalist with a few more mechanics and systems behind in, in the art style of the Fallout franchise."
3474,gg
3475,ranger armor (merc armor) and laser pistol guud
3476,awesome
3477,This game is super fun
3478,"Wonderful game. I've played much longer than the 1 hour shown here. I downloaded the game directly from Bethesda and have played to what I think is the end. There is no conclusion to the game, and it is strictly a world-building (vault-building) endeavor with outside missions and exploration.

Having reached this point (only one mission left), maximum of 200 people at level 50 or approaching, and no space left for additional storage or other rooms (all levels are occupied by rooms), I'm pretty sure that I'm done. It's been a long but fun trip, though.

Some suggestions, and I'm sure not exactly new:

1) Increase the maximum occupants from 200 to some ungodly upper limit.
2) Add the ability to expand to other vaults to continue building.
3) Add an infinite number of possibilities for missions.

I noticed one ""bug"" during my journey. I don't know if it's Bethesda's attempt to be more ""woke"" with respect to relationships or just an oversight, but when a baby is born, you are given the option to name it. Usually, but not always, the baby's last name is the same as the father's. But frequently, the baby's default last name is that of the mother's. It's more of an annoyance than anything else because I liked to keep track of families.

Again, a great and sometimes funny, cute, dark  experience.

Just wish it could go further...."
3479,Good for a free game. Will probably not play this again for the rest of my life.

3507,"My strongest vault dweller is basically heavily armoured Jason Voorhees with a portable nuke and a pet cat. How can you not enjoy life when this is what life hands you? I mean, I have no idea how the people in my vault feel about the fact that their roommate is Jason Voorhees, but apparently they're not too bothered by it - that or the vault is so enormous that its really easy for them to avoid him anyways. Or maybe they just like his cat. I like his cat too."

3516,"Transferred my phone save over to my computer and steam immediately bombed me with half of the achievements, very satisfying. Nothing too serious in terms of roleplaying like the other games, but it's something to pass the time. Take care of dwellers and don't let them die, check in on them every once in a while.

Nothing major anyway, the game is solid and it doesn't require to forcibly buy addons to go one.. more or less.. sometimes the shortage of water seems higher than it should be, but it just makes the game more difficult, not impossible. It's a solid game easy to play."

3562,Great at the start but then after a couple of hours of playing you begin to need to wait days for stuff unless you wanna drop some microstransactions.
3563,"I remember the day this came out and I played it for a week straight. Fun concept love the updates that have been added. It's not exactly a pay to win game, but it can be. My biggest gripe here is the wait-times on a pc game. Instead of addressing this issue and adjusting times from mobile to port all the original time constraints still exist. Controller support felt like an after thought after learning the game from mobile playing it on pc and even running it on ps4. For a f2p game this is absolutely it."

3565,"good game, i hate lunchboxes tho"
3566,Addicting little game. I was familiar with fallout so running a vault seemed interesting.
3567,pretty epic

3569,"It's a great time waster, however from using the mobile device it's pretty obvious that purchasing from the store is the way to make things interesting. You can earn things by playing, but it will take an awfully long time."

3598,"its a good game, its a bit different than other idle games, i recommend it. but if you play, please, take your time. focus on upgrading your essentials first and do not expand too quickly. leave no dweller without work. and with a little luck, youll be able to have a good vault. it takes some trial and error at first, but its fun."

3617,"Ultra-slow motion clicker that keeps playing even when you've shut off the game!

I tried this when I had first installed it.  The game is free - so why not?  Of course me being how I am, I didn't at first ""get"" the game, and failed miserably, thought it wasn't for me, etc.  But it turns out, once the mechanisms and strategy make sense, the game is very generous to people patient enough to keep slogging through some of the slow spots.

Gameplay basics:

- Build an elevator / room system for taking care of people.  At bare minimum it will need power, water and food (which is magically ""produced"" in restaurants), and living quarters, though the living quarters don't really have to be occupied.  Living quarters can be occupied by male and female occupants, which may result in pregnancies, and subsequent babies being born.

- Each production room has an associated character trait which will generate the highest production.  So matching up occupants to the right rooms will usually make them happier and always more productive.

- Chose when to upgrade rooms by priority to maintain production levels to keep up with population.

- Send some people out into the outside wilderness to try to find stuff and hopefully live to bring back the goods!  These include crafting items and weapons.

- Raiders, fires and cockroaches will attack your base.  Save up on health packs to prevent people from dying during these disasters!

The tricky part is making sure production is such that if you shut the game off, and try to live a normal life, and come back again, that the economy will allow recovering from the broken-down state - it might not if it wasn't balanced right.  This is a fairly feature-rich game especially for being free to play.  There are in-game purchases available if you want to support the developer, but these aren't required to succeed in the game."

3624,"The game is a lot of fun, a great time waster but, it is a hard grind. It is very apparent this game is designed for pay to play.  Plan on spending hours and hours waiting on some of the things to happen. I have played several times and never seem to get past 15 0r 20 hours before I loose interest."

3647,"How come my chances for rush is 33%, but I only get 50% success????"
3648,Humorous light-hearted little time killer
3649,its ok i guess
3650,I made a nerd have a baby with a supermodel
3651,This game needs constant attention. Just like you. You selfish mf.
3652,Semi Idle/clicker. Honestly I enjoy it because it's basically and interactive Ant Farm. If you have seen the Show Solar Opposites on Hulu... you are the aliens on the show and these are you shrunk down people.
3653,"TERMINAL-LOG NUMBER 14 

LOG NAME: FALLOUT SHELTER

This old terminal is so fucking old! I found this on the terminal download's...fallout shelter, possibly a vault tech simulation

Time to sign off this terminal feral ghouls are coming.

3654,"really fun game to put hours into and also fun to grind
"
3655,"This game is not for the Christian / Catholic audience for many reasons. The biggest reason and probably the most Comanement breaking one is that the dwellers have premarital s***ex and do not follow the rule of abstinence. The dwellers can also after pregnancy have se**x with a different dweller than the original father which is a big no no. The game should make it so that you can only make the dwellers have children if they are married and they can only have children again with the same father which means that there are no Commitements being brocken. Another problem is that dwellers can go explore and STEAL which is the 7th Comandement and against God¬¥s prefrence. Lets end this comment with a prayer, ""Lord, I'm in that place again On my knees Laying my life out before You Thank you that on the cross you cried ""It is finished"" You have done it Forgiveness is complete I can live forever in Your grace Forever in Your love So I ask now for Your forgiveness For the wrongs that I have done And the things that I have neglected I ask for Your forgiveness For the people I have hurt along the way And those who I have failed to love as You love I ask for Your forgiveness I receive Your forgiveness And resolve in my heart That with Your strength I determine not to make these errors again I receive Your forgiveness And by the power of Your Holy Spirit I walk away from everything I know to be wrong And embrace everything I know about You For the kingdom, the power and the glory Are always and forever Yours Amen""

"
3656," Game is fun, especially if you are just looking for something that doesnt take up a lo to time but is still enjoyable to play with a minor amount of time to invest."
3657,yeah
3658,"I like it
"
3659,A fun little add on to the Fallout Universe. Can do everything without purchases but definitely faster with purchases.
3660,good
3661,nice
3662,still fun
3663,dont leave these dumb fuckers alone. left for 5 minutes and came back to depressed and radiated dwellers. what the hell did they do while i was gone?

3666,"After spending a significant amount of time of Fallout shelter I've been enjoying myself so much are 1.2 hours. 
so this game i recommend"
3667,yes game good
3668,yeah
3669,man i love building a room and having all of my residents starve
3670,boring.
3671,","
3672,oh my god this is so flipping cool
3673,even for a free game this is terrible
3674,HI
3675,extremely fun ! if you like animal jam tunnel town and fallout you would probably like this
3676,Fallout New Vegas characters pleaaaaaseee
3677,my vault people keep dying
3678,"A classic, still remember playing for the first time on cellphone, but they could add a time system of day and night as in most games."
3679,"Seru buat ngilangin gabut
"
3680,Great way to Waste Land some tyme. Truly one of the best mobile games.
3681,yea
3682,It good
3683,"Super fun game! Was actually my introduction to the Fallout series years ago when I first played it on my phone, and I still play it now. Simple premise but very entertaining and will keep you busy for hours."
3684,good
3685,Play the mobile version. There are bonuses like the option to watch an ad for some caps or lunchbox or Nuka Quantum. This is an idle game so it should have these idle game features.
3686,"it good
"
3687,"cant stop playing please help, im addicted"
3688,good
3689,cool game i guess
3690,This game is really fun although you do have to wait for things. But that's good so you don't sit in front of your screen for 12 hours a day. I really like it and would recommend to anybody who is interesting in apocalyptic-type survival games.
3691,"Solid Time waster the gameplay style is suited a bit better to mobile if you could carry saves across platform would be the cherry on top.,"
3692,When the vault dwellers do the sex I laugh. The lunchbox thing in the game is kinda poggers
3693,Now kithh
3694,"Boring and Repetitive, idk mby just not my game but it is just the same loop, over and over"
3695,"ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"
3696,Amusing offshoot of the fallout series
3697,I've played this on and off since release and I enjoy it! It's a good time waster for sure!
3698,Easy little time killer. Plenty of quests to send your dwellers on and some pretty funny comments are made if you focus in and watch them. Even the robots will make snarky comments.
3699,Its a Bethesda game soooo... all of the microtransactions lunchboxes quantums can be obtained in mass quantities by changing some files so dont spend money
3700,g
3701,its aight
3702,"great game, i don't expect the graphics to be that good as its just a 2d game but the graphics are great for the type of game it is, it has great game play and it even has tasks for you to do to get some items and so you don't get bored of the game it has some ""disasters"" well not really but it could be raiders, fires, or roach infestations. overall a really great game and its free too so just try it out"
3703,my dweller caused a fire while working out because of how hot they were
3704,"guud
"
3705,its pretty uber cool
3706,"Pretty good game honestly, not too much to add :)"
3707,.
3708,Nothing like sending out your Dwellers out stranded for 24 Hours for them to come back with an entire armies worth of weapons.
3709,">>>>>>>>>> midout 1, midout 2, midout 3, midout: mid vegas, midout 4, midout 76"
3710,i hate this game.
3711,Too slow paced.
3712,"The most fun I have ever had playing a tower builder/real time management game! 

- The quests you send dwellers on are cute and I like that you unlock all kinds of things from them
- The different characters, outfits and themes are all fun
- Loot boxes are fun and have a good amount of loot inside which you can earn by completing objectives or buy
- You can jump in for a quick check up or stay a while and watch the vault dwellers roam while you earn caps from the mysterious stranger and other visitors

Not your typical cheap tower building game, has good depth and keeps it fun to come back."
3713,Fun little game. You can play it for only a few minutes each day and make massive progress.
3714,"yes
"
3715,Good
3716,Too easy
3717,Game is fun when you're waiting for chicken nuggets to finish heating up.

3762,"A good, free, tycoon type game. As someone who has never played the fallout series, this game is still enjoyable on its own with no prior knowledge of the franchise. If you're into management games, this one is worth a try."

3768,"its good, i like it. but most of it is waiting, alot of waiting."
3769,"It's actually a fun port, so much better than the mobile version.

It's a nice little time-waster with a good sense of progression. Yes, there are microtransactions to ""assist"" with progress but they aren't inherently necessary. You start out with a decent amount of Quantum (used to rush tasks), the Mysterious Stranger appears quite often, and when you find and click him he'll grant you anywhere between a few hundred and couple thousand caps, so it's actually fair and you don't need to pay for extra, and also quests give you a pretty good amount eventually. There's also quite a few times where the game will give you lunchboxes which contain premium items which otherwise you'd have to pay for. Basically, its a fair and fun little game and I'd say worth a shot"
3770,"Fallout Shelter is a basic concept game, and I have no issue with that. Build your underground vault and try to expand and survive. With plenty of rooms to build, dwellers to acquire, and weapons to find, this game is simple but fun. Ill admit it can get boring at times but overall the game at its core is still a fun pass time for Fallout fans."

3784,"Fun, and easy to play. Very addictive and with lots to explore. It's not just about evolving your vault there are tons of missions to complete. Explore the Wasteland! My only complaint, is that with every other basebuilding game. It becomes a waiting game after a while. Legendary items take like a week to build."

This one is a no brainer: It's free, Casual, not heavy at all, Portable, fun and fallout
What are you waiting to play!?"
3804,Predicting the future!
3805,cant complain
3806,cool game
3807,Fun game.  Doesn't work well on the laptop.  Doesn't work well with a mouse and it freezes often.  Best used on a touchpad.
3808,a fun little time waster and for free its perfect!
3809,played this on mobile and switch and it's suprisingly good for a mobile game! and i love how after the first 12 hours it throws all hell at you.  this is my first review on this account. just saying. also the dweller based on me having sexual intercouse with hot girls is hilarious
3810,"Simple and fun game, but really lacks substance and is carefully designed to keep you hooked to it as long as possible. Also, of course, microtransactions. Fun time waster, but be super wary if you are prone to binge on games or mindlessly scroll the internet.

edit: also prone to game-breaking bugs late game"
3811,Do not buy anything in the store i did and a few days later for some reason the game reset and my vault save was no where to be found. im glad i only spent 20 bucks and not more on some the the stuff in the shop
3812,"good thing to kill some time, getting u relax"
3813,"Wow, this game is really hard! One of the most challenging games I've ever played...I'll start off by mentioning the most irritating feature in this game, not to do with the actual gameplay, but more an option you can't turn off, this is something very important you should know, before getting this game, because it heavily affects gameplay:

This game has an irritating autosave feature installed into it, which you can't even turn off. Meaning, if a devastating incident happens in your vault, such as creatures or raiders killing stacks of people in your vault, and you quit out to try to load into a save before the incident happened, it just loads you straight back into the disaster, there is no possibility of being able to load into any old saves before the disaster, because the autosave keeps saving automatically, just about 24/7; there is a 'save' button you can click, but what's the point when the autosave just saves over it?? You have no 2nd tries when an attack happens, you literally have to get it right and stay on top of it on the first try, because of the stupid autosave feature. I just really hope the devs read this, and seriously consider at least bringing in the option to turn it off, because it provides no contribution whatsoever to this game, only being an extreme irritation and incredibly game-crippling feature.

ANOTHER THING I NEED TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR MATURE AUDIENCES, 18 AND UP! (I put it in caps to immediately bring this part to any readers' attention, because this is very important to know, before getting this game, if you have any kids, or if you are under-age), because of a sexual theme being in this game - you can make women pregnant in this game; when you put a man and a woman into a Living Quarters together, and leave them there for a while, they'll start out by talking, then dancing, then they'll kiss a couple times, then run into the bedroom together and disappear around the wall. It's not as explicit as Sims 4, where you can sort of see what they're doing, in this game, when they disappear around the wall in the bedroom, all you see is green smiling faces appearing and disappearing around the bedroom for a couple seconds, then they both come out, with the woman suddenly being pregnant. Still, it is suggestive enough that I would still not recommend this game to anyone under 18, this game is definitely one that belongs in the 'mature audience' category. 

Anyway, to get to what this game is actually about, and what makes it so worth playing: the aim of this game is to keep your dwellers alive and happy. There are only 3 types of supplies you need to keep maintained in order to do this: power, food, and water. At the start of the game, you only have a small amount of rooms available to choose from, when building, just very basic power, food and water supply rooms, and also a couple other things, like storage rooms and living quarters, which you need to support population; the more living quarters you build, the more dwellers will be able to live in your vault. It is very hard to maintain these supplies with the basic rooms you have to choose from, and the small amount of dwellers that arrive at your vault, and especially when the first attacks from the wasteland outside start happening against your vault. 
But I promise you, it is TOTALLY worth sticking around and giving this game a chance, because, the more you understand this game, and how it works, the easier it becomes, and that's when it becomes super fun and addictive! :D The more dwellers you gain in your vault (either from attracting them from the wasteland to your vault by crafting a radio room - which attracts dwellers out in the wasteland to your vault -  or breeding them, from pregnant dwellers), the more rooms you unlock, different ones that make it so much more easier to survive in this game, like more effective power, food and water supplies than the basic ones you start out with, that help you produce and collect supplies much faster, and weapon and armour rooms that are very handy for equipping your dwellers with armour and weapons to defend themselves against attacks against the vault. You can also collect weapons and armour as loot from sending dwellers out into the wasteland to explore for loot, which I would highly recommend you do at the very beginning of your game, sending at least 3 dwellers out into the wasteland to find guns or armour, to be ready for the first attack against your vault. You can also craft an Overseer's Office later on, which allows you to send up to 3 teams consisting of 3 dwellers each out to do quests, which awards you far more weapons, armour, and loot, and caps (the Fallout currency in this game) than wasteland exploration does. 

You can also make your dwellers more skilled at producing supplies faster if you put them in the right room, according to the stats of their skills. Skills are portrayed as .S.P.E.C.I.A.L. in this game, which stands for the 7 different skills dwellers each have, which can all be raised and improved from training rooms: 
STRENGTH - Not need for combat, but good for power rooms, so dwellers with higher strength skills should be tasked with maintaining power rooms.
PERCEPTION - Works the same way as the strength skill, the same with all the other skills, this one's good for water rooms. 
ENDURANCE - Good for both combat and rooms, the only room this skill is good for though, is the Nuka-Cola Bottler room, the final and most effective room that unlocks at 100 dwellers, that supplies both food and water in one. Unusual that endurance is the skill needed to maintain this room, as the previous basic food rooms require the agility skill...anyway, endurance is also the go-to skill to have for wasteland exploration and quests, as higher endurance means more health for your dwellers, making them take longer to die against attacks.
CHARISMA - This skill is not important for any vault rooms OR wasteland/quest exploration, but it does improve the rate at which female dwellers can become pregnant, when putting a female and male dweller together in the living quarters; higher charisma means the whole process of becoming pregnant, talking, kissing and then becoming pregnant, goes faster, which can take a painstakingly long time if the dwellers have low charisma. 
AGILITY - Good for both rooms and combat, being good for basic food rooms (Diners and Gardens) and increases your rate of fire in combat, how often your dwellers will fire their weapons when attacking enemies.
LUCK - This one is also good for both combat and rooms, as it increases your dweller's chances of collecting loot from wasteland/quest exploration, and is good for rushing rooms, an option you can select on a room to fast-forward production and collect the supplies from it immediately; rushing, which always has the chance of backfiring, no matter how high or low dwellers' luck is - if the rushing is a success, you collect the supplies, if it fails, an incident happens in the room, such as fires or enemies popping up into the room, and the dwellers have to quickly maintain it. When you click the 'rush' button on a room, it'll say 'Chance of incident,' and show you the percentage of the chance of the incidents that could happen; the average percentage normally starts out at 30%. Each time you rush a room, the percentage goes up higher and higher, but goes back down to normal if you leave it for a while to let it refresh, after rushing once or twice. I would strongly recommend only rushing rooms when the percentage is at either 30-40%, any higher, and the chance of an incident NOT happening becomes incredibly rare. While having high luck doesn't eliminate the chance of incidents happening, it lowers the starting percentage by a huge amount, lowering the average 30% down to 10%! The lower the percentage, the more times you can rush in a row, with higher chances of success.

Cute cartoony graphics too, no blood! :)"
3814,It was fun
3815,"Vault to big, cant find money man"

3817,good game and its really fun
3818,very good
3819,"Although this game is more enjoyable on pc, I wouldn't recommend this game to people who aren't Hardcore fans of the series. Unless the overall tediousness of the raid mechanics don't bother you and you really want to be a vault overseer, don't bother getting the game"

3836,rly good big fun times
3837,"A decent time killer game
"
3838,Excellent free game!
3839,"A ton of grinding, but still a fun game for some relax time inbetween work."
3840,"Really addictive game. A cartoony version of the other Fallout games, in this one, you create a safe bunker for dwellers to make home in and get to work. You get raiders that attack every now and then which is pretty funny, because when they die, they die with crossed eyes xD
You can create interesting job bunkers, such as radio towers to call in new dwellers, armouries, weapons store, even diners. 
Yeah. games pretty fun and non violent, I recommend it for those who like strategy.

3876,"This game is fun, it lets you be the overseer of any vault, including Vault 111 which is the players Vault in Fallout 4. I've played this game for 5 hours and haven't had many problems with it. The things I like about this game are: You can make your own vault, you have references to other Bethesda games (A NPC in your vault can say ""Someone stole my sweetroll"" which is similar to a line that a guard from Skyrim has [the guard says ""let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll""]), you can also learn something about the Fallout lore (I saw my Vault Dweller that was outside of the vault say something like ""Super mutants are asexual, some were even female""), you also have to help your vault survive certain problems like a radroach infestation. There isn't anything bad about the game I can name."
3877,Basically: If EA bought bethesda.

All gone because of a crash. I've imported my save data from the cloud and it doesn't work.

This should not be a problem. I should be able to load my cloud save. I am so angry words can not even express."

For what it is i'd say its a great game it does a lot well although I wish the time progression thing was slightly altered I hate playing then having to wait like 4 hours just to do one quest that gets my vault dwellers one weapon or a random outfit. I love the childlike aesthetic and the simplicity of the game but they should have altered the game for mobile to PC. overall i would recommend to casual gamers' and people who like gaming but have a busy life style."
3909,It fallout
3910,games pretty funny when u know what to do while it does take time patience is key always try to keep your power food and water in check in order to keep your dwellers happy !

3944,"unless you have the cheat for 9999 ""FREE"" lunchboxes this game is worthless money making garbage from bitofshitye...."
3945,Pretty good little game to play while you work on stuff. Small little nitpick is that I wish the Legendary dwellers weren't just characters from Fallout 3 and Fallout 4.
3946,.
3947,"I have played this game for months. My only real issue is how saved vaults have a tendency to not autosave if your PC suddenly turns off.  So much of my progress is GONE. Aside from that, the game is pretty fun (just be wary of saving."
3948,not bad!
3949,"I zorched a couple of vaults before I figured out how to set one up to run efficiently, but now I have Mr. Handy collecting resources on each resource level so its not so annoying to click every time resources are produced. Death claw attacks are easier to manage with big rooms full of maxed out dwellers up top."

4003,Don't not spend any money on this game. My game crashed and when i booted up my game again my vault was gone and all the items that i spent money on were and gone wiped from the game completely. Do not buy any thing in this game
4004,Bread
4005,cool!
4006,meh
4007,Its ok but i think that even though junk loot was added to give another game mechanic such as crafting it diluted the loot pool alot. Also if you wanna do things right then the wait and level/gearing up between 40 vault dwellers to 50 (where deathclaws start attacking) is rather boring.

I would suggest researching this and backing up your files if you want to play seriously, or else you will lose a lot of time building up the perfect vault only to never visit it again."

It's got a great vibe and is a great game to play whilst chilling out or watching something. The quests are quite fun, they can get a bit repetitive but that's just the grind of any game really. Fun little characters were implemented to help with that and so I'd for sure give the game a good recommendation!"

4054,"A quick easy game that you can play a little over a long period of time. Sometimes its slow, but its (for the most part) pretty calm and easy."
4055,Fun clever game. If you like Fallout you will like this.
4056,"Fun little idle game, if you dont exactly like farming/idle games i wouldnt recommend it as much, i personally love to play this when I dont have the energy to play more in-depth games. I played for an additional 30 hours i think, again fun, and if you failed to keep dwellers alive try to find a 'guide to 100 dweller'
heres the link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1277145964"
4057,"Awesome game, fallout bases somewhat idle game. What i mean by ""somewhat idle game"" is that it is but its not. It has multiple things that normal idle games dont really have, for example, normal idle games are just to easy, this games wants to make sure your prepared, so it has radroaches attacks, rooms will be set on fire, raider attacks, deathclaw attacks. Its hard enough where a casual player can still take care of them! 10/10!"

4079,Fun little game to kill time it's quite luck base when it comes to opening the loot boxes sometimes you get good items and most of the time you get shit items. The Overseer quest's are interesting but it takes a long time to finish them all if you don't spend money on the speedups then again it's a free game so I don't blame them for putting it in. It's pretty much just a time wasting game lol

4081,"Game is only if you want to play casualy 1-2x day. If you want to play longer there is microtransaction time-wall. 
When i reached 100 population, ive built Nuka Cola bottling factory (which says that produces Nuka Cola). Then i found out it DOESENT actualy produce it, but instead it produces food and water. I immediately unninstalled it."
4082,Great game to drop into for 5-10 minutes unless your spending money to buy quantums. The dialogue is hilarious and the missions are interesting.
4083,Fun Game
4084,"I played this game before,although it hasn't updated for a long time,but I think it's a fantastic game.And I hope I can see some news about it in steam."
4085,Just play it.
4086,gute Partie
4087,"Game takes forever gets really boring.  then finally when you can do some kind of quest you have to take your best guys out of your vault for HOURS while they are traveling for a quest that may take minutes then hours to travel back unless you have, find, or actually pay money for Quantum so that the game sucks less.  Then they throw random calamities at your vault which would be fine but if you upgrade the rooms the calamities get way over powered so it can take HOURS again to recover.  If they reduced the times everything takes it may be worth playing.  ----- So after writing the review I kept playing and it seems most of my complaints are solved by having a more established vault and you MUST do the kappy and bottle quest to overcome the pay to play stuff.  If you survive the early stages it does get better but not much less boring and time consuming."

Our Father who art in heaven -

Let him not be tempted

As is Thy will,

Amen.

I have saved up some money -

But since you have chosen
a different path...

...you get nothing.

You will, however, get a gift.

This watch, which my father gave
to me on the day that I left home -

- I give to you, in the hope that
it will soothe your hardened heart.

And open your obstinate mind.

When, one day, you turn away
from the path to perdition -

- you will open
your misguided heart to us.

- And to Our Lord in Heaven.

4210,"fun relaxing game, can play while cooking."
4211,Unironically better than Omori's entire storyline
4212,Very good stratgey game.
4213,literally send your dwellers on missions and forget about the game for months just to open it and get addicted again i stg
4214,m..mommy what is dad doing with my sister?
4215,the f N of course Imma like this game
4216,Good fun.
4217,"fun to check up on
"
4218,.
4219,I would recommend this if you just want to pass the time and chill less stress and you get to collect the characters you like. :)
4220,fun mobile game type game play while not needing all your money to play
4221,hahaha deathclaws go cronch
4222,good
4223,K
4224,"It has its flaws and is far from a perfect game but it is a pretty good game, despite its flaws"
4225,sickk
4226,Yes
4227,Fun and simple game.
4228,am birb and i approve
4229,It's an addicting game that makes progress even while you're idle. There's something so satisfying about leveling up dwellers and building a cool vault underground. The achievements are also pretty fun to work towards.
4230,poggers
4231,"Decent game, very grindy but fairly dinamic. Quests were definitely a great addition. It's a shame it hasn't been updated further since."
4232,this good very good really good DOWNLEAD BLEASEEEE
4233,"Great game, especially for being free. I'd recommend this to anyone who just wants a relaxing game to play."
4234,My only gripe is legendary dwellers...achievement may e broken. very fun idea fallout franchise could have charged $20 at least for this.
4235,it awsome
4236,great time waster
4237,fun idle game
4238,Lots of fun to be had. Plus its free
4239,ok
4240,I think it's better than F76)
4241,:)
4242,l
4243,I love it!
4244,"Good side activity or past time, something fun to run in the background while doing work, school, etc.. Fun building game"
4245,decent
4246,Really addictive game. I have been played on android so i can play anywhere and everywhere but when i need more size screen i play on Steam. Thank you for making this game for free and hope there a new sequel such as this.
4247,This is a pretty mediocre game. It feels really repetitive and boring after a few hours of playing.
4248,still better then Fallout 76
4249,"It's a good game if you're bored af and want to waste your time! Btw I was able to hack this and have infinite Lunchboxes!
Still a great time waster!"
4250,Keeps you busy.
4251,great game!

4255,poop in toilet then pick up and smell
4256,Fun. Simple. But fun.
4257,they can make babies
4258,so boring without paying
4259,"I have named all my dwellers Gary

Worst mistake in my life O.O"
4260,"good
"
4261,"Very good game, especially for non-fallout fans."
4262,EPIC
4263,its pretty fun. it gets boring just looking at your screen for something to happen tho.
4264,THIS GAME IS PART OF A GREAT FRANCHISE THAT I'VE LOVED FOR YEARS!!!!!!!
4265,Very fun! It can give anxiety but that what makes it fun! You can go on quest!
4266,if you got patience and like games likes these its a super fun game and you will get into it i got 7 hours into the game its so much fun highly recommended
4267,"Nice, But Very Slow Gameplay"
4268,"it good
"
4269,the pregant ladies make my weewee go boing boing
4270,I play this game across three platforms. I love it.
4271,"This is a good game to play when you have a few mins to waste at a time.   It starts quickly and you can save and exit anytime without losing forward progression.  It is Awesome!  Group Hugz!

Here is a Tip:
HUGE CON!!!! There are only a few tedious things.  But the worst one is every time a lady has a kid, it takes the camera back to the top of the shelter, OMG ANNOYING MUCH!!!!!  I have 10 pregnant ladies over 40 floors and you click on one lade screen goes to the top of the shelter, scroll all the way back down click on the next lady and repeat!  Make sure you put a living quarters near the top of the shelter so you can move all your Mom's to be to the top, it is a pain because they have the stats for the job, but he scrolling back and forth is a bigger pain."
4272,:(
4273,"it guud
"
4274,game good
4275,..
4276,Very nice 9/10
4277,"I dont know, man. a vault full of maxed out stats with best armor and guns STILL CANT KILL A SINGLE RADSCORPION?!

a bit sus. not gonna lie."
4278,One of my favorite games. I like to spend hours in a shelter with my dwellers.
4279,very good
4280,fun
4281,keemstar
4282,very fun game to play when bored
4283,"A fun fallout game, the animation style is unique and the gameplay is really addicting. The sad part is the micro transactions. i recommend it if you are bored or just need a side project."
4284,"its the same game, still super addictive"
4285,"Dull, repetitive, uninspiring, no new content, easy to glitch for perks."
4286,This game was so good :)
4287,so far it fun
4288,[eq
4289,"A free to play bunker tycoon kind of game with the Fallout franchise attached to it. It's fun, but slow by design so you are more tempted to buy things with real money to speed up or enhance your gaming experience. Not typically the type of game I would play but you can avoid buying things and still have fun."
4290,took so long to 100%

4292,Good game<3
4293,"Ya know I have heard great things about this game. So I tried it out, but this game just wasn't fun I had played it for like 2 days and enjoyed it for a bit, but then it just got boring and there a much better games out there. I highly don't recommend this game."
4294,this game told me to turn my pp into pretzel
4295,i think this is a good filler game it has the right amount of afk and adventure sure its not like your regular fallout game but it still has the same feeling of one in my opinion 10/10
4296,"why, of course my vault is number 69. How did you know?"
4297,"This game is pretty fun, send your survivors out, send your survivors out BUT FOR MISSIONS, and gain a gambling addiction"
4298,cheating is fun
4299,The Fallout spin on the typical management base building game and its great! This game has its unique features for being a fallout game like exploring the wasteland and leveling characters stats. Its free and while it has microtransactions they aren't pushed. So give it a try
4300,Great in/out time killing fun.
4301,very kool
4302,Game Crashed and my save and hard work are now both gone.
4303,"I originally played this on mobile and loved it, though obviously it leaned towards pay to play. This version on Steam is way better. And while its fun, it still has some pay to play aspects to it. Though if you don't pay, it doesn't take ages to get anything done thankfully. If you ever get your vault  filled up then you probably have hit the pointy of ""Been there, done that"" and may not play anymore. Still worth a play though. Good for when you want to play quick sessions (well given it came from mobile)."
4304,If you love fallout you should play Game show gauntlet quest
4305,"It's free and a decent game!
The rush feature is a bit strange though. Seems to fail 50% of the time regardless what the % it shows to you is
"
4306,"good
"
4307,"i got this game like 2 days ago not even and its so nice , it is a super nice game to have run in the background or overnight , its not a game you gotta play all day every day to get somewhere which i love!"
4308,is epic i like it. i don't like long wait times but it's an idle game for the most part so no other complaints
4309,very nice old timey music is fun
4310,"The perfect game to play when you really just want to watch a TV show or a podcast or something, its very sit back and watch and most fallout players will probably get a kick out of it. DO NOT PAY for anything on the store though a simple insert to a website can give you anything you could possibly want. Really just a ported mobile game but not bad for one, but if it runs on a phone how good can it be? As a mobile game 7.5/10"
4311,never leave running
4312,i got piper in a lunchbox and all i can say is... legalise synths
4313,i use a save file editor for free shit :)
4314,"Fun game when you cant buy or pay money for any other games

4323,"Best Fallout of all time. Better than Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas, and 4."
4324,"The game is good, but can get tiring at times due to the limited game mechanics. UI and controlling your dwellers is an absolute headache without a mouse & even then wrangling the camera to do what you want it to do is a pain. Love the legendary dwellers though!"
4325,very relaxing and fun game
4326,"Overall the game is fine i guess but I have several issues.

1:
Being a completionist and completing this game is hell in order to get one achievement you basically have to spend money or spend thousands of hours to get it legit as it requires loot boxes in order to get the drop needed and playing for several hours a day every day you can realistically only get 1-5 a week which seems fine until you realise you need hundreds of loot boxes in order to unlock 20 legendary dwellers.

2:
Save files being corrupted is a real issue that still has not been fixed nor do I think there will ever be a permanent fix. at any given time your game could decide to crash and end up deleating or corrupting your save file which means ALL PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE IS GONE AS WELL AS ANY REWARDS FROM LOOT BOXES WILL BE GONE AS WELL, meaning that even if you spent money to speed up progress it could all be lost at an instant. This has happened to me twice just this year alone.

3: Combat is boring and is not intuitive. In game combat is just a stat check;if you have the hp/damage to kill something you win if not you die. On top of this how a dwellers S.P.E.C.I.A.L affects combat makes no sense and is not explained. If a player has to create a tutorial outside of the game for you then you have done something clearly wrong. (For example the E in special stands for Endurance and it effectively increases the max hp of a dweller, but because the UI in the game is trash there is pretty much no way to know this because the bar doesn't change in size nor is there a numarical value for you to know it changed, its just a bar. The only way to ever know that increasing endurance even does anything is to try and set up tests to try and figure out if a dweller with higher E loses a lesser % of their healthbar than one with lower endurance. AND ON TOP OF ALLL THIS there's a hidden mechanic that completely changes a dwellers hp. If you equip an outfit onto a dewller that increases their E then every time they level up they GAIN EVEN MORE HP. Which turns out that this mechanic is extremly important for late game as its pretty much one of the only ways to survive the highest level bosses, but if you didnt know about this mechanic you would get stuck in endless death cycles not understanding why you cant progress because of a hidden mechanic that is not stated anywhere in the game. And that was just 1 of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L Traits that a dweller can have and all of them have either poorly explained mechanics (That you can't tell the differnce of increaseing it or decreasing it because of the UI but Ill get to that) or mechanics that are just not explained at all

4: The USER INTERFACE (UI)
Dear god is the interface garbage. The interface in this game seems to be desinged to hide as much information as possible for some god forsaken reason. as stated in my section a dwellers HP is near impossible to tell you never know how much hp is left or how much max hp you have because there is no numaricle value or even a percentage all you have is a tiny green bar that slowly depleats as you take damage. for other SPECIAL stats you have no way to know how it affects your dweller in combat because the UI does not give such information. Want to know how your Strength affects your chances on being able to open loot? too bad you dont get to know, now what about Perception is there somthjing in the HUD or UI that shows you your chances of gaining a critical hit? too bad, what about Agility?  did the developers bother to put in a number on the UI that shows how it affects/what yourt current attack speed is? of course not because designing a good UI is aparently too much.

5: User Interface continued
Now to talk about Actual combat, when you are in combat there are two ""types"" of damage you can take normal damage that just decreases ur hp and can be increased with a stimpack and radiation damage which decreases your max hp and is shown with a red bar slowly encroching on your hp bar, this can be removed with rad away. Now heres the problem once your dweller hits a certain threshhold a clickable button appears where you can fix theMOST RECENT THRESH HOLD HIT meaning if you had say 30% hp the button for a stimpack appears and clicking it heals u and say when 70% radiation the rad away button will appear now what happens if the health button appears but then you hit the radiation threshhold? well now the rad away button appears meaning YOU CANNOT HEAL YOUR DWELLER and in late game where enemies do massive damage this stupid  bug will kill hundreds of your dwellers as they will get 1 shot before u can heal them because the time it takes for the heal button to come back they're allready dead. 

This game is alright but it has wayyyyyyy tooo many issues with basic gameplay  and gamebreaking bugs with the lack of a proper tutorial for most aspects of combat being non existant. This game has been out for years and they still have not fixed game breaking things or even bothered to make the UI better when all they would need to do is add some numbers, now if all u wanted was to see what being an overseer would have been like than try it out, but i repeat DO NOT SPEND MONEY BECAUSE U CAN LOSE A SAVE FILE AT ANY TIME!!!!!"
4327,very fun
4328,gud gam
4329,"Es ist immer noch KOSTENLOS und ich hoffe f√ºr immer. Du kannst ""Pay to Win"", aber es ist immer noch ein Solo/Local-Spiel. Baue deine eigene Vault, k√§mpfe gegen Raider und lasse deine Bewohner wachsen. Erledige Quests, baue Waffen und R√ºstungen, rette dein √ñdland/Commonwealth f√ºr deine Bev√∂lkerung. Es ist ein ziemlich nettes Spiel f√ºr Ihre kostenlosen Minuten / Stunden."
4330,Loved It SOOOOO Good!
4331,nice
4332,"This isn't a very in-depth game, in fact it's closer to an idle once you eventually hit that point (in these games) were you can no longer freely use your resources. You have three survival resources: power, food, and water. Power is your only real concern, it's not really a survival game. There are raids, missions, and exploring. Raids are fairly easily defended (upgrade your vault door ASAP or station 2 people there permanently), but it's a slight on the game that you can only have 2 people in your vault door area even though Raiders can have 3. Missions unlock after you place a certain building and the ability to run multiple at once is walled behind your dweller (population) count. Exploring can be done at any time, but if send them for too long w/o the proper stim-packs or rad-packs (heals/cures radiation) they'll die and you'll be forced to pay $ to revive them (Mr. Handy's do not die).

Overall it's a fun relaxing game but is limited... once you beat it there's no real reason to play again. Fun for a few weeks or months, but not really much of a game. If you spend too much in the in-game store you'll rush the game and it won't be as exciting. Part of the fun is slowly gearing your people with gear you find / craft / unlock yourself. Though it doesn't hurt buying Mr. Handy packs or Pet packs -- they don't really add much to the game ""cheat"" wise."
4333,"good game, :v"
4334,Becomes hard to manage
4335,well done Bethesda
4336,Surprisingly additive
4337,i cant flip!!!
4338,better than 76
4339,"Overall fun gameplay, simple, but nice sound and graphics.
Unfortunately the nice experience is ruined by the clunky interface - managing the day-to-day activities in a larger vault is a slog, taking away much of the fun and turning the game into a nasty chore. The whole interface layout is very prone to miss clicks, un-selectable buttons at times and obscured objects,
To even greater frustration the game is absolutely unforgiving sometimes, throwing very tough monsters at the player at times when resources are scares and dwellers are in bad condition.
The Fallout game series is is one of my all time favorites, I've got several hundred hours on the mobile version. Try as I might, but I couldn't really love this one. Every time my vault develops further and the game begins to unfold all its good sides, I get mauled into submission by the unfair monster waves while the whole game interface makes it even harder to resist the destruction.
Technical and gameplay issues set this Fallout tittle at the very bottom of my liked games from the series."

4341,just change the time on your clock lol

me : 696
friend : hmm simple number?
me : just u know"
4348,"Nice game to keep running in the background during work and take breaks more often by checking up on it.üëç
Also, these dwellers feel like pets, like playing Tomagachi from the 90's."
4349,repetitive
4350,Lacks mod support and other nice updates that would improve vault management etc... also the space for your fault is quite small...Feel free to hit me up Bethesda for suggestions that could make the game much nicer :D
4351,"has some issues, but overall a fun ant farm like game"
4352,"I think it's a really good and inspirational game to play, when you first get into the game you will be met by lots of action and also a group of black guys will fuck a younger girl, and she seems to like it (also called gangbang)
all in all a very good game and it's pretty kogeren"
4353,after playing this for about four hours and putting about 20 dollars into it and was doing great. but the game crashed and deleted my save file and all the purchases with it.

"
4364,yes I find it fun
4365,"Pretty great for a free game based around civilization building. However, since it takes a while for some things to finish i.e. quests and weapon/outfit making, it's more of an idle game that you casually check in on than something you would have open for hours."
4366,haha funne men big bomb oh noo haha underground fallout yay!!
4367,game relly slow
4368,very boring game.

4370,"Despite some annoying and deeply unclear instructions at times (that lead one to think the game is bugged), it is somehow--as seemingly stupid as this is to write--more engaging than Fallout 4.  

In summary:  an annoying, charming consumer of time."

4377,"Surprisingly addictive. 

Clearly this game was designed for smartphone use but I've only played it on PC. In that format, there is so much to watch. Shrunken down to handheld size it must be a bear and a half to handle. I can imagine the folks watching people play this on their phones. They saw people with hands trembling, sputtering expletives with occasional yelps of victory or frustration, eyes glued to the screen. I'm sure they hoped that insanity wasn't contagious. Especially at work. 

After 500 hours I believe I'm finally done. I've got my sanity back. 
I know how people live for Sims now. They're nuts. I've been there."

4383,its alright

4385,great time killer and much more fun on pc then phone
4386,+1
4387,Fun little game very addictive
4388,bomb
4389,"Back when fallout shelter first came out I had it on my old ass phone. That phone ended up getting destroyed and I lost my 200 dweller vault with a number of legendary things in it. 

I decided to get back into it when I saw it on steam some years later. I check into it every day at this point, cause' I don't date forward my computer and what else am I going to stare at, while doing nothing in particular?

I recommend it. The microtransactions aren't invasive at all, and it's not the app version where you can get everywhere by watching an ad."
4390,really good game kinda addicting played it about 4 hours
4391,Fun and easy way to pass the time.
4392,"Fun pass time game, love the esthetic... not something u'd play as ur main game tho, just some fun on the side."
4393,cool
4394,"Good game, and I found a way to get pretty much anything by editing the files."
4395,You can make people have sex. 10/10
4396,"no food for you
"
4397,good game.
4398,The resource availability is balanced well. I also like the art design and the sound design. I would prefer if there was a selection of music. Also the feature to grab multiple dwellers at once in a drag and drop feature would make gameplay much more enjoyable. Quests take an annoying amount of time to complete.
4399,Yes.
4400,Bethesda
4401,"still never get bored of this game. been playing it in my phone since the releases, and now coming back to it on pc. bruh the nostalgia

kind of good to kill times while watching your dweller making bebe and fighting roaches lmao"
4402,FO Shelter is fun for casual gaming. It's interesting to go on quests and collect new weapons. It's nice just to pass the time.
4403,"Fallout Shelter is probably one of the best clickers out there. It has some pretty interesting quests and a lot of flavour from the Fallout universe. However, I am giving it negative rating because the quests take too long to engage with, the micro-transactions are egregious and one of the achievements requires you too spend lots and lots of money on Lootboxes, which is simply not acceptable.

Feel free to check this game out (it is free), but be aware that the achievements are not fun to collect and you'll probably get bored after a couple of hours."
4404,OK
4405,its really fun
4406,"It shouldn't be good but besides a few small times where it wants money, it is very fun! A bunker style game that isn't annoying but isn't complicated. Simple, and fun."
4407,3r5
4408,"class
"
4409,if you feel tired this game is perfect. Doesnt take much energy to play and is pretty fun
4410,much like fallout 4 this game desperately needs a stability update because it crashes every 5 minutes.
4411,one of my top idle games
4412,"Do you like getting Radscorpions constantly? This is the game for you! Now with faster dying dwellers, and power output reduced to 200% per every radscorpion! All your stimpaks gone as well GUARANTEED!"
4413,"it good,it fun"
4414,"I like how it's simple. You're building a vault, upgrading it, helping the vault dwellers to grow, develop, have relationships and families too."
4415,"cool
"
4416,Eh its free
4417,its good
4418,"The game's fun to play and all, but I've experienced some pretty big problems with the game. 

First; You can only have 3 separate groups go out on quests. I have so many vault dwellers either staying inside the vault and have them max out their S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats or have them go out and explore to occupy them. I want to have more than 3 groups out for quests so that I won't be staring at the screen for hours doing completely nothing.

Second; There is way too much unused space in the building area. With me, being someone who makes my vault organized with each floor consist of 2 3-room-merged rooms, 1 2-merged room, and 2 elevators in between them, I managed to max out my vault to 200 vault dwellers while I still have room to spare. Unfortunately, it gave me about more than 8 completely unused floors for my vault, and I have absolutely no idea on what I should use it for. I'm sure a lot of people would say that I should fill all of that space with storage rooms. Really? 8 floors consisting of nothing but storage rooms? Not only will that make the electricity production be through the roof but I don't see myself in need of that much storage space. I want to be given a reason to use all of the remaining space that I have. I wouldn't even mind having more vault dwellers in my vault. This also brings me to my next problem with the game.

Third; The vault dweller cap. Why only 200? Why not bump it up to about 250 (or even have it be as high as you want it, as long as you have the room for it), in order to have all of the empty space in the building area be of use. I wanted this game where you not only have to worry about raids, infestations, and lacking resources, but overpopulation too. It would make the game a lot more interesting."
4419,get mods
4420,9/10
4421,"Can only have 200 people, and then the rest have to stand outside, and it congests the people who are coming back from exploration"
4422,"A fun little game to pass the time, although I wish the NGD still had legendaries."
4423,Simple instructions and easy to understand. Also very addictive-
4424,"i have to recommend it, cmon its fallout"
4425,Nice game of mindless clicking.
4426,Its fun.
4427,"Its bad,like literally, its a mobile port."
4428,"After surviving the crop famine of the winter, my fault was ambushed by not one, but two Deathclaw raids right after the other. Everything that I worked for was wiped away in the blink of an eye by reptilian killing machines. 10/10 recommend this game to everyone"
4429,"If love was radiation, I'd need a box of Radaway"
4430,"It's a decent time-waster puzzle game. With a few tweaks, it could be turned into a classic. I'm surprised Bethesda doesn't release a patch for the PC version that puts it into ""classic"" territory. 

Some obvious stuff to fix (off the top of my head):
The worst design decision is that it cannot be paused. 
The UI is clunky/fiddly in some places, which becomes more annoying with the clock ticking and no room for ""dammit, I want to see Molly's stats!"" Considering how often you have to check stats to see who should go where, for example, it seems kinda weird that the UI is ill-suited to this task.
Attacking raiders don't seem to kill or loot, which seems kinda dumb. People ran into the base and attacked structures but didn't disable anything, attacked people but didn't really hurt them, won and left without taking anything."
4431,"Great little time waster. Does a great job at offering a Fallout spin off, build a shelter, send people out exploring and level and gear them up. You also don't need to spend a cent in progressing in it."
4432,"its just good 
"
4433,"Good game. Highly recommend. For a free game, it is amazing."
4434,Quite interesting
4435,crashes on launch
4436,"It's fun for what it is and as a little F2P game on the Steam better than most. It's a clock game where everything you want to do will take hours or days and is a bit of a frustration engine as invariably anything you want to just bop in, start new cycles cycling around the clock and improve things a smidgen gets interrupted by some attack that after awhile is no threat but just a time sink as you wait for the baddies to croak so you can get on with things.  The other icky bit is you're essentially running a eugenics program as you kick out all your original dwellers as you train up all your new babies to have full stats and maximum Endurance at level one so that when you level them up to 50 they'll have max hit points.  Finally, a lot of the campaign quests become lying and deceiving the baddies to infiltrate their bases and acquire info tidbits, which yeah is some variety from ""we're from Vault Luke Skywalker and we're here to rescue you"" of most of the quests but ostensibly you're creating a Vault of the Nazis comfortable with the ends justifying the means.   Or at least I did.  It's easy enough that a run where you keep all Vault Dwellers and never lie seems doable so I might just wrap up and shelve my Nazi Vault and try a Truth and Justice Superman Vault and see how that goes.  Might fail a few quests that way, I just hope it's not a chain breaker and that the game lets me proceed with the campaign where not lying and having to fight ALL the baddies because it's a no lie run still lets me finish the quest challenges and unlock the next leg of the campaign.  If you like building up little bases and equipping up your toons you'll dig it as for challenge, it's more frustrationsauce in lieu of challenging.  Cheers!"
4437,"[i]Fallout Shelter[/i] is not as bad as some people say. It's a good game to boot up from time to time in order to control your vault or play it while watching something on the other screen. If you're patient you can have fun without spending no money whatsoever.

4449,It is a fun game.
4450,"A great time killer for those times when there's nothing else going on, fills the hole."
4451,nice
4452,"Surprisingly addictive time-sink. Mixed feeling... The gameplay is boring and repetitive, the pace is barely acceptable not to give up, controls clumsy, but nevertheless I keep checking on it every day. It's probably about hoarding loot and maxing out, upgrading everything, etc."
4453,pog
4454,"I played it only for 27 hours and one day my vault was gone. Just like that, like it was never there. I googled the issue of course, found out it's rather common issue (mind blowing that Bethesda hasnt resolved it after so many years??!!!), and that there isn't really any 100% working way to get my vault back. I can't be bothered to keep looking, don't care But it certainly WILL influence my purchasing decisions in the future: why risk money buying stuff from the company that can't even save their own games properly? Such shame, as Fallout is of course the legendary game, but greed again won :("

4484,I like this game a lot. It is a fun and simple time waster for when you are bored. There are a few flaws like how my dwellers will randomly decide that working is not worth it anymore but the pros outweigh the cons. The game is good and I feel like it is a fun pick up and play game. 8/10

4486,"THIS GAME IS FREE AND FUN
"
4487,"I'm still playing hahahahaha

4488,A fun little time waster so long as you don't dump money into Bethesda's never-ending pit of cash. Just stick to playing daily.
4489,This game doesn't hold up good when the player has to wait in real time to make progress(howsoever little).
4490,"fun
free
good"
4491,It's fallout shelter... just download it
4492,good
4493,"Honestly, I enjoy this game and it can be challenging at times. I think that people that only have around 9-15 hours in the game definitely haven't finished the game ( unless p2w but then that wouldn't be as fun or challenging I think ) and/or one of their vaults've died. The times where you do quests and send people to the wasteland is pretty neat as well, mostly quests though since you actually get to interact with something there. Also if you don't manage resources well then your vault is kind of screwed too. I remember I used to play this on my Ipad a couple years back and I had around, say 60 dwellers? And afterwards my whole vault was destroyed by a couple of deathclaws :( . It's a great time killer and it can be a thing to play when you're really bored and I don't really get bored of playing it. I'd give this game a solid rating of 7.7/10."
4494,its alr
4495,"Ok game
This game is ok, its just to hard for me though.
Maybe im just bad at the game... Still, a game not for everyone but still worth trying!"

4520,It's a very fun and simple game. You can put real money into the game but it's not required. All you need is some patience. Especially early on and then your Vault will be running like a well oiled machine.
4521,"yes - but:

4570,all my women dwellers are pregnant please help
4571,Addicting and very fun. Best combo
4572,A base building-like game! If you have the patience and like to grind then this is a game for you! I've had hours of fun and continue to send my dwellers into the vast lands of the Apocalypse. Upgrading the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. helps out of ton and working on getting better weapons/outfits. Merging rooms and upgrading the essentials (Power/Food/Water)  is a good idea to start out with. Make sure to put your dwellers into the correct rooms for better efficiency. Happy slaying

4586,I have played this game on a couple other platforms and I still very much enjoy it. It is a great idle game for lovers of the Fallout series. The creators incorporate characters from their games as well as other wonderful dialogue to enjoy for however long you play.
4587,chill game for filling your useless timeXD
4588,The best micro-transactional game.

4674,"Nice to play while watching something. This game definitely has the Fallout flair, the missions are quite fun and it's a pretty easy to learn. Most tasks need some time though, so it's normal to play for like 10-15 minutes every 5 hours. Can recommend it!"
4675,It fun
4676,Very good GAYM
4677,"It's not a bad game but you need to spend a bit of time to build it up your vault so it can function for long periods of time unattended. If you don't you're gonna come back hours later to a disaster zone you need to repair, which can feel tedious."

4682,very gud game kinda like mobile game but pc vibe good shit to play when your queing for like lets say an overwatch game or just passing time and something to check up on every now and then. I say every single person should get this game cause its free and try it out so if you don't like it you can just uninstall no harm done.
4683,Its kinda cheesy and easy for the most part.    Keep your layout simple  the dwellers are on the extra stupid side.    Its pretty much designed to be played for a few minutes at a time every like 12-24 hours..   Since its free give it a shot if your bored.   It be a better game if the dev's had actually tried a little more there's some really annoying  simple things that  make the game less enjoyable then it could be.  You can scroll through other reviews to read about what those things are.
4684,good to burn time
4685,Fun game to keep you from dying of lack of games
4686,"Had this game on the phone, later on ps4 and now on pc, this Game is a drug xD"
4687,good game!
4688,ive played for a little bit but overall i say that its ok
4689,"I like it just dont buy packs 
"
4690,Had a vault of 100 residents then 3 OP deathclaws broke in and wiped them out. FFS
4691,A shameless cash grab
4692,penis
4693,a little satisfaction for more fallout cravings
4694,"Well its good fun, satisfying, well done etc. but if you want to play it like its any other comparable game , then prepare to spend a lot of real ¬£/$

Yes, 'technically' most content is not completely locked behind a pay wall (At least as far as I got) , but everything is 'time wall-ed?' You quickly get to a point where you've built everything, upgraded everything that you can from free content, and in order to progress from there you need to take on harder expeditions outside your vault. The thing is, even basic 'short' excursions at this point take several hours of IRL time before they begin/end; if you forget to buy/dont buy enough stimpaks/radaways before you send your people out, the expedition is a complete loss and you either lose your guys and their equipment, or cancel the trip and have to wait irl hours to try another one.

I enjoyed the game a lot up to 17 hours or so and then realised that it was either spend ¬£5/$7+ per play session or give up. I chose the latter. If you're one of those people who can/like to play 'background' games throughout a day, while doing something else; you'll probably love this game and its absolutely for you. If however you like to binge games and play solid 2-4 hour sessions after work or on a day off, dont bother."
4695,"fun little fallout game, it‚Äôs fine. plus it‚Äôs free"

4701,good game :D
4702,"A game just interesting enough to keep playing. Once I have one of everything and all my Vault Dwellers are maxed out, I'm not really sure what motivation I'll have to continue playing nor do I see myself replaying the game. Definitely a once and done, unless they release new content which seems unlikely."
4703,"Its a f2p idle game, you know what you're getting."
4704,"i mean its alright, its not the type of game i would play for hours at a time, but its good for a few minutes every day or so"

4714,"Very fun and addicting, would totally recommend to anyone who likes the Fallout series or just anyone who wants to have a lot of fun!"
4715,meh
4716,It's a great game with fun stuff to do and build but survival and expansion games become boring and loose interest of players when they have to wait in real time to complete a task or get new dwellers after playing just few minutes I realized I have to wait 3 hours to get a dweller to have a baby and another 3 hour for then to grow and work which makes it difficult and boring to keep up with the game. It became a waste of time and even after games of these category are my favorite after playing this it became the only game I hate.
4717,I LIKE GAME
4718,It's a alright game if you like farming but there was a couple stuff it could improve like tips on how to play the game when your really far in the game and don't know what to fix or do
4719,Its better than Fallout 76
4720,"good free game to waste some time, and MAN wasteland music ""gas station"" is pretty GOOD"
4721,very good game you can spend your life for nothing and I like that cuz I dont have much to do right now due to a problem in my right leg and now I can play this game and be better.
4722,its almost like choose your own adventure meets RPG.....but PC style....
4723,"This game is highly suitable for home schooling. Just run the game, click some resources and allocate some dwellers. Focus your thoughts on being a good student while gaining some resources and begetting some thicc dwellers."

I dont care about your fucking store"

4738,I played this in lessons at school.
4739,i am obamium and this is my favorite game
4740,"The game is the best of it's kind in my opinion, it can be fun and rewarding. But the waiting can deter me from playing the game at all. The only reason I would recommend this title is because it's free and you've got nothing to lose."
4741,git gud
4742,"A fun simple game at the start, there is plenty of room for growing into the more challenging aspects of it's end game design where a significant amount of fun is to be had. You don't have to buy anything, but the starter packs are probably worth it if you're really into this game and love getting to the points of doing quests sooner rather than later, especially if you enjoy the challenge of survival mode. In any case, a great small time investment or distraction to have running at odd times in the background as a reward for study or work pursuits. Worth your time and energy if you enjoy these kinds of games and this is the type of game that would make you fall for these types of games. Criticism? Could be more complex...? Bloody good deal for a free game though that only has in game purchases as an option. If you read up on technique and want to play this more intensely, I believe you will find there is absolutely no need to buy anything in order to complete this game on even the hardest settings. Just get gud. It ain't that hard."
4743,it's just. really addicting i guess
4744,It's a good game.
4745,"good
"
4746,"It is a fun game if you want to pass a bit of time. A very passive game that can be challenging in regards to upgrading the underground bunker. Overall it is an okay game. Glad it's free, I would not spend money on it."
4747,very nice always something to do
4748,gets boring if you stay on it too long this is a play for 10 mins every 6 hours
4749,Its alright. Needs more gore.

4752,We need Chinese ! ! !  PLEASE

4754,Great little game to play while you patch other games or don't want to get into running dailies or quests on other games.
4755,"its free, a good game to check up on through out the day, not the most fun"
4756,"With ample time on this game, Fallout Shelter truly astounds me as an inexplicable joy. The subtle, yet intricately beautiful elements of this game rocked me to the absolute core like no other game had before: implementations of real-time elements, base building, resource management, and workforce direction seemed to hold itself at the top of its craft. Not once in my years have I encountered a game that so beautifully weaves these aspects together into a seemingly abstract form of art. What initially begins as a willful endeavor for survival quickly and elegantly manifests into a contemporary marvel of thriving video game design. Fallout Shelter's pacing, story, game mechanics, and soundtrack all amalgamate to create a game unrivaled in its industry.

The award-winning game's story is written with inspirations from epics - it is pristine from the story's exposition that this game borrows from previous successes; John Green's ""The Fault in Our Stars"" (referencing the game's amorous yet passionate romance developments as an enduring mechanic), Angie Thomas' ""The Hate U Give"" (playing into social contexts of racism and sexism as encountered within a much culturally diverse setting), and Dr. Seuss' ""The Lorax"" (a riveting allusion to climate change) are all notable sources that foster Fallout Shelter's compelling narrative. The game utilizes widely-used mechanics in terms of pacing, but adds impressive twists to ensure that my experience as a consumer is unparalleled whatsoever. Fallout Shelter's soundtrack is the ultimatum as a final impression: albeit not being the centerpiece of this game's immersive feel, it rather serves as a reminder of the brutalities of apocalypse; a reminder, of sorts, of the very real world outside. While this tampers with my personal experience - it wakes me out of my ethereal, paradisaical slumber, yet concurrently is a beguiling aesthetic.

If I were to sum Fallout Shelter in one sentence, I would put it forth as an entrancing, once-in-a-lifetime take on mortality that delivers skillfully. To be framed as a contemporary classic, Bethesda's Mona Lisa sets forth a higher standard for the entire video game industry."
4757,yeah
4758,"This is one of those free to play games that showed up on my phone once and I spent so many hours just grinding the levels, It can be a fun little distraction that doesn't have to take more than 20 minutes a day. 
However, this is not a recommendation as an Idle game, as there it has several events that make you want to stay just a few more minutes. This could be anything like a visit from some mystery man or an attack on your people. Its a super fun game though"
4759,great fun not easy to keep up.... not a major need to pay to play
4760,Addictive game deceptively simple. Has some depth of play you don't always see right away.

4768,its cute and enterianting
4769,"This game is pretty fun..
Sorta grindy and annoying at times,
but a bit boring and repetitive afterwards...."
4770,"It's a mobile game that can be played on a computer, but doesn't paywall its content. So with that in mind, it's an excellent game to occasionally check in on and slowly build your Vault. It's consistent with the Fallout lore. If you like Fallout then you will most likely enjoy this."
4771,doesnt have big monke but has bold people
4772,It's better as a mobile game

4786,You've got to play this!
4787,"Cute distraction from the main Fallout series, but to be honest, this game is better on a phone. It's pretty fun, but there's a lot of waiting around. 7/10."
4788,"so much fun,  8.5 out of ten for me
"
4789,"overall review : 

Positive :
- Good game for killing time
- Can be quite fun and challenging 
- Gameplay is simple yet need a bit of planning and strategy. 

Negative :
- You only get 4 lunchbox at the beginning from finishing tasks and about 1 per week from daily login. After that, you have to be lucky to get tasks that give out lunchboxes. Unless you buy in cash
- The mysterious guy is hard to locate, and harder as your vault is getting larger. 
- Dwellers literally stopped coming after hitting 18 population, you have to either breed or use the radio room. Which means putting your dwellers out of their work in the meanwhile.
- Lunchbox is too random, but one item that is guaranteed : junk. You are guaranteed to get 1 junk every lunchbox but not armor or weapon... so if you're unlucky (like me), you'll get no weapon or armor from the first 4-5 lunchboxes and had to retry. 
- Gets boring after hitting 40-50 population, because you basically repeat everything you've done since the beginning. Sending out dwellers for quests is the only saving grace... but most of them took too long (could go from 1 hours to flat out a whole day). 

Overall rating : 3.5/10"
4790,"Good game to chill out

4795,"Good in you like resource/time management. Probably better to get the phone app though, if you aren't constantly on the computer, or you're a casual."

4801,"I love the game, really.. but wth is with this game breaking bug? 
Almost at the end game, done all but 1 quest, and btw also spend some to cola, mr handy, and lunch boxes. Then a power outage while playing.. now it seems my save file is broken, and there's no way to recover it, even using the cloud save.. 
It's just sad this is still not addressed, checking online with all the complaints, I see with the same issue.
What's the use of cloud save as backup if no one can use it..?
Well it's been fun, I like it, playing from time to time reduce stress.. Sad I can't really recommend this.."

4805,A fair game useful for your spare time. Just make sure not to leave it alone for too long or else an event will trigger. A nice addition to the fallout series.

4852,yes
4853,yes
4854,well it is very fun. some may have some questions that the game doesn't cover like it takes 3hrs IRL for a dweller to have a child and another 3 for the child to grow. an i am sure the best thing is that it is such a great game and it is 110% free. with the exclusion of in game transactions. So if it is a free good game you are looking for or just a fallout game while you save for fallout 4 or 76 this game is amazing
4855,"Yo this game is so grinding yet I cant fxxking stop playing. I almost finished all the quest, every time I logged in I spent an hour to manage the inventory space, I'm practically just wasting my time but I finally overcome myself and uninstalled this mobile game alike piece of crap today.  Still recommand people to try though."
4856,"I recommend it with a citation. Just don't bother spending money in it. The FSSE mod is essential for making it more enjoyable. Any purchases  you make will inevitably glitch out and make you lose money. No refunds can be made because it will send you in an infinite loop of steam asking you to contact bethesda and vice versa.

Just get Fallout Shelter Save Editor and itll be a great experience"
4857,very enjoyable experience how the hell is this free!
4858,"The only time this game was fun is when I was using cheats, soooo it is a good game."

4860,good game 9/10
4861,Lost my whole vault......
4862,Had a vault of 100 residents then 3 OP deathclaws broke in and wiped them out. FFS
4863,"This is a really enjoyable point & click / idle game in the fallout universe, which is packed full of content. You definitely do not need to pay for anything to advance as you have an objectives system and quests where you can earn lunchboxes, pets and nuka-cola.

The dialogue can be seriously funny with some good references, there's lots of outfits and weapons to craft too. It's a great game to chip away at and have fun with, there's also a good range of achievements to complete for the completionists out there.

A couple of things I would love to see added to the mechanics would be a 'Harvest all' button when all your supplies are ready to collect, instead of having to click each singular room. Furthermore it would be brilliant if you could alter your room layout without having to destroy the rooms and re-buy them for maximum caps, this is especially annoying when you've fully upgraded your rooms.

Overall I would highly recommend this as non-time consuming game which is completely free and does not require you to spend real money to advance."
4864,mmm
4865,"not bad

4866,Redownloaded this game and remembered how much this game sucks ass.

And then the game decided at this point i am not allowed to play anymore, and just straight up collapse whenever i press ""Enter vault"". So yeh, if you plan to spend money in the game, just keep in mind that they will stop you from continue playing at one point

4880,fun for a point and click game its tough getting attacked offfline
4881,"its fun, it eats up time. briefly...  but once you really get going the death claw attacks happen every 5 minutes and then the game shifts from building up a vault to reviving your dwellers and robots.  seriously, at a certain point all of your time and resources are spent to recover from the never ending deathclaw attacks.  i think theres more in this game than in fallout 4 itself and once it becomes obnoxious, its not fun at all anymore.

update approximately 6 hours of playtime after a long break, its fun.  thats really what counts."
4882,Runs no better than the phone version. Is fun enough as a side game but play it too long and the stinginess comes through. Random attacks will spawn frequently and if you don't have enough weapons/healing/radpacks for everyone you better be prepared to pay to respawn your characters. These'll add up so in the end it feels like it'd be better investing time elsewhere.
4883,Free to play and very adicting.

Wouldn't recommend anyone putting a lot of time in the game unless they like starting over from scratch over and over again. There shouldn't be any reason that a game loses all its data. If you spend money, prepare to lose it all."

4957,"Good game 

Calm and simple game . whenever i was bored i was used to play this game . It has a simple thing to do , Do task , produce food , water , electricity and protect your shelter . But in the quiz they ask questions that i never heard , i think to answer that quiz you have to be some knowladge of other fallout games 

But sometimes game wipes your all saves . so you have to start it all again 


i can give 8 scores out of 10 :)"
4958,"The game wipes your saves and all your work all the time, and you have to dig through and dig through your fallout shelter files and fix it yourself and save your game by yourself. Because the ingame save option doesn't work."

5003,"The real game is developing strategies to progress without having to open up your wallet and spent your hard earned money on Bethesda micro-transactions.

Even if you succeed in not paying Bethesda, it will spite you by disrespecting your time.

Hey do you want to do some Questing? That'll be 6 quantums or 10 hours real time.
Hey do you want to craft a legendary weapon? That'll be 30 quantums or 7 days real time.
Hey do you want to train SPECIAL faster? That'll be 4 quantums or 6 hours real time.

The game will try to screw you over every opportunity it gets like delaying level up on dweller when the exp bar is full or spawn deathclaws or radscorpions when you re-enter the game.

Don't get me started on Radscorpions spawning in your vault, the consequences behind the Radscorpion is such cancer that it has more damage, health, radiation than bosses in the game and your store of electricity will completely vanish, what a joke."

5010,"Fallout Shelter is a free game where you simulate building your own shelter in the Fallout world.  It's free and enjoyable.  You build rooms to supply your dwellers with food, water and electricity.

You can send your dwellers out on quests for resources and possibly special dwellers.  It's the same game from your phone and I find it easier to play with a mouse and keyboard rather than scrolling on your phone.  It's enjoyable and even though you can pay for content like crates providing resources, special dwellers, Mr Handy's or nuka cola you don't need to spend a cent because you can earn them from playing the game and doing quests and any purchases don't feel forced because you can earn them on your own.

"
5011,yes
5012,"I used to play this on mobile a few phones ago and enjoyed the concept though always had a struggle with the learning curve on how to most efficiently enlarge the vault without bankrupting resources or losing characters to raids and such. I truly wish there was more thought put into it for updates because it's a great base game and could have been built upon so much more.

That being said, it is essentially an idler you need to regularly check in on and pending on your play style is pending how much checking back in on it you'll have to do."

5022,"fun
"
5023,"An addictive, free game with a charming aesthetic. If you are a fallout fan and want to play dolls house with your very own vault, this is the game for you. It's free to play as well, so worth giving it a try although it is first and foremost designed as a mobile game with microtransactions like 'Tiny Towers' so actions like crafting items and going on quests do have a wait time unless you fork over the money to speed things up, so if that's not your cup of tea, I'd recommend you pass on this game.

Overall though, it's a good little game to kill some time and the wait times aren't too bad if you got the patience to just play it casually, when you have a spare minute in between doing other stuff."
5024,ya

5031,"This game is good and all but the thing is that the power, water, and food bar go down very quick and then the rushes to get the food, water, or power fast enough to survive do not work 70% of the time. I rushed the generater room on a 33% incetent chance and it failled like 6 times in a row. So I could not do any thing and my people would have died. AND geting the food, water, and power is REALLY slow so thats why you have to even rush in the first place."
5032,"This game is so much fun, I can't believe the nostalgia I had when I started playing this again I love it!"
5033,its like fallout but shelter
5034,"Don't waste you time or money!!! The game started to crash after 50+ dwellers or so. Now at 120 dwellers and over 100 hrs played I can't load my shelter anymore and I tried reinstalling and all troubleshooting options. I used to love  
Bethesda games now I will never spend a dollar on them again because they can't even get a simple game as this right. This is the first game in 10 years that I played where's there's money involved that just stopped working on me. So disappointing!!!"
5035,"Fun and amazing game, the mobile version only has reward ads which is the best!"

5051,<3
5052,"Heh, I think I spend more time in this game than I planned. But, damn it, she's addictive. It is very important to understand that Fallout Shelter should not be viewed as a PC game. This is, first of all, a game for smartphones and on this platform, it looks quite decent."
5053,nice
5054, Epic gamers play this game
5055,Chum is Fum
5056,"Do NOT buy in game packs. Do NOT buy in game packs. Do NOT buy in game packs. There is a bug in the game, you can look it up on line, that if your game crashes there is a real possibility that it will delete your vault, If so all your in game purchaces will also be gone. Bethesda will NOT help you. You will have to go through the difficult process of contacting STEAM for a refund, they will send you to Bethesda and Bethesda will send you to STEAM. I am deleting this game and no longer playing it. If you choose to play please consider yourself warned."
5057,"good game, but some of the quests take multiple days to actually reach, so this is a ocassional game to play, you only really need to hop on once a day unless you have quests that are less than a day"
5058,"Boring after the first 45 seconds. If you like this sort of game, maybe. Otherwise look for something else."
5059,Change your calender.
5060,"This is an example of a PC version of a game that is worse than the console version.  The most egregious is trying to select units.  The hit box is terrible so the game thinks you're clicking thin air, even when do you click sometimes all it does is highlight the model and not bring up the menu it's supposed to.  Other times you won't have clicked a model at all but it acts like you did and you end up dragging someone to a different room instead of what you were trying to do.  This is especially bad on high level quests when your dwellers' lives depend on you healing them.  I just had a squad wipe because of this.  I had played the console version and never had this problem.  The reason I tried to switch to PC was because of stability.  I got the stability but far worse control performance."
5061,Very fun and easy game!
5062,just fun
5063,everybody got a big iron on they hip
5064,"Do you like Fallout games? Have you ever wondered what it‚Äôs like to be an Overseer of a Vault? Well, you can do just that in Fallout Shelter. It is a spinoff title of Fallout series that lets you take the role of the Overseer of one of the numerous Vaults scattered across the Wasteland. It‚Äôs up to you to ensure that your Vault and its denizens survive all the hardships that come their way."
5065,It's playable even without buying the micro transaction stuff.  It's good if you have about 20 minutes or so to waste during your daily commute :)
5066,"A fun little game, that will make you drop severral hours into it :) Manage your ""sims"", and have fun :)"
5067,Pretty good for a mobile game

5069,This helps with the sadness
5070,Good game for relaxing. Keep it chill.
5071,"Take that it's a free game when it might as well have been paid for, take that you're in charge of a Vault, take that it's an enjoyable management game, take that the ""pay-to-win"" component makes almost no impact and that you can play it without paying any extra, take that it's a Fallout... But what more do you want! Yes, I recommend it, especially if you play it while doing other things on your pc (from time to time you take a break from work, you fix the vault and then you start working again ahahah)."
5072,Good if you want to relax and not stress about anything.
5073,"A good example of a well-made CASUAL game. Hop on, play God for 10 minutes, then let your people live their lives until you return again. Play something else. Keep coming back. It's a good supplemental in-betweener game."
5074,relaxing strategy game
5075,"I've played several versions of this (Android, PC, Xbox), and it's a great game for just wasting a few minutes here and there. The stories are silly and fun to play through."

5079,"‚ùé Quick achievements

I can sum this game up in one word. Grind! Grind! Grind! Grind! Grind! Grind! O wait that's more than one word right, yeah it's a lot of grinding the whole way trough. Still, pretty fun though if you like the Fallout universe. 

Note* Get off my lawn Achievement, you will need 29< dwellers inside the vault for the raiders to spawn. Go above this number and they won't spawn anymore.

Note* Overseer Achievement, you will have to level up a dweller from LV1 all the way up to LV50. Using a dweller with a high LV from the start won't work.

5193,2d fallout do i need to Say more?
5194,"It's pleasant to have a more laid-back game in which to delve into the Fallout universe. Although belying its mobile origins, the game still plays well on Steam and is a lot of fun to play intermittently. However it's by no means perfect - it's fairly simple to max out your dwellers complete all the questlines. Radscorpion infestations are ridiculously overpowered and the drop rate to get the rare dwellers is abysmal, bordering on obscene. A fun way to while away the hours and spend a bit of time in the wasteland."
5195,fun on phone and fun here

5269,i like this game

5272,coooooooooool
5273,poop poop pooping game!
5274,n1c3 because is nice
5275,This game sucks it expects you to play 24/7 I got others things to do. Bethesda you need to do it better (I am surprised you are seeing this because the game is dead) when ever I go into the bunker after I play CSGO I every one is sad and almost dead.
5276,Lots to do and strategy is helpful!
5277,"This game saved my life.

I am 31.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
5278,"Nice try todd but i wont be spending my money on this game.

Cancelled my preorder for the next skyrim remaster too."
5279,The devs have endeavored to create something that occupies user time through illogical design and unresponsive controls rather than engaging content. The real vault experiment here is how long it takes players to smash their comp in frustration. I thought I'd pick up some easy achievements from this idle game but honestly FOS completely wastes even a casual effort.
5280,hkjl
5281,"It's free.  It's casual.  It is interesting for a free, simple game.  It's no Fallout Las Vegas, but it's a nice distraction when you want something mindless to do for a bit."

5298,This game is a strategy game where you need help from others and the game is fun to play.
5299,It's a great game. Thanks Bethesda.
5300,"Have you ever played one of the Fallout games and wondered ""What would life be like inside a vault? How would they manage the resources and keep everyone happy?"" 
No, neither have I! But if you want a fun, easy to get into management game that takes a very different view at the world of Fallout, this game is for you! 
Set dwellers to produce the resources needed to keep them alive! Send them out on quests! Attract more dwellers and unlock more rooms so you can train your dwellers to better survive! Build bigger and better weapons to defend what is yours from raiders, ghouls and other invaders!

Note to new players: A dwellers health is, I believe, determined by their Endurance *when* they level up. Increasing their Endurance does *not* have a retro-active effect! So the best thing is as soon as you are able to train Endurance, get everyone up as high as you can before setting them to work and levelling up"
5301,kill time game :d
5302,gets repetitive but is fun
5303,"okay game ig, i used to play it a lot on my tablet."
5304,not as good as i thought..
5305,I LOVE MY MOM!!!!
5306,fdfdfdfdf
5307,"i mean, its basically a mobile game can't expect too much but what you get will be on par with what you expect so .... i gues"
5308,"Ant Hill Simulator: Fallout Edition.

It's what you would expect from controlling people on a simple mobile like game- and it can be fun to play at first and every now and then.
However, expect there to be time restraints from doing quests, crafting items, and upgrading your people's stats. 
It allows you to play the game at your own pace that way that keeps you playing, but there is no further updates, no expansions, nothing extra than what they have already. (Holiday quests don't count of course.)

Also this is one of those games that it's pretty easy to get all the achievements from, although if you want the hardest one of all which is gaining 20 legendary vault dwellers.
You will be expected to pay real money on this free game on lunch boxes to finish the game 100%, the lunch boxes are also  random so good luck with that one.

So is this a good game?
I think it really depends on the type of person, I like fallout and I like simulations so I don't mind this at all.
It's more of a time waster more than anything else if I don't wanna spend a lot of time on a game everyday."
5309,"Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play simulation were your goal is build your very own underground vault tec bunker. (YOU!) are the overseer of your vault, defend your dwellers and settlement from the hazardous dangers of the unpredictable wasteland, while the managing resources, population, and your occupants happiness."
5310,"The most pointless game you will ever find. 

I truly do not understand how this braindead RNG heavy lootbox storefront has such high reviewscores. 
To anyone who is stupid enough to have wasted a cent buying lootboxes and therefore told the creators that this garbage is worth the effort and therefore shouldnt bother making actual games - there are ways to get as much as you want for free, use google.

The entire game is literally built around making you buy currency or lootboxes. Gear and items all come in lootbox form and literally everything you can achieve in the game can be easily achieved with the push of a button - if you have the currency. 

There is NOTHING to strive for. No difficulty, no learning curve, nothing - the game literally only exist to trick people to pay for imaginary numbers instead of spending days going through lootbox after lootbox getting them.

I spent a few hours clicking the magical buttons to make my characters into uber vaultdwellers, only to see what the ""endgame"" or rather, point of the game would be after you had everything. The entire endgame is as RNG as it gets, as you send out your characters into different dungeons or into the wastelands, and wether or not they survive is completely up to rng.

If i had spent weeks on getting 3 guys maxed out, gearing them up in powerarmor and laser weaponry only to have them lost to RNG id probably feel really shitty - luckily i valued my time slightly higher."
5311,this game is awesome makes you feel like you need too play the real game i love fallout
5312,"Unhappy dwellers, waste of time, one impossible achievement, never touching this again"
5313,Play the mobile version I guess? Just ported to pc lol
5314,makes you stare at your screen
5315,My vault got burnt down by fire EVERY FRICKING TIME
5316,grat game bugh is very uglose an girby
5317,"I spent a lengthy amount of time playing this game and i really enjoyed it, only thing is, in order to have a overall successful vault you pretty much have to spend some additional money"
5318,eh
5319,It's fun but tales a  long time to do anythying
5320,really fun although a kinda don't like it when u get to the point where the game stops giving u people.
5321,Fun game. It's an easy log in and do a few things and let them run in real time while doing daily life.
5322,"long time play game
"
5323,"after you get the overseers office the game actually becomes kinda fun, its got a dungeon crawler vibe when doing quests, though the rest of the game can be a bit frustrating, being able to swap rooms around would be insanely useful, but it doesnt exist, so plan accordingly"
5324,This terribly boring game is exactly where it should be: Buried deep underground!
5325,not bad...
5326,As a player who originally played on the android. I can honestly say that this has always been one of my favorites; there are a lot of neat and quirky things I enjoyed.
5327,"Simple and fun
Nothing special

5328,"Long grind, made for tablet game. Kills time and your soul. 10/10 will continue to waste my existence playing"

Summary:
Fallout Shelter is the optimal game to cheat in! As it is an offline game, you, like everybody else, will simply change the time and date settings to skip any time you have to wait!

No, but seriously, Fallout Shelter is an awesome game, it is relaxing and calming. I really enjoy the music, even though I am forced to listen to it on repeat. It is actually really tempting to cheat in this game, but I definetly do not suggest to do so, it ruins the vibe and appreciation, you have for every little detail in the game. You are not forced to buy anything, and everything is achievable, simply by working for it.

TLDR: ASMR game for PC and phone ^^

5370,yeah nah yeah fully sick
5371,"Plan to spend at lease $30 on Mr. handy's. Be careful of your vault layout as it is costly to rearrange the vault and you lose your handy's if you start a new vault. I do wish they could give us a better handy, its a bit too slow and they don't seem to care about your objectives. They are completely fine fighting in your vault but during attacks if they're in the line to get into your vault they run away."
5372,"I like the game its a bit pay to win though, I feel like I have failed rushing with a chance of only 30% it feels more like 75% fail rate but its decent."
5373,yes
5374,game play is extremely slow and you have to check it everyday. Just get it on mobile

5399,"It doesn't really stand apart from other Mobile Games, in terms of Gameplay, so aside from saying it's all Pay to Win (as they all are) I'll touch on the particular issues that might discourage people from playing:

- Compared to playing this on a mobile, the platform for which it was designed, playing it on PC is absolutely abysmal, there is no way to quickly do things, some mouse movements aren't registered at all, and dragging and dropping causes the mouse to get incredibly out of sync.

- For achievement completionists, the achievements of this game will run you well over 100 hours of play, if not that it will require you to spend a lot of real money, as they contain ""legendaries"".

In truth the game is fine. Just fine."

5431,"I started playing Fallout Shelter on mobile years ago and just got back to it again on PC after a long hiatus. What can I say? It's an incredibly fun, cute game that will keep you amused for quite some time. The best part is that you can advance in Normal Mode without having to spend any money.

There are a few issues to be aware of, though. First of all, there is no end game at all. Once you've maxed out your vaults, that's it. That's the end of the game. Because of this, the micro-transactions have always been a bit questionable to me. The goal of micro transactions should be to enhance game play, right? But because there is no end game, all that happens is that you shorten gaming time so that what might have taken you months to complete without micro-transaction will take you only weeks.

To use an analogy, imagine if you decided to pay an extra $5 for a roller coaster ride that allows you to ""jump the line"" ahead of everyone else so you don't have to wait 15-20 minutes to go again. Also, the ride goes faster, making for a more exciting experience. So, you pay the $5 and everything, and the ride is indeed intense. But because the coaster went twice the speed, the ride lasted in half the time. This is how micro-transactions work in this game. You're just paying to finish the game faster, not to make the most out of it.

Another issue I have is Survival Mode. Remember that Fallout Shelter started out as a mobile game. Because of this, it  shares some of the terrible mechanics that people have come to hate about freemiums. In the case of Survival Mode, What happens with freemiums  is that you're given a ""board"", load out or a card hand (like in a poker game) that seems random and therefore playable if you use strategy and skill. But in reality, some boards are designed to fail no matter what you do while others are not. When you fail, you think, ""Oh, I must have done something wrong this time; let me change up my strategy."" But it's not that. Some of the load outs seem designed to frustrate you into buying micro-transactions.

In the case of Survival Mode, I don't think that every load out (dwellers, stats, weapons, etc.) is doable with strategy. For example, some vaults, you'll get legendary weapons, outfits and dwellers from the start, making Survival Mode more challenging than Normal mode, but able to be completed. Other vaults, you will just barely squeak by with anything, and it will be very hard to get it up and running past Level 16 without suddenly needing to buy something from the store or rage quitting. I just want to put that out there because it bothers me to think that people could be beating themselves up not breezing through Survival Mode when the reality is that they just got a weak load out that will make mincemeat out of strategy.

Bottom line, stick to Normal Mode, which definitely utilizes skill and is more fun to play. Survival Mode plays more like an online poker game or mobile game, as in P2W but tricking you into thinking that it's more an issue of you needing to bone up on your skills."

5461,"Although I am a fan of 3D games, this game is awesome! I really love the Fallout series, especially 4 (I know i know..)..
This game is awesome for multiple reasons, one of them is giving me the ability to play one handed because I sliced the tips of my middle and ring finger and I need to keep them bandaged so it's really hard to use my left hand, otherwise, this game is awesome <3"
5462,yges
5463,Its a cute game for Fallout lovers. It resembles mobile games we all waste time on a lot. But there is some humor and Fallout lore that makes this game worth playing. And its free (unless you don't know how to be patient)

My only complaint is that without going on quests, caps are hard to come by, so it's hard to build and move forward in the game, unless you want to buy nuka colas."

And sometimes, I just want to pop into a game for 5 minutes between responsibilities, or kill 15 minutes waiting for this and that, or meander through a casual game for an hour.. Fallout Shelter gives me that second option, where I'm not diving deep into something like Fallout 4, but I can happily entertain myself for a bit of time, and properly enjoy it. I love this little game."

Sometime the game is slow - taking too long to travel to quests (they want you to pay to speed things up), which is fair but can be annoying. Overall, great product."
5509,"Not paying for anything in the game is truly the way to play this, it favours people who can be patient and generally have other things to do.

Would recommend to at least try it out."
5515,fun addictive game  makes you want to play the real thing
5516,bery nice game bery addicting
5517,"I have fun playing this sporadically. It's not one you can really stay with over time, but fun to come back to and play for a while then start over again later. Easy for anyone to pick up. A lot of the exploring and best gear are reserved for more dedicated regular players, but not necessary to enjoy the game. Hey, it's free. You can buy bundles to help your vault along, also totally optional. Fun, resource light. Really more of a mobile title, cloud saving makes it easy to take your vault anywhere. I only play when I have a few minutes to kill at home."
5518,good chill fun
5519,d==(¬¥‚ñΩÔΩÄ)‚ô™
5520,"Quite a few things about the game play that I don't like. Firstly, it's a free to play game, designed to be almost impossible to play without spending money to speed things up, or buy pieces in the game. There really needs to be a pause button, but because there isn't, I close the game if I need to go to the toilet or anything away from my computer screen, I may or may not come back to it. It's slow as hell, because they want you to spend real money to speed it up. Too many raids and attacks, kills your people and you can't ever get enough supplies. Having to pick up the people to move them is extremely annoying, especially in a raid. When you set your armed people onto the attackers or raiders, once the attackers leave the room, your people don't follow them, they just stand around like idiots. The proportion of pregnancy to the kids growing up is way out, either they are pregnant for years, or the kids grow up really quickly. Overall conclusion: Frustrating as hell, don't waste your time."

5530,fun FREE fallout vault sim
5531,Fun to play when you need the game that you can play at anytime of the day.
5532,"Not may favorite game on the PC, but for me this is my perfect phone game. The UI is extremely intuitive and easy to use. I wish there was another game like this. But the whole marketplace seems filled with greedy gambling simulators designed to drain you of money. The monitization in this game is not a requirement, but you can spend if you wish. I don't find the lunchboxes to be all that helpful, maybe a couple in the early game to get some starting weapons and outfits. 

I started my main vault in 2015 on an Iphone 4 and after 200 hours there isn't anything left for me to do. All dwellers are maxed level and stats, all geared with top tier legendary weapons and outfits. A variety of pets are available for various missions and objectives. Robots for all the automatic resource gathering. I have rearranged the layout twice to optimize rooms as strategy/focus changed (Population/Leveling/Training/Gathering/etc).

There does seem to be some issues with achievements on my transferred game save. I probably have to start a new save to try and complete some of the harder ones."
5533,uhm yes i like game
5534,not a bad game

5540,"is a great strategy/Management sandbox game and i would recommend this mobile game 
"
5541,"So much fun watching my vault grow!

EDIT: 167 hours in, and I must say, the game passes the time by real fast! I'm a professional procrastinator, so this game came in handy these last few months.  

I (unfortunately) wasted my money on lunchboxes and Mr Handy's, until I realised you can simply change your computer's time to advance production of weapons or to let my dwellers reach quest destinations in the wasteland. FML. FML. FML.

But hey, at least now I can share my knowledge with others and (hopefully) you won't be making the same mistakes I did.  Also, Google beforehand which SPECIAL stats are most useful for Quests (to my knowledge, Agility, Strength, Endurance and Luck are most useful, so send out dwellers that have high points in those categories)."
5542,crazy incest stuff right there
5543,"This game is a great time waster and can be addicting. Once you build up your vault enough, it begins to be something that you can waste several hours on. Although, as I see this game was released in 2017, are there any plans for an update? When you begin to get a large number of vault dwellers, micro managing can be a bit difficult. I'd like to see more sort options for vault dwellers (i.e. hp/radiation lvls, by last name, etc.). Match making can be a bit difficult when you can't fully tell who is related. In fact, a family tree sort option would be nice, too. Same thing for sorting items in your inventory. It be nice to only display rarity types as there is in the craft workshops. 

Just some food for thought."
5544,"This game was a good game, and yeah this game is F2P so yeah"

For real though this game is ass lmao"
5573,i enjoy this game because theres always something to do. Its a great game.
5574,"first of all, its very different from the rest of the fallout library. It's like a mobile game, everything in the game makes you wait for hours and the only way to speed it up is to spend bottles that you can find in the waste land. You can also buy bottles but it doesn't force you to spend money. its a fine game if you're interested in the fallout world but have already played the other games, it has vaults you can explore and you can customize your own vault in anyway. holy shit it crashes so much, i've played fallout new vegas for 171 hours and this game has crashed more times in the 20 hours ive played it than fallout new vegas."
5575,"It got boring, not even enough quests to do play it daily, no updates, no expansions, same quests over and over and over and over and over again.."
5576,great.
5577,A fun and casual base-building game!
5578,YES
5579,"Pay to win. If you don't, be prepared to stay logged in 24/7 of real life time to make any progress. A mobile port at best and super boring. I think this is a stealth Bitcoin miner."
5580,funny
5581,good
5582,"Very fun entertaning game. This game is not pay-to-win but does require grinding.

Edit: After 52 Hours put into a Vault my game just Disapeared! Says i now have no Vaults... Very DIsapointing!
Obviously the Cloud back-up has a Major Flaw or don't work at all!"
5583,is cool
5584,"It get's boring. Coins are too hard to come by. Expansion is pointless. Power modules all over is also pointless. I mean it's fun, it's just not that much fun."
5585,Fun and easy enough game to kill some time with. A perfect way to transition into the boardgame with the same name.
5586,"Kinda difficult to get very far if you're new to the game, but eventually you get a handle of it. I'd recommend, especially since it's free."
5587,"pretty pog

5590,"Good general management game to pass 10min here and there.  Certain things you have to know by looking up that are VERY important for end game content, which i found to show pretty bad game design.  I played on my phone years ago and after I already had max levels and max pop I learned that you have to have their Endurance maxed at level 1 then they climb to max level in order for Endurance to even matter... so I had to restart my entire game after months of playing that vault??? Yea, thats something we shouldn't have to figure out on our own.  Other than that, I enjoy it."
5591,very fun for time killing but also really fun because you can do quests and stuff
5592,This game is pretty fun. I thought it was only on android but it's on here also
5593,free to play is a plus. nice to pass the time.
5594,Great game.

5598,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
5599,very nice
5600,waste of time
5601,Classic
5602,
5603,its tough in the beginning but if you can hold on to your caps and dwellers and send them out on missions in the wasteland then if they die revive them with your caps and then just bring em home plus your going to need a storage bay
5604,fun
5605,like
5606,it good
5607,Holy mobile-money grab Batman!
5608,"Its really much funner than expected. You really wouldnt expect too much at first, but after playing a couple hours it throws amazing little quests at you. Its free, under 1 gigabyte, so it takes not no space really. This game can really run on a computer from 1990, and it is so fun at that."
5609,goog
5610, Shelter in Shelter
5611,"Very fun and interesting game, would definitely recommend to give it a try."
5612,its good and fun and challenging
5613,money money moneeeeeeyyyyyy
5614,"I play this on my switch more than on steam now but that being said, it is a relatively simple and fun game.

I'd be remiss if I didn't add that some of the exploring the wasteland levels are a bit fucked though, you're gonna be spamming stims on that, and I one time had 3 varying raids back to back not that far apart. 

It is literally the living embodiment of toilet gaming."
5615,you can make them frick each other 11/10
5616,"It's a fun little casual game, no stress."
5617,yes
5618,fun gaem

5621,Good

5623,fun for free
5624,still a very good time waster.
5625,its a fun 10 minutes a day
5626,VERY GOOD
5627,"Slightly pay to win, but not too bad. You can easily spend the $5 or $10 and be set for the whole game, it really helps having some super characters tho. Also, If you have patience, then this is a lot of fun overall.  8/10

"
5628,"This is the game from your childhood. Here you can have your own shelter, pets and problems with water. I liked this free game from Bethesda but only for 5 hours max..

score: 5.5/10"
5629,¬†
5630,"Very fun and entertaining game to play on your free time, can have as low and fun approach with regular difficulty or even more intense and hard on survival difficulty."
5631,it is a great game but as soon as u make to many rooms and not many power genarators it gets realy hard
5632,Gets old as soon as you leave the tutorial.
5633,face
5634,better then a mobile game
5635,it too my grind it move dweller to room wait 4 hour send dweller on quest wait 4 days
5636,"genuinely really fun and also very rewarding when you upgrade things or expand your vault :D

good game if you want something to motivate you to be awake :)

only part i dislike a bit is how much you have to wait for things but thats probably just because im impatient and if you have decent money you can buy things in-game to help but is it really fun if you buy everything with real money?"
5637,Very fun game.
5638,Same as on mobile. It's good.
5639,is good
5640,20 hours or 10 cola? I prefer uninstall.
5641,"Good
"
5642,"yes
"
5643,"No pause?! Something comes up and the game stays alone for a few minutes. When I come back, most peps are dead!
No speed up?! Wait for hours to get the peps to do something?
No fun! Basic game with ridiculous micromanagement.
No challenge! Well, waiting hours for something to happen is a challenge but that's not the kind of challenge I want in a game.
Uninstalled."
5644,Good game. Fun to play during some down time.
5645,Patrolling the Vault makes you wish for a Radroach invasion.
5646,My save file deleted itself. Vault is gone. Would not recommend.
5647,"Multiplayer game that can bring a lot of fun even if you are playing solo. Nice mechanics, easy to learn, don't know yet how difficult to master."
5648,"A nice little idle game within the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/Fallout_New_Vegas/]Fallout[/url] universe giving you a taste of overseeing your very own Vault and its survivors. It is a complete experience with great humour, cameos of famous Fallout characters, quests that tell stories, little random events that happens not only to the Vault but to the people you send out to explore the Wasteland and configurability in individual survivor loadouts (clothes, weapon and pet). 

There are microtransactions available in-game, but I have been a free player from the start and have been able to enjoy plenty of content and play time.

Live ""safely"" inside a Vault today!"
5649,love it
5650,feels good to grind

5653,"You probaby downloaded it on your pc either to make your library look bigger or to have all the fallout games on steam. Either way, its a good game."
5654,Fun but the timer on missions to make up for lack of variation in missions kills it
5655,offline fun for anyone
5656, great game
5657,"The game was good
"
5658,Pretty fun
5659,;-;
5660,"Yes I do The game keeps me glued to the screen for hours, and the mechanics are great. So I would greatly recommend this game, plus it is free to play/"
5661,kinda hard :/
5662,Fun simple but limited. Good free game.
5663,"My bias to the Fallout universe, Bethesda and Todd Howard's cute little face aside, this is a great little management game especially due to its free to play status.  Having recently returned to it after not playing since it came out in 2015 on phones it has to be said that I am really enjoying the Steam version and the updates the game has seemingly received over the past 6 years.

Do not be put off by the dreaded micro-transactions, this is easily played without having to purchase them and you are gifted lunchboxes as rewards for the more challenging quests as complete them.  So far I have received one free pet too, a cat, which I have understandably called Dark Kitten."
5664,A little gamplay goes a long way
5665,fun
5666,"Fun and simple game. Watch out from crashes, if a fire starts and your PC freezes, say goodbye to your vault."

"
5669,a fun game to cut some time ;)
5670,"Immersive,Nice graphics 9/10 yet if you could add swords and people who specializes in certain thing like Generator,Water,etc,etc"
5671,good game
5672,it can be fun did not spend any money on this
5673,"The PC version does not have the option to watch ad videos like the phone version does. This means fewer lunchboxes and bottles for you to help get your vault optimized like you want, unless you're willing to pay real-world dollars."
5674,"great if ur bad at games n need an ego boost 
"
5675,this game is AMAZING the only problem i have is 1. dwellers dont come to your door that much and 2. you need mr. handy men to be offline and still grab the things and they are pretty late game
5676,o brabo para aqueles como eu que n√£o possuem amigos

5693,"If you want something that doesn't pay to win, this is the answer. Even though the gameplay is kinda very very simple, but at least it doesn't force you to pay on something. And sometimes, you gotta use your brain instead of your greed to play this game."
5694,gut ebening
5695,"I played this game pretty nonstop on mobile when it first launched, forgot about it for a few years, and now I'm back to being addicted to it. Really fun and easy management game, good for having something to do while listening to a podcast."
5696,It's alright pretty well made game.
5697,"this game is like a child, you just have to check up in on it every now and then to check up and take care of somethings."
5698,Easy to play and fun to watch grow.
5699,good
5700,sure
5701,i would recommend
5702,"Build a vault, great game to mess around with while at work or school"
5703,"its free, its fun, its easy to play, 3 in one! ive played it on console, mobile, and pc and they all are so simple!  even with only 2 hours into it, its a good thing to play when bored. my only problem is that supplies run out FAST. and when the powers out, the waters out, then the game begins to go downhill. 9.7/10!"
5704,pretty cool but i wish i could run my vault in a more dictator-type style and directly kill any vault dweller i please and put restrictions on food but other than that pretty nice
5705,¬≠
5706,"I had play this before on the phone but keeping lose save game. Now, they are on the Steam on PC, no worry about lose saves! This game is fun and killing time for a while."
5707,good game
5708,very awesome!!!
5709,"When I saw a friend playing this on PS4 and how much joy he got out of it (and remembering that I spent many happy hours with Sim Tower all those years ago), I really hoped that this game was available on Steam and going for a song. So I was overjoyed to find that it is, it's free and not a crappy port. I really wanted to like this game and I do. Bethesda have, in a very rare case for them, made that very easy to do in their best (but also simplest) Fallout release since acquiring the IP from Interplay. It is the closest to the original games (in theme and spirit, if not in style) and the only one Bethesda should have made. It is, however, abundanly clear and ironic that their best work is one that they originally made for consoles and mobile phones, one that they give away for free while charging mucha dinero for steaming piles of dog faeces such as FO 4 and 76. If console and mobile games are the only things they can get right, they do not deserve their mountain of gold nor being considered a AAA game studio, IMO."
5710,"good, iv'e heard there is no good content at the end though so..... we'll see!"
5711,"A fun little FtP idle game set in the Fallout universe. Pretty easy to understand, with a lot of resource management and clicking. If I had one gripe, I'd say that it gets a little repetitive before the Overseer's Office becomes available so you can send your vault dwellers on quests. However, once it does, these break up the monotony nicely and help it feel more like a standard Fallout game. It's a good game to waste an hour or two every day on without constantly feeling like you have to grind for good gear and items. Be sure to keep an eye out for the Mysterious Stranger - if you hear an ominous tone, look around your vault and click him for a hefty Cap reward."
5712,"Adicting
"
5713,Had it on the phone. Now i have it on the PC.
5714,Such an addictive game i started it last night and cant stop playing its taking all my time.

5735,it's a fun type of its game!
5736,"This is a fantastic game that I highly recommend. The goal of this game is to establish a civilization and entice people to move in so that they can be protected. To keep your inhabitants happy and alive, gather items such as weapons, outfits, and junk."

5739,"Good little game based on the Fallout Universe. Free to play, although there is in-game micro transactions, if you wish to advance faster... But it is in no way a requirement to pay to actually enjoy the game, as it is already pretty well balanced. I had played this game on a daily basis for nearly a year on Microsoft Store, and when I saw it on Steam, I decided to download it.

Although I noticed the Steam version is a little bit more buggy, but nothing game breaking."

5742,i eat sand.
5743,This is a pretty decent free game. It is definitely not as good as other fallout games. Granted it is not main series and is just an idle game. It is pretty good for that.

5749,"i enjoy this game, i personally love all the fallout games and this one is not a game you really have to think about when you are really not in the mood to truly concentrate.
"
5750,"Ok... Let's get straight to it!! If you R a super Fallout fan like me, you should NOT miss this game AT ALL!
I'm building my third vault, (cause there R some tips you would miss in first times) and i'm never get bored of playing it for the third time! =)"
5751,Maybe one of if not the only mobile port that is worth playing.
5752,"Fun Game Wish they would give more rewards

 wish the would offer higher value to thing"
5753,fun clicker
5754,so cool game
5755,"It's a management sim. It basic and simple, yet not to complex to get a person confused. It does take forever to get things up and running effectively. Patience is a must. This side scrolling compartmentalized structure is a unique experience in the Fallout universe. I have other vaults on other devices, and it is possible to build a thriving vault. The only downside is that the resident cap is 200, and it limits how big your vault can be. It pauses when you leave and resumes when you come back, which is nice, but not so much for the people outside the vault. I have had many vault members die because I did not check back in time, even when you give them the best gear and equipment. This game has micro-transactions. Some micro-transactions are better than others. Lunchboxes, animal carriers, and Mr. Handy are the best for the value. It is one of the only loot-box systems in the gaming industry that I actually like to spend money on. I spent hours on this game, and very few in frustration. Also, it is a great game to the kill time if needed."
5756,It gets boring really quick
5757,You can have babies üò≥
5758,"play after some while, the game start to crush, Many bug occur, when click the bug character the game auto quit out.  Reinstalled it also no use."
5759,fantastic game with a flaw that is that a bug of the Mole rat that can multiply and so you can lose all your Vault.
5760,"s*** forgot this exists, can't be bothered changing my Fallout 4 review.
This is probably better tbh"
5761,it's pretty fun but takes a lot of time
5762,Yes
5763,fun to play
5764,VERY fun game about the fallout franchise and is a absolute treat to play. kind of heavy on microtransactions but you can speed up time on your pc and get free stuff and no waiting times
5765,poo
5766,"if you stack in minecraft bedwars, this game is for you."
5767,this game is really fun but it take time and i mean a lot of time to get a 100 people in your vault.
5768,mobile game
5769,very fun and addicting game
5770,"pretty alright. microtransactions are weirdly decent, but unnecessary with cheats."
5771,"i wasted like 40 bucks on this game like a year ago i have 39124882 sets of power armor get outta my mouth, head, and butt dude"
5772,YES
5773,yes iz fun
5774,While i personally think the mobile version is better (hence why i have way more hours on mobile and just transferred my save to my pc) i still think the pc version is a very good version of this game.
5775,AaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAaAAaAaAaAAaAaAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
5776,"pretty anoying because its paytowin, but what else would you get from Bethesda game..."
5777,"The game is average atleast fun for about the 1 hour you are gonna play it and then only turn it on for the daily bonuses, there are some bugs and gliches even (you could call them features at this point tho :D)


4 out of 10"
5778,good game. although its fun for 30 minutes and then you gotta wait 2 hours then 30 minutes of fun then another 2 hours of waiting
5779,"Super duper fun game! But, there is one thing. They should make it for mac, it seems playable on it. But anyways amazing game, very fun when you are board. While you are waiting for, children to grow up, or someone to reach their mission areas, you can play other games!"

5793,"At first I was going to give this a thumbs up, but ended up changing my mind after ""playing"" for 139 hours so far. Fallout Shelter is very management heavy which is fine. You place your dwellers in different rooms which produce different resources, you can send them out into the wasteland to gather items and send them on quests which will reward you with all kinds of items. That's a brief summery of the things you can do in Fallout Shelter;... sounds cool right? Well...

If your impatient this ""Free"" game will tempt you into purchasing in game items with real world money to speed up different things in the game. See everything in Fallout Shelter is completed over time... real world time which means; crafting weapons, clothing, training, traveling and questing takes time hours in many cases sometimes days! This is where you can purchase with real world money an item that can speed up time.

1. Fallout Shelter isn't very interactive, you set up your dwellers then exit the game.

2. There's not much of a battle system

3. Items and rewards are extremely bland & not exciting at all 

4. Finally, if your interested in collecting achievements/trophies there's one that will either cost you an insane 
    amount of time or real world money. You have to collect 20 unique legendary dwellers which you can only 
    get from ""lunch boxes"", lunch boxes are rare to get & getting a legendary dweller from one is extremely 
    rare on top of that!"

5807,good
5808,okay
5809,very good game so far not boring.
5810,"Decent game, frame rates are great especially on my horrible no good laptop"
5811,"The game is really fun.  It freezes up about once every hour but it launches fast.  Also, you can only play about 10 minutes a day without spending money, and the game is basically dead."
5812,I love this game because its like a mini version of fallout 4 and its cool...
5813,Fun game - if you have the time to spare. I seem to spend my time running out of food and power.. hmm maybe I need to find some more time to play more. :-)
5814,easy to play
5815,it good
5816,.
5817,Brilliant Game very fun i wish there was a way to speed up pregnancy and for the children to grow up
5818,"Mostly trash. Half glitched, the game is not really enjoyable past a certain point. Connect, get your things, disconnect. Not even gonna bother mentioning all the shit quests wich give very little compared to the effort put into them, and the 24/7 deathclaw attacks past a certain level."
5819,good game if you're hella bored
5820,itz gud
5821,it was vary fun
5822,cool game
5823,Great game.  Thoughtful and rewarding.  More to do than you initially think.
5824,Better than Fallout '76............  probably.
5825,its a good time killer  i like giveing everyone  random name     and  inforceing a one man Breeding Program for the best stats lol
5826,fucking LIT
5827,"Build cool shelter
Make Settlers have lots of children
Deathclaw attack inbound
1/2 population dead....10/10 game"
5828,Stupd fucking game. If your pc crashes while this game is active say bye bye to your vault and all the save files.
5829,e
5830,I took a break from playing for more than two years and I've started playing again since last Sunday and it got me hooked once more. Its really fun playing the game. I hope more contents would be added and introduced to the game to make it much more exciting to play.
5831,good game
5832,yes
5833,Great time-wasting game. Perfect to be played while queuing on your other games :)
5834,"so far so good
"
5835,"It is similar with Craft The World somehow, and I love this game, its a Yes from me"
5836,Pretty good solo base builder. Nicely straight forward.
5837,"Download the WeMod application to get free Lunchboxes, Pet Crates, and Mr. Handies. DO NOT give Bethesda your dolans for all of the 1 minute of dev time it took, WeMod also gives you infinite caps and Nuka Cola Quantum"
5838,Fun game to check in on every now and again
5839,Very fun
5840,"It's fun, and it's free. Runs on ""real-time"" so the beginning can be a bit ""slow"" to progress, but eventually there is plenty to do for those of us who like to micro manage things."
5841,ok phone game not ok fallout game h
5842,the critical strike mini-game makes me really really anxious
5843,"This game is amazing!! Yes. It's Freemium. I've spent money on it. It will be very hard without spending real money.  But it's so much fun, It's worth it!!!!! You dont have to spend a penny though if you dont mind waiting."
5844,Yes = E
5845,nobrainer
5846,awesome late night game
5847,"It's a really good game. The problem is that when I booted the game, my vault was gone. I Tried Verifying the Integrity of the files, nothing. I Don't know how this happened. I Didn't Delete my vault. The Last time I played, Everything was fine. I exited the game like I normally do, and then my vault is gone."
5848,"Well I guess its kinda good. But it's hella repetitive, and really fun. Pick it up play for around a week on and off like half an hour a day. Then you'll either get hooked or just get bored."
5849,"its a fun game as you can torture your dwellers as you watch them suffer from working too much and not having food,water,electricity"
5850,"fun
"
5851,Great little casual game in the Fallout universe.
5852,Epic Game :D
5853,Cannot open the game anymore. Support doesn't help at all and the money I've put into the game is now lost. Not cool.
5854,I was bored so i got 44 hours on this.
5855,nice
5856,"Good game, but for an idle it isn't too ""idle"" friendly. The raiders and events scale based on in game level so you can't rush things, if you don't do things absolutely perfectly from the very beginning you will quickly get overwhelmed if you're not paying attention almost 24/7. Left it idle for an hour and Raiders wiped out my entire vault in the first 2-3 days of game play forcing me to restart and look up guides on how to meta game since it seems to be the only way to do well."
5857,Great!
5858,"dont have the time nor patience to wait for my retarded men to go outside for 2 days





fun game doe"
5859,Fun little game to kill some time. I definitely recommend it.
5860,i have a love and hate relationship with this game
5861,quite casual
5862,yes very

Conclusion: Not the best game... Worse than Fallout 76. The game is too grindy and you can barely ever get any survivors. Sometimes the game is pay to win and the Mister Handy is such a waste it gets you like 63 bottle caps. This game is terrible. It is a waste of your time. Just go buy Fallout 4 or 76"
5869,It's free.
5870,simple
5871,Nice game!
5872,It‚Äôs alright
5873,good game its fun it takes a long time but when u hit 50 dwellers bad boys come so be carful
5874,"Fuck you, Bethesda"
5875,"Very adicting game for the first 10-20 hours, but after that it starts to get a bit boring because quests take forever. Still fun-ish on 30-100 hours, after that you kinda just beat the game."

5888,I really like fallout shelter its really great and all but i have an idea so with MR handy if you play over Fallout's like fallout 4 you know that curie was MRS nanny(Basically the MR handy version. but in female form) i think and it would be cool if there were  a little bonus where MRS nanny would be able to heal dwellers in the room shes in if they got damaged at all. and MR handy does way more damage and they were my ideas so yeah.
5889,"I like the game, it's pretty cool and fun.
Personally, I don't play it much because I have a lot of work to do rn.
But I recommend it.
Approved."
5890,Its a good game if you like suvival and simulator games
5891,nice gameeeee
5892,"Okay...

Bethesda, what have you done?

Supposed to be a brief waste of time but becomes an absorbing and intricate distraction for far too long. I experienced genuine laughter whilst playing this game.

It is is simply the best free game on Steam and probably a better ""investment"" than most god games on this platform. 

I will, of course, be uninstalling the bloody thing asap!"
5893,"Enjoyed it, went crazy for maybe 2 years.  However in the end game I had to use my desktop, even my 2012 laptop would crash.  Not sure if its related to graphic card limits but the machine would just shut off.  However the end end game is limited to collecting legendary weapons.  

I'd recommend survival mode straight up.  Can't bring myself to play it again when theres other games, if you can try fallout shelter online."
5894,"I fell in love, the whole base building is fun and there is a lot things need to do for upgrading and making the balance base. however once your reach to point where your base is pretty much efficient the quest is actually really fun to play and there is your typical fallout comedy story. 

Dont forger on events quest as like , like christmas , valentine and ect they also give good story and loots. the story quest keep me grinding to play this games.  

ITS FREE BTW !!!"
5895,good game
5896,awesome
5897,Fun! but gets boring pretty quickly.
5898,`
5899,"Has the same MO as every other freemium game: it primes you with tons of goodies at the beginning and then hides the rest of its content behind timewalls that can be skipped with the in-game currency (which you can conveniently pay for). You can also buy lunchboxes for random drops of weapons, rare dwellers, caps, etc but its obvious that the value and uniqueness of the stuff in them drops off steeply with time. 

Not gonna lie, I've played nearly 50 hours of this game and I got pretty far into this game. I've unlocked nearly every room and now the first thing I do every morning is check up on how my dwellers are doing and click on all the notifications. I'm more than a little embarrassed to have played it this far. I should have deleted this long ago. 

tldr: Just a shitty freemium game imported to pc; don't play unless you want a product specifically made to form bad habits in you.

5902,good game but i recommend downloading on mobile because its a game you play when you are bored
5903,fun though there is a glitch when you try to add the overseer station.  You will need to point to the area outside of the vault (far left outside and click) where you team has run off to so that you can do anything.
5904,"Very cool grind game
"
5905,Good game. 9/10
5906,Got this on steam to say I played on Xbox. Wanted to review on here because I love this game.  It was my introduction to the Fallout universe. I only wish they did more with this. But overall a lot of fun and very cool
5907,WERRY NICE
5908,funnie vualt raider die hahahah amogus chungus xDDDDDDD my dad drowned he was too sussy LMAO iagineee being that bad at fortnite chungies ugandan knuckles cringe ngl skill issue #skillgap papa #wage gap lol get famiunsms
5909,"A port of a mobile game centered around base building with a bit of dungeon crawling mixed in, all in the classic Fallout flair.  Oh, and a nice pile of micro-transactions to make life easier or more convenient but at least here they're in a Free to Play game instead of one you have to buy first (*cough*76*cough*).

Graphics are good and match the kind of cutesy art style of the ""Fallout Guy"" franchise mascot.  Nothing amazing, but it does its job well.

Sound is kind of 'meh' but does at least keep to the Fallout theme well in music choices and sound effects though the Incident Alert klaxon is annoying enough you'll probably be turning the sound off entirely just to shut the blasted thing up (it really needs its own mute button).

The core base building gameplay loop is fine for casual gaming, being centered around wait timers that will tick down even when you're not actively playing so it's a sort of game you just check in on for a couple minutes at a time throughout your day.  Anyone old enough to remember Tamagachis, this is the Fallout version.

The dungeon gameplay, or 'Quests' aren't all that complex, but do provide a nice mini-game sort of distraction to break up the base-building.  You basically just go room to room killing all the baddies with the vault dwellers you've trained up which could get boring, but it doesn't take too long either so it doesn't overstay its welcome.

The game even has plenty of classic Fallout humor, but most of it is tucked away rather than shoved in your face.  If you zoom in on a room with multiple dwellers, for example, you'll start seeing their banter.  Or if you read through the logs of one you have exploring the wasteland there are a few gems sprinkled in there.

All in all, it's a fun little time user good for a casual audiences but is probably going to feel too slow paced for the more 'hardcore gamer' crowd that will likely feel pressured into buying stuff to keep up a faster pace of progression."
5910,look at the play time. 10 minutes over :(
5911,"This is a good time killer, but don't expect much more."
5912,"nice c:
"
5913,Waste of time
5914,Very fun once you get used to how the game works.
5915,wow!
5916,Another wonderful day in the Vault!
5917,"ok heres my review 


fallout games are very popular in general but let me tell you this game is a great time passer for people who just want to lay back and chill 
"
5918,how
5919,"Good
"
5920,"Just a very amusing and fun resource management game, simple but entertaining."
5921,"Good Ol' Bethesda , what happened to you"
5922,lmao dead haha funy
5923,ggssgsgsgsg
5924,Adictive fun and easy to play.
5925,This game is a mobile Classic (10/10)
5926,Netter Zeitvertreibhure.
5927,"Pretty fun, and good for killing time"
5928,nice easy little game to take mind of things.
5929,fyuuck you ahmad!!
5930,I had the game on Xbox one and it did not give me satisfaction but on PC it is fun the amount of hours that I have put is wowing to me.
5931,"I've played this in the past, I've recently downloaded it on the pc, I'm fucking done, EVERY GOD DAMN FIVE MINUTES there is an incident that prevents you from getting shit done, radscorpions drain your power down to nothing moving from room to room, and even then when you do get to rest, OH GEE 13 days to make a fucking outfit or weapon, I've cheated time on my pc AND IT'S STILL NOT FUN. Fuck this game."
5932,The female raiders are kinda hot
5933,"cock
"
5934,"same as always, short time sync :D"
5935,"Quality game. Plenty of room for extra content to be added, but still fun as it is."
5936,"micro/scam-transaction hell, pass."
5937,fingers in his ass
5938,"Fallout Shelter (2015 on IOS, 2016 on PC)

Originally out on the cellphone, Fallout Shelter gives you the role of The Overseer to manage your very own vault, Build up your vault with everything the people need, from food to water and living spaces, ever expanding as your vault grows in size. Fight off bandits and any other scum trying to steal your resources. Send dwellers out to explore the wasteland to recover gear, weapons and resources for you to use. Complete quests with a team of dwellers for more loot. You can even get characters from the Fallout games to join your vault. Its a pretty fun game to play, if you invest the time into it. Was a great game to play during boring lectures at University.

8/10"
5939,Pretty good just to pass the time. fun to create your own vault and get old characters from the pass games. Also the quest are pretty cool too
5940,GOOOOOG
5941,"Bethesda games are awesome , even a mini game like fallout shelter can make life easy for u ! 
making time better is the purpose of games , and fallout shelter did his part"
5942,great
5943,"Fun to play, same game as on mobile. I just let it idle in the background while grinding on other games"
5944,good game in general
5945,"Very shallow and full of micro-transaction BS. Even after update the game-play is almost nonexistent. UI is dreadful and pacing is horrible. Only reason I play this is that there are not many games of this type. Still it was a mistake but I still want to ""finish it""."
5946,One of the best free games out there by far!
5947,if you like putting time and effort in a singleplayer game this is the thing for you
5948,played alot on the mobile. runs better for me on steam. yes
5949,its pog
5950,"This is a nice idle game, it's fun with the quests, and def a old fav, and doesnt get old"
5951,Recommend
5952,Class
5953,nice
5954,"If you love Fall Out and pocket games, this is the perfect combination."
5955,Fun game to pass a bit of time.
5956,"Yes I love Nuking every age person on earth and sticking them in a mountain. Fuck you little kids and deathclaws
"
5957,good game spawn point told me to play this.
5958,"I like that the game is on Steam because I can play it almost whenever, and when I do, so many nostalgic memories just flood my head."
5959,I find it a bit boring. Instructions are not clear.
5960,hmmm
5961,.
5962,Its just as fun as i remmeber it
5963,love this game its awesome
5964,"Quite awesome for a free game, basic but entertaining"
5965,">Build room for work
>Build house
>People have baby
>Get robbed
>Immediately send injured people out to scavenge
>They die
>Surprised-Pikachu-face.png"
5966,"This is a fun casual game. It deserves to be updated once in a while. It could benefit from some new quests occasionally, perhaps some new items, maybe fixing a few quality of life issues."
5967,well its fun in the start when u stop playing it for a while u wont know what to do but over all fun game
5968,I have exsplosive and Runny diareah when i play this game Its amazeing
5969,XD
5970,Quite nice game to be honest. Used it as a game to play when having burnout from playing other RPG based games.
5971,boring
5972,"Pretty good simulator. There is a lot to it with many dynamic dimensions of game play. It keeps me coming back for me. But beware, don't let your dwellers be undefended for a minute. It could cost you your shelter."
5973,cool and fun!
5974,"Great game. A bit of a money pit if you like updating quickly. Also, survival is a bit more stressful. It's still awesome."
5975,It's ok.
5976, bvnj
5977,"A very good game in the fallout series, I enjoy playing it and I'm very happy that it is free even if it is a game that at its quality should be bought with money"
5978,"This game is enjoyable, exciting, creative and very addictive. Highly recommended for Bethesda gamers especially."
5979,"Slow progression because it's a mobile game, but if you are a fan of fallout you will enjoy building your vault."
5980,"It's pretty fun, I started off playing this on my phone for ages then realised I could move it to Steam. It started off slow as these types of games tend to, but keeping at it yields better weapons, outfits etc! It's worth checking out a guide if you want to work out the best way of setting up your rooms, it's something I wished I'd done sooner!"
5981,make them have babies
5982,"I love this game because of the challenges, quests, and struggles your underground bunker could face! I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun game that isn't too challenging!"
5983,"This game sucks, increasing 100% happiness is imposible until you spend money on them. Otherwise the AI will screw your vault. After fallout 4, Bethesda became a filthy dump. Home for some greedy bastard."
5984,I starteed my vault and everone died   2 radroch!
5985,"Was loving the game until the bugs went from annoying to completely game-breaking. My whole vault is dead because half of an attacking horde (a very manageable one at that) was somehow set to invulnerable. I would demand my money back, but at least with this game the only thing I lost was time. It's a shame, I wanted this game to be good but I should've known better with Bethesda involved."
5986,What is this
5987,I'd rather live in a nuclear bomb shelter alone than play this
5988,"very nice game i pl;ay 1000k hhours and i love my self 
"
5989,is good
5990,I like overall concept and spend alot of time in this game. I spent some money to start off but ultimately am unwilling to spend much more than 10 dollars. My time playing consecutively begins to drop off and eventually I stop playing. It really is a wonderful game but they could back of the pay to play aspect when it comes to leaving the vault. Replay value would raise for me personally if this were the case.
5991,A fun game with seasonal themes. A must have if you play and enjoy Fallout of any kind
5992,epic
5993,I own the people in my Vault.
5994,woman + boy = child make internat
5995,this game is good lol
5996,THIS GAME IS AWESOME
5997,"good time killer, why? cos fuck time that's why!"
5998,Good game its simple and easy to understand the mechanics of the game ez to get into.
5999,FUN GAME
6000,"After many hours in, my vault deleted itself. No means of backup load. Such a waste of time."
6001,"Good game to come back to every so often. Game play can be slow, so you can sometimes have it running in the background or treat it like an idle game. Been playing on and off with one vault since 2017, and managing rooms, organizing layouts, arranging wasteland exploration and quests, and planning ahead is a good bit of fun for me. 

Would be nice to have some kind of multiplayer. The new version Fallout Shelter Online has that kind of stuff, but it is still only available on mobile devices.

Anyway, nice little game and you might find that you like this kind of stuff. If not, well, it's not the end of the world is it?"
6002,Dont play this game its so shit imo
6003,fun if u want fo something fast before sleep
6004,"Fun game... bit of a pay wall, but easily avoidable by letting the game sit for a while after the initial grind."
6005,"vry fun game o chill and vibe
"
6006,basic game works for killing time
6007,"its a good game
"
6008,Fully Automated Luxury Communism
6009,Very good game
6010,mmmm yes good
6011,Fun at the start but gets boring rather quickly.  All the games that used this model are the same.  At some point they become tedious and stop being fun.
6012,IS GUD
6013,Live under a rock simulator. 9/10 because some of my citizens kept lighting the place on fire.
6014,"Pretty fun, if you know what you're doing."
6015,"it took me 40 minutes to fail
"
6016,great time waster with out abnotiopus ads
6017,I made a room for mating and have 20 kids now
6018,i would but i got bored of it after a while but its free so yeah might as well try it
6019,"Kinda nice
Kinda boring
but free so poggers.

6020,
6021,"Time Killer, don't play unless you're free and boring during pandemic"
6022,fun managing game
6023,"nice
"
6024,long wait for goods yep
6025,Does anyone have a stimpak?
6026,the wait times are kinda garbage but i like to keep it running in the back ground while I'm doing other things and check in on it once in awhile
6027,"This game makes me feel so relaxing. I have spent a lot of time on the game, like A LOT of time (mobile version). Now i have returned to the game once again on PC platform. Hope i can have much fun while playing it.
Personal Rate: 10/10"
6028, n
6029,i  played fallout 4 and this game is like fallout4 but you are vault tec
6030,phone game is kinda fun
6031,its great
6032,"The Game Crash sometimes . Anyway . You can cloud your game and play on your phone. Its not a pay to win. And you can advance without having to wait after completition of stuff. because there is a lot to do.
Survival"
6033,yes i got a fat man
6034,it ok
6035,"While it's fun for a while (I've been playing for more than a year), it's not worth investing too much time or ANY real money.

The main quests offer interesting storylines, and the prospect of getting rare or legendary items keep you coming back for more. So does a degree of freedom to the layout and upgrades to your vault. The crafting doesn't seem necessary when you do a lot of quests, because the rewards alone should be enough to equip your dwellers, so you most likely will end up filling your warehouses with a huge amount of junk.

However, the game tends to crash every now and then, and a crash at the wrong time corrupts your save - rendering your vault unrecoverable. So if you've made considerable progress and it crashes - there is a chance that your precious vault is no more. Aside from that, the quests become repetitive after some time (there are WAY too few locations, it's as if you're visiting the same places over and over later on). There are also vault incidents that at higher levels (deathclaws) are frustrating and happen too often, so it's imperative that you have a well-equipped army guarding the rooms adjacent to the vault door at all times.

And so it's difficult to rate this game (despite it being free) because it's designed for long-term gameplay (as in finish a quest, upgrade a room, and get back later), while being totally unreliable due to the crashes that can make you lose everything..."
6036,7/10
6037,What a great game! It's easy-to-play and fun for everyone!
6038,"perfect game, recommend it!"
6039,"A little slow getting started as you have to wait for your vault to populate.  SIM City type game where you need to manage your resources and keep everything running smoothly.  Unique way to manage people and resources that I have not seen in other games.  Lazy, addicting game!"
6040,Good.
6041,Good Game.
6042,knknk
6043,Good game but gets boring after a while when u unlock everything.
6044,"This is an addicting little game. It's a simple management game, but with the quirkiness of Fallout and plenty of challenging bits without being too hard. If you're into those free restaurant/hotel/market games, this is like the next level. Def recommend."
6045,GG
6046,this is hard like trying to kill a tank wtih a stick it not going to happend but is cool
6047,slaps
6048,It's a good game to have to play between everything else you're doing. Still highly addicting though.
6049,fallout 4
6050, ccooooooooooool
6051,"Extremely fun, great graphics and a good building game. Makes sure that you remember all those iconic individuals from the past fallout games."

6054,very good game i like it
6055,"Its decent enough, more content focused on new vegas would be nice."
6056,Fun game to play while waiting for an update or download

Thanks to several softwares i was able to open hundreds of those lootboxes and it quickly turned into gambling (or suprise mechanic as EA would say). But its free so what did i expect honestly. Okay i think i put enough negative reviews."

6085,"A fun little section of the Fallout Verse, though I'd like it if pets and robots dropped more often :D"
6086,"This game is pretty bad, so here are my complaints. 

Quests are boring, sitting there for a minute in each room waiting for your dwellers to finally shoot the enemy is really boring and time wasting. It feels like it's forever until you finally progress to the next room only to do the same thing again. There is no option where you can autoplay the mission. You have to do it yourself.
My second complaint is when you don't play the game for a long time, you will start to lose resources over time such as water, power, or food.
My 3rd complaint is that there's only a limit of things you can do a day. It's not something you can grind for a few hours."
6087,"its good
its lit"
6088,"I play this on my phone, and I wanted to continue the same vault, but the cloud save is not available for PC.
I think that this cloud save is false advertisement, since it doesn't work on PC nor the switch, nor the Xbox.
It's easier to list what it works on, that is when you change phone. I haven't tested with the PS4, but my guess is that it does not work either.

The game itself is fun, but with it being available in all platforms there really should have a way to use this cross save, I do not want to start all over again every time I switch platforms."
6089,no the best but its a good game
6090,"A very fun game, totally recommend!"
6091,"I might have enjoyed this, but it is for some reason chained to real life days, You can't just play 5 hours today. You have certain amount of actions and that is. It's like those facebook games where you need energy to do tasks."

6148,"S-tier idle game.

It's more complex than most idle games, requiring you to pay more attention to what's actually happening. My main complaint is that the only music you hear in the game - [i]at all -[/i] are in isolated moments that don't make the game feel like it has a soundtrack, much. 

Update suggestion: Currently, Music plays [i]in the radio stations,[/i] but no one is actually [i]playing music.[/i] Have dwellers who are in a radio station play different instruments (Piano, Guitar - hell, could be what the background music ends up being), reminiscent of the radio stations you hear in the triple-A titles."
6149,Yes
6150,Just a casual fun game to play in short bursts of spare time.
6151,
6152,had this game on my phone and ipad years ago when it first came out. a lot more expansive than back then. idle game but takes a bit more attention if you care about achievements and stuff. i don't like bethesda games much but they did good on this PC version. bit of nostalgia game for me. i am also a whore for resource management / base building games so i might be biased on it.

EXPLORE THE WASTELAND
Send Dwellers above ground to explore the blasted surface left behind and seek adventure, handy survival loot, or unspeakable death. Find new armor and weapons, gain experience, and earn Caps. But dont let them die!

Vault-Tec has provided the tools, but the rest is up to you. What are you waiting for? Get started building your Vault today for FREE."
6194,nice
6195,cool
6196,a good low impact game .... when you just want some light play time
6197,I LOVE THIS GAME
6198,I like the simple and this is it. Even after all the missions are done I can still send out vault dwellers into the wasteland and gather material.
6199,Takes time but ya slowly get into it
6200,very boring
6201,"one on the best games ive played
"
6202,It's all fun and games with the Holy Moose as your Overseer and the only Lord and Saviour.
6203,nice game
6204,"A fun idle game. Very addictive. Not too basic, multiple dynamic elements."
6205,.
6206,"Good game to pass the time. I got really addicted to it for about a month. 
It can run on just about anything. 
Plan you shelter accordingly. Eventually you will have enough in game money to re-do it but its easiest to plan it out from the beginning."
6207,"One of the most stupid addictive games I¬¥ve played. 

Uno de los juegos m√°s estupidamente adictivos que he jugado."
6208,pretty good
6209,"fun on the go, gives me flash backs of old Fallout games But building a community instead of being alone."
6210,"I really like this game, but now that i've spent hours and hours managing an amazing vault that has over 100 dwellers somehow my savefile got corrupted so I can no longer play in my vault and have to start over in a new one. I looked online and the consensus is just ""Yeah you're F***ed mate sorry"". This is a real slap in the face"
6211,great idle game
6212,good game to kill time
6213,Better on mobile
6214,"just try it , its free"
6215,good for killing time
6216,ye
6217,it can be a little stressful but its a good chill out game
6218,It is a fun Simulator game I have played way more that 30 hours I have it on xbox and my phone.
6219,"Because my sister in law has it on her computer, when I first played it, I loved it, it is a good game."
6220,"Good for mobile, OK for PC. Semi-idle game with South Park style art."
6221,its very fun if you just be careful with resources i reccomend you have children as often as possible
6222,"I'm a big fan of Fallout 4, and I found this game addictive and charming. It's great for people who are looking for an uncomplicated game - I haven't tried survival mode so I can't comment on that. There's always something to do, whether that's fighting a molerat invasion or rescuing a hostage during a quest."
6223,"Another good free-to-play sandbox game. However, there is some big problem about this game. Your save file can be lost and can not be recovered. I suggested you to frequently back-up the save files to avoid this trouble."
6224,I ported my save from my phone to desktop. I'm having fun even if it's an old game

6275,"As much as people will say, the game is pretty cool and laid back. Is it a sell-out? Perhaps. But the game is not only very well paced (it really doesn't become grindery), it is even pretty well made (the self-awarness and irony is pretty good). It's a really great game if you are searching for a laid back fallout themed sim."
6276,big good
6277,This game is very fun and relaxing to play! I love it!
6278,It's a fun game for when you're bored in online school and have nothing to do trust me you'll have a good time.
6279,"its a decent game very good grafiks, and it very hard when you get over 100 dwellers"
6280,YES
6281,love this game its so fun to create your own vault but my problem is it needs a update ive done 2 runs and each have been deleted cuz i got 100 people and then theres nothing to do
6282,"TODD HOWARD!!!!! I swear that as sure as the sun rises the blood of your new born will run in the streets, you Mossad haircut. Like the sand in an hourglass soon your time will also run out. Mark my words. Make another mobile game, and I swear i'll have your head on a stake you limp-wristed, fudge packing fruitbar. Fuck you, you ZOG lord bastard. Make New Vegas 2 or the DC metro will have another riot to worry about."
6283,"While building up characters S.P.E.C.I,A,L. may take a while, that in of its self has its rewards. The quests are fun and just trying to balance things out to have a decent running vault is a fun challenge. plus the random attacks on the vault keep it interesting"
6284,"Fallout? No.
Good? Yes!"
6285,"Play this while waiting for friends to join you in playing other games, or in between queue times. It's got loads more to do that most resource management games do which is what keeps me coming back."
6286,Good game to just spend 30 minutes on every day
6287,"This game is clearly pay to win and encourages you to pay to pass time or at the very least put down your phone for 5 hours without thought.

There is clearly no strategy as so far its super easy and lacking complexity to keep you really interested, such as strategies where to build dealing with raiders.

Overall i would not recommend this game if you are looking for a game that is strategy since its one of those pay to wait games with simplistic gmaeplay."
6288,
6289,"Fallout Shelter is typical farm simulator with Fallout aesthetics. Unfortunately, farming is all that there is. That would be enough for time killing, but I expected to play Fallout Shelter and to manage Fallout vault, not some vague postapocalyptic underground farm. The only thing this game can offer is wish to play actual Fallout. 

Two main complaints about mechanics are SPECIAL system and Wasteland missions.  
First, SPECIAL system is totally redundant here. The only paramater that matters is endurance and it has to be maxed at 1st dweller level, because it determines maximum health increase of dweller that happens only  at level gain. There is zero explanations of this mechanic in game, so, player has no clue that his dwellers have low health and why. All other six parameters don't play any major role at all. They slightly speed up resource gain and can be maxed at any level without consequences. They may be affecting something when dweller is sent to wasteland they role is so much less than endurance and weapon damage. And this brings us to second thing. 
Wasteland is reduced to 2 backgrounds and 2 types of missions. 1 mission is when dweller goes to wasteland on its own and collects resourses until your call back. There is no interactions, no decisions, just automated resource collection. Second type of mission is one that requires three dwellers. They go to same building, thet you click on all rooms there, click on all enemies, wait until enemies are dead, click on dwellers to heal them, click on all boxes and order end mission. Sometimes enemies ask something but there is no consequences. And this is all. No mechanics, no diversity, no gameplay. I don't ask for much, but may be make not everything the same? At some early point, when your vault is developed a little, when you got the basic principles of resource balancing, game just ends. It turns into monotonous routine. Yes, you can update weapons and costumes from rare to legendary, but there is no challenge and no reward for doing so. On the other hand, getting legendary dwellers are impossible without paying for starter packs. There is absolute zero chance to get them from lunchboxes. Oh, lunchboxes. They are supposed to be some random high reward for hard task, but often they just give random common junk. It is so much easier to just craft legendary items rather get some from lunchbox. Thank god, it is not necessary to spend money to maintain vault here.

Summary: imperfect time killer with Fallout aestetics. If you want to kill time - just read any book."

Although Mobile Versions are also pretty good because it is more of an on-the-go time waster than a sit down and play for a bit kind of game."

6308,ok game.

6321,i Like it
6322,gg
6323,insuportavelmente dif√≠cil
6324,I'm such a gamer I prefer this one over the Fallout series.
6325,This is a fun time waster if you love the fallout franchise and ever wanted to be one of the oversears.  Now you can do your own tests.
6326,"Was fun for a while, had a vault for 2 years but the saving is so bad, if your computer powers off while in the vault you loose everything no previous saves."
6327,I really loved the wasteland-y feel of the game. An amazing game for free! I would buy it for 10 bucks!
6328,Lol lunchboxes have monetary value but can be easily modded... Believe it or not I actually like playing with a trainer and it doesn't even get boring for a good while. Ten out of ten would save money again!
6329,easy game to chill out with
6330,"after 60 hours in a vault grabbing achievements, game bugged out and now random dwellers are glitched and i can not even check how dwellers outside are because the game crashes every time. thank you bethesda for upholding quality within your games"
6331,Y
6332,Pog
6333,"yes
"
6334,"Really nice game, nice time waster and fun when you have nothing to do."
6335,I like it
6336,Fun!
6337,Cute fun game.  Played on iPad years ago.  Fun playing it on steam with achievements and learning the game all over.
6338,"perfect game to leave in the background while doing other things such as homework. check in every 5 minutes, collect your materials, and go back to what you are doing. oddly very enjoyable"
6339,its a good a show yah
6340,I grinded for all these hours now suffer from proto-gaycha with me
6341,"it is a fun game to play in online classes it may be a little grindy and pay to have an advantage but it is amazing
"
6342,yes
6343,good
6344,100/10 save files are cheat-able
6345,Good Game
6346,is good
6347,so fun
6348,"I am a big fan of idle games, and this is a good mix of idle and... not idle gameplay. However, I am also a completionist, and good lord are some of the acheivements a menace to get. The ""Raise a Vault Dweller to 50"" is misleading - you need to raise a Vault Dweller from 1 to 50, and the rare/legendary Dwellers you get randomly don't count.
Speaking of the Legendary Dwellers... I've played 50+ hours at the time of writing this, and I only have 3 Legendary Dwellers (I haven't spent any money in this game). You can only get legendary dwellers from lunchboxes and a couple of quests. If you want to keep your sanity, do NOT go for this achievement. You will crumble up into a pile of dust before you reach the goal legitimately. Otherwise, this is a fun free game to put a few hours into."
6349,this game is bad
6350,Its extremely difficult to make progress almost right after you start and you end up having to start over a lot because you failed. I was discouraged from playing this version of fallout because it requires you to constantly check in with the game and I am not able to do that.
6351,Chilled & relax game
6352,Its pretty nice and chill
6353,fun time killer
6354,very addictive
6355,"Never taught I would be this into it, It's brain relaxing for me."
6356,Great game definitely recommend
6357,"very nice game
"
6358,i spent 47 hours straight thinking this was the new installment of fallout! i was confused with the story and i dont know how to beat it:/ 6.5/10 i was kinda entertained wish there was more story!
6359,Free and a nice little time passer. Why not?
6360,"fun
"
6361,this game is clsh of clans but on steam
6362,esta bueno para matar el tiempo
6363,been playing this game for years never gets old
6364,"First things first, this game is annoyingly addictive! It will have you do a quick log on to ""just check up"" and then you find yourself stuck in a loop of doing this and that. There is always something to and things to work towards. It is nice and steady in the beginning but when you expand more and reach higher levels just be weary of the difficulty as it becomes quite a challenge."
6365,"good game
"
6366,Fun works with no internet
6367,Just a fun game to pass the time when waiting on things to finish up or when have some time to fill. It is free to play which is nice can be found a in mobile form as well.
6368,gay
6369,gg
6370,i do enjoy losing a whole vault to some mole rats
6371,"It's casual to intermediate skills kind of game. you can switch between windows to do something else entirely and can still enjoy the game without much of a hassle. It's repetitive, but still manage to make me entertained despite it was published several years ago."
6372,"I have enjoyed this time sink game so far. It's a pretty simple concept that keeps me interested several hours in. For a free to play game you can't really ask for a whole lot more.

Basically you create a shelter underground and have to build up a community to improve your situation. You have to maintain power, water and food resources and can recruit new survivors who find your shelter. Sometimes you get raided by enemies and you can equip your survivors with clothing, armor, weapons and companions such as pets. You can also send your survivors on quests to find resources or attack enemies, etc. You can match up male and female survivors in the same place and they might hit it off and have a child, adding to your overall community survivor totals, etc. You can name or rename all your survivors to whatever you want, creating your own family structures within your community, etc.

Some games were made for grinding and this is one of the better ones. I continue to want to see what happens next."
6373,good mobile game
6374,gg
6375,its really fun game. different than all other games i have played. they should really expand on this concept.
6376,cool beans
6377,indeed

6379,Fun
6380,good.
6381,"A decent worker-placement and base management game, if weirdly sanitized compared to its source material.

The good is mostly in the theming and stratgic base management business. 

The game's weaknesses are concentrated in its monetization, as should shock no-one. In this game, you pay money to make things happen faster and to buy grab-bags of potentially-useful items.

In short, you pay to turn the difficulty down and play the game less. That said, if you're going to charge for that kind of thing, do it in a free-to-play game. Doing it in a game with an upfront price, like for example Fallout 76, would just be gross and exploitative.

If at any point you feel like putting money in to this game, it probbly means you have gotten bored of it. Find something else to play instead."
6382,it is fun but very challenging. you get addicted to it just trying to figure out the best setup of your vault to be successful.
6383,LOVE IT!
6384,"89iip
"
6385,"I have played this game on darn near every platform that supports it. It is a nice slice of Fallout when I don't have the time to play the real thing. Surprisingly tricky to master, it is a good little game if you need something to pick up and put down as needed."
6386,"Nice game but its free for alll
"
6387,it good
6388,Nice for passing time.
6389,Such a great game which will get you to play it even after several years I will always remain a Fallout Shelter fan.

I like it.

So many fun by creating your own Vaults.....!

So much fun and Quests are really good....."

6396,"Free game, worth a play!"
6397,It is chill. Pay to speed though...
6398,Didnt think I would like this game as much as I do now. The game has some challanges that I think are good for anyone.

6400,good sim game

6405,perfect time killer
6406,"If you liked the theme of Fallout, but wished you were playing a microtransaction-based SimTower instead, this is the game for you! 

Somebody must be into this kind of game because they keep making them, but it sure isn't me."
6407,It is fun until your water and stuff breaks and starts a huge ass fire
6408,gg
6409,"the game always gets very boring after playing it for like a day, and you have to come back to it multiple times a day or all your people end up dead."
6410,"It's a simple but very catchy game. It's free, but off course, you have in game purchase, what is not required to advance in the game. Around 8h of playing I was near lvl 50 with 5 levels of rooms, 60+ dwellers and a lot of daily quests/tasks to do. Since you don't ""lose"" or ""die"" bye closing the game, I'd recommend for sure as a pastime casual game."
6411,this is SO FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6412,Needs an expansion.
6413,"Fun game, one of the better free games on steam."
6414,"Good game.
I recommend it."

6419,Nice
6420,it's a nice chill game
6421,Meh
6422,its ok
6423,Great game and very addictive.
6424,"Its just like fallout 4, where you'll lose your pet if you move to fast, and it randomly crashes! All in all, a great time waster, and I do have to say they've come a long way since the first release."
6425,+ Want to wake up early in the morning and chill banter with a cup of tea and a soft song in the background? Then play this shit (game)
6426,exactly why i spent $2k on a PC
6427,"An amazing game! If you are broke like me and love fallout, this is the game to play.
"
6428,"If you happen to have a PC crash/power outage, your save can become corrupted and you'll lose that vault with all the money you spent on it"
6429,"  
                                                                                         What I liked
I found this game because i played fallout 4 and there is a lot of references to all the other fallout games so its like i'm getting a survival game simular to oxygen not included vibes mixed with nostalgia and another vibe i can't quiet place. Its a great game.
 
                                                                                        RATING
 I give it a 7.5/10 because you can cheat the game by changing your time and collecting all the rewards. If 
                                                                 
                                                                                         TIPS
you want to complete the game Legitly don't change your time. also I reccommend getting 3 okay-good items and equip them to 3 people before you create a overseer office so you can have people who can beat the tutorial mission/quest. Also on most missions/quests always bring at least 3-6 Stimpacks and Radaway or else your guys might die and you will be punished by having to pay caps to revive them or If you don't you lose a viable dweller and all their loot the had on them"
6430,all you need to know is gets fucking insane when you are at low supplies for something just trust me
6431,yes
6432,"You actually don't need money to beat this game, although it takes longer, it's still satisfying knowing you don't need money to beat a game."
6433,ii
6434,I love the Fallout Universe and is a fun game with some connection to the others.
6435,yup
6436,"Not to difficult fun to play,"
6437,"Boring for PC, designed as a mobile app?"
6438,me when
6439,its fun but it tries really hard for you to do the microtransactions and if they cared more about actual level building instead of that it would be a much better game. but it is fun to just slap on and play while youre killing time
6440,c
6441,endless fun
6442,9/10
6443,cool
6444,I'm not the biggest fan of the Fallout series but I'm addicted to this one.
6445,I LIKE MICDONALDS :)
6446,I approve :))
6447,its entertaining.
6448,Great Game!
6449,This game is a waste of time unless you know exactly how defend deathclaws you will lose your save after 6 hours and cry yourself to sleep. Take it from me who spent 33 miserable hours playing this awful game. The only way to have fun is use a save editor to give yourself everything. This is fun for about 2 minutes until you begin crying again. Just please dont play this game unless you want to be bullied by everyone you know.
6450,great game

6461,decent
6462,Very entertaining! Recommended! Try out a few layouts before initiating the real one xD that worked for me... :)

6518,i am extremely addicted to this its so amazing i love it.
6519,It's easy to understand and play. And you can play it in half-hour fragment during the day. You don't need to play one to four hours to have a sense of progress. Which is important for someone with a lot on his plate. Even a kid can play it. No stress at all about it.
6520,me likey
6521,Nice game to play when are you bored.
6522,ok it good
6523,"This is a super fun, casual, time wasting game that you can spend a few minutes a day messing around with."
6524,"fun game, manage your shelter, go on quests, improve character stats, have a blast (oh wait, that already happened)"
6525,THIS GAME IS SO HARD~
6526,"This game combines the action-packed life of being in charge of large groups of people, with the semi-monotony of waiting for something to happen, resulting in a game that constantly keeps you on your toes. While at times it's difficult to manage all of the different needed rooms, the payoff that you get when a Raider Attack is stopped dead in it's tracks before reaching the second floor is worth it. One heed of warning, however,  that I didn't realize when playing for the first time: The game runs even when it's not open. You can quit the application, but a rooted time-keeping system makes certain events happen while you're offline. Most of the time, it's just things like dwellers having children, and rooms producing resources. Occasionally, though, you might miss out on new dwellers coming to your vault, only to never be let in.
Overall, I'm a huge fan of this game and its mobile counterpart, but it requires planning and budgeting to the fullest. Highly recommend."
6527,"bunch of people in a sealed chamber? ""Awww sh*t here we go again"""
6528,It's a good game to just put on another tab while your working and just check every five minutes. I even found Goodneighbor while exploring.
6529,"I PLAYED FOR 69 HOURS, that is all"
6530,Really great game to get on collect and do everything that needs to get done then get off and get back on later and so on.
6531,It get's pretty annoying and boring after some time. You can't pause to build. The random attacks are annyoing and it doesn't help at all to upgrad you Vault door.
6532,yeah
6533,addicting
6534,A fun little game if you like Fallout.  Lots of little things to keep you amused.  You should listen to the conversations the vault dwellers have amongst themselves.  I check on it once or twice a day to see how things are going.
6535,It good now shut the fuck up haters
6536,"The game is good, but the radscorpion attacks are the dumbest thing ever. I have a vault full of high stat, fully armed and armoured dwellers and yet one radscorpion will drain my entire stock of radaway and stimpacks while also taking 5 minutes to deal with. Honestly, it's incredibly stupid. Everything else is good though."

6556,A very gamer game recommendation.
6557,Fun chill game to play whenever you have time. Cute Fallout game. Really enjoy getting to be the Overseerer of a vault. You get to make decisions for your vault dwellers... Who works where... Who goes to explore the Wasteland... Who goes on special quests... etc.... You can play completely free and still have a great time.
6558,its so fun!
6559,Go build something better than Vault 88.
6560,"what i like about the game is that its a sandbox game, and its 3D, plus it does event stuff like if its christmas then everything will be festive, definitely play this game if you want a smooth, challenging and fun game."
6561,Need to be on a lot for the vault to function correctly but other than that its a good game
6562,NICE GAME.

6587,"The game mechanic that makes me not recommend is the dweller health calculation.  Dweller health only goes up based on the endurance stat at the time of level up, so if you level up to 50 and then train endurance you get nothing, and the dweller is basically a throw-away.

Also, I was excited to get power armor and bulldoze the wasteland, but apparently power armor is kind of junk in this.  (it's special stats aren't really useful for combat and doesn't provide any actual defense)

That dweller survivability thing is really irritating and could easily have been fixed.  Otherwise I'm addicted to this game."
6588,i do recommend i also recommend buying the started pack it gives a really op legendary pet an ok legendary weapon (infiltraitor) and a mister handy which i don't recommend sending to the waste it can earn 5000 caps but over 2 weeks but the starter pack is really strong i like the game and its not pay to win i hope this review is helpful
6589,Fun and light game that keeps your interest.
6590,"If you like tycoon games, you can play this game."
6591,"Muy bien, super fun. 10 starS!"
6592,It's a good game to just put on another tab while your working and just check every five minutes. I even found Goodneighbor while exploring.

6600,"ok i have not played a lot of fallout, but this game is amazing"
6601,"First point has to be Its only Worth playing With WeMod (Cheat engine) As it gets you paid content Free whats like the top tier 25% Gear. Like enclave power armour, or any other types power armour, Energy weapons, Big guns,Pets,Mr handy's. Originally designed as Mobile app that made it PSN and Steam its pretty okay to kill few hours.The quests ingame are dull and combat is stimpack spam, with few interesting dialogues that happen, Its basicailly one big ad for fallout 4  and the series before it came out.Building the vault, And seeing it grow the fun part. But tedious part is equiping each new vault dweller with armour and a gun, you have individually click on. Equip, Inventory management is a chore.Its more or less a flash game. Fans of fallout series will recognise many of items,locations in games. And its semi fun experience 7/10."
6602,Game good.
6603,im not happy about how much time on here but it is what it is
6604,"its aight

needs more rule 34"
6605,"So the game itself was pretty entertaining and I had fun playing it. After spending so much time playing, the game crashed and the file disappeared. Tried using the backup files but it didn't do anything, so don't waste your time and money to just lose everything randomly."
6606,"Doesn't progress for PC as it does for mobile. It's a find time sucker on mobile, but pretty unplayable on PC"
6607,i was doing good i had 55 dwellers and then an attack happens. My dwellers didn't attack and ended up dying. i went from 55 dwellers to 18. more then 30 of my dwellers died out of nowhere. Don't get super invested into this game.
6608,very fun
6609,very epic
6610,"Tooo easy to lose everything

6611,It's more glitchy than most free games. Wouldn't suggest getting it.
6612,no

6642,Its actually not a terrible little game if you really have the time for it
6643,BEST GAME!!!
6644,"As a free product, it is absolutely worth a try.
Unfortunately it has a very high longevity in the short term but almost absent in the long term.
Being very intuitive at the beginning it totally captures you and you are busy for hours and hours managing the cave, mentally planning the location of the environments, choosing the most suitable tasks for each of the survivors, but in the long run it becomes very repetitive and since they are not required special skills to move forward, all you need to do is level up to keep up with the growing strength of the enemies storming the base. If you have time to wait (or Nuka-Cola bonus bottles) you can play the missions, where you just have to click on the rooms and watch almost helplessly the clashes between your three men chosen for the mission and the various enemies you encounter. These missions are very useful in the beginning for obtaining powerful weapons and clothes, but later on the relative importance of these loot decreases tediously.
Technically, with mouse and keyboard the typical gaps of a touch game are accused. For example, you feel the lack of a multiple selection, because you are forced to drag men from room to room by taking them one at a time. It would have been practical to be able to manage survivors by being able to organize them into numbered groups that could be saved and recalled directly with the push of a button, as it works in hundreds of games simpler than this.
Nonetheless, it is an interesting strategy management game from which something deeper could be developed."
6645,very fun and can be played in the background. just a fun game to play when bored
6646,"First lets start with things I don't like. for starters, the limited amount of character customization for the dwellers. second, the expensiveness of the rooms you get later in the game. third, the very limited number of lunchboxes and animal crates you can get without spending real money. fourth, the wait time for quests and the like. reason 5, getting weak items such as a bb gun or .32 pistol from strong mobs. there are indeed some other things I dislike about the game but I can't remember them at the moment. Every thing else is fine. And this does happen to be my favorite game."
6647,it a good game
6648,"We all know this game...
One of Bethesda's greatest achievements!"
6649,gud bild gam
6650,"Just wish they'd put in a 'fast-forward' function. Past that, it's great!"
6651,very fun i just wish there was a faster way to get more vault dwellers then waiting for females to give birth then have the child grow up or having to wait for the raido
6652,wish it wasn't by real time and had a fast forward button but its a nice game to kill time with. would play til the end but haven't made it that far yet.
6653,"Fallout Shelter is just some boring colony builder, but you literally do nothing but left click occasionally, it's so boring, but if you got nothing better to do, check it out since it is free.

Nothing much I can say about the community.

There are a few bugs, but nothing game breaking.

The game runs fast and loads almost instantly.

Overall I recommend the game."
6654,"Fun, but not too easy. It has challenges and it made me really like the game. A few bugs but it doesn't affect the game badly. 10/10 could play for a while."
6655,0/10
6656,The gameplay is a little bit outdated compared to its siblings on the mobile version.
6657,Super Fun!
6658,Fires will erupt randomly in rooms and I feel like reality should take notes on that.
6659,Fun to play every now and then when there isn't much else to do. There's no pressure to buy the micro-transactions or use the premium currency (which you can get for free through doing tasks) and its just a chill experience in general.
6660,its good
6661,fire go ssssssss
6662,good.
6663,"Played this on PS4 a few years back and I actually enjoyed it a lot managed to platinum it but I didn't even try was playing the game and it's a great little challenge as it goes through trying to level up characters, find the best weapons and armour to find and give birth to more settlers in order to unlock more rooms. Need to a total of 100 for all the room unlocks and it's not easy you get raided and as you level up your settlers the raids get harder, from just plain raiders to Deathclaws that can wipe your base out in mins. Don‚Äôt have the right mind set and strategy for defence and attack you can see all your hard work go to pieces believe it's happened to me a couple of times. 

The game is different and sometimes it's a nice little break from other games to work out what to do next should you send some of your strongest on a mission or hold back as you don't know what will happen, I've done just that sent out 3 of my strongest on a quest to go get a legendary weapon schematic for only 2 mins later a raid happen luckily I managed to defend it off but depends on what comes. So far I have managed very well without paying any real world money even did that on PS4 so I've taken the same stragesyt take it slow and plan accordingly and I've done better for my 4th vault attempt lol, it's a great little game I recommend it a lot.
"
6664,"Mix of Tamagotchi and base builder.

Good enough.
Expect 10 hours of gameplay.

Little replay value."
6665,Play the god-dam game.
6666,<3
6667,"A great time on PC, datapad, or mobile phone.
Be the Overseer, and micromanage the lives of your own Vaultboys & girls!"
6668,Nice play but short. Emptiness.
6669,"It's actually pretty good, PC or mobile! although, I'm not the best, I still have fun playing, lol."
6670,"It's very fun and has many different aspects including some bits of fighting and base building. You have to choose the best characters for different jobs throughout the facility you create and I like being able to decide where I want everything and how I do things. All in all, it's a good game and I enjoy playing it, I recommend it to anyone that's interested."
6671,f
6672,It's fun and can be very interesting especially when you need a stress relief. Fallout fans will love it.
6673,Very easy/simple civilization builder.
6674,its good
6675,"nice
"
6676,ok
6677,I loved how this game is a why different game then all the other fallout games. This game is really fun if you like building your own home for Dwellers.
6678,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

6695,"5/10 - It's not a bad game but despite being free, I think you'd be better off playing it on your mobile device. It requires you to check on your progress regularly, which would be much easier on a phone or tablet."
6696,all you gotta do is pray when rushing and make sure mathew grant aint cheating on his wife then your good
6697,Basically a phone game that eats up your time. Sort of fun in the beginning but it wears on you after awhile. I'll run it every now and again when I don't really feel like doing anything.
6698,"Good game. Even though this game takes awhile to get going I have enjoyed it very much.
I gotta say though the pay to progress statement in the game is over the roof. To get anything good and fast you HAVE TO buy these things called, ""Lunch boxes."" Which is one of the things that I hate about the game.

Plus when your done you kinda feel lost in the sense of there is nothing else to do in the game."
6699,Fills Time
6700,gud gaem fun gaem
6701,"Game is just really boring and long. If it had a time accelerate feature and maybe an auto collect option, then I could passivly play the game instead of needing to stare at it for hours at a time.Loved the inclusion of the mysterious stranger though."
6702,This game is the perfect game to kill time and have fun doing it.
6703,nice game!
6704,that ass can fart

6736,"It's sooooo buggy.
Sometimes the game doesn't load at all.
And when you have an infestation and tell those with guns to go fight, they just run between rooms then stand there looking at you in  random room, and other characters will run into the room to take their job (no idea why as I've not touched their room) but they don't have a gun so also run around and look at you.
So you get more damage for longer, and infestation spreading because the controls for the characters seems to go out the window during an infestation.
No idea what's causing that but its annoying.

The game itself is ok but its a buggy mess and I can't fully relax when playing because of it."
6737,Warning! Extremely addictive!
6738,You can lose your motivation when you play for some time and lose everything.
6739,GOod game. I like that you have to check in once a while but i wish you could just pause the game for a bit since.... sleep.

6749,"Chill and casual game, i love it"
6750,"I sometimes like to just sit and play a game without a lot of energy. This is a great time-killer. There is always something you can be or could be doing. I like that there are so many little things to do.
Though I do wish I could rearrange the shelter a bit differently."
6751,"This is pretty much the run of the mill resource and time management type of game with a few microtransactions. But it at least isn‚Äôt a pay-to-win as you can ignore the shop altogether and build your perfect vault over time. Yes, it will take a lot longer to acquire the resources and dwellers to be able to do so but it is very much possible to play without bleeding your wallet. But as a ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù game, I wouldn‚Äôt really acknowledge it as part of the franchise to be exact considering some of the legendary dwellers that can drop from lunchboxes. On its own, it is a fine little time waster to play from time to time. I give it an 8.5/10 as it is an okay game to burn a bit of time with on your phone."
6752,Great time killer and even f2p it is fun
6753,Great game for chore day! Can leave it running in the background and just check in on your dwellers in between tasks!

6789,"The game was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and Behaviour Interactive, published by Bethesda Softworks, on Microsoft Windows (Bethesda / .net and Steam), iOS, Android, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Tesla vehicles, released on 15th of June 2015 (First release / iOS) and 29th of March 2017 (Steam), simulation and tycoon genre and what I review is the latest 1.12 version on 25th of May, 2017 (yeah, this game hasn't been updated since two months after being ported) on Steam platform.
Good and simple base building spin-off Fallout game though it has different characteristics from previous series, very innovative and unique 2.5D side-scrolling and ""overseer a vault"" concept.

[h1]Story 8,3/10[/h1]

The story follows a player who runs a Vault-Tec Corporation vault as the overseer and must survive in the vault with the dwellers in it by employs the dweller to their respective skills such as strength for power resources, perception for water resources, and agility for food resources, marry off a dweller couple to produce offspring or use a radio studio to attract new dwellers from the wasteland, arm them with weapons and outfits, train their SPECIAL to add their performance, craft weapons, outfits and themes from junks, and send 'em to wasteland.
In quests, there are many interesting and neat exclusive stories and events such as investigating ruthless raider cults, searching a ""mythical utopia"", rescuing a missing Diamond City detective or a Thanksgiving cook, saving a couple of a drink sponsor, scare off some raiders, fight off ""thieves"" in Christmas, etc.

[h1]Gameplay 8.8/10[/h1]

The main gameplay in the vault is mediocre for example harvesting goods (can be done by Mr. Handy) , crafting items, and mating and train the dwellers that only relies on time (can be cheated using the device time), even the rush feature will be useless other than to complete the objective if you have got three or more Mr. Handys.
However, the gameplay when your dwellers exploring wasteland or in a quest was quite good, for example the SPECIAL of a dweller which'll affect what they find in the wasteland, fairly inexpensive paid items, good exclusive stories, items and characters in quests, limited-time events (reused every year) and dialogue choices with full sentences instead of just ""sarcastic"" and ""what's going on?"".
The things i dislike are save data that's likely to disappear (can be overcome), lucky or unlucky if you're a free player facing a radscorpion or ghouls attack with only sawed-off shotguns and 38. revolvers and the combat system for not having timeskipper which over times becomes boring

[h1]Graphics 9,1/10[/h1]

2.5D Unity engine graphics with cartoonist theme that derives from Vault Boy a.k.a. Vault-Tec Corporation mascot and side view of the game, all I can say is the graphics and styles of this game are excellent for a -500mb size mobile game.
Even though this game's been ported to many platforms, even to PlayStation 4 and Tesla vehicles, the graphics still don't have or aren't upscale(d) is fairly disappointing. 
The old film slideshow, radiant green, and children's cartoon paper (?) from the 50s UI following from Fallout 4 and the previous installment like a characteristic of a Fallout game series are classy.

[h1]Sounds 9,3/10[/h1]

The retro background music with melodic and rhythmic musical instruments, each rooms ambience sounds, and cool sound effects which all of them are well packed.
The only drawback is that there's no official singer unlike the previous installment, so there's no known song in this game unlike ""Big Iron"" from New Vegas or ""Uranium Fever"" from Fallout 4.

[h1]Replayability 8/10[/h1]

Since this game doesn't have an ending or endless play, you can replay the game at any time, either for an event, mood to play, or to get fairly easy achievements

[h1]Overall 8,7/10[/h1]

This game's dope enough when it was first announced at E3 2015 and first released on Android, i was quite addicted to playing this game on my phone at the time and was willing to delete saves to get the best item drop and lunchboxes"

6796,"6.9/10.

Not bad for a free game. It has in-game microtransaction like most F2P game, which will help you progress the game. It's grindy and time-wasting if you wanna stay F2P, but still quite playable with (tons of) extra patience, or..., you could just mod it out lol."
6797,"fun (and free) game. <edit> game corrupted, unrecoverable according to my efforts and what I found online."
6798,fun and great game to pass some time.

- Grinding at a job for 5 years, to NOT receive a promotion. Chad did. 

Eff this Game."
6813,"ok , good enough for free game"
6814,Nice game when you don`t have time to play big games
6815,Solid free-to-play game.
6816,This has a good relax gameplay while still having the intense fights against monsters and other raiders.
6817,POOB
6818,"I like building up for quests but I don't like getting far in the game and then losing a room or some rooms or some levels that I got to because of some glitch, that is very disappointing.

If you are okay with losing some ground after taking hours to get there, then this game is for you!
I still love playing it, it is a labor of love, just need to figure out how to save any progress, so I don't get burned again.

6863,"Designed as a mobile game, it takes patience and twice+ a day regular attention over weeks to succeed, along with planning construction and layouts of vault facilities to learn to make things work efficiently. If you're patient, there's no need to pay for in-game purchases, but they can speed things along."
6864,is gud
6865,"I'm enjoying my time with Fallout Shelter, I would recommend this game if you have time and are patient. From what Im going through Fallout shelter takes effort ass well as time, One thing could mess up your entire Vault.

6872,Nice semi-idle game to pass the time. Interesting game style and fun theme/backstory
6873,"Not too bad, not too good either.

Achievements are easily obtainable."
6874,One that is easy to play and not much difference with the mobile version of Fallout Shelter. Great for times where one would just like to play simple games.
6875,"The experience feels like a solid and somewhat fun foundation for a deeper and better game that just isn‚Äôt here (yet). There are no vault decoration or customization options. No options to trade with other players or trade caravans. There is no need give any thought to the specific positioning of the rooms in your fault, beyond keeping your most essential buildings near your power plant in case of emergencies. There is no need to craft specific items or think about production lines. Any or all of these features would make Fallout Shelter a deeper and more rewarding game in the long term, as we see in similar mobile games, including very casual mobile hits like FarmVille 2: Country Escape and Township"
6876,"It is a fun game, but be prepared to spend some $ to enhance your experience. The cost may be held to a minimum with discipline, but if you are a completionist on a budget it might be wise to avoid this one."
6877,"funnn

And the best thing is it's Free !!!
Now they do have in game purchases if feel the need to spend money.
I highly recommend this game."
6888,This game is FUN!
6889,"I first discovered this game a few years ago in the mobile app store and really enjoyed it.  I was really pleased to come across it on Steam, however, having been playing for a bit, it definitely lends itself more to a mobile game.  The gameplay, while entertaining, is not particularly action packed.  Once you gain access to the quests, things do pick up a bit, but overall Fallout Shelter isn't a game you can lose yourself in for hours."
6890,"Fun and exciting! Worth playing until it become routine.
4/5"
6891,me gusta porque si
6892,I had this game sitting in my collection for over a year and finally decided to play it. This is actually one of the better mobile-ports that I've seen. It's addicting and enjoyable whether you're a fan of the Fallout universe or not.

Also, I looooove the parrot pets. Definitely my favourite <3"

6938,"The start of the game is rather slow, but after an hour or so of game play it picks up a lot & keeps you buys. It is also nice that your people will continue to make resources for a while after you leave. Be careful not to have anyone out exploring after you leave the game until your people & gear are stronger, they can easily die out there & cost a pretty penny to revive (but you can wait until you save enough caps). Overall a pretty fun game."

It stays true to its original source material and despite not being like the other Fallout games in the series, it also implements a few mechanics such as the VATS system and tweaks it to suit the gameplay."

6975,"This game was absolutely not worth 2/3 the time i spent on it, mouse/touch controls are horrible, quests are freaking boring and long. Lore might be fun at first but considering how boring quests are, the fallout 4-ish trivia just stupid. I only play this game now because i had an old save which i wanted to finish, i could not bare making another save because it requires so much raw time and attention, that is just totally unreasonable. So if  you value your time do not bother."

7019,"[h1] A Good Mobile Port from my Beloved universe: [/h1]
Fallout Shelter is a free to play game where you are an overseer tasked with building and maintaining a vault in a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland.

[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]
Game is a mobile port. It is a 2-D game. it consists of building a vault and keeping vault dwellers happy by providing food, water and electricity. The game is of 2 parts vault building and doing quests. each quest has time to complete like any other free to play game. You send dwellers out for doing quest The quest takes place in outside vaults mostly in a procedurally developed vaults. The ultimate aim in this game is to keep your dwellers happy and equipping and training them to be best. As it is a free to play game, everything in this game is time bound. So to speed things up we need lunchboxes[spoiler] [other name for lootboxes to evade gambling accusation :) ] [/spoiler]. This is the micro-transaction part which most free to play games employ to generate revenue. But gotta give credit to them for employing in a fair manner. You can get atleast 3 (or more depending on your luck) of these lunchboxes per week for free. So those who wait can get everything in this game if you are willing to trade your time. 

[h1] Atmosphere and Story: [/h1]
The world is ravaged by nuclear fire and many people  enter into vaults to survive. With this premise most of the time we will be looking at the vaults from a 2-D point of view and managing it. While doing quest its is of same with dwellers arriving at different procedurally developed vaults to do pre-destined quests. For a 2-d free to play game, the music is good. 

[h1] Other features: [/h1]
This game has no DLC's or multiplayer content. This is a purely single player game.

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
This is one of the good free to play game. If you are a fallout fan then you must play it. Others who are new to this series should give it a try. You don't need to know anything about fallout to play this game. The micro-transaction part is also well done. But there are some achievements in game that will definitely require to open those lunchboxes to get it. So achievement hunters beware, if you are not spending any money it may takes months to get those achievements[spoiler] (Play mobile version before to get to know the game if you are achievement hunting to optimise your time and gameplay) [/spoiler]. Overall it is a good game that everyone must give it a try."
7020,"Good to waste some time on, the constant attacks when you've just gotten organised can get annoying from time to time."
7021,vou dar a bunda
7022,Very good relaxing game that you dont need to dedicate you're life too!

7039,"game is ight
"
7040,extremely good for a 2D game. especially because it's free and my broke ass can't afford shit. would definitely recommend.
7041,not bad overall till it bugs on you then chances are you will lose everything in that vault since there is no transferring items.. cash grab!!!! .The saves are very limited and revise constantly ..with only one save.. greater chance for fatal bug to crash. cant recommend for poor overall save design. A bugged dweller that i cant fix is what doomed my vault..till this iv'e not altered anything so no external influence this was all their crappy coding.
7042,Epic game I love it. I also play it on mobile which is great!
7043,"Easygoing game, with a good memorabilia for the fans of the original game.
A production/reward game.

Slow at first, but enjoyable. Doesn't have longevity after you accomplished most of the obvious goals.
Wandering into the wasteland and doing quests becomes boring after a while."

7059,"NO WAY! Random incidents in shelter are WAY TOO HARD for mid-tier, when player has only around 40-80 dwellers, almost no any good weapons or gear, when dwellers levels still are pretty low, even slowly gaining dwellers and upgrading them. I've tried this two times, after what I did this conclusion. Way too powerful radscorpion and deathclaws, when player still is way too weak. Later they are ok, not easy, not weak, but at mid-tier this is madness a bit... You just trying to get better power source and getting condemned on way too exhausting and annoying gameplay... 

Devs, do you know at all, what entertainment is? To annoy people, means for you entertainment? Games should be entertainment, not torture. Nerf those and I'll change my opinion, regarding review :P"

First one that stands out is the first over seer quest in which you normally have to quit game and try again...be sure to save game otherwise you lose caps for overseer room and lose room on re-entry

Sloppy programming and  yet another attempt at a cash grab from this rabble....wouldn't pay a cent for this game or into this franchise again.

Deleting this game as I refuse to support the incompetence and arrogance of yet another company no longer focused on quality and merely interested in cash grabs"

7082,Game is not being supported properly. DO NOT BUY anything from their stores. Not worth it
7083,"yes
"
7084,"After enough playing I realized that this game isn't really good due to the following points:

1) Clumsy interface:
When you open the game after 24 hours you find that it has been ""running"" on its own like clicker games. In other words the resource generation has been going on on its own.

* But when you're playing it directly you need to constantly click on a room to receive the generated power / food etc. Why? This is just a clumsy interface design which interrupts your thought process.

* When people level up you need to click on them in order to upgrade their stats. This is again a redundant game mechanic which serves no purpose. And what makes it really annoying is that you need to do this multiple times because the first click will usually select the person instead of upgrading him.

* There are some people who're walking all around the rooms. Why? It becomes very difficult to select them because the UI prioritizes clicks to a room over clicks to a person.

2) Broken gameplay design:

Consider this, you're people are all working peacefully. Suddenly there's a breach. How in the hell are they able to break through a door, like butter, that was upgraded to level 3? But let's leave aside that part and consider the gameplay during a breach:

* All your vault mates will ignore the intruders and continue doing their jobs. Does that make any sense to you?

* _You_ need to manually arm the dwellers (but you get weapons much later in the game). So you need to have at least one dweller with weapons and _manually_... yes, you read that right! _Manually_ move that dweller to the room in which intruders have gone to.

* As your dweller fights the intruder, they'll quickly go to another room. So what does your dweller do? He stays in that room doing nothing. Really smart!

* Sometimes you would have armed people in the room with the weapons (in order to avoid the stupid gameplay mechanic mentioned above). In this case these dwellers will get back to their job once the intruders go into another room. So either you now need to move these dwellers to another room    -OR-   remove the weapons from their inventory and provide the weapons to someone else's inventory.

* In case you moved dwellers who were performing a task into another room then they'll stop doing their jobs once the intruders are dealt with. They'll start loitering around the entire vault. The onus is on you to identify those people once again and reassign them back into their room.

* Typically the vault intrusions will happen a lot! And it will upset multiple rooms at once. Combine all the broken gameplay mechanics mentioned above and you're looking at micromanaging the UI as your vault becomes bigger.

3) Lots of bad design choices:

* You get dwellers only when you create more rooms. And there will always be more empty rooms than you have dwellers. Keep that in mind while you're adding rooms.

* If you quit the game your explorers will keep ""exploring"" AKA die. Most of them will be dead. So you need to keep spending money to revive them and get them back. There's no way of setting up a rule or making them have the sense to return back when their health is low. The onus is on you to micromanage that while you're AFK.

 Summary: There is a _looooott_ of grind in this game. You'd be better of getting the fallout single player by paying an upfront amount and enjoying that game for several hours than playing this one where you're endlessly dealing with one bad design element after another.

7085,its good
7086,"really addicting
"
7087,Very addicting
7088,Fun thing to play as a time waster.
7089,yes
7090,Yeah. it passes time. Its fun. Just don't spend money on it. Its not worth it
7091,is's so good game for chilling
7092,"Addictive little game, patience is the key, massive amounts of patience."
7093,Good timewaster when you've got nothing going on.
7094,"AFTER a lot of time playing, i must say.. its very good game (for a month).
but there not much to do in it.
it is nice, the building the fighting, the baby making, but after paying it for one week, 
you can realize you only make the same steps over and over, and it not nothing more in it ..

7095,Nice little game.
7096,like the sims but without aging
7097,"I'm really liking this game, I wish that I could do more faster without spending extra money but overall it's a fun experience. It's really a nice game and has kept my attention for a decent amount of time. So yes I do recommend it."
7098,"Incredible game.  Played on mobile for years, excited to see it on Steam.  Lots more detail and gameplay than you would expect."
7099,It's a fun game.
7100,very fun i love this. except the fact that for some reason the radiers always come when im about to turn off the game to sleep. i do LOVE this game tho it's got me addicted.
7101,A good choice to waste couple of hours. After that it'll be repetitive and boring
7102,fun to have on in during school
7103,Pretty good. The micro-transactions are overpriced. I'd wait until a sale if you want to buy anything. I bought 40 pet carriers and I got 2 in game for free but I didn't get dogmeat :-(
7104,good
7105,i don't recommend it if you don't like it.
7106,Nice

7123,"My favorite casual game. Well I can't say ""casual"" anymore. Very addictive especially when I do missions and stuff. Crafting weapons and armors is the best part"
7124,it's a good game that you have to make sure you'r people don't die and collect animals resources consumables weapons and tools have the best realistic vault game with this truly curiously pressureing and exciting adventure.
7125,"Just keep the game open on the side and micromanage it whenever, its not that hard and gives you something to focus on. The difficulty spike comes very early so beware"

7138,gets boring.
7139,"its pretty good. reminds me of vault 101 in the early years, sending scouts out when needed but otherwise keeping the vault locked"
7140,"A game one somehow often comes back too. There are boring times in between events but those are nice when having a big vault to customize it. 
Most notable on my side is that though the game looks simple at the start it offers quite some depth once progressed and one starts to explore the wasteland. 
hint for producers: A little more customization at the beginning of the vault (like is it in a more or less dangerous zone) could be helpful in setting ones preferences to the game.
The cross system transfer of the vaults doesn't really work for me which is a pity."
7141,yes
7142,I loaded up the game as usual and My Vault just deleted itself and I spent money on it not even a couple hours before that
7143,"Fun, simple little game that does have micro transactions. I originally played it on Android and accidently discovered it in Steam so I installed it."
7144,it is a awesome survival game
7145,because i love it
7146,"gooooooood
"
7147,"If you play this expecting it to fulfil its function (which is to let give you Diet Coke version of Fallout experience, without commitment, maybe on your tablet while you're killing time), it does it's job well.

If you're coming for a Fallout related RPG experience, you need to reassess your expectations."
7148,ABSOLUTELY  FANTASTIC
7149,Great little time waster. Just log in every now and again to claim rewards and make sure dwellers level up and trained. Also fun quests
7150,Is good :)
7151,I used to play this game a tonne and suddenly game crashed and wiped my file to the point where I got to start again. There is no good support help service I can find to retrieve my file so i ended up quitting sadly. It was a fun game until that happened.
7152,Addictive! : )

7172,"Firstly its' a Free game with well composed 2d Falloutboy style animation, with only a few minor bugs ( I've noticed the mysterious stranger not showing up even though the audio plays for him and you have only 4 rooms to find him in or delays in picking up weapon animations ). 

Essentially, you build up a vault and its dwellers, collect caps and resources, expand / upgrade your vault rooms to make more or better resources, upgrade your SPECIAL stats for each vault dweller to improve their happiness and overall contributions in the vault. There is lots to time-synced grind for caps and resource peaks, lots of waiting for rooms to produce goods too which means you probably load this game up on a lunch break or before bed and leave it to collect. 

There some combat event sequences that can happen, you can send your vault dwellers into the wasteland to find caps, junk, gear, weapons and fight wasteland creatures, sometimes your vault gets attacked and you have to have station dwellers to defend it. There are also exploration sites you can visit to uncover caps, junk, gear, weapons and fight monsters hiding through the building(s). 

If you enjoy the fallout universe you will likely enjoy this ! 

8/10"
7173,"A fun little distraction, meant to be played in sessions over days or weeks. In-game time passes in sync with real time, so the game is essentially visit, catch up, and see ya later. It tastes a lot like a facebook game with better publishers.

Unfortunately the game is plagued with frequent crashes that make the experience painful."
7174,"click click click gameplay for ‚ôÇfucking slaves‚ôÇ , recummend for ‚ôÇdeep dark ,dungeons‚ôÇ"
7175,good
7176,fun to pass time
7177,Still better than Fallout 76
7178,"It is a free easy wating simulator no-brainer game and spinoff to Fallout 4. 

Session Routine
- building different rooms in the vault (rather in the beginning)
- assigning dwellers to different rooms/ tasks/ training 
- gather ressources/ dweller levelups in the vault
- sending dwellers on quests to different locations for items/ crafting ingredients. Up to 3 quests in a session, 
   but can be accelerated with in-game currency Nuka Cola

Pros
+ good to play if you don`t want to spend much time playing ( ~15 minutes)
+ some nice humorous Fallout4 references/ dialogues/ stories    
+ microtransactions are completely not needed and irrelevant (no pay2win) 

Contras
- after few hours you discovered all game mechanics and it becomes repetetative
- some elements don`t have any influence on the gameplay, are rather game filler"
7179,nijj
7180,"Free, fun if you like settlement management - very easy to fall for temptation and buy things, but not necessary"
7181,radscorpions are annoying
7182,"Easy Idle Game To Organize your own Fallout Vault. Have fun, everyone!"
7183,Entertaining - great game to hop onto for a few minutes at a time to maintain and progress your vault.
7184,"Its a fishbowl, but its pretty fun if you need a small waste of time every once in a while. I enjoy it much more on PC then I did on mobile. Its small enough too that you can forget its installed sometimes and just pick it up when you feel it. 

Fun little game if you like the Fallout theme."
7185,its ok
7186,How did I spend this much time on a terrible Mobile game
7187,Weirdly addictive and just enough Fallout feel to make it interesting.

7215,idle
7216,its fallout nothing else
7217,"I like the premise, its pretty much super dumbed down settlement building from fallout 4. however the implementation as a typical mobile game (even on PC) means that it demands constant attention and penalizes you for stepping away. there is no pause function (at least that I can find) and with the number of quick time events this puts you at a huge disadvantage if you ever plan to eat, use the bathroom or... have a freaking life. if there was an option to pause the game and tone down the jackpot sounds (designed to get you hooked) I would be much more likely to recommend."

7232,"so addictive, just keeping them alive and sending them out on raids (when you get the overseers room you can interact with the raids and heal your people).  For a free game it is great and I have had so much fun.  You don't have to spend money, but you can if you want to help them along.  As free games go this one has to be the best."

7242,MM so hot it makes me hard
7243,It is easy to play and a great way to relax.
7244,"This game is good, but the time it takes for some things is absurd. Overall it's a good game."
7245,well its a time sink a well designed time sink.
7246,"A game where it depends a lot on how you lay out the vault. You can do it well, be lucky and open up great things from the lunchbox. Or you won't succeed either and you'll be disappointed to delete it and start again.

Lots of expeditions that will take you to surveys from which you can get useful things. Attacks, whether by animals or humans. And finally the satisfied inhabitants of your shelter or half-dead and sad.

It's up to you how you conceive the game, but it will definitely entertain you, at least for a while."

7253,All of the women in this game are THICC
7254,"Plays in the background when you aren't there but there is enough for you to do in game (an idle game). Good concept complimented by fun mechanics. You can manage the items (clothing, weapons, and pets) your vault residents have, manage assigned tasks, and design the vault layout. You can buy boosters but they aren't necessary to win. 

Overall, a decent time waster and cute fallout inspired game."
7255,fallout mobile game go OOOOH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

7261,"Its addicting
"
7262,"While free, it tries to take your money every way it can. Also, like every Bethesda game, it's filled to the brim with exploits or bugs. I can always understand monetizing a free game in some way or another, that's forgivable to certain extents. That said, this game lacks basically anything resembling stuff to do, or content of any kind. Very little weapon or gear variety that actually matters - most is junk that clutters your inventory. There's some annoyingly stupid mechanics mixed in there as well - ignoring the ""cola conveniences"" aspect they use for more money. I realize this is a mobile game and was ported due to popularity, but wow does it unfortunately feel like a mobile game. Don't be fooled by my hours - it's almost all AFK. If you've never played it before, you'll have fun for the first while - after that you'll realize you did everything the game has to offer after you've built your first room or explored your first mission/point of interest."

7269,"If you are patient and you just want something to pass the time I would recommend it, if you want to play for hours not so much as you would need money to be able to advance at a fast pace.
"
7270,its easy but one thing is that i cant play it
7271,"This game gets pretty addicting. I stopped playing for a while after half my vault population got eliminated by Deathclaws. Lesson learned: Have all your dwellers armed and if possible, give them outfits with decent armor protection and SPECIAL boosts depending on what job they have. Do not make the same mistake I made. And go for quests that give outfits, guns, and caps. 

All SPECIALs are good in their own way. I'd say that the most important SPECIALS are Strength, Agility, and Perception. But if you think otherwise you may comment down below your opinions. 

This game is one of those games where you grind, boost things up and when you miss a day or two, things go downhill sometimes. I don't know what else to put here, I'm tired and as of typing this, it's 12:00 at night. I'd just cut this review short now and give you my rating: 6.5/10.

7293,I played this in the past so a old hand when getting a good vault going & had done a vault to max size on a android device. This is a good easy to play game when you want easy fun . It is easier to play on a PC  than on a phone as screen  is way larger on a good PC than a phone. I still hate the molerats swam  as you can loose your vault people so good to have caps to bring them back from the dead as bodies laying on the floor brings the vault down real fast going from green to red real fast. Another good tip is to train any mothers while waiting for babies to be delivered as at least your getting them skilled as you incress your vault population
7294,Its a fun free to play game
7295,"It's a great game, that you can play at any time, and it generally funny, with it not requiring much smarts. You can play a lot of differnt ways, like being a jerk to your dwellers or looking out for them."
7296,"oh, dear heavens no, i wouldn't recommend this game.
for starters, it's kind of a buggy mess. aside from, you know, regular bethesda sloppiness, the controls are ridiculously asinine and the game simply CANNOT parse commands. if you click on a ""dweller"" and try to drag him into another room, you'll find that you usually end up giving that command to either another random dweller (that you did NOT click on), or simply scroll around the screen.
Boy, i hope you weren't trying to move someone very far, and i REALLY hope you weren't in a hurry! because it isn't going to work, and by the time they get there, whatever incident it was will have spread. lol!
nothing scales well at all. once your vault list reaches ~100ish, it starts becoming tedious to do anything. it takes literally weeks (no really. literal. weeks.) to make high tier weapons and armor (you are better off just not doing that, obviously). 
i cannot stress how low bethesda sets the bar on this game.
as far as fallout, the reason i even installed the game in the first place, simply.... no. things that cannot be, are. things that are, cannot be. Bethesda has apparently been enjoying their time smearing their shit all over FO lore, so if you like FO, just don't pay attention... it's better to think of this game as it's own separate universe, from someone who has never had an original idea in their lives (which is what it is. bethesda couldn't come up with an interesting, new setting if their life depended on it. and even if they could, they wouldn't because that would be risky than copying someone else's work and sprinkling SJ and shitty marketing tactics on it).
i could look past most of this, honestly, if anyone can tell me what part of this game is ""fun.""
the waiting? the dragging dwellers places, and then waiting? giving commands and waiting? trying to do things and waiting? honestly, even when you ""play"" this game, there really isn't any ""playing"" going on. no real thought, strategy, or skill is involved. it's not a very interactive game, at all. almost every instant of the game is simply  waiting for arbitrary lengths of time. and when you're done with that, you wait some more. you can upgrade your room and wait a little less, but... we're talking about a few hours shaved off of a few days, in a lot of cases.
if you don't believe me, that's cool, man. it's a free. definitely check out other games while you ""play"" this one. stellaris is a good companion, or maybe MtG Arena."
7297,"Great game, even better on mobile because you can take it anywhere you go when you're bored. This game was a great appetizer to the release of Fallout 4 and it's still great to play whenever you're bored or not in the mood to play a more casual/laid back game"
7298,good to meme on
7299,"Fun game. It takes a little while to get started, though."
7300,"Do you want a game that punishes you for logging in? Then play Fallout Shelter!

Do you want a game where the optimal strategy is to wait as long as possible to log in and then do stuff as quick as you can before you log out? Then this is the game for you!

7319,"Very addictive, totally loving playing with my husband!! try it out!!"
7320,poders
7321,they added more aggressive microtransactions and advertisements.
7322,Another one of those pay to win schemes and loot boxes opening simulators. Quests become obsolete after 30-40 dwellers simply making you purchase help and assistance. Quests take you sometimes up to two days to finish unless you buy a Nuka Cola boost to finish travelling faster. It's a time waster and you will give up really quickly either when you are out of boosts or out of money. Quests are extremely repetitive. 3/10
7323,"This game is not very good. It is very slow paced, I mean very slow paced. Yet, if you log out and come back after a long time, some of your people may be dead, killed. This is the kind of game to play little and often.  Within 5 minutes I had 2 fires start in the same UNUSED room, which then spread because no one can get there fast enough. I also did a quest that needed survivors around level 6+, I sent 2 level 7 persons there. Then when I entered the room with the 'boss', he started throwing grenades that killed both of them in 2 hits. I don't get it because it said it was an easy task, no warning was given that it was dangerous, or hard. Either way, I haven't quested since, and to be frank, I doubt I will play this game again. I keep coming back every few days, but it is just to collect water, electricity and food, which mean nothing since no one comes to the shelter, and no resources are given. I think this game was poorly designed. It had potential, but I am disappointed."
7324,Nice
7325,good game
7326,It is a great game to play of you love strategy where you can get unique characters through lunchboxes lik3 longfellow but the only problem is it runs in the background where u find that resources become low quickly
7327,"For it's genre, actually pretty decent."
7328,pretty cash money

7340,"This Fallout game is not bad, I only played for so long, but that was because it was not very intriguing for me. It's not for me, but can be for others, so i'll give a description and a heads up about it.

It is a nice little shelter game with building your own homestead and caring for vault dwellers and arming a few of them for adventures. But I am constantly on the brink of a crisis when it comes to resource meters. 

I need dwellers to unlock things, but more dwellers increases food and water demand, and more food and water rooms to meet the demand increases the electricity demand to run them all, and building any kind of room and/or digging out dirt to make more room requires a good chunk of caps that are tough to get without things like lunchboxes or packs to provide cap rewards.

It is one of those games where you need grit and have to pull through tough situations and best plan out things in hard times. But gets nice to watch progress overtime. And of course, it is a free game, so it try's to tempt you with in-game purchases so help you progress/maintain.
"
7341,"for everyone that loves fallout , its a great time spender :)"
7342,"Fallout Shelter has been an imbecile game from day one and it still is. You're given a vault to manage, some cancerous inbreds to pilot and some blueprints to build. The issues in Fallout Shelter spread wide and are so dumb you're left to wonder if anyone working on this project actually cared about it.

First issue is the tutorial won't let you build anything and is an agonizing piece to go through. They made the instructions for children 5 and below. It's useless, annoying and leads nowhere. So you are forced to scrap one vault to get rid of the absolutely horrid build path they force on you.

From that tutorial onward, half the time you'll pick inhabitants in the shelter it will be by accident. You always end up having to redo assignments because of the clumsy drag and drop controls.

Second, this game can't be paused. If you need a bathroom break, be careful, because 9/10 the game will wipe your vault at the same time. Speaking of randomly generated events, they are fixed to guarantee your progression is slowed down as much as possible in a bid to incite your wallet to be used.

Third, there's barely anything Fallout in it, but the lipstick they put on the pig. Weapons don't have stats, it doesn't matter who uses what. You can equip a team of scientists with baseball bats and its the same as if they had laser rifles. It's incoherent, botched and quite frankly not worth suing anyone over.

I don't recommend this game, it's made to exploit people's troubles, not challenge anyone on a fair play field."

7352,"This game is for anyone who enjoys the Fallout universe as well as having a consistent time sink option.  Easy to pick up and understand with no pay wall barriers.  Quests to complete, lots of upgrades to your shelter to be had & good variety of dwellers.  Cool looking artwork and just a solid game if you're not looking for anything too heavy."
7353,"This game is free. It is a mobile port. It has microtransactions. It is a waiting simulator. It is singleplayer. Graphics are cartoony.

It is literally just a free, micro-managing, waiting game that you check in on once in a while. That's it. That's ALL it is. Whether you prefer to do this inbetween other obligations while working on your PC, or simply once or twice throughout the day, or even every other day.

Fallout Shelter just puts you into the propaganda-style Vault introduced in the Fallout series, it has good humor, and it is interesting enough for a free game to warrant my recommendation.

And to all of the people who passionately dislike this game. It's still Fallout, maybe not an open world shooter. This is not a game you are supposed to rush. It is not a game you are supposed to ""win"". It does have microtransactions, but you can earn those readily ingame as well, without paying. All those negative reviews ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about these various non-sensical issues are just trash.

The game has good humor, it is very relaxing to watch your dwellers do whatever they do, and frankly since its release on mobile platforms, it has come a long way with a lot of updates and new features. For a FREE game, it is absolutely recommendable. But buyer beware I guess, if you are an elitist moron who thinks you HAVE to rush through the game and ""win"", then you probably will not enjoy it."
7354,Great game to pace the time away :3
7355,"It's not fit for PC play, especially considering you have to leave the game running to do anything that takes a shit load of time, this is not how you port mobile games onto PC"
7356,"I have played fallout shelter across many platforms and I have never gotten bored of the game once. If you're looking to scratch your fallout itch, but don't want to dive into any of the main titles (fallout 4, fallout new vegas, fallout 76, etc.) this is the perfect game. While it may require more investment of time than other idle games, it can definitely be a hands off experience. However, there's something peaceful about watching your little vault dwellers run around and do their jobs. Even if you haven't played a fallout game before, this is very beginner friendly and will introduce you to the mechanics and themes of fallout without being chased and eaten by a yao gui."
7357,is vare fun and i defletle  recumend.

Simple to pick up and play but takes a lot of time and patience to 100% complete; I'm still getting those achievements slowly at time of review.
Free to Play; there are options to pay for things (lunch-boxes/Nuka Cola bottles) to speed some things up but not essential to completing the game.
A fun, casual game or way to pass the time on other things."

Fallout theme - disrespecting the universe.
Everything is done so that it would take you longer. 
Why have everything on one nice screen when you can click like crazy person 10 times and remember the numbers etc...
I must say I enjoyed it a bit. But as a whole this game is a crap and only good just to pass the time. I wish I haven;t spent my time with this one although there were some nice moments.

7422,"Probably, I cannot be completely objective, since I have never played a Fallout on the basis of which this game was made, but still
At first, this is quite a fun simulator / strategy game, but after about 20 hours of playing, nothing new can be seen here and there is nothing to do in it. It takes too long to wait for the villagers to run on a mission, return from a mission, learn, make a new costume or weapon. And the whole gameplay goes down to the fact that you enter once a day, do tasks, send new inhabitants on tasks, collect resources and leave until the next day. Now I have 113 villagers out of 200 with a happiness level of 84% and I don't think that I will open this game again

7435,Lagging 5 minutes into gameplay causes game to crash. Unplayable at times.
7436,"If you have some time to kill between work shifts or just feel like vegging out with a relatively lax strategy/building game, this is a decent one. The nice thing about this game is that you really don't have to pay any money (even though it's an option) to get any in-game items or perks. If you work at it and have patience, you can even make everything yourself and allow your vault to thrive.

I'd highly recommend reading the wiki if you want to build your vault efficiently. 

Don't forget to do quests once you get the overseer's office! Those quests are the most important! 

Happy vaulting!"
7437,It's a fine time waster that attempts to frustrate you into spending real money. However since real money and I are seldom in the same space I have no worries. The panic of vault dwellers when rad roaches raid is most amusing.

7442,"Could have benefited from some music, but the game is numbingly quiet. Apart from studding out your dwellers, nothing remotely interesting happens.

7443,gooch
7444,"great game, good time killer"
7445,relaxing chill game you can leave on in the background. so fun micro managing the vault and making things look cool
7446,"if you like to play god then this is one for you. with total controle of how your dwellers grows and develop, its up to you to put the right people in the right places to make the shelter work, after that its more like you are caring for your dwellers not just overseeing. being able to send them out on missions or to scavage in the random unforgiving events that will befall your dweller. WORTH IT #nosponsrd #cantspel"
7447,"While i understand the game is ""FREE"" it is extremely high maintenance, you must play often otherwise your vault will not ""develop"" the game doesn't pause except for disasters, otherwise everything else carries on running while you are not in the game.

One of the most annoying things i found in the game is the lack of defense for the vault. Putting dwellers in the front door of your vault does NOT necessarily mean they will hold back enemies. While you can train and harden your dwellers, it does not stop the enemy from passing through the front door of your vault, instead the enemy gets ""Bored"" and moves further on into your vault causing more damage and mayhem which could easily be avoided if the game allowed the player or ""Overseer"" to construct defensive turrets or some sort of deterrent.

Upgrading the Vault Door is a waste of Resources & Caps, they break down the door anyway.

That said! After my 25 hours of playing the game, i am fed up of having to baby sit every single individual in my vault to make sure they have a weapon, armor and stimpacks.

I would honestly rather play something with optimized survival options. eg: Something that allowed me to prevent entry into the base/vault/structure by means of health & defences, sort of like a Zombie horde survival game only 2D.

Thank you."
7448,It's fun game but has micro-transactions but who cares because is free just don't buy them and don't let them bother you.

7474,"Not very intuitive and quite boring for a PC game. Don't recommend, it's more suitable as a mobile game anyways."
7475,"yes
"
7476,recommend for time past while you are waiting.. harvest while u can
7477,This is good game
7478,"I haven't played this game much yet, but it's a pretty fun game. It's free to play, it's fun to play, and it's a pretty nice little game. Good time killer.
[h1]9.3 out of 10[/h1]

Edit:
After thinking about it more and some time after the original review was made, I can say the same things I did before. What I can't say is that it's 9.3 out of 10. It's free to play and has in-game purchases. It's more of a mobile game, and it's not really a 9.3 out of 10.
Suffice to say it is still a good game.
[h1] 8.5 out of 10[/h1]

It's a mobile game
I mean, 8.5? Dude, this game is good but NOT THAT GOOD!!

[h1] 6.8 out of 10[/h1]"
7479,"good game, after a while there is nothing left to do tbh but overall chill"
7480,"Well, unlike the mobile version it actually works to some extent."
7481,"Really good game, Nothing much to say."
7482,It was fun and totally not a cash grab.
7483,it always is a good time waster even if i haven't played it for a while its pretty balanced
7484,"a good game to have in the background while waiting for stuff to update/install, or wait for some mates to join you."
7485,level easy
7486,i like it
7487,this game has taken a lot of my attention. 10/10.
7488,if you play this on PC you have big pp energy.
7489,"This Game does require some patience and grind, but all in all its good fun and a nice way to spend time."
7490,nice mobile game when you want to play mobile games on your computer heh.
7491,"This game is perfect!!
.
For phones..
When you take a dump..
"
7492,"Look. Do what I did. Step 1.) Download it, Step 2.) play it for about 20 minutes at a time, Step 3.) Forget about it for an extended period of time, Step 4.) repeat from Step 2.
Optional step: download a cheat save and just screw around with the quests..."
7493,It's a video game.
7494,"It's an alright game, It's similar to mobile except you lose far more chances for rewards. A lot of the rewards on mobile you could get daily from watching ads has a huge advantage over playing this game on pc through steam. Progression on steams variant of the game is a lot slower for that reason, But it is still fun to play. It just takes longer to progress"
7495,"I have this shit on my PC, my phone and my PS4. Please help."
7496,its awesomeeeeeeee
7497,No new content in years and do not expect any ever as Bethesda has moved Fallout Shelter to the Chinese market for $$$.
7498,"It's no true Fallout game, but if your half asleep and want something to do this is perfect for you"
7499,"i love to play this game, at the start of it its kinda boring and you cant play it for to long this is a type of game were you play for a bit at a time"
7500,Good stuff!
7501,it kills time
7502,yes
7503,poo poo pee pee
7504,Fun building game with some cool tatics
7505,yay
7506,just love poo
7507,decent. not buying micro transactions tho
7508,"Just a fun game, imagine empire building but with vaults...  That has a ton a replayability..."
7509,"I actually played this game a lot longer than my profile says, but on the Bethesda launcher. Pro tip, don't use the Bethesda launcher for this game. Anyway, Fallout Shelter has been an enjoyable time waster and it's surprisingly exciting to watch your vault grow. It's not a particularly difficult game, but it does require thought and planning to make sure your vault succeeds. If you enjoy the Fallout series and need something small to play other than candy crush, this is the way to go."
7510,Better than Fallout 4!
7511,Better than 76 i guess.
7512,"I  never used to understand why Fallout Shelter was such a popular game and why so many people played it. I started to watch my sister play it and it seemed pretty fun. At first I would get frustrated because supplies would be scarce. Then I started to work more and more, some Dwellers did die because of the rush which can be frustrating but it's all about building it back up."
7513,pretty good game :)
7514,"It's a nice game, i really loved it."
7515,yes
7516,"Pretty good for a mobile game. Although it is pay to win, so that sucks."
7517,Poor sensitivity. Clicks on things when you don't want to and does the opposite when you want it to. Not to mention the annoying RNG where you're just given Deathclaw and Rad Scorpion back to back.
7518,Good Game
7519,fun chill game
7520,"thats a very good simulator. there are a lot of different kinds of rooms to built, places to explore, ways to survive or die, pets, weapons, clothes, designs of people and quests. :)"
7521,"I do not recommend games on this business model.

Ultimately it's a clash of clans / typical f2p model reskin where they block progression using timers and then set a paywall for removing the timers.

The art and anthill management is cool and faithful to fallout, for that reason it's worth checking out for the first 4 hours of gameplay. 

I would recommend not to sink too much of your attention into this for fear of wasting your money."
7522,epic
7523,gua ga ada hape ajg jadi main di laptop aowkoawkoakwok
7524,"A good way to waste time, not to complicated but not too simple.  I just wish there was a pause other than closing the game."
7525,"Very addicting, i recommend restarting and getting the first lunchboxes over and over until you get a decent start, it can be a bummer on some starts and take you a lot longer to get past the beginning otherwise. Don't over do it, a few 500 caps, a dweller/decent pet, and a high damage weapon will do you. [do the rush room success, then collect 50 water and skip the 50 food task. you might get a few extra lunchboxes this way for a slight boost. tasks vary sightly sometimes but for the most part these will 8/10 times be the first 2 lunchbox tasks]

other than that i really enjoy the game and working on a full vault of people raised from level 1 to have full stats.... try to start with endurance training as often as possible as it is the only stat that scales from level one and it affects max hp all the way up to level 50 which is max.

less review and more advice i suppose. but as you can see from my at the point of writing this having played 456 hours [lol sequences. going to make a 456 vault now!] that i really enjoy playing this game and even have maintained a vault since practically my start and just keep cycling my other two on whims.
its not that i have played everyday  since i downloaded it the first time, but my vault saves to the cloud as well so i get to return to it after months of inactivity [no gain to thaaat much wait time but still] and just pick my old vault up and start a new one on a different slot and have a fun howdy doo of a few weeks playing them ^.^"
7526,.
7527,"Fallout Shelter:Cool igrukha to kill time ,but quickly got tired, I did not see any bugs, the game is not demanding for the PC so it will pull ),"
7528,My #1 choice for killing time before my save was corrupted and I didn't know why. But I still give a thumb up for it. Just don't put too much money constantly because THERE WILL BE SALES.
7529,fun and free and strangely addicting.  good way to pass time.
7530,amazing game although with my first vault it went downhill very fast then in my second vault everything is much better and i even have a surplus of supplies
7531,de najs
7532,I like it!
7533,Good time sink
7534,Named my vault 911.
7535,Its a fun game that lets you bulid your own fallout shelter i have played it for a little bit and so far id the best game ive playen in a while
7536,go try it yourself
7537,"I originally played this on my mobile. Eventually wore out the fun, all good, it met expectations and more. Picked it up again to pass the time.

EDIT: Enjoying Survival Mode a little more now that I went back to normal and back because normal was too easy. I still don't like that the real difficulty increase seems more in the increase of events more than the difficulty of the events, but it's I think on the better side of a happy medium than normal mode."
7538,more of a time killer if anything install if you want that
7539,fun toilet game
7540,good
7541,its a mobile game but its still fun on pc
7542,not a good game
7543,yeah
7544,4 hoers play
7545,Soft way of being in Fallout World.

7547,"Its fun at first but after that, its sorta meh. Put a few bucks in at the start so I don't get screwed over by the mole rats or rad-scorpians but after that the game gets stale."
7548,Too micromanagy for my taste
7549,good game fun to pass time
7550,great game
7551,"A fun game for minimal attention at a time.  Not quite an idle game, but also doesn't require a lot of activity.  Good for that extra bit of entertainment on the side."
7552,Great game to zone out to
7553,Fun
7554,"Medium Sized Fun Free Fallout Themed Game, Lots Of Guns, Pets, Outfits, And Dwellers, Maybe Its Just Me But Opening The Lunch Boxes In The Game Is Just Tons Of Fun, The Only Free Game That Really Makes You Want To Purchase Stuff."

7557,"I first played this on IOS and loved it, its much better as a phone app to kill time. On PC it's slow, repetitive, and not as fun. Mouse control isn't as good as touching the screen.

Quests are a new addition. You assemble a team of a few people, wait an hour or more, go to a building, kill enemies, then wait an hour or more to come back. The wait time is up to 24 hours so that's lame for PC.

I still like the game but more fun can be had elsewhere."
7558,yes
7559,yuoilp;lloiuh
7560,I love the sex scenes ;)
7561,i like dis game
7562,"Definitely a good time killing game, but for a limited time. I've played for a good chunk of time on and off, and it's surely difficult to reach the bottom. You either have to put a lot more TIME or a lot more MONEY into the game. Frankly, I've done a little bit of both after ""resetting"" my best vault. Overall, I'm having fun making my little vault peoples do whatever it takes to build up! I mean... down?"
7563,its all fun until ONE person catches some fucking radiation disease and it spreads faster then you can cure it and then EVERYBODY is slowly dying. then you have to wait until everyone dies
7564,Manage your own vault. it's awesome.
7565,fun little game with lots of easter eggs and nods to the main games
7566,"A Slow-Burner simulation game,you can even play this on window mode,if you like organising go for it !"
7567,"I loved this game as it gave a taste of what Fallout 4 could be.  It was, and still is, fun to create a vault and utilize lessons learned from previous vaults to ensure efficiency.  The quests are fun and provide a steady challenge.  It is also great fun to equip vault members with outfits and weapons to protect the vault and make quests easier to complete.  Enjoy the game!!"
7568,It's good time waster
7569,fun

7574,"The ATF and CIA do not approve of this game, that's why it was made."
7575,"I find this to be one of the only freemium games I would play. They don't make you have to pay to unlock things like Mr. Handy's, lunch boxes, or Nuka-Cola quantum. You can play this game for free and unlock everything, or pay if you don't have the time to grind. It really works with my school/work schedule to check it in my free time."
7576,it
7577,Nice
7578,Good game to kill time. Not much else. Don't be like me and spend actual money on this game. I know it's tempting.
7579,Nice game to  have in the background to wait something to load.
7580,game is okay
7581,"It's fun and all, but i just think that its so unnecesarry that you have to be on the game CONSTANTLY in order to not have your people die. If you want soemthing fun for a couple days, the i recomend this game, but if its long term, DONT get this one."
7582,"Revised: Game is no longer crashing so I recommend it. Prior: Game crashes all the time. There does not seem to be any support anymore. Pick a different game to play, not worth the frustration. If they fix the crashing, then it is a fun game. It used to work pretty well and I got really far before, which was nice."
7583,"It's fun and casual, easy to play during Online school since it doesnt require full focus and has wait times"
7584,Ah yes. Great game

7592,is good

7599,its a good time waster and fairly smooth plus it is much better than it used to be.
7600,yes it cool game and have coolness and exist soooooooo therefore it is fun and coooooooooool
7601,"I do not recommend this game if you don`t have self-control. You start playing for 5-10 minutes and then you slowly start to get addicted and instead of playing when you have some free time, you put off other real-life things in order to come back to the game and complete quests or level up dwellers. 

I also do not recommend this game if you plan to get all the steam achievements. The one where you have to get 20 legendary dwellers is next to impossible to get if you don`t buy lunch (aka loot) boxes... You could get it, but you would have to grind A LOT. My guess is that you would need at least 400 hrs. This wouldn`t be that bad if there was a better ""end game"", but after a while everything seems so repetitive and boring that, in my opinion, it`s not worth the hassle...

That being said, if you don`t find yourself in either category and just want a game in which you can waste 20 minutes a day, this might be an ok game for you. I would, however, recommend that you do something productive with those 20 minutes and not waste them playing this :)"

the only thing i would ad is a auto collecter or a save game option"
7615,...
7616,"It's a fun little game and becomes more and more challenging the more 'dwellers' you have to keep the balance of resources, explore the wasteland and prepare for various attacks/accidents.  A bonus, for me, are the cheesy one liners and the random 'seek and find' guy which gives caps.  In my opinion, appropriate for most ages."

7620,"Three hours in. This game is fun for people who have played Fallout 4. It has neat references to the game and it brings back some nostalgia of playing as well. I'd recommend this game to play for 15-20 minutes a day. Maybe a couple of times a day. It's not quite an idle game but there is a lot of waiting around for your dwellers to gather materials from the wasteland. It's fun for what it is, though."
7621,I love itttttttt c:
7622,htfyd
7623,"When the slavic potato interNIET strikes again, or there is just for a few seconds nothing to do, the funny FALLOUT SHELTER is your savior! A game, which made me love it first point straight on as a fan of the Fallout Universe, eventhough it certainly has it's ups and downs like every game.

GRAPHICS: (24/25)
I find it difficult to value this term, since it's not meant to be a laborious and realistic thing. It's all in the adorable comic style of the Vault Boy and all the Vault Tec drawings in Fallout games, which is a very neat one. It just fits like a fist on the eye or an ass on a pot and is well designed for all platforms!

SOUND: (21/25)
The exhilarating music is gloriously fitting to Fallout and each room provides you with it's own environmental atmosphere like you actually stand in it. The guns provide different sounds, partially even from Fallout 4 / Fallout 76, eventhough I'm having sometimes weird cuts in a few action sounds like error-barking dogs and glitching gunshots.

GAMEPLAY: (22/25)
The game get's explained in all the details you need and the control is primitevly easy, so you don't have to strain too much about the game. Perfect for little opportunities where you wait on your comrades getting online - if you have any comrades at all - eventhough sometimes the hitboxes for picking items and dwellers is a bit buggy. In general it makes a lot of fun, eventhough I'd wish myself more features actually and more exciting quests. The game runs mostly without issue, unlike most people would expect from Bethesda.

CONTENT: (22/25)
Everything from Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 seems to be included into this game in terms of legendary dwellers, outfits, weapons and a bit of story as well. For Fallout fans, the cr√©me de la cr√©me (or however to write that) and the whole idea I think is very creative and extraordinary. The only thing that runs out is the motivation, when there's nothing to do anymore and you have to wait hours until dwellers come home from a raid or improve their skills.

SUM: 89/100
A result that speaks for itself - it ain't a main-game thing that you play the entire day, but for peaking into it here and then while doing other things, it's perfect! I love it and it's for free as well, soooo very communistic ;)"

7639,"[b]9/10[/b]

Fallout Shelter is a pretty cool game. It is not too hard and it does not take too much of your time to build something cool. It can get somewhat addictive after a time but also seems somewhat easy after a bit of time. When you egt to the point where you have a big base, good weapons and armour it feels a bit too easy. Because it is free, you cannot complain at all.

Overall, this game is great, especially because it is free."

7649,"This is a fun in-between game. This one is based off your computer clock, so it's pretty fun to check in every once in a while if you're playing other games or just to see how your shelter is doing. There are definitely ways to cheese the game to do better, and it does have micro transactions to expedite your missions/growth, but I like having it as a backup game for when I'm doing other things or playing something else. One issue that I'm running into though is that it won't let me craft the weapons development room, so I cant use my blue prints to make some of the rare/legendary items I'm finding. Not sure if it's just my computer or what, but I have at least 10 blueprints that I can't do anything with. Overall, its a fun game, but it doesn't seem to have some of the bugs worked out since it's coming from mobile. At least in my situation anyways. Still gets a thumbs up for what it is."
7650,it's cute and it's free
7651,Best way to kill time

I am going to recommend to everyone I know to avoid this game, and not waste their time!"
7667,It's free unless you want to speed up progress.
7668,Everything you know to expect from a free to play mobile title.
7669,"Fallout Shelter (FS) is one of those free games that you can't stop playing, due to a judicious mix of random elements and set strategies. 

As a vault manager, you have gained the resources to build your own vault, provided you keep the resources going. You need caps to hire the laborers to dig elevators and excavate rooms. You need resources to construct simple to advanced rooms, to supply the vault with food, water, energy, and other vital needs, from barber to weapons manufacturing. AND you need vault dwellers. You have to train some to improve them, use the rest to run the facilities, and send a few out into the wasteland to scavenge. You also have missions that can gain you extra loot, blueprints, and more. And if you introduce two citizens together and they have enough charisma, they may decide to make babies... 

There technically is no end to this, until you ran out of missions/quests, or you have maximized the citizens and/or the vault completely and you've built all you can built. But only your management skills can get you there... Can you recruit some of commonwealth's famous citizens? Can you survive ghoul or deathclaw attacks? How about other underground critter attacks? Will your vault become a tomb of your ambitions, or the crowning glory of the wasteland? 

All of this was presented in a very nicely parallaxed view that you can zoom in and observe the citizens at their jobs. But it's not that simple. As your explorers of the wasteland return (and you tell them when to come back) they can bring back loot, which can be used by workshops to build things, as well as various uniforms and weapons. Many uniforms can improve the citizen's SPECIAL attributes. And the better his or her attributes fits the job, the more s/he produces at that job. It all adds up. 

And due to all the bad critters wanting into your vault, you need some serious firepower, lest you find your vault littered with corpses after a deathclaw raid... But you can't build the more advanced stuff until you have the modern stuff... and you need a medical facility to build stims and whatnot to keep the adventurers out and about... 

It's all spinning plates and competing priorities. And that's what makes it fun..."
7670,its great if u have like time to waste i guess pretty cool
7671,fun
7672,"it good and free
"
7673,"Help ! , I can't stop playing."
7674,"Downloaded with low expectations, played with low expectations and by far enjoyed it."
7675,Needed a laid back game on a tired night that didn't require too much attention boy was I wrong still a pretty decent idler game that keeps you playing. If your'e looking for something to pick up and drop in a pinch or even for a mobile version on other devices revisit shelter!
7676,"All RNG, If you want a skill based strategy game that's actually strategic, Fallout Shelter isn't what your looking for."
7677,"If you go into this not expecting a mobile game, then you'll be disappointed. If you're already familiar with the game, this is in my opinion the best place to play it. Having a big screen and a mouse makes it a lot better to play than it is on a phone (especially if your phone screen is as small as mine).

If only Bethesda would take the presentation of this game and make an actual tactics Fallout game, that'd be be great. I'm sure they won't, but I can dream."
7678,"I actually played this much more on switch, and i really enjoyed it. Great game. 9.69/10 in my opinion.

7685,"This game is really fun and super good way to waste some time, overall i would give this game a 10/10. but i have an interesting idea, what if this game was VR compatible imagine having the menu in your left or right hand and controlling everything with your hands. (building, sending people out to explore, collecting your stuff, ect) just a fun idea i thought of. 100% recommend this game."
7686,good game!
7687,"fun game

7688,"Bethesda took a game that could be fun for a week and tried to use mechanics to stretch it into something that could be fun for 2-3 months, giving them enough time to add more content to the game. They failed. Fallout Shelter, despite never asking you to spend money, basically just gets worse the more you play it because you're constantly being badgered by intentionally annoying ""speed bump"" mechanics and other artificial barriers."
7689,Great way to pass the time but it is kinda a pay to win game.

7704,I like the game.. I hate posting reviews..
7705,pretty ebic
7706,I love this game
7707,"I liked the following elements: 1st assigning dwellers to correct positions, since choosing an incorrect one, results into a decrease in happiness; 2nd missions are funny and become challenging once your levels go up; 3rd completing tasks that give you great prices (mr handy, pets, etc); and overall training dwellers skills and put them into a good use. 

The following elements that I disliked: 1st once your level goes up, the enemies become too strong and you end up dying over and over in spite of having their skills trained; 2nd no additional prices if you play continuously, it seems that the game punishes you for playing more; 3rd the only thing that elevates dwellers' happiness is to have children."
7708,.
7709,"Nice way to  pass a little time, can go faster with micro-transactions but not needed to enjoy the game"
7710,It is just another way to enjoy fallout
7711,Great game and it also has many random things happen while you're away from your game.
7712,"Vault disappear after a crash. All saves corrupted and I lost everything. Have to start to 0.  At least I never put any money in it.

7726,"I've played this on my phone for a while, but sort of ""lost interest"" with playing on a tiny screen and dealing with battery life. So of course I decided to pop it onto my 32"" and start over for the sake of convenience and comfort. If you enjoy city builders and the Fallout theme, this is a pretty cute and fun amalgamation."
7727,"One of the better time wasters out there, nothing takes too long to do and it's easy to make progress without buying anything."
7728,"Its pretty good.. until you get a little deeper into the game.
In many Bethesda games everything is leveled - here it's based on the number of people you have.
Example: room fires do very little damage to your people at first ... however as you get more people fires become so much stronger. Everything else is the same way. Which in my view is a game killer - You simply don't get that feeling of accomplishment as in many other games."

7748,"Would love to see extra (perhaps even paid) content for this game !
Its amazing, probably one of the best Free to Play games ever designed - the simple engine has so much more potential.

Would be great to see some extra locations (!!!), skins for both environment and creatures, higher variety of enemies (!), more types of vault incidents (like for instance different types of raider attacks) etc

Game does become a bit boring after a few weeks - some kind of endgame would also make it more enjoyable for long term players.

Overall 5/5"

7762,"Resembles those web-page-based CGI games, but without the tension of multiple countdown clocks staring at you and the endless timed midnight crises that program you to get up in the middle of the night if you strive to become a serious player. Clocks countdown stop running after the round ends after you leave the game. Therefore, when you open the game, you pick up where all the operations have finished their (last) round of countdown and you can start by reaping all the finished goods and utilities. 

The game starts a bit slow if you buy a starter pack, literally, nothing happens and need you tending to for minutes: either you spend some bucks to start off faster, or you hang in there until you get the Overseer's office to start sending out exploration groups to specially tailored series of tasks. Is it worth it to spend a few bucks for the starter pack? I say yes, because it is a free game to begin with. The developers to deserve a bit of our appreciation. But does one need to spend more money on the lunch boxes, pet cages or quantum nuka-colas? I say that depends on how serious you want this gaming experience to be. It is quite possible to sink too much money into this game, putting it above an average (small?) game, if you aren't patient enough, though."
7763,"Relaxing game. I actually wouldn't mind living in the vault we've created.  Zero diversity, zero imported terrorism from the middle east, zero anti-white hated, zero illegal intruders. There is no ""muh reparations""  and ""muh slavery"" going on. No one burns other people's bunks. No rioting. No disrespecting the flag, no spitting on our ancestors. 

 My vault dwellers are well-behaved, traditional, monogomous, patriotic people of European descent. All the women have long hair. We don't allow freaks with tattoos and neon-dyed hair. No drugs or pornography is allowed either. Everyone is armed and allowed to defend themselves with as much force they deem necessary in a life-threatening situations. Property rights are respected.  We allow ALL speech, ZERO exceptions.  When a dweller goes against popular opinion, we don't call them ""haters"",  ""phobes""  or ""deniers"" ... we listen to them and we debate them. 

My vault is heaven.
My vault is what America once was. 
My vault is what America can become once again, without filthy communists and hoodrat, BurningLootingMurderers (BLMs) who hate White people."

7770,"Free to play, simplistic game. It has many features and there is always room for improvement. For me it's a great way to take some rest from fps games requiring concentration. The game offers pleasant gameplay experience and many hours of relaxing playtime."
7771,Noice
7772,"Fallout Shelter has some good ideas and in a sense, it's a bit like Dungeon Keeper. You level up your dwellers, put 'm to work and equip them with some familiar items and you expand your vault as you go along. That's a bit weird from a story perspective but whatever, it's one of the few (if not only, not counting mods) Fallout-themed building games we'll probably ever get.

Unfortunately, 'casual' mode is far too easy so you switch over to survival mode for a challenge, right? Well ... The challenge in this game is more in being sure to save and exit on time and logging in a few hours later on when the tasks are done rather than continuously playing the game because you will at some point be overrun and run out of Rad-away and Stimpacks or simply be incredibly annoyed at the endless amount of accidents and raids (Deathclaws appear at 35 dwellers on survival) that just take up a ton of your time that you would really, really want to spend on expanding your vault and micro-managing everything. 

The focus should have been far more on exploration and wasteland combat rather than defending your vault. Not only is it unrealistic that everyone and everyone and their mom barges down the door every 3 minutes, it's also terribly annoying. At some point you'll be in control of it and it stops being a challenge so then it just becomes busy work as you sit there waiting for the raiders to finally keel over and die long after the fight is over. The way you have to defend your vault by dragging people onto chambers (which doesn't work all too well on the PC version, for some reason, you can only drag them into the top half which often causes workers to be assigned to the wrong rooms for me) or assigning them a (temporary) defense job in that room is extremely tedious and doesn't really work well with the speed at which attackers move through your dungeon, err, vault. 

Then there's the fact that your dwellers can not auto-stimpack themselves. You have to monitor their health bars continuously. The health bars disappear when they run around and they will also obscure each other's health bars. Then there's the fact that unless you level up your characters, you can not click any other icon above their heads but leveling up early means you'll forfeit a lot of health because all your dwellers have low endurance so later on in the game, you'll be forced to get rid of all your high-level, low-endurance dwellers and start from scratch if you want to get dwellers that don't require a ton of stimpacks during each fight. Can you see how Bethesda really put thought into how to annoy you into getting those lunchboxes with high endurance dwellers? 

And what about the having an extra job in the form of having to log back into the game on time to make sure your explorers aren't killed in the wasteland? Not a problem on casual but in survival, there are no second chances. Woe you if you use the ""X"" to close the program, it doesn't auto-save and it won't remember your command to return dwellers so it'll kill 'm off! (So make sure you Save and exit from the options menu). I guess that can be forgiven to some extent, it is a port after all but the fact that you have to log back into a game to check if your explorers aren't dying is just busy work and obviously done to make the game more addictive rather than functional. 

Games should allow you to simply log off and go about your day and start 'm back up as if you were never gone unless they're persistent multiplayer games if only for the sake of the mental health of the player.

I guess what Bethesda really wants you to do is just buy their stuff so you can boost your way through the game. Buy more lunch boxes, buy more pets, buy more handyman ... Here's a hint for you: don't allow Bethesda to violate the series any further and just use a savegame editor for stuff you normally would have spent money on."
7773,Fun and relaxing mobile game brought to console/PC

7778,"This game is batter than Fortnite. You can build, you can increase your happiness, and blast your enimies."
7779,Great game
7780,"The game is quite an interesting and simple asylum management simulator. We take on the role of the Superintendent and must control the situation in the shelter: happiness, health, satiety and the number of people, their clothes, weapons, electricity for shelter and in general all the welfare of the shelter. (Fight raiders and monsters that they want to take our shelter and lives from our people)
Moreover, in this we have complete freedom. You can really build anything, the only question is whether people will survive in this 'building'...

As our development progresses, new rooms, characters, room customization options and many interesting quest tasks will open and the game will not make us bored, at least for the next 100 hours.

I really liked this game, because even taking into account that it is completely free, you can open everything in it, nothing really depends on whether you put money into the game or not. It's all about time.

The game is really addictive, the only thing that depresses me - the appearance of being ported from mobile devices. Because of this, it has a kind of strange mouse control, but for me personally. This isn't bothers everyone, but I didn't like it. On this, in principle, the cons of the game ends.

I advise this game to anyone who does not have money on the account, but you really want to play something interesting. That's what you need."
7781,"A cute little time waster game, perfect to have open while watching a podcast or political debate. You can train your dwellers in specific skills and put them to work, or train them in everything, give them the best weapons, and send them out to explore or tackle missions. The ability to play out the missions is such a nice touch, it really gives you the illusion that the game isn't a wait-to-play like Clash of Clans. The Nuka-Colas that speed up wait times aren't that hard to find either, making it so you hardly ever have real downtime in game. 

7/10"
7782,"Simple mechanics that make the game fun, yet easy to understand. The Game has lots of fun and interesting features, but it allows and encourages player creativity."
7783,yes
7784,"Almost the whole game is just waiting around hoping something will happen, clicking on stuff to make rooms actually do their jobs which is st00pid. For example power stations, after a few minutes, stop working and you have to click on them to make them continue working... and that is almost all you do in this game.
This game is Incredibly tedious and boring and there is no enjoyment to be found in it anywhere."

7816,Love playing this live on stream. Also a fun game. It's free so expect microtransactions.
7817,"It's pay to win. Perhaps I should've known, since it was free and not a demo, but I was disappointed all the same and feel I should warn you. 

It has problems with corrupted saves, which means if you put irl money into it you might lose it with no warning.

It is abandoned even though the store is still running. Which means no fixes for the game corruption problem that might lose you your money investment, no updates, and no new features. Seasonally, they re-release decorations.

The interface also has problems and lacks important features. You cannot pause the game and you cannot speed it up, so you're stuck with a very slow-paced game. During emergencies, you must click and drag each individual you want to send to help, and fight auto-focus features to do it which lowers your response time. There are no security staff roles you can assign so they automatically respond to emergencies, either.

I would have preferred to pay $15 for a small game that worked, than get for free a game which does not work. I was hoping for something that felt like early ""Oxygen Not Included"" with a Fallout theme, but instead I got an abandoned beta game that is restrictive in an effort to extort money without guarantee that money will not be wasted. 

If you play it (it is free, so why not) I do not recommend you invest a lot of time or any money at all into it."

Things can go to shit very quickly and at times it'll be very hard to get your resources above the required amount, but if you take it slow and not build a room every time you can afford it, then you'll go fine. Expanding your vault makes you more prone to attacks and raids, so expand as little as possible.
If I remember correctly, each new dweller increases the required resources, and each new room built, increases the required power, so moderate that well and make sure you can provide all that easily or you'll get trouble"
7842,[spoiler] One man and his 199 wives plus 100 pets [/spoiler]
7843,Just one of those time passer games. Nothing bad about it.
7844,GG
7845,"Let's first mention that the game is free and you only spend your time, so if you have nothing better to do, might as well try it. 

The game has microtransactions but they're not very intrusive, you get informed of them once, they're under the first menu button (F1) and you can earn a few teasers that scream at you ""Look how handy these lootboxes are, wouldn't it be nice if you bought MORE of them!?"" The lootbox rewards are ultimately conveniences though, you don't need them.

What you do need, is overseer mentality. The wasteland is a dangerous place and it will come to your vault, and like a true overseer it is your job to maximise utility while keeping your vault dwellers safe, oblivious and happy. They'll do as they're told, or they'll get sent to the wasteland and will only be allowed back in with decent loot! Also, people will basically breed on demand, and with anyone except (close) relatives. 

Keeping a steady production of babies is key to a well populated vault. Don't overdo it though, pregnant women won't participate against disasters and the toddlers take a while to turn into adults, so they're temporary resource hogs before they're useful.

Gameplay is superficially straightforward but I'd recommend getting some information on the underlying mathematics (unless you like figuring that out yourself, in which case, do. It's not hard, but it may be tedious). Some mechanics are pretty opaque, like your water/food/power needs. You get nifty bars with a green marker in them that indicates your needs versus your total stores of these necessities. Sadly, the marker has no relation to your actual production so it's mostly a half-arsed guess if you're producing enough to stay above the green line. Dipping below it is basically bad, you get punished immediately, even if you have enough production to keep your levels stable.

What actually bugs me about the game though and why I'm not recommending it, is that it's a game that rewards you for not playing. If you save and shut down your vault, the vault on the next load progresses 3 more minutes of in-vault resource handling, at which point the vault officially pauses. But not everything is treated the same.

Production like food, water, power, stimpacks will keep producing until you can claim the next set of products, your vault dwellers will consume for up to 3 minutes worth. Extended duration activities like training timers, crafting timers and wasteland travellers will keep running (protip: don't send an explorer out on Survival mode just before you go to bed unless the dweller's basically immortal). Pregnancies advance, and useless kids become functional adults. Most importantly, negative events do not happen. 

That last bit unfortunately means that it frequently becomes more efficient to shut the game down, than to actually play it. I've ruined my first few vault attempts 'cause I kept the game active, waiting for a quest party to arrive or an explorer to come home, while taking the resources as they were produced. I tried to use the Rush mechanic against temporary deficiencies but early game it is extremely unreliable if not outright disastrous.

So, people need to do their romance thing before they breed? Shut down the game. Travellers need to return to help fill empty rooms? Recall them, and shut down your game. Babies need to drop and children need to grow up? Shut down your game. Basically if nothing requires your immediate attention in the next 30 seconds, just quit. 

Especially on survival mode, if I kept trying to ""actively"" play, I just kept getting disasters which eventually started killing people because a bunch of women were pregnant and my explorers with extra needed weapons were still coming back. If I'd quit, no disasters would happen, the pregnancy timer would keep running, the explorers would come back, and I'd log in to a vault with more resources, more functional people, and more weapons.

So that's why I'm giving it a ""No"". It's far from a bad game to play, it's just that it insists on not wanting to be played. ""Hey Fallout Shelter, I want to play you and do stuff, that OK? No? Ok, 'No' it is."""
7846,"The only REALLY ANNOYING part of the game is that if you have a DEAD MR HANDY or VAULT DWELLER and you do not revive before leaving the game, they disappear! I was mad about this because it doesn't warn you anywhere"
7847,"Well polished free to play game, it is game you can play at your office or school pc pretending like you are working :) or it just helps in waiting while other games are downloading!!"

I was enjoying this (on desktop) for many hours till one day I come back and my vault is gone. The whole thing is vanished. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and restarting my computer, but nothing. Looking around a little online it seems I'm not the only one in this boat, and I find that especially bad for a game with real world money loot boxes in it (so money as well as progress has the potential of being lost). I'm done with this game, I really don't feel like starting another vault from scratch."

7879,fun fun fun well i think it is...
7880,"Forgot to pick the injections. Lost three chars in a level 5 quest, one of them level 39."
7881,"A good game to kill time.

Makes me laugh at how all the women vaulters look so unhappy when one of the males gets them up the duff lol"
7882,Can't even utilize the entire space you're given since they went and put a dweller cap.  Feels like the game is terrible early game unless you put money into it.
7883,Easy relaxing fun
7884,"Fun little game, love the slow pace."
7885,"Slightly complicated at first, but pretty fun once you get the hang of what you're supposed to be doing----like all games."
7886,ewaddfeasf ZASEDfR Tsrgwtarwnzrwftw44vqwD
7887,Fun to play
7888,"Better than Solitary,
if you don't want to play a real game!
(better than Fallout 4 too, lol)"
7889,ye
7890,It's really addictive and good!
7891,fallout shelter
7892,What if this game was online?
7893,An amazing game for a f2p game. Recommed this game !
7894,Got this game when it first arrived via Bethesda and it's been a favorite of mine ever since. I also got the board game version as well which was just released this week (8\7\20). Give it a try ! It's a very easy and enjoyable game for the whole family ! Fallout Shelter is a simple and easy way to introduce you into the post-nuclear world it simulates.
7895,"This is a most amusing way to pass the time in a strategic, rewarding way.  Very zen like.  I have much planning to do....and those fires!!! They drive me crazy......I will be back tomorrow..."
7896,I wish the hard mode was not so hard. Also why is there still no timer on prego vault deweller?
7897,"Great game. Anyone looking for a light RTS game this is for you. Simple, yet still interesting."
7898,"i just played this while i was playing other games when there was downtime

Fallout shelter is a game where the fallout build mechanic is taken to the nest level, when the whole game revolves around it!
some things are very slow paced like the training characters to get better stats and the mission time to get to and from. 

but i can look over those things because the game is alright!"
7899,It's a very fun strategic building game.
7900,Kill them all
7901,Great game to play slowly over time.
7902,good game frfr
7903,dave
7904,this is awsome!
7905,h
7906,"The game is fun to play initially until after a day or two then it becomes very slow if you do not pay real world money in purchase in game currency. Disaster events such as raider or rats became very difficult and takes a long time to clear while your base requires more resources. 

Overall the game can be very fun if you pay. I feel that the developer wants cash so badly that they don't want you to play this game without paying. Uninstall is way cheaper."
7907,GET NOOB!!!
7908,Great time killer. I like the grind and story to it. its like building your own community at the end of the world.
7909,Decent toilet game. Don't really feel like pay to play is being pushed in your face although I have bought some sort of booster way back when
7910,this game is very bad poor mechanics would recommened
7911,gud
7912,"amazing

7914,great time waster
7915,Clash Of Clans - Fallout Expansion Pack‚Ñ¢
7916,"Not much to say, for a free game this is definitely worth trying out. It offers a couple of hours of fun, although it can be grindy at times. There's a game-breaking ""bug"" that if you set your local time on your PC a few hours/ days into the future, the game will also progress that said time, allowing you to get to the Endgame quickly. If you like base- building, I would recommend you try it out, but don't expect too much."
7917,Great time killer.
7918,"cool game, can get boring after a bit though"
7919,"Its a freemium game, so there is standard thoughts on it. I actually played this a while back on my phone and just stopped, and playing it again, it doesnt feel nerfed or anything. Like, one of my favorite MTX mobile games was probably Madden Mobile, and that clearly got changed to favor spending sadly. This however, after a several year break? It doesnt feel too grindy compared to some other games, and its weirdly generous with premium goods sometimes. The lunchboxes are usually a pain to get, but the special sodas you buy to speed stuff up is actually shockingly plentiful sometimes on quests. Also caps can come ridiculously high on quests and wandering, and while quests lose decent amounts of health... wasteland searching was not bad at all, had a guy out for a few hours with less than stellar stats and not great equipment (not even a pet) and he barely lost health. 
Kinda got specific in the review, but short review, this is a solid free mtx game, and if it wasnt affected a ton in multiple years prior, i doubt bethseda will patch anything to spawn less goods anytime soon."
7920,Interesting and so addictive !
7921,"goof
"
7922,awesomee
7923,"I won't lie, for a mobile pay to win game, it is decent fun. The fact that I have 10 hours on it however is mostly due to leaving the game to idle and wait, rather than pay out for it to resolve things more quickly. Eventually I got bored one day, and just never turned it back on. If you have no money and you are looking for something to play, this game is ok. If you have money, you can do better than this."
7924,i spend too much money on it but i love the game
7925,"yknow, its pretty fun."
7926,A very interesting game.
7927,drop in drop out its a very nice game
7928,7/10...nice game..:)
7929,"It's the best free game that you can play. It doesn't get stale at any point, and you never have to wait for a ridiculously long time for stuff as other games do. It's fun, and I recommend it for anybody, not just fallout fans."
7930,"great game but updates are needed, gets really laggy after 5 mins of game play"
7931,only bad part is I bought a starter pack on xbox and it doesn't come back after that vault dying
7932,"Very nice game, highly reccommend."
7933,addictive
7934,its fuun
7935,"Free to play - but don't be temped by the Pay-to-win.

Go survival mode and the struggle is real.... :D"
7936,nice free game
7937,"this is the best game i have played in awhile, i love it!"
7938,"i mean its Bethesda guys/gals, they want your cash duhhhhhhhhh but besides that its a really neat game"
7939,This game suck
7940,"vury nice
"
7941,ez
7942,It's not terribly hard to figure out how to play and it's something I can do even while tired.
7943,It's what you would expect from a mobile type of game. It's fairly good any will have you putting in a fair amount of hours into it so I would recommend this game to everyone especially because its free!
7944,fun when u have nothing to do
7945,"
It's a great time waster. :)"
7946,"so addicting, no much comment, iy you like post-apocalypse theme games, you should try this simple one."
7947,"if you have decent equipment, raiders are easy enough to deal with"
7948,It's okay I guess
7949,yeah
7950,relaxing and satisfying
7951,Nice game!
7952,Great game!
7953,"very cool Donald Trump
"
7954,Simple but fun game to help pass the time.
7955,great game for gringing
7956,"A good simplistic building game, with a Fall Out skin"
7957,"Just Good Game. I like

"
7958,8/10
7959,So fun and simple
7960,"I guess it is kinda cool, but I dont think its cool. I got really far just to see what the game was like when your good at it but I didnt like it. Here's why.
It felt empty. There were times when I felt bored. There was pretty much nothing to do except maintain the vault.
There are more reasons but I hate typing stuff so ya."
7961,"Great 2D game, and some elements from the original games incorporated really well."
7962,Maybe
7963,fun have not even play most of it its a good game to pass the time
7964,Best thing Bethesda's done since Oblivion.
7965,Good Game
7966,yes
7967,its good
7968,"Its a fun way to spend your time, it has some legitimate complexity once you get 100 plus dwellers"
7969,pretty good game if you like the Fallout series
7970,productive and stratigy game i think?
7971,sheeshh
7972,It's not fallout 76
7973,"Side-scrolling post-apocalyptic underground city builder. Dig out and designate rooms; breed and designate people to work in them. Send parties out to explore the outside world, gather resources and recruit people. Not sure if there's an overarching plot or an endgame; I certainly didn't reach it. Free to play on Steam.  Worth a try to see if it's to your taste."
7974,good for when you have no wifi
7975,I play this when i'm in my online classes so i don't space out as often.
7976,"It would be an okay game if the ""touch-emulation"" would work better and if it wouldn't have controller support. 

Since this game was made for mobile and touch devices. the mouseclicks sometimes just don't ""click"" or you have to drag a dweller way lower to the room you want to drop him. Its not a huge problem but it annoys me more and more. 

Controller support is nice but there is no way to turn it off. Since I'm using joystick and gamepad for other reasons, I have to unplug them every time I want to play Fallout Shelter. This sucks! ;)"
7977,epic
7978,You can cheese by manually setting time. Have fun.
7979,it's honestly the only fallout game i still play that isn't boring
7980,"Great Fun Game

One of the best free games out there
You always have some thing to do.
Only thing is when you have over 100 people it gets a little bit chaotic.
No Pay To Win
No Bugs Found

Warning it's Addictive 


Greatings Dr. Grey"
7981,better than fallout 76 thats  for sure
7982,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0CJKvevs2M?autoplay=1
7983,just an amazing game for being freemium
7984,"Played the hell out of it on my phone years ago, a nice little near-idling game to pass some time!"
7985,yup
7986,"If you're looking for a game to play with a lot or a little  maintenance, this game is for you. This was originally a mobile game with time-gates for everything. At release, I was okay with waiting, but this late in the game it is easier to use Nexus Mods to speed up a very interesting and enjoyable game. Without the mod there is a pay-wall to get through in order to advance quickly. My advice is to mod the game and enjoy playing a great game. 8/10"
7987,"Great casual game...it was pretty addictive at first, but gets a little monotonous after a while. I keep at it cause I wanna get all the achievements...and I like playing dress up with the dwellers in the meantime. Oh and there's cats and dogs, big thumbs up to that..."
7988,It's free. Just try it.
7989,"good time kil;er but needs to make new dwellers appear more often, and yes I'm the real Barack Obama"
7990,yes
7991,a little boring but you will get use to it
7992,pog
7993,good arcade game
7994,"1. Play for days straight without break
2. Send people out into the wasteland with like 5 stimpacks
3. Forget about the game for a while
4. Come back to lots of dead people and also no power in your vault 
5. Make women have babies with multiple men with no break in between children 
6. Children are on their own once they are born
7. Deathclaws from hell
8. Again no power
9. Cats and birds available as a pet"
7995,xie pia pia
7996,like it Lots
7997,"Very addicting, but the fires and mole rate attacks etc get old after a while."
7998,"TBH it's a great ""casual"" game..its good for passing time... i've played it for like 17 hours,,and then got bored
man! this game makes you wait a lot..like you need to wait for a week to complete a quest if you aren't willing to do in-game purchases..overall its a good ""casual game"""
7999,Good game to kill time with. But might get boring after a while.
8000,"very addictive, a relaxing distraction from the world."
8001,tttttttttttttttttttttttttuytuututyiuuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuuuuuuu
8002,This game has the same feel as the Fallout Games in an App form.  I would recommend this game
8003,Free game... scratches the bored itch. Recommended.
8004,chill
8005,It's a basic but fun game.
8006,Very good game here
8007,"It's an okay free-to-play mobile game. From start to mid-game the gameplay is quite entertaining, but after a few weeks the gameplay will get easy and monotonous. This mobile game was released just a few weeks before Fallout 4 as an appetizer so maybe the late-game was ignored on purpose. This theory is also supported by the fact that you can trick the game into giving you in-game highest currency without paying for it real money. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2177122635 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2172222456 Unlocked all achievements!"
8008,"Fun to pass the time
You know what type of game it is, personally I feel like it is the best of its genre because of the game place as well as the references to Fallout"
8009,#GOOD
8010,Fantastic!
8011,"love it
"
8012,"Ehh, it's okay."
8013,fun small game when you just want to play without thinking to much PMPLOL
8014,"54 days play
achievement 33/35

no way to collect 20 legendary dweller
raiders dont visit my vault"
8015,Nice little indie game to kill time
8016,"i think i might be gay
"
8017,Didnt think I would be so addicted to this game
8018,Only thing I hated is that there isn't some sort of creative mode so the player can experiment with the game.
8019,it the best
8020,"I played this game on my phone a couple years back, and it translates surprisingly well to the PC, even though you don't have the benefits of alerts. While I wish combat was slightly more invigorating, but it's still pretty fun."
8021,"Pretty chill game

8023,"[i]Fallout Shelter[/i] is a surprisingly good management game. It's a mobile game that is somehow [b]not[/b] pay-to-win or demanding of time. 

The game is a city builder with basic combat mechanics that can be boiled down to rotating units between rooms based on their health and equipment.  You manage 3 resources and can directly intervene through a % risk for a brief boost. With a well-managed vault, you don't need such boosts and the boost isn't tied to any digital currency. After the initial setup phase, the game never demands more than 20 minutes of gameplay in a session. The game can be played very infrequently if you choose to not do exploration missions. 

Combat is all about equipping dwellers with weapons and leveling them through maintaining resource facilities or exploring. Management is basically just done once a day. Exploring is risky but it can be calculated and managed to a non-risk by planning to play the game at certain times. Weapons can be acquired through in-game purchase via loot boxes, but these weapons can be earned fairly, so the game is not pay-to-win. 

The game features a hard mode that blocks re-saves and has permadeath for vault dwellers. Players buying weapons to stop these types of games from failing is likely how Bethesda profits from this game. Hard mode is challenging and fun to invest time into.

8024,its better than fallout: a post nuclear role playing gaem
8025,"Fun game, Would recommend!"
8026,.
8027,Good
8028,yes
8029,"WOW a decent mobile game, the micro-transactions aren't scummy WOW. 8/10 wouldn't play again WOW."
8030,Fun fades fast
8031,"kill time with fallout flavor
"
8032,great game
8033,"If you are willing to spend a lot of time doing something else while this game is running, then its a good game for you."
8034,is gud
8035,Good for a nice chill time
8036,is good
8037,"It's cool at first, but as with all mobile-style games it quickly turns into what is obviously a cash cow using MTX to help milk it. I'm 100%ing this because I'm a biased bethesda boy, but I wont spend a cent on this. Don't bother if you don't wanna spend MTX, it will take you far too long to be worth it."
8038,Nice little free game.
8039,fun and addictive
8040,"Fun to design your own Vault and assign jobs to different characters. Progression is somewhat slow, you have to wait a while between resource productions and for pregnancies/aging up. Works well on my Win7 PC. Overall a cool game."
8041,I need a real life shelter right now.
8042,A nice addition to the Fallout Franchise.
8043,good
8044,its a fun mobile game if you know what you are doing. it is kind of needy if you want to do it right but other than that it is pretty good. there is a bug where if you change your time with your pc settings where you can basically get infinite everything excluding pet carriers. so you can get around the pay to win side
8045,cxzzxuc;'p[
8046,It's good!
8047,"Why do I keep coming back to this game you may wonder? Well I don't know. Classical Addiction paired with one part of boredom and at least two parts of its still somewhat fun.
If you dont like grindy useless games keep going and dont look back. If this indeed is your cup of tea, you should definetly enter. Tons of outfits and other collectibles, repetetive missions and long waiting times.
Welcome to Vault 001-999"
8048,if you get stuffed once you're stuffed forever
8049,a good game
8050,Fun building game in the fallout world. Great to play casually or on trips!
8051,"The game is a great little time waster...UNTIL IT CORRUPTS YOUR SAVE. 

Pros:
-Easy to play, easy to master: once you figure out the basic mechanics of the game, thats pretty much all there is
-Put in as much time as you want: While the game does reward investing your time into it, it can be just as fun for a more casual player
-FREE!: As in not pay-to-win. You can achieve the same results with a bit of time investment as with spending money in the cash store
-Sense of achievement: It really feels rewarding when you send your first maxed out dweller out into the wastes to explore

CONS:
-Combat: feels very repetitive and tedious; takes way longer than it should, especially at higher levels
-Dead end: you can rapidly run out of things to build in your vault
-Lackluster quests: The quests can quickly begin to feel repetitive; despite attempts at adding flavor, they all pretty much boil down to: ""go somewhere, kill everything""
-AT SOME POINT YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR SAVE: If the game crashes for any reason your save file will be  irreparably corrupted, and your only option will be to start a new game.

I had nearly 100 hours into the game, and while I was becoming  bored with it, I could hardly argue considering I paid nothing for it. I only had a couple more achievements left that I was holding out for when my game crashed. I didn't think much of it until I tried to reload my save, only to have the game crash again. After a few more attempts, I did a quick Google search, to find that I was far from the only person to have this issue. Worse yet: there was no way to fix it. over 90 hours of grinding ended up being for naught. While I could start a new game to get those last few achievements (and frankly this would probably have been easier than continuing my old save) the whole situation left such a bad taste in my mouth that I just want to wash my hands not just of this game, but the franchise as a whole."
8052,"Great game... Unfortunately, there's not much of an end game."
8053,"it's okay
"
8054,TF2 TEU FORT 2
8055,"While I do HIGHLY recommend this game, there are a few things that would massively need to be improved

Including:

The AI - Its decent, but god they suck at very simple tasks, like instead of putting out a fire they will either run to another room or just stand there. Another example is while on quests, they take SO long to actually shoot at an enemy, which sucks because they will just sit there while getting hit/shot at 

Mr Handy - While he is a purchasable option (with real money) he seems way too weak when in combat situations, and when he ""dies"" he costs 2k caps just to repair, for new players this is difficult as caps arent as easy to get compared to late game

There are many other things I could list but for now, the games pretty good

Overall, I give it a 8.5/10, its 100% worth playing if you have patience :)

"
8056,It s n i c e :D
8057,"Good game

"
8058,"This game costs some money to get started, but considering the base game is free, it's not too bad. I've been playing for 68 hours whilst working and I really enjoy it. Not challenging at all - apart from getting up off the ground - but has enough to keep me occupied."
8059,"Fun.
"
8060,Good Game just dont play it as offten
8061,YES
8062,i dont get it
8063,actually poggers

8070,"l;
"
8071,"i wish their was a ""meh"" rateing on steam because this game is super meh. its alright when you start of but due to the nature of the game it slowly just becomes the same grindy esc app with no real point. its not the worst app at all. i do find some entertainment in renameing everyone. i do wish their was a way to customise your base like fitting rooms with themes or colour or something just a way to decorate and make your vault look uniqe.sadly knowing bethesda and these money grabbing micro transaction apps anything somewhat intresting would be put behind a paywall. its not bad but its not good its just their"
8072,mildly fun
8073,is fun
8074,"goeie game, nice to play if you are lonely like me"
8075,good game i recommend it
8076,"It's fun and i have only torn my hair out once
10/10"
8077,its fun
8078,A good and simple game. Not much else to say...play it.
8079,It's a time consuming game
8080,entertaining to pass the time
8081,Nothing is better than living in a vault
8082,highly interesting
8083,its fun to do if you want to pass time
8084,"It is just fun to play, love it!"
8085,decent little zero brain power time killer.  kinda hit a paywall at like 25-30 people in the vault but.. still entertaining.
8086,"Fallout Shelter is fun at First until you have to start doing Upgrades for Several Days. and Your forced to Pay $ to get some good progress. of course you don't have to Give your Cash to Bethesda but The Grind is going to be slow that's if your Shelter isn't wiped out.  but it's a Free to Play Why am i bit**ing of course free games have Micro transactions. 
overall I find it slow but it is still enjoyable"

it's a good game!"
8089,"To be fair for a free game its quite fun as long as you know how to circumvent the cancer that is the micro-transactions. THANKS to robot9706 on github.io/FSSE/ for the save editor. It lets you add nuka cola, lunchboxes, pets, and so much more for free."
8090,"It's fun and quirky- and it's FOC. 
A bit like those stupid games on Facebook or your phone- but... cool?

8098,"The vault door has little to no heath, same goes for the dwellers. Loaded with microtransactions. Gets a lot harder after going farther underground. Not enough chances to get rare items unless it's junk (How funny is that). Lunch boxes are basically loot boxes (odds 80% of shit you don't need, and the rest is boring the same shit. 3% useful, powerful dweller or weapon. Don't expect cool looking power armour or updates that change the game.) Mr. handy is never atainable unless you pay for one. ( 7.99$) Boss fight are generic and stupid strong. (Only if you got stims and radaway). Objectives are easy for the most part, but again generic. (Unless you want lunch boxes or pets, but no Mr. handies though, good luck with that!) 
THAT'S ONLY WHAT I WANTED TO COMMENT.

FINAL RATING: 3.5\10"
8099,its very addicting and pretty cool for someone who has no money in their steam account. but it can be frustrating at times. it just requires a lot of patience.
8100,as fare as Fallout games go this one is not all bad being able to build your own vaults & oversee their prodgress is really great

8121,"shitty  bad game
"
8122,"This is THE idle game. It has slow pacing by being designed as a phone game, meant to be checked in with once or twice a day, micro-managed if that's your thing. 

As someone who likes stupid, idle games this one's kept me coming back. The monotization is both non-aggressive and surprisingly fair for a mobile game.

Early game things are rather simple and dull, but there is a tangible sense of progression. This is where the desire for the games in game loot boxes is hottest, but you can still earn a few of them a day by just cycling through the really easy to do missions in hopes of getting a legendary weapon/dweller-- something that's nice for the early game

Later game, once you've unlocked all the facilities and have missions on farm, crafting all of the shiny legendary items is easy and the game becomes more of a collectathon vault building game, where even 100$ of the in game lunchboxes won't give you much of substance. Seriously, I have no desire to ever purchase lunchboxes or anything of the type. Once you get three Mr Handies you're safe to just let the game idle, too. 

All together a fun game, if you don't mind how inactive it is. It's why I play it."
8123,"While the first 24 hours of the game is fairly entertaining, it seems more like a grind after that, 48 hours later and you're bored shitless. Well, I should say, I am."
8124,Fallout fans will have something to do in waiting rooms.
8125,You can YEET in this game 10/10
8126,"All my vault dwellers are heavily armed, perpetually pregnant sluts.
10/10"
8127,"This a generally fun game, mostly because it's basically The Sims but it's 2-Dimensional and is set in the Fallout universe. So the premise is, you have become an Vault-Tec Overseer for a vault that you have to grow from rock bottom. You also need to choose the number, but that can be random. Anyway, it can get infuriating in some cases, but it's mostly a chill game.

8152,No doubt. I love it
8153,veri gud
8154,"Fallout Shelter is a survival game with a similar Idea to it's brethren Fallout Games like Fallout 4, Fallout 3, and Fallout New Vegas but unlike such games this puts you in the perspective of the overseer or the Person in charge of running the vault and doing this really puts you in the point where you can feel connected to your Vault dwellers and you are responsible for what happens to them whether they are successful or Die horribly it is always YOUR fault."
8155,good game if you are just looking to kill some spare time
8156,"yeet
"
8157," For being a free game this really takes the cake. But if you're playing without a WiFi/mobile connection, it is unplayable. it lags out and shuts down. There's lots to do in the game, from building up your bunker, to sending dwellers on quests. Would recommend. Also, very minimal gore. The violence is violent but not like crazy scary. You also can name the dwellers which is really fun! Having famous actors or people living in your bunker is really fun lol. I'd give 4 and a half stars. Taking half a star down for not being able to play without WiFi. Hope this helps :3"
8158,GOOD
8159,"it requires a long time investment, but once you're in you're in DEEP"
8160,"The game is not for everyone it simply requires lots of time. The things you can buy are not mandatory and you can have lots of fun as long as you are semi willing to put in the time.
"
8161,Great to start up and play around for 10-15 mins a day. Highly recommend as a game to just check in every day or two.
8162,this game make relax after work

8166,it's aight

8168,this is good game
8169,Mostly played on mobile. Prolly more than a couple hours. Still playing. Not the most deep management game but fun to play on the long run.
8170,Get this game. It's free.
8171,lol
8172,Amazing game and its free
8173,"Decent, could be better"
8174,"Lengthy build up game. Quests are worked in real time. 5h 7h 15h +++ Shorten with Nuka Cola (Prem currency). In addition, there are many negative random effects that quickly wipe out a vault. Raider Death Claws Ray Scorpions are in constant attack. I have a huge base with 180+ residents. there is no real goal anymore. without the bots patrolling each floor and automatically harvesting the room, you would click dead. It's ok to play in between, but otherwise I wouldn't invest any money, in order to get more bots for the floors, you would have to pay something. The boxes you get are equipped with random loot, which is mostly scrapped into senseless junk. It is extremely rare that there is something good in it. Many have written that what you pay for the current vault only counts, yes that is true. If the vault is broken, your money is also broken. ;) Have fun with the game."
8175,Very enjoyable and not p2w. Limited replayability but is ok for a casual 5m per day game.
8176,"I recommend it as the game is simple, runs efficiently on most systems, and allows for a wide array of vault construction styles and variety in play. The graphics are simple, however this adds to the charm of the game as it replicates the art style used in the main series games for vault-tec promotional materials. The game is simple enough to play with little to no thought and I highly recommend it."
8177,Very grindy and repetitive unles you get yourself Mr Handy. Which costs real life money and most of the time isn't worth it
8178,"Like Farmville but by Bethesda. Manage cartoons, breed cartoons and wait real amounts of time to do things. Also! Don't feel like waiting for game progress??? Guess what! You can purchase it with the money that you didn't spend buying this game!!! It's insane!!"
8179,cool
8180,Who doesn't enjoy life in a vault?
8181,"It's a cool little side game for fallout fans and the fact that it's ""FREE"" is great but i put pressure on free because like most new/free games there are micro transactions not forced but ones that make the game much easier. So overall if you're scrolling through the reviews to see if it's worth a go just go ahead and download it you won't be sorry you did because this is much better than any of the recent crap they've released this is better than 4 and 76 here's my list of the fallout games I have played from best to worst down below.
Best:
1.) Fallout 3(Can't play on steam you should Buy on GOG.com it's the only one that works without fixes)
2.) New Vegas
3.) Fallout 1(own on gog)
4.) Fallout 2
5.) Fallout shelter
6.) Fallout tactics(Owned Disc copy)
7.) Fallout 4
8.) Fallout 76 (Of course it's last what else did you expect)"
8182,"cool

8183,"It's OK to kill some time... 
The Achievements are kinda hard to get though if you don't want to invest some money.
Anyway it pretty interesting. 


BTW Full achievements!!"
8184,.
8185,This free to play game is so addictive and fun! You get to be the overseer of your vault and start a new civilisation there. Amazing to watch time pass and more people come and go. Overall a fun game for everyone!
8186,"Great little time filler or something to do when you're bored, just over produce energy, food, and water, and level the stats to max then send your dwellers out in to the wastes to level them up and get the best designs :)"
8187,"Very fun, the random events keep you on your toes, there's reasons to play due to quests, supplies and expanding your vault forward! I DEFINITELY Recommend this."
8188,It's a fun game.
8189,It's a great game to play with no rush. I like to keep it in my second monitor and check it from time to time between my other activities.
8190,Lit
8191,fun
8192,While still a bethesda f2p game i find it enjoyable for two reasons: its microtransactions done semi right and its enjoyable. About the microtransactions its right in the way that you can gain some of the things you can buy without very much trouble my only gripe with it is that 2/4 things you can get are lootboxes while the other two are a useless robot and a soda that speeds up things and buys things the lootboxes are randomized each hour (so ive heard ) while they sometimes contain good stuff most of the time its useless trash that you could craft/find or resources that you most likely have max of. you can also find meager amounts of  caps that are mostly used to upgrade and buy rooms. while the other lootbox contains pets that give vault dwellers extra bonuses such as more caps while exploring or level to max without stopping.  i dont find this that bad since once again they can be obtained for free and dont have many exclusives in them just a small boost. i rate this game 8/10
8193,"nice
"
8194,"Its great! If you like Fallout 1-76, you will definitly like this game!"
8195,"Steam updated my game which, for some reason, deleated the vaut I had which I've put a lot of time into"
8196,"Good game if you like micromanage and got time to waste.
Quests are a bit boring and radscorpions are d**ks.
Don't spend money on microtransactions, it's not worth it."
8197,classic
8198,If yo like Fallout games you'll like this as well it's a fun game to play
8199,"[u]Played this game more on mobile and i think it's more suitable for that.[/u] It's passe can be very slow, and it's better to have it in your pocket sort of speak, like little pocket peoples. Works well with the fallout universe and offers a nice perspective to it. Take in consideration that it has some microtransactions and with that in mind game is going to try tempting you with shortcuts. You can even name your vault dwellers so there nothing stopping you in being the overseer to all your real life friends and make them work in the water treatment plant.
Long story short its a decent manager in the funny fallout universe with a decent amount of things to do and discover. Takes a bit of time but there are so many games out there that do fast. 
[h1]I recomend this trip![/h1]
[i]pro tip: on mobile you can use google rewards app to do some surveys from time to time ( you get real 'change' money) when you get enought $ you can buy some packs on the game. works well with the slow progression of the game[/i]"
8200,"I can't support this game.

Building your Vault for a few hours is fun. Creating stuff is fun. Exploring the Wasteland is fun for a few hours. The dialogues are really funny. So at first nothing wrong with the game itself.

BUT:
Literally forcing players to microtransactions if they want to achieve 100% in this game is a no-go. 
You need 20 legendary dwellers. which translates to: play this game for 4 straight years if you want 100%.
OR: give us money and you can have it instantly. BUT it's not guaranteed you will get legendarys for money. So It's gambling for REAL money in a singleplayer game. You can NOT support this."
8201,"decent for what is generally regarded as a mobile game

8202,epic game
8203,40% chance of incident or higher means 100%.  They lie.
8204,"""fallout shelter, except the game's broken""
hi, today its fallout shelter i guess
whats this game about?
its a game where you click and tap and click and tap
and you get bored in about 5 minutes
not because you have to wait (which you have to)
but because the game is so fucking boring that you will see everything in 5 minutes
heres everything:
shop
base
wait
thats it
bye gamers
also im selling gamerboy bathwater or something

8205,"i have finished the vault. dont give it that much praise for the time i spent, it was idle, in the backround while i watched youtube. i didnt need to buy a single pack from this, its a waist of time and money."
8206,Just good fun when you don't want something to heavy to entertain you
8207,I like the game a lot. I really like the quests when your finally able to do them. I also like that everybody is in the vault boy art style.
8208,"This game was originally released as a mobile, and then ported to the computer and console.  This shows up in small ways, where the game seems designed for a different interface than the one you're using.  That being said, I stopped playing on mobile because when my vault got large it was too difficult to try to see what was going on and select individuals on such a small screen...playing on a laptop solves that problem nicely.

Like many games, this one is most fun at the beginning.  As your vault starts to get larger, you have to spend more time managing resources and balancing factors like production vs. questing vs. training time for your dwellers.  It can be monotonous, or it can be challenging, depending on if you enjoy that sort of thing or not.

There are a /lot/ of achievements available for the game, and while you can buy your way out of the most difficult ones, they are all possible to achieve for free.  Just realize that doing so will take hundreds of hours.  If you're enjoying using the game to kill time and you're not in a hurry, that's not a problem.  If you're looking to rack up some quick achievements, though, you probably want to get the beginning ones for this game and then move on to another one.

The true joy of the game is in the references.  This game is fully set in the larger Fallout universe, featuring ""legendary dwellers"" that are characters in the other games, equipment that you can find and use in the other games, and even featuring a weekly trivia quest that requires you to answer questions about the other games in the series (or else be attacked by raiders).  For a fan of the series, it's a great way to immerse yourself on a regular basis without getting stuck in front of a console for 40 hours straight.  For someone not familiar with the games, it's a nice idle game that might provide a good introduction to the larger Fallout world."

8211,"Very fun little game to play while your just trying to kill some time. Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of a casual little romp through the wasteland. Building your base can be a lot of fun as well, however after awhile you eventually just run out of things do and the game just turns a little stale. Still a lot of fun though, easily a 6 out of 10."

8213,"This is like a million other Free to Play castle games. Except it's on your computer, rather than your phone.

8231,"Its an alright game. I haven't completed any of the fallout games, but I have played most. I would NOT consider this a fallout game. But, if you want something to pass the time, this is an alright Sims-like experience."
8232,"yes, but no"
8233,it's a ok game
8234,"I like playing this game. I'd rather play this in my phone though, but I can't because my phone is a potato so its a good thing for me its available on steam. I just wish there's also free stuffs like in mobile version where you can watch ads to get free stuffs every 5 hrs to 8 hrs I think, can't remember the exact length between you can watch ads though. and also where you can boosts in wasteland for 30 minutes by watching an ad and rush guaranteed from ad also. overall this game is fun."
8235,"Friends & Fellow Gamer's as a one should know, they need to check the reviews before buying or downloading a game. so I. Haunted Medic. warn you of the danger's and Horrors before getting this game. 1st is that the game data and vault are easily deletable and corruptble to the simple'st things such as closing your computer can delete your entire game with no save data to be found. 2nd the game has a very unfair diffuclty that, in many cases do not give new players the chance they need to climb the ranks in the Vault-Tec ranks of the fallout world. 3rd this game will only bring tears and pain to your life/Non canon to those who love to play the canon game's. so bundle up folks and bring out the marshmellows and hot chocholate as this nuclear winter of a game is going to be a doozy."

8239,"This review is coming from a guy who doesn't know shit about Fallout series and also for someone who has never played management/ colonial sim games before. This game is meant for people who want to get a gist of how management games might turn out for you for free. This game is meant for people who are struggling to pass time. 

There is no story to be told. There is not much grinding to be done. Nothing. All you have to do is keep your ""dwellers"" (as they call in game) alive from looters and monsters. They just happen to raid your ""vault"" (your safe bunker) at random intervals. 

Personally I felt some mechanics just don't make sense. For example, if your dweller succumbs to radiation or injuries, he dies. You might think that it's all over. You just have to take what's left of him (like gear, weapons, etc) and arrange for a new dweller in his place. But NO. You can revive him with in game currency which turns out to be incredibly cheap for some reason. It doesn't matter if he is arm less or he's a walking tank. You can revive him for just 100 coins. This is exactly why you don't feel the pressure to keep your dwellers alive. Even if they mow down more than half of your vault, you'll just be like, ""Nah, it's all good fam, here's a few 1000 coins, and boom it's like it never happened."" It's just impossible to fail at this game. 

At the start of the game, they call you ""Overseer"". It makes you think that you are in charge of your group of people and every decision you make might result in success or failure of your people. But as you play on, you realise that you're just making use of your people to get the job done. You just use them like tools and machinery for your personal benefit. Even if you screw up, you can get them back. 

You don't have to pay for loot boxes at all. Just send your dwellers on quests or let them wander off into the wasteland, and as they return you'll see that they come back with OP gear and weapons every single time. As I said, there is very little  grinding involved.  

Don't get me wrong. This game was a good experience for me. It helped me pass time a lot. But once you reach a certain threshold, it's just repetitive. I know this game is for free, and you can't expect a whole AAA experience, and that's why I have recommended this game. Probably this game was made by the devs to promote the Fallout series. And they are successful in doing so. They've caught my attention. 

Yeah overall a very good game. And oh there's also a pet mechanic. So cheers."

8247,"You get what you give in this game, in a very positive way. If you choose to make in game purchases (buying Lunchboxes, Pet crates, and bottles). Lunch boxes are very fun and satisfying to open and they make you feel rewarded than like a cheater== same with pet crates. Bottles are good for those all-night-ers when you just wanna keep playing. 

Anyone can be an Overseer, but can you do it well? This game puts that to the test. A great example of the ""get what you give"" notion is that if you make a habit of frequently checking to see that all dwellers are well equipped, well trained and developed, as well as making sure they are working a job they are most talented in.

I have done this and so far, in my 50+ hrs, it's given me GREAT satisfaction in my gameplay."

8258,"This has become my new obsession. Addicting and fun. I like that you can run it in the background in windowed mode while doing something else.

Make sure you don't expand before you have dwellers to fill the rooms, especially power plants. The more rooms, the more power you need. But also, don't overpopulate before you have the rooms, more dwellers consume more food and water.

My only complaint is that when you aren't playing, resources are still used, but not automatically collected. I suggest aquiring a few Mr. Handy to collect for you when you can."
8259,Fun but crashes when you get far into the game and becomes unplayable. Had fun till then.
8260,Fun little side game
8261,A mobile game on the PC doesn't feel like the right combo
8262,"Fallout Shelter is a fun, free to play base building game which allows you a casual play style. The game can be played in real time, so you can send your people out on missions and come back later to see what happened, i enjoyed setting everything up and checking in every few hours. 
At approx the 10 hour mark it started to feel a little grind-y to me, and i got board of it shortly after that.
For a free game this is a lot of fun, and worth the install!
9/10"
8263,"This can be fun in many ways, until you change the time, you just need to send your best character to explore, and change the time hour per hour until is health is low then you send him back, change the time again so you don¬¥t need to wait and then get the items, sell the bad stuff and keep the best guns to your self, do this multiple times and eventually  your main character  will be level 50 and your whole vault will be well equipped. Once you got to this point you will pretty much get everything you want in just some minutes. 
I am sure someone will play the game on the normal way and have fun but i just cant, there is no multiplayer, so nobody can attack my shelter and i cant attack other peoples shelter, imagine Minecraft singleplayer but you only have an certain amount of space to build and a few blocks to use, you will eventually have the best items and built in that space, then there is nothing more to do.
But its a free game and you still can have a couple hours of fun playing it, there is no bug or glitch besides the time changer  that really ruins the game and you can always play it on the normal way, so overall i think its 7/10, had a good time 

This video show how the time glitch works -

8265,"VERY addictive game, extremly fun to play!"
8266,Very good little game in the fallou universe
8267,fuck you
8268,"A decent time waster for when you got nothing else going on, it helps to have the robots going around and harvesting stuff but last I checked they cost money unless you get a lucky one in a box. Your population breeds faster than rabbits if you're not careful and digging deep down gets expensive quick.

Overall I had fun until there was too much going on and my computer started lagging, I got a different computer now so maybe I'll give it another shot.

Main gripe is that you can't fortify the entrance but considering it's a fairly simple game that kind of stuff may be just outside the scope of what Fallout Shelter is supposed to be."
8269,"Doesn't matter which platform I play this one, it's always a fantastic and fun time waster."
8270,Great game
8271,"Even if the game is old and there is a new version coming, its still pretty fun and challenging. Personally i dont care much for the multiplayer aspect coming in the new version, specially pvp, but thats just my preference, im sure it will be fun as well. 9-10"
8272,"Really fun game, but after a while, it just becomes a waiting game. I keep coming back to it every now and then since it seems to work better on PC than my phone. 

Lots of early game fun. Situations can become very dangerous quickly if not dealt with.

Mid game is a slower, but more rewards and more to do.

End game is literally playing an hour and then waiting until the next day.

Once you hit around 100 dwellers or so, you should have seen what the game has to offer and there isn't much left to do. You can still continue on, but that's just perfectionism or story content."
8273,fun lol
8274,Fallout
8275,Awesome game if you want something to play while waiting in other games.
8276,good
8277,it is a fun game that has so many aspect and is harder than it looks
8278,When raiders attack it makes no sense for them to take your Power.  Decrease the time of quest because it makes no sense to wait 10 hours only to search 2 floors.

8285,"It's good, and it's in short a mobile game but for PC users. So while it might have a few microtransactions I really don't mind it, it's still pretty easy to obtain things. 

Recommend it if you like fallout as a franchise and want something new and different."
8286,"Is fun game!
Is free!(When I got it was)
I like keeping track of everything in a journal!!
Is fun game!!"
8287,"Good  game..!!

8288,"Fun game, you better start planning your base since the biggining because otherwise it's going to be a pita to modify it

And always keep cloud saves on... dont do what i did because i lost almost all my progress"
8289,good
8290,It's a good time sink
8291,It show our Real World looks like
8292,Great way to kill a bit of time.
8293,Fun game all about thinking! I recommend it to all those thinkers out there!
8294,"If you like tediously working on a base for hours only to have the game go from difficulty 3 to difficulty 10 and destroy everything you created, then this is your game.

Don't play this game or if you do, don't get more than 59 dwellers. After carefully balancing and progressing in this game for 44 hours, little did I know that after building a community of 60+ dwellers (max is 200), base raids go from being a significant nuisance to wiping out your vault. Just look up Deathclaws. Three of these killed about 10 of my dwellers. All dwellers were equipped with guns and clothing, but of course my best gear had been sent out on Quests and into the Wasteland. You can only have 15 Stimpaks and 15 Rads in the game. At this level, you'd need more than that to keep your dwellers alive during a single raid, and need to equip each Quest team with 15 of each as well. After spending around 3000 caps to revive my dwellers, there was a mole rat attack and it wiped out my ailing dwellers (and the remainder of my enthusiasm for this game) where I had no caps and Stimpaks left. The better guns take hours and hours to craft and with raids occurring roughly every 5-10 minutes, well, I wouldn't waste any more time on this game. I assume now in retrospect that you would have to max out at least 10-20 of your dwellers with all SPECIAL stats and best guns and clothing inside the vault before acquiring your 60th dweller - this would take probably double or triple the time that I spent.

These base raids are dumb as well - the moment anything enters a room with dwellers, all dwellers systematically lose health at an alarming rate. It doesn't matter their level, they all have low health and all lose it fast the moment any enemy enters the room. Even if a single enemy is left in the raid, the next room that they enter will eat away at all 6 dwellers' health constantly even without radiation, and they will have less than half of their health left by the time you can send more dwellers to their death in the same room.

I am guessing that other reviewers on average spent less than 40 hours on this game and simply are unaware of what I have mentioned."
8295,XHT
8296,cool
8297,i like to cheat on this game cuz its so eazy lmao
8298,Good little game if you just wanna kill some time and play n the back round while doing other stuff.

8302,"1.7.2020.									Game #136

Back in 2015, after fans of the Fallout series heart that they would have to wait a couple of months more before they could play Fallout 4 https://store.steampowered.com/app/377160/Fallout_4/, Bethesda offered a solution to ‚Äúease‚Äù the wait.

[h1] A free-to-play fallout game. Oh, dear‚Ä¶[/h1]

Now, it would be unfair of me to say that I, or anyone else, was surprised when Bethesda announced that this would be a free-to-play smartphone game with micro-transactions. I mean, that‚Äôs how mobile games work right, also, ‚ÄúDo you guys not have phones?‚Äù (Blizzard spokesperson, 2018). What did surprise many of us was when this game got ported to consoles and PC (or, rather, Steam). 

[h1] He who shelters us from the atomic wasteland, and to whom we own everything we have, including our lives [/h1] 

In Fallout Shelter you play as an overseer of your very own vault. You use your mouse to move around the vault, click and drag your vault dwellers around, build new rooms and just take care of your vault. It works well, actually. You get a bunch of random vault dwellers, you assign them their roles and you watch them do their thing and improve at it. As they do their stuff, they will make stuff for you and you can use that stuff to make your vault bigger, better and so on. You gather various resources to make your vault function properly and make sure that everyone in it is happy. It sounds quite relaxing, doesn‚Äôt it?

[h1] I thought that I would have fun with this game‚Ä¶ [/h1] 

I was actually glad when this game was announced for PC. I thought that I would have a nice little game to run in the background as I do work and stuff and only check on it, every now and then. That is how these games work too. You play them for a little bit, you turn it off, you do something else and when you come back you check and see how much your vault dwellers have accomplished. 

[h1] ‚Ä¶ but I wasn‚Äôt having much fun because I didn‚Äôt have enough of a certain resource. [/h1] 

Now, as I was playing this game, I noticed that my vault wasn‚Äôt improving all that much. I mean sure, I built a few rooms and I assigned each of my vault dweller something to and that was that. I had to wait, I guess. I kept waiting for a long time for anything to happen. My vault dwellers were improving, sure, but they were improving rather slowly. I thought that something might be wrong with the game. So, I kept turning the game on and off, checking to see if anything was changing, but not much did. However, everything changed when I finished a certain goal got this one resource. A lunch container.

[h1] Don‚Äôt forget to pack a lunch box. If you don‚Äôt have one, Bethesda will be more than happy to sell you a few. Of course, they are completely optional [/h1]

Sure, they are optional, technically, but the amount of cool things I got from one of these lunch boxes put everything I worked hard to achieve as an overseer to shame. I got so much caps, lots of power, a dog companion and even a vault dweller that looked like a God when compared to other vault dwellers.

[h1] Once you open your lunch box, the game gets fun again‚Ä¶ until you finish your lunch [/h1]

So, I played around with the new vault dweller and bought a few new things that I didn‚Äôt even plan on buying until much later (because of all the caps I got from that one lunch box) and was having fun again, but, really soon, I got to that point where everything was running smoothly and I could only wait. My new God vault dweller was out of the Vault trying to find adventures and loot. So, I was back with nothing to do but check on the game every now and then. 

[h1] I thought you might not have had your fill, so I brought you another lunch box. Don‚Äôt forget, you can always buy more from us. Of course, they are completely optional [/h1]

I got another lunch box as a reward for finishing a quest and after opening it, the game suddenly got fun again. I got a bunch of cool stuff, a robot maid and basically, lots of cool things I could never even dream of getting when I was just, you know, playing the game. That‚Äôs when I decided to stop.

[h1] Fallout Shelter just wants you to have lunch [/h1]

This game only ever seems to be fun after you open one of its lootboxes. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just a boring grind/waiting festival. Normally, when I play free-to-play games they at least let me have some sort of fun with the promise of more if I fork over some cash, but not Fallout Shelter. Fallout Shelter basically says: If you want to have any sort of fun, you have to pay but don‚Äôt think that that one time purchase will last forever. 

The sad thing is, I can really see how this game would have worked if Bethesda made it so you could actually make more progress without opening lunch boxes. To make any sort of progress in this game, you have to wait for a very very very long time. Too long for most of us. 

[h1] Sure, other mobile games do this too, but not many of them do it so soon [/h1]

I‚Äôm not going to say that this is the worst free-to-play game out there, because it isn‚Äôt. There are much worse games (probably) out there but that isn‚Äôt saying a lot. Point is, if a free game tells me that the only way I can have any sort of fun in it is to buy things, I will, respectfully, find another game. Fallout Shelters thinks that just because it has ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù in it, people will forgive all of its intentional grindy mechanics and pay up so they can have little bits of fun.

[h1] There are much better free-to-play games out there [/h1]

Honestly, I know my review isn‚Äôt all that great and detailed but I think I can safely say that, unless you are willing to spend some money OR are willing to wait an excruciatingly long amount of time, you won‚Äôt find anything fun to do in Fallout Shelters. 

Next game: Fallout New Vegas

Comment: A good game to kill time and it's even free!"
8308,Fallout Shelter is a great Fallout spinoff that I can play for hours!
8309,"""Fallout Shelter"" is and always has been a cheap way for Bethesda to make more money off of those who can't control their wallets and get way too invested in a game built to eat up your money much better than any game with a static price can.

Although my Steam time relays that I have only played a few minutes of this game, I played this game back when it came out on a different platform, therefore this isn't an accurate assessment of my time with the game. It was more like I spent hours wasted on this title back at its first release and am back to relay how detrimental these titles are for the masses. Although it isn't any news that these cheap ""free-to-play"" experiences are predatory and disguise their tired gameplay loops and grinding with flashy rewards, they really amount to nothing in the end. With these sorts of games, your only objective is progress forward. Of course, this is the goal of all games, and really, all media that wants to give you your money's worth, but ""Fallout Shelter"" is a continuous money investment if you have problems with controlling how much you spend. 

Even if you are patient and wait for everything to progress naturally, you are going to be in for a long and tedious experience that only rewards you with flashy animations and a sense of accomplishment that, at the end of the day, are gone and forgotten. There is no true sense of accomplishment or complex thinking that goes into how you manage your vault in this game, especially if you invest money into it. Here, you see a real lack in the gameplay department, with little exploration or wonder, no true puzzles or problem solving beyond simple resource management, and nothing besides a bigger vault filled with one-dimensional vault denizens that only exist for your profit to show for time invested. Along with no story elements at all accompanying such a lackluster gaming experience, little value is attributed to this ""free-to-play"" cash cow that took little to make but takes a lot from the invested consumer.

I could say plenty about how much of a disgusting business practice this is, and to an extent, I did, but I have talked plenty about how gross such practices are in previous ""free-to-play"" reviews, therefore I will not go into detail just how unhealthy and predatory these types of games are, but if you are interested, check out my reviews for ""AdVenture Capitalist"" and ""Soda Dungeon"", they highlight exactly why I despise developers who allow themselves to abuse the consumer in such manipulative ways. ""Fallout Shelter"" may look pretty for one of these types of titles, but it is just as bad, if not, worse than its peers due to the sheer popularity of the ""Fallout"" franchise and offensive abuse of the fan's strong feelings for an understandably nostalgic series.

[RATING: 1.9/10]"
8310,"A light-hearted mobile game you can play on PC. A lot easier to see on a monitor than a tiny phone screen, too. Don't expect great depth or a lot of unique moments, but a fun little time-waster. No need to spend real money if you are patient; if you aren't patient, at least wait for sales to score a lot of lunchboxes or animal crates at the price of a big fast-food value meal."
8311,Fun game. Good for passing some idle time. I always come back to this game.
8312,"Easy, fun, can still kill stuff and build a home. What's to hate?"
8313,I love this little game and it's super fun but don't let yourself get dragged into spending on the microtransactions. It's just as fun if you just be patient :P
8314,Good time killer
8315,"It just works!

Don't talk to me about early deathclaw attacks, I don't want to remember."
8316,the world of fallout sorta meets the sims its free and can run on my computer besides that i like treating my people like dolls and playing god the missions added something too
8317,"Personally I enjoy playing this game.

I don't have specific reasons but I like this game.

I used to play this game in the past and I keep love playing it in present!"
8318,this game is good for make child in no space room
8319,"Played this game for a while, but it was never actually 'fun'.  Feels more like work."
8320,"very addicting, you should try it out"

8330,"Once upon a midnight levy while I camped there prone and ready,
Over many a quaint and curious streak of performance poor,
While I aimed, clearly tracking, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one here attacking, then dispatched by my placed Claymore.
`'Tis some noob,' I muttered, `exploding into bits of gore
Only this, and nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the village tower,
And each separate dying player wrought his corpse upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished for ammo; - vainly I had brought the crossbow
From my misses bursts of sorrow - sorrow for the lost streak scores
For the rare and radiant rifle whom the gunsmiths forged from iron ore
Bulletless here for evermore.

And the thundering certain noise of each fired shot
Strained me - enraged me with fantastic envy never felt before;
So that now, to match the contents of my clip I stopped shooting
`'Tis some noob below on the ground floor -
A new player and not hardcore; -
This it is, and nothing more,'

Presently my angst grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
`Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I am camping, and so rudely you came attacking,
And so carelessly you came backing, backing into my planted claymore,
That doubtless was I that I heard you' - here I backtracked to the source; -
Dog tag there, and nothing more.

Deep into that hallway peering, long I stood there wondering, cheering,
Grinning, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was broken, and here appeared a notification,
and the words spoken of kill confirmed, the points added to my score
Thus I pondered, and a gunshot pulled my mind back to the war
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the tower camping, hand on mouse is damping,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
`Surely,' said I, `surely I should have taken scavenger pro;
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this enemy - my knife will soon gore
Let my heart be still a moment and as I crawl out on the floor; -
'Tis a drone and nothing more!'

Over there I flung the flashbang, when, follow'd the blind and ear rang,
In there stepped the soldier of the same username before.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, ran hastily to the second floor -
Proned upon my old position just around the tower door
Proned, and aimed, and nothing more.

Then this new player beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the lack of awareness that he bore,
`Though thy gun is new and loaded, thou,' I said, `soon you shall be exploded.
Consequence of so carelessly barging to that second floor
Tell me why thy thought to camp prior to thou explored!
Cursed the player, which I ignore

Much I thankful this player to bring me a gun so plainly,
Though its attachments little synergy - little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no competent virtual soldier
Ever yet would refuse a firearm delivered to his front door
Though the munition in the chamber could have numbered more
Tis was a blessing, I implore"
8331,It is very cool and fun to play.You can customize the way your vault looks and the more dwellers you have the more stuff you can build.
8332,"A very in-depth vault managing game, with lots of micro management features

8333,...

8337,Good time waster.
8338,i use cheat
8339,"It's fun for a few weeks and then you throw the game away, and then you pick it up again, etc"
8340,"Got a few minutes to waste and looking for something to do? I think this will suffice. There is a good sense of accomplishment from this title and it carries an addictive element as well. There are times during game play where you will experience wait times (resources to build, pregnancy, returns from the wasteland). What I like to do is log out for a while. When you return, there will be plenty of things for you to do."
8341,"Great game, gets easier over time, you dont have to pay to win or anything which is a plus. Fallout shelter gets easier over time and its quite addictive. if you play on mobile you can watch 30s ads to get free stuff which is better
"
8342,game sucks my vault got set on fire and no dweller did anything they just walked around the fire like.. oh well...ure game sucks
8343,'
8344,good
8345,"That‚Äôs a really good game !

It‚Äôs a management game in the Fallout‚Äôs universe where you need to take care of your dwellers 

You are the supervisor of your Vault !

You can send your dwellers in the wasteland to find stuff or complete some quests, equip them with weapons and armors and they‚Äôll progress in their level at lvl50 max"
8346,such a wow
8347,I hacked the game and gave myself infinite lunch pails and animal crates (among some other fun effects) because charging money for this garbage is a literal scam. Mobile gaming is a joke because of games like this. I played it legitimately on my phone a while back when I was having PC problems and eventually came to the conclusion that it was a form of self harm.
8348,Good game. 10/10
8349,enjoy playing this game
8350,"Good to waste a couple hours on here and there. It is free to play but it's more fun to buy a Mr. Handy, lunchbox, or pet pack when there's a sale. Auto-collection and some pets really help.

Been playing for a long time on mobile. I had to pull my save file from my phone onto my computer to keep my vault. Blows my mind that a large company can't manage to sync across platforms when I know small devs can manage it with their indie games."

I'm not a fan of Fallout, but this game is very good. But as for me, the PC does not really fit into the framework. Who, of course, is better for me to play on a smartphone or tablet. On his smartphone stuck for a couple of dozen hours. And on the PC, there is something to play, more advanced games. But I still feel that I‚Äôm soon tired of the smartphone, already fed up ... Everything is somehow monotonous ... Nevertheless, the game is worth the attention no matter on which platform, it‚Äôs 30 hours for sure"
8360,It is very entertaining only for a couple minutes and it is free!
8361,"Not a conventional Fallout game, it however incorporates things and characters from all across the modern Fallout series. Build your own vault, fend off attacks, and send vault members on missions across the wasteland. There are 0 bugs, and is entertaining, however obviously not as entertaining as the actual Fallout games. A very well made spinoff.

8364,It ok
8365,Time efficiently wasted.
8366,If you want to build a vault this is the game for you

8368,"This game brings all the loved characters, stories and atmosphere of the fallout universe into one [i]frictionless[/i] easy to play casual rpg/bunker builder game."
8369,CUTE.
8370,Glad they fixed the incest problem some time ago...
8371,"Its a fun, relaxing game, even after it being out for years. Always exciting to start a new vault and test different ways to do things. I played it a lot on my mobile device, but needed something to play in between rounds of other games!"
8372,"Excellent for the one handed

I recently spawned a small human, and have found myself sitting at my PC for hours with one hand available and the other attempting to rock an angry gremlin. One hand is useful for a wide variety of things - but most games seem to be rather bias in favour of two. In short, I've been playing a lot of Fallout Shelter this month because I can do it with a single mouse click. Since I've managed to rack up 60 sleep deprived hours on the game, I figured I'd write a review. I'll make it brief, do you know how slow it is to type with one hand?!

Pros:
Only requires one hand.
Free to play that doesn't require you to spend money to build an awesome vault.
Very extensive amount of gameplay, way more than were on mobile on release.
Quests have interesting and amusing lore / dialogue.
Very polished, everything is well implemented and balanced.
Addictive.

Cons:
You'll lose a great deal of time.
You can give your vault a significant boost with spending money - but you don't need to.
Extreme micromanagement might get boring fast for some.
Addictive.

That's all I'm gonna say - you don't need a breakdown of what it is and how to play it. If you're bored and have plenty of free time, enjoy micromanaging and want to save the lives of gingers from a cult in a quest, this is the game for you.

It's a free to play game well implemented, in a lore-rich universe. Really no reason not to try it and see if you enjoy."
8373,...
8374,"This game is pretty highly addictive, its very much like an idle game but if you don't pay attention to your vault you can lose a lot of your people too.  Its a nice mixture of resource management and combat.  I avoided it forever and recently started playing it and I can't stop."
8375,The gameplay seems interesting until you learn that nothing matters but training up con and luk and making max level babies.
8376,"Fun to play, interesting to do various themes with the dwellers. Lots to do."
8377,So good.
8378,very fun
8379,relaxing game
8380,"I send most of my NPCs outside of the vault and forgot them and everyone died... You maybe should make sure you are not forgetting your NPCs. 
"
8381,Is a fun game for if you graphics card goes out and you cant play any other games lol. Even when I got my new graphics card back I found myself coming back to this since it is actually pretty addicting. If you are into the fallout universe and like these style games this is for you
8382,I stopped playing games with real time but this one has got me addicted again and i think this is more of a mobile game but then on mobiles and tablets i hate games cause of ads and in game purchases via ads so This is a great time pass.
8383,Good game.

Hallo!


This is a gateway game showcasing the gist of the franchise, teaching you to manage resources and to be a good overseer. The game is entertaining early on but after a while, it becomes monotonous. It has no long term appeal due to the nature of the game. It is moderate on the difficulty scale if you're hunting for achievements. It took me about 96 hours to complete the game and I did make a guide for this.
 
Achievements take a lot of time and need some calculated grinding. The 'Get Off My Lawn' achievement was particularly hard for me and well, I paid my way out of the 'Blast From The Past' achievement. 

I do play this game on iOS and yes, it does kill time, but on the PC, it's just about right for someone who just started gaming and/or who has come across this franchise. The game could have been much better for the PC in terms of design. The controller could have been integrated in a better way.


Regards.
[/code]"
8396,It's an easy to understand and fun to play game. It can get a little boring at times but if you step away from it for a day or two then it's just as much fun as it was when you started. I can't help coming back.
8397,"This is a peculiar game.  Its one of those ones where you manage your base, try not to let people starve, produce enough energy etc.  Its free, and pretty fun.  Its kind of like other fallout games.  While there is not too much action, its a pretty good tycoon type game."
8398,g
8399,"computer shuts down due to power issue, didnt save the game, save file now gone: BAD GAME"
8400,Its kinda boring if you play this on pc and is waiting for resources but i did play this on mobile and it was kinda good to play
8401,Fun game!
8402,"I cant make up my mind, this is the most fun boring game I've ever played. Every little thing you want to do in this game takes time, and as always there is a premium currency to speed things up. However, the game is surprisingly immersive and has a lot of story hidden in its quests, which is its saving grace. And planning the layout of your vault is not as straightforward as it sounds. Its a pretty fun game to run in the background while you play other things such as Fallout 4, and if you're willing to put up with the ridiculous wait times for the quests, its has a few things going for itself. Solid 7/10"
8403,"i like that i have control over a lot that happens, and that i can make decisions."
8404,"i tried to get a breeding program going, realized i needed stuff i didn't have, and to get it i needed more lunchboxes which are obviously limited."
8405,no
8406,yes
8407,"Not sure why this is on steam when its more at home on cell phones...but its still a fun little game to have in the background. 

The Microtransactions are WAY to expensive for a game like this but there is an easy fix, just dont buy them. 

6/10 a game good if played in short sessions instead of the normal 2-3 hours"
8408,good
8409,"If you like playing for hours only to have all your effort wasted because the game crashes every couple hours, then this game is for you!"
8410,=-
8411,A very fun little way to waste time :)
8412,It's ok if you mod it to remove some of the time annoyances.
8413,goood
8414,very cool
8415,great time waster this is also on mobile
8416,"This is Vault survival as a Tamagotchi. It runs on real time, and if you dont periodically check up on your vault, your resources will slowly dwindle and all your explorers will all die in the wastes. As a steam app you can't carry it with you, or probably have it on your office job computer, so this is just another chore you have to make sure you do every day at 5. Absolutely no one should buy this when there are thousands of cheap flash games that are this or better. Complete drek with nearly none of the charm of the fallout universe. A cheap exploitation."
8417,good
8418,.
8419,10/10
8420,A classic on mobile platforms and a good way to kill time on your PC.
8421,yea shelter!
8422,very fun game. Can't leave the game for too long at the start but as you progress the longer you can leave the vault to fend for itself and the more you progress the more fun it is. sad it's not being updated anymore but still worth playing especially if you need a game to play during your lunch break or just to pass some time.
8423,"my vault got deleted WTF????
dont play the game it deletes your vault 
i wasted my god damn time to play this game and now its gone to nothing 
such BS"
8424,"cool lil game
"
8425,"Fallout shelter was originally a mobile game where you create your own vault and populate it with dwellers to perform different tasks like generate power, grow food and other tasks to keep your vault running. It has all the makings of a standard app game where you perform a few tasks then exit the app and return to it a few hours later to collect resources and check on how things are going. Your vault unlocks different rooms based on the number of dwellers you have, and you use the Fallout universe currency of bottlecaps to purchaser things. There are no premium currencies like in other mobile games but there are loot boxes and items to speed up tasks to be done immediately.
You can also send your dwellers on quests, however most of the quests involve exploring a building which is your dwellers going room to room fighting enemies. The combat is done automatically with almost no interaction from the player other than using healing items and performing ‚Äúcritical hits‚Äù which is a one-click event. This game is mostly about waiting for events to happen and checking in every few hours like most mobile games of the same genera. While the Fallout spin is fun at first it quickly becomes repetitive and feels more like a chore than a game.
"
8426,"Good game, considering a second play through which is rare. Worth your time for sure."
8427,"its ight
"
8428,sick game m8
8429,Pretty cool and humorous game to spend some time. Imminently gets repetitive. Ingame transactions are not necessary. The characters are so cute =^)
8430,"An otherwise fun game marred by an over reliance on microtransactions. 

To be clear, it is both possible and enjoyable to play the game without any money. I gave the game a negative review because it is *painfully* apparently how much microtransactions affected Fallout Shelter's development and design; it could have been something great, but they chose to just be okay instead."
8431,seems good. fun game for fun.
8432,good
8433,"I have played this on mobile, Playstation 4 and PC. I love this game on any device but on computer, it's my favorite. Everything is so clear and detailed on the PC. I really enjoy the fact that you get to name your kids, and that your vault dwellers can die if you're not careful in combat or if they aren't armored up. This game although you have to wait a few minutes for more resources or to get to your quest destination, it makes it an easy game to come back to every few hours to see how vast my vault has gotten. I really like that you can also up the skills of each person.  This game is very addicting."

8450,"Good time waste, must get 1k hrs for the meme"
8451,"I like the game. But play it on the BlueStacks emulator instead of steam.

It is missing some of the perks here.  It makes a difference."
8452,"Meh.
The game requires grinding away at tasks for hours to earn coin so the next room can be made. This would not be too bad, but the ""micro transactions"" offered to speed things up are silly. Is $5 - $20 considered ""micro""? Who buys dollars worth of fake stuff in a free game? There are downloadable save game files loaded with coins, crates, bottles, boxes, coins...etc. Just load one into the game, and POOF! You've saved $500 in micro transactions. But you'll still grind trying to  recruit another vault dweller before the next room is unlocked.

I checked the game out on PC as it was recently released in Tesla cars. The Tesla version is actually superior as the ""micro transactions"" are removed, and the game runs a little quicker (i.e. giving two rewards instead of one).

I can see the addictive nature of the game with rewards, rare items, upgrades, pets, cards, missions...etc. But don't be dumb. Buying anything in this game is worse than buying lottery tickets. Buy a Tesla instead, play the game without micro transactions."
8453,not as fun as other fallouts but it just works

I decided to go get some wather and a short trip to the bathroom and 50% of my population was dead when I returned. I have no money to revive them and I can no longer maintain my vault. So the 4 hours was just a waste. 

If you play don't go afk unless you have your people with guns. I could not find enough for mine and it cost me the game"

[list]
    [*]Sometimes the Storage / Item menu does not open at all.
    [*]When I pan over my vault with the mouse, I would like to not drag any Dweller that comes up on my cursor.

8484,"Beautifully crafted, funny game where you, the Overseer, controls the fate and destiny of unsuspecting Vault dwellers. Set up in a kitsch 1950s nuclear apocalypse, it shows how fun Armageddon by Atom is!"
8485,.
8486,i would if you like building games with some action
8487,"Even tho I'm a little late to the party with this review. There are a few things that might help this game if the developers still care.

Rearranging rooms tool. Yes, this might seem unrealistic in the world of fallout but organizing rooms by shifting them around instantly (even a small fee) saves time and money with players who care more with the Aesthetics of their vault.

Upgrade the vault doors. I would honestly love it if you could put more at the entrance, wether that be turrets, Assaultron, Eyebots, animals or more guards spots outside I would very much accept that in this game.

Expand the universe with this game. Y'all did a great job with exploration, but what if you can raid other settlements?
play with friends? Send a fake settler to another vault? Steal their secrets? sabotage their base before either paying off raider (which would be expensive). Have an investigator to help out who the spy is to battle this.

Animal Shelter. I want more animals in this game but it seems rare or even impossible to get any since playing this game. Make it fun as well by using Breeding stats like Pokemon.
You can even make it funny by cross-contaminating species, with fallout's mutation possibility, it not that far fetch to do so.

Lastly, just do...more. In this sense I mean is do a Halloween month theme or Christmas theme, do updates with the community. it has been a couple of years since I last booted this game up and honestly, nothing has changed. Its the same ok idle game that has the potential to be more.

Would I recommend this game? hmmm, it depends. Short term play? Yes, do too how much I do like the style and somewhat lacking game play that makes me check up on my peeps. long term play? no not really."

8543,"Thought I'd give this game a go since it's free and I am definitely impressed considering this is free to play.

The game itself is extremely slow paced, it seems like more of a mobile game than your typical fallout game but again - it's free so it makes sense that it's not totally action packed. I am finding it pretty addicting to purchase lunch boxes so if you're playing on a budget, it's a good idea to refrain from purchasing any. It is completely possible to play without spending any money, it's just super slow. I recommend grinding out the objectives as quick and as often as you can to get rewards which will help you progress. You will get a rush of new dwellers which will slow to a complete stop, so try to start the process of procreating as early as possible. Other than that, I personally love the aesthetics of the  game and am so far thoroughly enjoying getting a little fallout fix.

If you're interested in something super chill that you don't have to completely pay attention to, I do highly recommend this game. Even if you want something to grind, I would still recommend this but just keep in mind that it is a slow grind and there isn't really anything to do while you're waiting except read over the tips etc. Hope this helps! Remember it's free to download so there's no harm in trying :)"

8545,"An interesting resource management game centered around the Fallout universe.  It‚Äôs fun, and there is a learning curve, but is well done for the most part.  It‚Äôs built around providing food, water and energy to your colony inside your Vault, and assigning the right workers to the right task.  It‚Äôs good for 20-30 hours but then the repetition sets in.  It‚Äôs free, so there is some in game monetization, but it can be completely ignored even if it is a bit obnoxious.  I‚Äôm a Fallout fan so I really enjoyed it as there is lots of fan service...give it a try."
8546,YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
8547,Fallout Shelter is the perfect game for relaxing and listening to music. Obviously Fallout Shelter does not offer the same things as other fallout games but it is a simple and fun game.
8548,"good
"
8549,"Fallout Shelter, TL;DR: Cute, low-effort, yet polished - great as a ""background"" game or for those new to colony sims.
FS is a lighthearted colony simulator with the kind of point-and-click simplicity that makes it a great game to kill time to or keep running in the background. It's gamplay feels much more relaxed than others of its kind, with just enough unpredictability and alternate play modes (occasional point-and-click quests and combat) that break up the main focus, which is resource management/building. It's no Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress, in terms of complexity or learning curve, and it's easy enough to catch on to quickly I'd imagine even kids could play this. (Just be warned your kid will become very familiar with novelty firearms after playing this.)
At best, it's polished, cute, and intuitive. At worst, it's nothing truly remarkable, and colony/resource management vets will likely get quickly bored by the limitations and slow pace. 
3.75/5"
8550,"Fun little game to mess around with if you don't have enough time to get a game going, but enough time to be bored. Be it while eating, running in the background during a downtime in a game, or if you're waiting for someone to show up at your home without a solid timestamp."
8551,it's a fun game to waste some time on
8552,log on and my vault has vanished with the 10 bucks or so I put into it. Thank God I didn't put in anymore. I will not be paying for anymore bathesda games. A shame they have turned into such horse shit.
8553,"Fun. Bigger and easier to see than the Phone version. Best Android game I've ever seen.
Could use some tweaking though. Once you get maxed at 200 people money eventually stops being helpful, and Lunchboxes giving out 1 Stimpac, or 50 caps is just a sad joke. Instead a single 12+ weapon, or 5+ gear, or a pet would make more sense and be less disappointing."
8554,this is on of the most relaxing game I played
8555,good game if ur bored
8556,good fun
8557,Click it! Most rewarding clicks I have clicked.
8558,It's a mobile game on pc. It's free but has microtransactions that make normal gameplay tedious. Unless you find a certain website that allows you to edit your saves. Easy achievements if you do that.
8559,"fun side game to play, enjoyable once you understand how to play"
8560,"It's free.  That is brilliant of them.  It's slow moving.  I wish there was a workshop to have various controls and add on.  I'm not a fan of the auto zoom when a emergency happens, for example, also since it's a slow moving game, It would be nice to have 3 more vault slots, which I'd even pay for that upgrade.  Would like to be able to double time it.   I do find the quests repetitive and boring;  One shoots everything, then collects junk then returns.  Each one is this repeat.  I've only made it to 87 dwellers because of this.  I just leave the game for months and then start over.   However, it's a free game and I will always appreciate all the work they did just to give us a free game.   When I grow up, I want to be a game maker."
8561,it's a fun game but too grindy
8562,..
8563,"Nice game for Fallout fans. Playing as Overseer, you command a Vault and its dwellers both in the Vault or in the Wasteland. The only thing that bothers me is the low variety of enemies, the game really needs a bunch of then.

It has microtransactions itens to make the time needed to make some things go fast but you can find then easy in the game after you know how the game works. 

This game is for patient players and Fallout fans.

This game is not for impatient people with credit card limit

Its almost unplayable when the game crashes your whole pc for no reason and then corrupts all your files. This is a great game and I love it so much, but it fucking sucks when you lose all your progress in the matter of seconds. Please fix this."

8584,shelt.
8585,"I had played this game a bit before on console, but didn't play it for long since I somehow got myself confused as to what to do (I could not progress), but I decided to restart this time on pc.

One thing I have learnt is to not make your dwellers bread when nearing 200 Vault Dwellers due to its cap at 200, I ended up having about 10 pregnant dwellers that I couldn't do anything with since I could not kick them out, nor let them have the baby (wish I knew that prior).

Can get a little stressful when your shelter is being raided by Ghouls and Death Claw's, so be sure to equip everyone with decent gear.

It's a good game to open and play for 10-20minutes."
8586,Guud time burner.
8587,yep
8588,"Very fun game. Not a game to be idle in as you have to collect all the resources, level up people etc... Unless you get a Mr.handy, which is a game-changing feature. The only way to get a Mr.handy is through lunchboxes."
8589,good time consumer
8590,"I see fallout, I click yes."
8591,Why not try it out? The game is free and a great time killer. I don't know how I let 17.4 hours get away from me. I'll never get those hours back.
8592,need a update...

8595,Could be pretty hard but if you get it right everything will be okay. This is extremely fun to play and i would recommend this to others for those who are trying to build their own bunker.
8596,"Poorly thought through game, to such extent I hardly can call it a game, more like software that provides some diversity betwen fallout games for fans only.

Pros:
- Doesn't require much knowledge or time to be good at it
- Good for fallout fans I guess
- Probably didn't mention something nice because I dislike the game.

Cons:
- Can't sell items in desired amounts
- All caps rewards are laughable
- Amount of caps are Capped, lol (999,999)
- After settlers come from mission you can't sell items by group or all at once
- Super annoying pop up (that can't be turned off) when your storage space is low... I have 2000+ space and had 1400 used and he kept popping up like 600 space isn't enough
- In mission combat lmb and rmb do the same, which is annoying, can cause you randomly zoom in.
- In general game doesn't have much functionality, game made just as a space holder for genre I guess."
8597,Very good
8598,It's gud
8599,"A simple Fallout game, build up your own vault and keep on top of it as the overseer! I play this game to wind down and relax, there are in app purchases but you can play the game without these as it isn't pay to win!

8600,fantastico
8601,"This game is fun, even though things can go south at any moment there is still that chance things might go better. Just know you always a have to expect things ahead of time, cause like any vault rep might say, ""Be prepared for the future!"" Find out for yourself and crate a vault of your own!"

8606,yes
8607,very working... yum
8608,"mmmmmm good
"
8609,"I spent over 50 hours in this game, on Bethesda's client. I've had my fill.
It's fun, until you've experienced everything, trying all the buildings at what-not. And that takes a while to get there.
It's a clicker-ant-farm, where you can do whatever hellish experiments you want to your vault inhabitants, or be a good overseer, make it work, and watch some of your favorite dwellers inevitably die when you're away from the PC for 5 minutes.

Just don't purchase the microtransactions. You can get by with what the game gives you, just fine.

8614,"Fallout Shelter is a fun simulator where you build and manage your own nuclear shelter. There is a lot of upgrades and options and you can send your members of the shelter to go and explore so you can get items. The game is pretty cool with nice collectibles and is a nice time killer, the game is 2D and you can't watch the scavengers find items but that is mainly to keep the game small so you can play it on your mobile phone. The game has a nice learning curve and starts to get boring often but right when you are about to quit it gives you something awesome like the Overseer's Office and then you can go on missions which you can actually watch! It is one of the best games you can play on your mobile phone, but on PC you have better options.

8630,"good game, good port from mobile to pc"
8631,"Even now, considering the age of the game, i find it hard to judge how i feel about it (so i'm unsure if this review is helpfull).
On the one hand its rather fun to kill time with, you can easily get to the end game without spending money on it, and still fits rather well into the fallout universe imho.
On the other hand, the monetization really becomes a burden the further you progress, and i found myself spending more time not playing then actually playing the further i got into it. Mostly because of the time required to get any where later on, witch in turn is inline with mobile game design tbh, on PC its a burden imo though.

Survival mode is a bit of a mixed bag i found, i do enjoy the extra challenge though, it does feel like this mode really shines on a mobile device not so much on PC. It's not impossible on PC either, but its not something to leave running on the side, keep your play sessions short (as you would on a mobile phone during a work or school brake for example) and gtfo when things get stale.

Overall i do still like it, sadly most my time played is on the Bethesda platform, so my steam profile does not really reflect that.
Despite its flaws, imho if this type of game is your thing, its not a bad addition to your Library."
8632,time to create a vault
8633,Pretty nice game.
8634,Bangin' Game. Keeps you interested
8635,The game is very pay to win and i only suggest this game to people willing to spend HOURS on this game if you don't intend on spending real money on it.

Its just like the app that every was most likely addicted to, for all of a week and then its forgot until you see it randomly upon Steam."
8637,"Fun game where you try to get better gear for your vault dwellers and try to make your vault bigger and bigger. There are creatures and dangers on the way however which will try to stop you. Eventually there's also quests you can do to help you step forward in your vault tec adventure. If you like management games where you build and grow, with things to do on the side this game is for you."
8638,"It's ok kinda liked it better on my cell phone, but they added some more stuff since i played it back then. W/e it's playable and decent. You can obviously see the aspects they want you to pay for , buts that's how all these games with waiting times are.  Just cell phone mini transaction game crossover to PC.  only reason I like it for the most part is cause it's FALLOUT."

8640,"The mechanics of the game are not too bad for a free to play game. But this is a mobile port to its fault. Basically the ""features"" that would be considered necessary for a mobile port in this PC version makes it very difficult to play the game. Mostly this has to do with mouse tracking. I can't count the number of times I have wanted to select a settler only to have the game level him up instead. And considering that you benefit quite a lot from waiting to level up until you have equipped an endurance boosting piece of clothing this is [i]really[/i] annoying. You would think that having pinpoint mouse precision in a PC port would be a given. But no, not in this POS lazy port. Furthermore I have even tried to have it corrupt a save game when at a point the game crashed and when I tried to reload the game it just crashed again every time. Considering the time requirement to get anywhere (without paying out that is) that is a large amount of time going to waste basically because Bethesda don't do quality control."

8649,It is a time waster and every seems to die when you are not playing is to you come back to the game worse off. than you left it seriously I can play far more rewarding games for my time.
8650,"Moderately fun game, with flaws that make it less enjoyable.

Considering how much of your work is sim-management, the UI for that is unpolished.  The Gear menu helps you find a dweller who excels in a particular skill, but you can't drag them from there or use that list to directly reassign them to the room you want.  The list would also benefit from the ability to sort it by trait.

The game doesn't scale up well to large displays.  Instead of showing more rooms and area, everything just becomes bigger.  You can zoom out, but maximizing the window doesn't stretch it to your screen.  It insists on keeping the original aspect ratio, even though there's no good reason.

Assigning dwellers to fight off raiders is confusing; sometimes they remember which room they originally came from and return to it after the fight, other times they think they've been reassigned to the new room.

Clicking outside a menu is inconsistent.  Sometimes it cancels the menu and selects the thing you want, other times it just cancels the menu.  Like when the clipboard is up and you click on a different room - here it would be nice if it selected the new room and kept the clipboard up for it.

The game would benefit from some quality-of-life tuning of the UI.

In terms of gameplay, pacing is off.  There are short periods where you're overwhelmed, and other long, boring periods where you're waiting for supplies to be generated.  A knob to speed up or slow down the passage of time would be welcome.  Maybe at the same time the devs could fix the cheap exploit which allows you to cheat the game by changing your system clock.

Another exploitable bug that should be fixed: Wearing clothing that grants an endurance boost apparently increases the amount of additional health capacity a dweller gets when leveling up.

Micropurchase pricing is WAY off.  Maybe if they had some options for ~30 cents I'd be interested.  You can play this game without spending any money at all, it just means more waiting around."
8651,"Extremely addictive. Extremely satisfying. The only issue I have is a slight difficulty with the touchscreen version, wherein it seems to exit randomly when I am scrolling through lists of items/people."

8667,"Good game to pass time when your internet connection is bad or you just don't have anything better to do (at least in my case).

Simple graphics sometimes go for a long way, and with this game that's the case. Given that this is a simple simulation game, graphics and mechanics are perfect to engange you into playing for hours and hours and distract yourself for a good bit.

Overall good and fun, but no more than that."
8668,Absolutely love this game for a chill relaxing thing to do when you need to unwind. It can be casual or you can get in depth and micro manage the hell out of it. Nothing not to enjoy. This is one game I don't mind the micro transactions for at all and I actually have spent money on.
8669,good planning game
8670,"Way too much attention needed for anything other than a mobile app.  No automation even for collecting resources.  Could be amusing, but as a PC game it would require a second machine running you clicked on a handful of times every few minutes.  Even having the name Fallout in the title is not enough to salvage this as a worthwhile game.

And yet I have played more just because I am a masochist and the Devs are half decent at attention harvesting.  Still wish I had never installed this game."

8672,"Very fun to play. Sometimes relaxing and sometimes exciting. You can choose to build/upgrade rooms, go exploring or on quests. You can gain dwellers by them having children or calling them in with radio broadcasting."
8673,okay now that i've played fora while its pretty kewl
8674,intro earraped me
8675,Fallout Shelter is a very well rounded game. the customization of characters is just enough to allow you to grow attachments and pick favorites out of your hundreds of vault residents not to mention the fun events that are often hosted allow for exploration outside of the vault to allow a break of the hum drum of power management and the constant barrage of deathclaws. This is one of those rare gems that you might download on a whim but find yourself truly enamored by its simplistic art style yet still engaging attention to detail. all in all i will probably play this game for years to come.

8679,An apocalyptic fantasy about what it is like for the ultra wealthy to shelter in place with their best friends.
8680,"(Stubborn fans - do not read this, go do something useful in your life)

What the game IS NOT about (considering the user-defined tags):
- it's NOT free-to-play, it's pay-to-win - there is no way to gather legendary dwellers other by buying boxes or waiting for months (literally) for a quest
- it's NOT not survival for anyone who ever played survival games, the only ""survival"" element there is keeping food/water indicator high for the whole vault - which is easy as
- is NOT base building, it has nothing with building or bases. You do not have much variability around

What the game IS about:
- clicking to place a ""room""
- clicking to assign a dweller to it
- clicking on EACH room to gather resource from it
- clicking on EACH dweller to level up 
- clicking on EACH dweller to grow a skill
- clicking on EACH item you want to ""sell""
- waiting for HOURS (literally) to go on a ""quest"" (on which you do nothing but more clicking)
- waiting for HOURS (literally) to craft a thing
- waiting for HOURS (literally) to train a dweller
- not waiting but PAYING REAL MONEY to get the above instantly - and then to make even more clicks!
- not getting all achievements because the only reliable way to get legendary dwellers is to PAY REAL MONEY

In fact this game is nothing but a PAY-TO-WIN CLICKER with a nice look (which I do admit). Still, I don't understand whom the game is intended for:
* For a Fallout fan, the game is waaaay too far from everything they love about the series
* For a clicker fan, the game is waaaay too complex

Huge disappointment, you did it Bethesda, finally ruined the franchise this time.

Verdict: 15 radscorpions of 10"

8688,"Let's put it this way. I've had mobile games way more riveting than this. This is literally a waiting fest. 3 hours to get a new dweller, limited stuff locked behind population. Most caps are out of luck or persistence and not to mention the microtransactions feeling like you don't got much of an option.

And reading about people playing this game, if you don't want to fall asleep on your keyboard, your best option is to get speed hacks and such to make the game at a ""normal speed"".

Like, I like upgrading games, but at least offer at least a minigame to earn caps on the side while I wait several hours to raise my settlers."

Too much stupid design."
8697,"By default, we should review all Bethesda games negatively. 

But, in this case, it is easily justified.
Greedy monetization mechanics masked behind a somewhat fun to play game make this one a very dangerous money dump for players with an addictive personality. The game basically encourages you to spend money on speed mechanics and purposefully makes anything worthwhile take hours and hours on end... 

Again, punish Bethesda by either not playing, or playing with some sort of Cheat Engine if you want to have some fun at their expense :)"
8698,"Pros:
[list]
[*] Weirdly addictive
[*] Not stupid easy
[*] Diverse game mechanics
[*] Not resource intensive
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] The fact that the game can't be sped up and you must wait for the power/water/electricity etc. to be generated in realtime does make it necessary for me to concurrently work or occasionally play a different game alongside, it does add character but when I started off I was looking at a screen for over 5 minutes and couldn't do anything because I was too scared to rush anything, too broke to buy anything, and my dwellers were too busy to mate. 
[*] No difficulty selection

8699,"This is not a complex thinking game. This is a fun little game to have running in the background while you do other things. There really isn't much you can do but wait once you get everything set up, but it's a nice distraction."
8700,is gud
8701,"This game can be fun despite having no relation to reality. After a nuclear war you can still construct huge underground structures because reasons. Power is made in a room with no inputs. Food is grown in a 50s dinner with no inputs. When raiders attack, they punch through your foot thick steel door with rusty swords to steal your electricity. The 1950s sexism makes itself felt too, because as soon as anyone becomes pregnant they lose all nerve and run screaming from any and all emergencies. 

If you can put up with all that though, the gameplay is fun and involving, like a digital dollhouse anyone can learn to enjoy."

8712,This game has been good since its initial release. It was originally released on mobile devices but now it is here on steam. Fun gameplay and really simple and easy to understand. I play this game for like 10 minutes to 30 minutes a day and its always fun to see what has happened in my vault since the last time.

8714,Its the least buggy bethesda

8741,good game but lots of micro transactions
8742,good game
8743,"Don't. 
It's fun, great way to spend time when you have little else to do, you should play...
IF YOU WAN'T TO TAKE THE RISK THAT EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAVED ON A VAULT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS: Bottlecaps, Nuka-cola bottles, Stimpaks, RadAway... You stop playing for a few hours, and when you come back, turns out you have zero on everything. Just like that. Out of the blue. And then Deathclaws attack and you lose A LOT of strong dwellers because you have nothing to cure them with. 
Play at you own risk or-- don't. Just, don't. 
Imma out of here, bye."

8747,"The game has allot of lore and fun simple gameplay from the fallout franchise, and it is very addicting and easy to pick up, play, and enjoy.

I can say i am not a big fan of the time lock pay walls that make you either have to pay to skip, or put the game down for hours and sometimes days just to complete.

All in all, i give the game a 7/10"

8814,"Fallout shelter is a free to play game for mobile players. This game will not be addicting at all, and you will get bored quickly.
Pros:
Variety in citizens, armour, and weaponry.
Overseers quests give you a reason to play more.
Interesting dialogue between the characters.
cool system of how you decided to handle things, with power, water, and food.
Cons:
Boring after 5 - 10 hours
You can take advantage of the game mechanic of charisma to create mass farms of pregnant women. Then overnight you will literally have just gained dozens of dwellers.
Nothing to do but wait for everyone
Room variety may be cool, but no one will last that long
Sending people out overnight without 20 stimpacks and 20 rad aways will kill them
quests are boring after your first mission
Odds of failing in a rush are much bigger than said

All in all, 4/10 game. You can sink a few hours in, then you will forget this game and move on. Free to play, so I don't know what I expected. But I know plenty of amazing free games. (SCP: Secret Labatory, Warframe, Crusader Kings, Conqueror's Blade.) Just boring, I mean you can consider this fallout clash of clans. But with less to do and worse artwork."

8819,"Fallout shelter is a great game for loads of reasons, but something I noticed is that once you get to about 20 to 50 vault dwellers your overall vault happiness drops, This might just be for me because I tend to not care about most of my vault dwellers and the food and water drops quite fast so, But other than that its a wonderful game and I 100% recommend it to everyone who likes the fallout franchise."

I build computers out of old junk, so I'm getting  my atom punk fix with Fallout Shelter.  Love the aesthetic: colors, sounds, and general feel of the game are great, sort of reminds me of a 2010's era  in-browser flash game take on Fallout 1 or 2.   Its a fun casual game.  My only complaint is the level of interaction is a little ""off"".  There isn't enough to do to have playing the game be your primary activity, but too much babysitting to just leave it idle in the background while you do other stuff."
8835,i lost my vault that i spent at least 30 dollars on i would really like my money back

8855,"NICE GAME
"
8856,Pretty cool and interesting. The only thing that you have to think about is if your into waiting some amounts of time to progress.
8857,best...game...ever!
8858,its not a game that you may want to play for long term.
8859,"PAY TO ENJOY

I really did give this game a chance, I really did try. But it stresses you out on things that do not get you any progress, and then has you wait for hours and hours for things that matter. For example, you send some of your people out to explore, they will only reach their destination in 12 hours. UNLESS of course you pay real money! And when the mission is over, they take another 9 hours to RETURN! UNLESS you - again - pay real money.

If you do not want to toss tons of bucks at the game, you will be stuck waiting a SHIT ton. A frustrating heck ton. Tagging this game as ""Free to Play"" is almost a scam at this point. It's ""Free to possess"" but ""Pay to enjoy"".

Aside from this, the game is really annoying to play, the hitboxes of most things are really tedious, overlap and are too small. The game often zooms you in all the way instead of clicking and responding with the thing you want. Made me feel very uncomfortable way too often."

u have to exprience this game"
8862,poes kiff game
8863,"Honestly, this is one of the most fun and chill games that I have ever played, I usually have it on in the background while doing work or watching a movie / TV Show. Never really stressful and super chill overall. Very addicting and I have not spent a dollar and do not plan to. Would highly recommend it considering it takes up less than half a gig. Final score would be in the range of 8.5/10; for what it is as a management game."
8864,I like this game
8865,yes

8871,very good game
8872,It is a classic
8873,good fun game
8874,"I played this game a few years ago when it was newer.  Sim city with guns and the trademark Fallout look and feel.  Never liked Sim City much myself but did play it for two days, before squeezing out all the strategic challenge (there is very little).  Similarly Fallout Shelter was fun but limited in strategic interest.  Still, I played it a lot for a couple weeks.  Great value for my lack of money!  But once you learned how to run the vault there was never any real challenge, just the constant accumulation of more stuff.  And then beyond a point there was not even that much new stuff.  So what to do?  This dynamic is pretty much unchanged, but's it fun to revisit.

What has changed is the addition of ""Quests"", which are missions you can send a small group of three of your dwellers on out in the wastelands.  They play out in locations obviously adapted from the vault, so side-view of a plane of rooms, connected by doors and elevators (which all work).  Your guys enter these locations and move from room to room, where monsters may be, and if so, they fight.  Then you  click on sparkling things and get rewards -- guns, suits, junk, caps, etc.

Quests are a lot more interesting then just sending dwellers out to the wasteland, because you get to see what they are doing, and have a slightly higher level of control and hence some (but not very much) more strategic decisionmaking.  Pretty cool!

The other big addition since I played it years ago is a pay-to-speedup-game feature called Nuko Cola.  You get a few of these as rewards in game, and can buy as many as you want using real money.  Each one speeds over 2 hours of some wait, for example the wait to train dwellers in training rooms.  I didn't use them at all so can't comment, but if you enjoyed this game a lot except the waiting and you're rich, maybe you'll want to re-try it.

All in all well worth the $0 I spent on it!"
8875,fun game to pass time
8876,"This is it. This is what Bethesda has become.

I recommend giving it shot, and dumping 30 odd hours in and see how your vault fairs. It's free so f*ck it."

8921,"FALLOUT SHELTER

Pros-

#1.Good graphics

#2.Can feel rewarding when you get anything new

#3.It is FREE

#4.If you like Fallout it is worth checking out


Cons-

#1.Waiting is sooo boring

They did this on purpose hoping we would pay real money for it but allegedly there is 2 ways around that.

I have not tried either way and am not suggesting you do but some claim this is how to get more enjoyment without paying.I dont want to pay for it and I dont want to cheat either but to play it normally the waiting time is too long that I would rather play the sims or something else.

A.The first way is to change the clock time of your pc

B.The second way is  type ' fsse fallout shelter ' on google search to learn how to edit it/cheat

As I said I did not try either but with how it is designed my only 3 options are to pay,cheat or not play it anymore and sadly I am picking the last one

#2.The dwellers do not have enough personality compared to say the sims


The bottom line-

Even people who claim to have paid real money say it is not worth it as sooner or later something bad will happen and kill all your dwellers.

I looked up the cheat and that looks way too easy if you can edit it to anything.If I had already beat it than that could be fun but to me just speeding up the default waiting times is all I wanted.I dont know if the cheat offered that or the changing your pc clock would do it?

Leave me a comment bellow and explain it please.

It would really be my only chance to give this game another shot.


I will say for a free game it is decent I have paid for games way worse than is.

I will end this by saying I will recommend this game but just be prepared to reach the point of paying,cheating or quitting.

8931,"I really liked the game play and how you need to expand and have a good big vault for your dwellers. So I recommend this game to people that are looking for a good game that's kinda like clash of clans but different, and recommended definitely to fallout fans like me. The problem though was I was playing the game and the next time I went in the game it deleted my save and I couldn't get my save back. That's a problem because if I were to spend money on the game I would just lose my money. So I think that should be fixed so it doesn't delete your save."

Bad controls (doubled up movement of view, and ordering meeple to go places. meaning you can't easily tell people where to go, and what to do)
These two combine in a particularly nasty way in emergencies.

The difficulty ""curve"" is more of a brick wall (nothing, and then deathclaws)

The ""balance"" seems off (As soon as you get good settlers/outfits, your storage capacity is far more of an issue than production)

It's really irritating to have to click all the time to ""collect"" the resources from the stuff you've built. While they'll still drain automatically. This makes in itself a huge problem. Both early game, and any time you quit out.
The inflexible, yet incredibly simple way of building makes for an incredibly uninteresting base/map
Again, these two factors fatally combine. Meaning you can't even have your screen (easily) over all of the things that you MUST click in time. 
Unfun, and painful.

Currently feels like a minimum effort treadmill skinner box game, to force you to actively do pointless things over and over again. And if at all possible shell out money."
8945,"it goood game

8946,this game is really fun it takes alot of time but over all its fun.
8947,it good
8948,is good
8949,"I had all the modern day Fallout`s but always kept away from this, thinking it wouldnt be any good, being a side scrolling game, how wrong I was, its a smashing game, I found it on my tablet first, then found out Steam also had it on for free, ive done 5 hours so far but still lots to do ;)"
8950,Nice game. Can take quite a long time to get all achievements though...
8951,"this game is that ""game"". if you don't have crap to do you can always fall back to this game and keep you occupied!"
8952,"Its free ;-)

However i cant really recommend it since its kind of boring and one of these games who try to trick you into spending money on worthless things to speed up how fast you gain new stuff or travel from a-b.

The graphics are really good and its kind of interesting to build your own vault.
But there are only like guess 15 different rooms to build that you can upgrade and merge together.
here you people work and produce energy/food/water and later on guns/clothing ect.
Now and then you are hit with random events such as a fire, or raiders breaking though your vault door in seconds and hten run and gun every room until they are dead or you are dead.
Dont worry they are really easy to defeat.

You can also send people out of the vault for exploration and bring back money or random stuff you do unfortunatly only see a text overview of what they are doing and encounter.
However once you build an overseer office you can go on real quests and example explore fatorys and find loot.
But its pretty boring, you typical meet the same enemy in almost every room. Example i raided a factory in a quest and it had only small rats comming out of the ground in every single room...  that was annoying. ;-(
After you kill the rats you can collect money and look and run home.
Your new stuff can be sold, used on your people or crafted into other things.

Well all in all pretty game, but its boring to play, and you just sit there waiting 5-10 min to get more food/water/energy.
yes its like one of the Facebook games where you loging, collect this and that and then you exit the game and wait and come back later and do the same again.

It was nice to try the game free but i dont find it interesting to play it anymore."
8953,Fun game! At first I just wanted to kill some time. But now can't stop going through the adventures!
8954,could add more but its excellent none the less
8955,"I like the power glove, it's so rad..."

8957,"Watch the countdown timers that let you click on stuff once they run out, while your resourses shrink - or you can resort to microtransactions and skip however many hours you'd have to wait before doing whatever it is that you wanted.
Also, there's no pause and exiting/minimizing the game doesn't stop it where you were, so you can take your eyes off for an instant from a stable situation and return to find your stocks exhausted and your base about to be attacked."

8968,This is a great game for building characters and customizing names.

8980,"ive playedmthis game for four hours, so i know its a good game"
8981,"It's a free game and it's actually addictive and a lot of fun. You don't have to spend money either, but you can if you want to (I did since I liked collecting all the pets and whatnot) and you won't regret it if you do. I enjoy rushing things since I'm impatient. Good quests/stories, ect."
8982,"Super fun, super light, super interesting game that really reminds me of my all time favorite Sims."
8983,fun/free to play! Brilliant concept.. that my brother and i have brainstormed about to make it more than the ceiling u eventually reach. So much more could be added. That comes from a guy bout 3500 hrs. into the game.

8986,HARD but still GOOD
8987,Good
8988,Fun Game.
8989,"this is one of my favourite casual games.  Build your shelter, deal with break-ins from raiders and deathclaws, find the mysterious stranger, create items and explore the wasteland.  It can be difficult at times to get started and survive, but it's great for wasting time.  Also very noisy for those who like to game quietly... you will want to turn it down due to the alarm."
8990,Good game to pass the time.
8991,Its like Fallout.... but in a shelter.
8992,"The bigger your vault gets, the more subject the game is to screen freezes and crashes.
For me, the freezes would start around a population of 40+.  My biggest vault has a pop of 84 and it crashes on loading now, even after I switched to a more graphically powerful computer.  According to the game tips, the game has a population cap of 200.  I wonder if there are people who can achieve half that without giving up in frustration?  >_>
It's a cute game... but it needs some debugging and optimization."

8995,"I think this game has a potenzial and I always loved the Fallout series so this game was one of my favourite but I think it could be better.
Anyway the mission are great, the vault is awesome and evrything is magnificent.
I also hope they will release a Fallout Shelter 2 with multyplayer added to make it more enjoyable."

9011,"the game play itself was fun. except for too many bugs and...critical errors. 
I am okay with minor errors, in general, but this game... is unplayable.
Go search at Google ""Fallout shelter crash/error/bugs"", and you will see how many critical issues (like crashing when start, thus not able to access your account) are being unattended for so many years. 
Their support is not responding or helping, even though you spend actual-hard earned money on the game.

I learned this the hard way - after spending about 200 play hours and USD $100. 

I dont usually leave comments, but am leaving this comment to save others from wasting their time and money. Seriously."

9038,"good to play in background of a game with long queues

-edit

Game easy to begin with if you maintain the priorities, however, with a lack of settlers coming to my base and low birth rate its gets to a point where you will be spending thousands of caps to keep reviving your soldiers. Theres no way for you to really have every room filled to defend against molerats unless you are maxing the rooms out or making sure they all have people, or else the threat spreads and maximizes room to room. Its not an impossible game just challenging."

9051,Yes!
9052,"Top notch freeware. Fun fact - if you're on the wasteland information screen, incidents can't happen, so a couple of Mister Handies and some high Luck dwellers can make you hundreds of thousands of caps overnight.
You do have to either play forever or spend some money to get all the achievements, though."

9056,"addictive game
"
9057,"It feels like the AI of the dwellers could be better. I would have liked it more if there were an easy mode, in which people who were close to death would run from threats, and if you had dwellers with good weapons put into a room with a threat, that they would pursue the threat they were put there to handle, rather than standing around looking dumb while raiders go off into a room with a bunch of unarmed people. 
It bothered me how the dwellers acted, basically. It felt more like moving pawns around rather than actually directing people, and I feel like that took away from the overall experience.

9081,"It's a great game to kill some time,  there is a lot of things to discover, but this game had a limit, after some time a lot of the stuff kind of become repetitive. I had around 140+ dwellers and I had to open the game very frequent to organize everything, I kind of start losing interest because it kind of become a chore and not a fun game.  But for a free game the in-game purchase wasn't very pushy, I can get by without worry about that and still had 50+ nuka cola in my inventory without spending real money. I love the graphic, the sound effect, the music, etc, this is a well done game in my opinion.

It will get frustrated at first when there is monsters attack very often but after some training and better weapon my dwellers are strong enough to hold up multiple waves of monsters. I train my dwellers to increase their E, up their level, build enough labs to create medicine, send dwellers to scavenge weapon. I think the most important thing I learn is scavenging is very important, now I had 20+ dwellers to do scavenging. You can find a lot of tips on the web, it will definitely help when things get too difficult."

Ever since we were given the opportunity to go on quests instead of just going out to the wasteland I am that much more stoked. All in all the game does get repetative as I have played it since its release on and off across my cell, Xbox and now PC. I do recommend it to anyone that is a fan of Fallout. It's good to pass the time."

9100,Great game with a simple idea.
9101,Simple but strategic.
9102,"Gameplay has gotten worse with the mouse to the point of unplayable to be unenjoyable. Clicking on a person with my mouse, the person goes to the room below. I am not moving them, all i did was just click. Even when i try to click on another person, it does not work. Reason, because when point the mouse on the whole person, it does not work. I have put the mouse pointer slightly on the edge of the person to click on them. Same goes with when the vault is attacked, i have offset the mouse pointer to refill their health when the icon comes above their head. Also same goes when i try to move person from one place to another, i have to move them to the upper part of the room. It does not work when i put them in the middle, nothing happens. So the whole room that you see, i can only use a quarter of the top of the room to tell the game i want to move a person to that room.
Honestly, this game has gotten very annoying! It is doing things that i do not want it to do! When i i want to click on a person to see what gun or clothes they have on, they run off the another room. How can i play a game that does not do what i tell it to do? It is not just that example i said is the problem, there is more. I am stating this for those conceited people that have their head up their ass because their narrow minded focusing on that i have one problem of ""how can i play the game"". It is that fact alone that i have to state that , because people like that exist int he real world, which in turn exist in the production of this video game. All companies start off doing what the people want, but then get big and make money to the point of now ignoring the same people that got them there to begin with. My goal was to get 100 people to make the nuke cola plant, but found out i was mislead to thing i can make the soda, but in fact is another food place!

9134,GOOD GAME
9135,"Addicting game, based on the Follout world, but plagued with poor implementation issues:
- Incident statistics is totally off. If you model the chance of incident as a random event, you will figure out immediately that the people, who was responsible for that feature, got a F in their statistics class.
- Object interaction is flawed and imprecise - people feel very sticky when you have a well developed and populated bunker, that every time you try to scroll, you actually get a dweller dragged around. Drop in over another room, and dwellers in start swapping their positions. Not all mouse clicks are correctly registered accurately, and that depends on the projection, e.g. your current point of view. In addition, mouse position offset is confusing and requires weird position when you want to place a dweller in a room, oftentimes resulting in placing the former at the incorrect one.
- Not everything from the game mechanics is obvious. Hints may reveal how some things work, others are a total history. You cannot see how much HP a dweller has. 
- Lack of balance of incidents/enemies, and it is difficult to understand what makes them stronger, e.g. if you have a single dweller with very high level, and that determines how difficult the game becomes, there are cases where a single incident way wipe your bunker off. Say goodbye to long playing hours and money spent on that bunker, unless you spend more real money to buy caps and revive your fallen dwellers, but you will have a hard time getting the bunker back in balance.

All in all, the game is pretty nice in the early hours of gameplay. The more you expand, the more obvious it becomes to see how many things are messed up. As this game comes with the standard microtransaction model, the idea might be that Bathesda makes a quick buck, then gently makes you walk away. 

The game has been available also for mobile devices for several years now, and it's a shame that all these nasty issues have never been addressed."

9164,"A some what fun game, though I dont really reccomend unless you're willing to spend money on it.  I'm not, so I can make no real progress."
9165,Cool game you can play inbetween stuff. Doenst' take much time away and the Fallout ambiance is unmistakebly.

9169,"#79 Fallout Shelter

Let me start by saying its not a bad game.  Its actually kind of fun, using a lot of different elements together to craft an addictive game.  So why don't i recommend it.  Lets start with the obvious.  Its a mobile port, and it brings with it all the annoying mobile port schemes.  In-app purchases, daily log-ins, real time time advancement, and the slog/grind of not buying anything to advance.  The worst of the worst is the slog of a free to play game.  If you don't buy any of the in-app add-ons everything takes forever.  Example: (this also goes for the real time advancement) A typical mission requires three vault keepers, but it takes them anywhere from 1 hour to 20 hours to get to their mission location, again real time.  But a Quantum Cola can  get you there now for the price of 1-7 colas.  Now if you don't buy them in the store, you might find one or two on the second or third leg of a mission, otherwise you have to wait for them to get there.  You can't go on a mission until you have a control room, and you can't get a control room until you have a certain amount of population and caps.  Crafting is the same way, it takes 2 days and 4 hours to craft a theme for a room, and anywhere from 4 hours to 12 hours to craft a weapon or outfit, these need junk, which you can only get on missions or by having a peep explore the wasteland.  Now you do get lunchboxes with cards  in them which can provide various boosts, like a pet, or a handy helper, sometimes a rare dweller or weapon, but those dry up pretty quick and average about 1 box for 10-15 tasks completed.  So its log in and play a few minutes, save and exit, rinse and repeat.  For a mobile game, where most are played in 5-15 minute intervals this fine, but for a pc ported game, this is annoying.  

So its a naw from dawg."

9195,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review [/h1]

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game

ALSO NOTE: Although Steam says that I have played Fallout Shelter for 3 hours (on the review page), I have played for much more on mobile, since this was primarily made for mobile... decide for yourself [/quote]

Fallout Shelter is a game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Fallout Shelter overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay-ish strategy/simulation game to play in short bursts! 

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

9196,"great game,,wish there was an add on"
9197,After 100 hours with the game i would have to say its very broken and the devs don't care about it at all. Even so i put a lot of time into my vault and guess what without a trace it got deleted and the best part is i still have my other vault the one i spent 1 hour on yeah that's right my 100+ vault is gone but it was like let just delete the good vault and not the bad vault. Also don't spend money on the game because if this happens to you with no notice or reason there goes your money this not refund. Bethesda need to give fallout shelter to 505 so it can get some love. And i though i couldn't be any more disappointed with Bethesda then after fallout 76. But you know they are in the market to trash their rep so good job.

9218,"Love this game. Doesn't require hours of grinding or playtime, allows you to dip in and out as you please. Easy to play with nice visuals, and fun for non-Fallout fans to pick up, either to get into the series or just to play by itself. Incorporates things from the other Fallout games well to give a refreshingly new style of play without feeling like a completely different game."

9300,"It's a good semi idle, resource management game, I only have a few problems with it, I can log in 7 days in a row, and when I collect my lunchbox, it doesn't actually give it to me, second is that it can get annoying when you get attacked by Deathclaws like six times in an hour, then you have dead dwellers, low overall happiness, and low pay for daily login, you can get attacked, have 76 dwellers and end up with like 46 after the attack, its annoying, but if you are looking for a challenging resource manager that requires you to actually take part in it, this game is for you."
9301,fun time waster game.
9302,"Astoundingly free to play, Fallout Shelter really grabs you out of the gate and makes you want to simultaneously buy and play all the Fallout AAA's (Except 76) and buy things on the Shelter Store. I don't, but I do have a desire to. Which is a first for passive management games I've tried.
It will remind you in minor ways of a super-simplified Terreria-Sims hybrid, where you both lose detailed control of your characters and don't want to murder your people. While you cannot walk away and leave your Vault to do its thing without passively killing everyone, you can leave the game and come back later to very few problems.
If you don't have to have massive environmental design control, and have something else to do while you have timers ticking, save that Sims money and try this out.
*Note: Terreria is still legendary.

Pros:
Small package that can sit on your SSD even if not played.
Free if you don't buy gameplay accelerators.
Seems to run on Potatoes (May need to be baked though).
Enough variety to keep you intrigued.
Fairly good tips and tutorial.
Active timeline that keeps working after you logoff.
You can do other things while you let it farm (While in proximity). ie. Read a book; Learn spanish.
Simple but pretty graphics.
Humorous Innuendos + Non-Graphic Violence.
Full Controller or KB/MS support.

Cons:
No multiplayer or similar connectivity, so no trading with friends.
No included timeline acceleration (they make you buy Nuka-Cola for that).
Quests can sometimes be way under level, but still destroy a well equipped party.
Some stats and pet bonuses are not explained (How does that stat help me?).
No time scheduling for explorers (no auto-return unless they have full inventory, you have to logon to keep them from dying in the wasteland).
Auto-Save only (you can't save progression to a slot, and then reload if all your people die).
Once your start down a big disaster hill, the only way to recover is to clear out a mess of things and start from scratch if you want to keep your inventory."
9303,"I like that you can force people to do things like work non stop no breaks. Have babies over and over and over till they die when I send them out to the wasteland with no PPE or stimpacks. I love that you can be evil overseer and get away with it.
Great game"
9304,"It takes patients , as it is a little slow paced, but I really enjoyed building my own fallo0ut"
9305,"Very addictive and I liked the Vault portion of quests anyway, the one where you had a chance to build a vault and become overseer (Fallout 4), so very cool.  Love this series in general and can't wait for Wastelander."
9306,great time killer
9307,A good little time waster.  Enough variety and a brain teaser to keep you occupied.  However its a micro management click click click game.

9317,haven't spent a cent yet but still fun. Takes a long time though but it makes the reward worth it.
9318,cool but you gotta wait long to get dwellers
9319,"Unfortunately, the bigger your vault grows, the more this thoughtful balancing act fades away. Fallout Shelter gets easier the bigger your vault is - not harder. It feels backwards. My 150+ population vault has more than 25 people with no job at all, just wandering the floors. I no longer need to optimize my factories, because I have an excess of all resources. My citizens want for nothing, and I have no more buildings to unlock or goals to work towards. I can expand my vault deeper and build a sixth Power Plant or third food-producing Garden, but that would just give me an even bigger resource surplus. Have I won? Is this it?

Fallout Shelter is desperately in need of a set of endgame goals or resource sinks to look forward to and build towards, or else players will see all the game has to show us in around a week of steady play."
9320,"Great game and all. Post apocalypse, guns, stat called SPECIAL, monster, radiation, deathclaw, another guns, pets, repopulation, and guns. Overall good."
9321,i recommend this game because it is vere good
9322,it's fun
9323,Great game i hope there ll be more update tho
9324,"It's a normal day, you open the game, do some quests, get some loots, everything seem fine, suddenly CRASH! You might think it's a bug (like USUAL), but no, god damn, when you load the game again and find out you cant access to the vault, time that you spend to grind is all wasted, you realized that you lost a vault with 58 full endurance dwellers (image how much time grind that shit), so no. If you dont want to see all your effort go wasted, dont play this buggy game."

9329,"Good to waste time in. It is a mobile game ported to consoles and steam but it is pretty fun. You are a vault overseer and your task is to help your vault dwellers by building and managing supplies. The main things you have to manage are: Caps, Electricity, Water, Food, and Vault Dweller happiness. It would be cool if this was 3D or something, but it is still pretty fun. This can basically run on everything, mainly because of the fact it's a mobile game. You have to arm your dwellers with weaponry and armor to boost their S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills and to defend from raider, deathclaw , rad roaches and more. Over all pretty fun, but I hate when I get very low on supplies and it takes me forever to get back up to the top."

Other than the incessant microtransaction suggestions, it's a fun, Fallout 3/4 themed way to spend time time after work or before a class or wherever you end up with some spare time to check a timer sim.

Now, [u]I'm also an achievement hunter, and this make me not recommend the game[/u]. Every achievement is possible, some with a little grinding but nothing too bad. However, the 20 Legendary Dwellers is what made me hate the game. After playing almost 80 hours in-game, I still only had 6. I had to cheat to finally get the achievement, by getting unlimited loot boxes. If I had spent no money at all, I probably wouldn't be done for a few years. If I had bought loot boxes, I'd have been out ‚Ç¨ 200. This game is worth about ‚Ç¨ 5."

9379,"      This game can be really fun. It's enjoyable, calming, and it makes you think. The one thing that reaaally gets me peeved however and my whole reasoning for writing this review is how literal merciless this game can be. I used to be play this game a lot about a year or two ago.
 Why did I stop? All of my dwellers died.
 How?
 Well they were attacked, and attacked, and attacked, over and over again until there was absolutely no reason for me to continue playing the game. At my weakest, I was constantly being attacked until everyone died. I'd used all my money to revive the ones that died only for them to die again. I was left with no dwellers nor any money.
And well, many months later it's happened again. I thought it may have just been bad luck or timing on my part but no. It seems to be programmed to literally kick you at your lowest moment until you've lost any and all motivation to play the game. It's not a the more you play the harder the game situation. My previous vault I can't say I was too far or prosperous at the time of it's falling. 
This time I was simply running a bit low on power and medicine and well, now everyone is once again dead- killed by mutant rats! How lovely. Three back to back rounds until no one was left.
If your looking to chill and have fun but also want a bit of a challenge I recommend this game. Though be prepared to become completely devastated as you watch all your hard work quickly diminish into nothing but three dwellers and 5 coins.

The beginning is a little rocky but once you get into the swing of things you'll have your place up and running in no time!"
9407,"This has to be the best free mini game ever. With it's fun play on the Fallout characters and addictive game play. Don't listen to the nay sayers complaining about how the game focuses on events (just scroll out), complaining about having to click to collect resources (that's part of the game or get a Mr Handy). I am still playing this game and even when I have cleared other games this remains my go to entertainment."
9408,Good
9409,"I bought two of the $20 packs of lunchboxes. They did not appear in game, they only appeared in my Steam inventory. Steam said to go to the developer's (Bethesda) website. I did that, and Bethesda said to go to the Steam website. So basically, it is endless loop of no help and wasted money."
9410,sick
9411,I found it very fun and exciting to play. It also helped me make time pass by is a bliss and its great! :3
9412,Is good

9421,"Little bit of overkill playing on the PC, but i like to run it in the background while working. Good fun to alt-tab out of every other minute. Plus good free game for kids to get used to a mouse and keyboard."
9422,Fun and you can get far in FTP which I really like. Some of these games become impossible if you aren't willing to spend money. The quests are fun and its just a good game to have in the background while you're doing other things.
9423,"Fun, simple relaxing game, like an ant nest supervisor simulator"
9424,Fun game to play if you like the Fallout world
9425,It can be long an boring at times.  I have 3 vaults to keep it entertaining.
9426,made my pp smaller tho
9427,It's pretty good.
9428,"l feel good so l kick my mac.
"
9429,"awesome game, simple and easy to play. ive a lot of hours in this game had this on my phone a while back."

9441,oogogogoggogoooog
9442,Fun
9443,Nice game to lose myself in
9444,I've played it off and on for years. I really enjoy it. It's a great time killer when you're waiting.
9445,I recommend this game to everyone who wants to create his own ethno-vault.I spent 6 hours straight sistematicaly segregating whites from non-whites.First you find the whitest guy in the vault and you put him in the living quarters and make him mate with all the women.While the mating process takes place i suggest you keep the black ones for the dirty jobs and then kick the out.This was a fun experience.
9446,.
9447,very great but don't get too addicted to the lunch boxes
9448,"A good, free game."
9449,Solid pass time.

9460,Awesome game! So fun and easy and it's free! Excellent!
9461,its a fun little game to waste some time on
9462,Its fun and free
9463,"if you like being god to people who are nothing, this is a game you should play"
9464,g
9465,great game. other than losing a saved game to corruption.
9466,The Games Good. :)
9467,...........
9468,"Fun and easy to get in and out of.  I can play for a while or I can keep my sessions short.  I have only ever bought one pack, but it was definitely worth the $10."
9469,"In my opinion, this is a good game, it can be played very casually, but the only drawback is that there is no Chinese, which is a difficulty for most Chinese players. Some people can still understand some, but this is always a problem , so I strongly urge this game to add Chinese, which will help us a lot, thank you. Plz help some Chinese playerÔºÅÔºÅ"
9470,its lots of fun
9471,YES
9472,"I rate it 3 out of 5 stars.

This game is fun to play but needs work.  It's awkward to play.  I'm playing it on a PC but also played it on the PS4.  Here are some of the issues I have with this game:

1.  When the alarm begins to sound, the camera automatically pans and zooms to the affected area.  There's no setting to disable it.

2.  While the alarm is active, Dwellers cannot be put outside to explore and cannot be assigned to work.  I'm forced to wait until the incident is over to do that.  The game needs to make left clicks do that regardless of alarm state, and make right clicks move Dwellers temporarily to help during emergencies.

3.  Mr. Handy is useless to me.  It only patrols one floor and it can't collect the icons when Dweller level up or training is complete.  There is no option to set waypoints or let us assign it to more than one floor.

4.  Some outfits are gender-specific.

5.  Electricity, water and food require harvesting (stupid). 

The only aspect of the game I actually like is the exploring.  When I send dwellers into the Wasteland, they level up without my needing to manage their every step.

A vault simulator, this game is not."
9473,This game is not a instant satisfaction game  every action takes time to do. Produce power/food/water/equipment takes anywhere from 1 min to 3 hrs or more so it may take some time getting used to. Its a sit back watch your vault and manage resource survival game =).
9474,Lots of fun...nothing else to say really
9475,good i guess tf do u want from me todd
9476,If you don't have it as an app and aren't constantly opening it you can't pay enough attention to keep your civilians alive and so you end up having incident after incident and running out of supplies
9477,"Game was great. Sometimes there were some bugs when I switch over to another monitor, but you can work around it. Very fun, I'm currently on my 2nd vault. Highly recommended."
9478,I kinda liked it at first but it gets really messy and grindy at some point.
9479,Simple and fun micro-management time-killer set within the Fallout universe.
9480,good vibes only))
9481,good game
9482,"At first I wasn't sure this was going to be any fun, and lo and behold all of a sudden a couple hours will pass by. A bit addictive, real time based, so you can set your dwellers to do something, turn it off, walk away for awhile, come back and it's done. Easy learning curve."
9483,"I like it, very fun and entertaining."
9484,Weirdly addictive.
9485,"When getting this, do yourself a favour and play this until you fail at about population 60.
I did this 3 times. Stopped playing. And then, when I felt better and knew I had enough Exp, I downloaded it again. 4th Times a charm!! ( I really miss my T-51 power armor and my focused plasma rifle, I sent my best dweller with that gear every time, he could go out there for 7hrs +!! )
Don't be afraid of failure with this game."
9486,its gr8
9487,pretty good game
9488,i had fun and i didnt expect to have fun with a port of a mobile game
9489,ESTE JUEGO ES MUY BUENO Y POR NO DECIRLO DE MALAS MANERAS XD LO RECOMIENDO UN MONTON PARA LOS QUE SE ABURRAN EN PLENA CUARENTENA.
9490,chill game!
9491,"i liked the fact that it was a sandbox and u get to manage people and what they do i dislike that when not playing it uses up ur supplys
"
9492,"meh, its alright"
9493,dope
9494,"Great idea, executed well."
9495,Its pretty good. A good time waster
9496,Been playing this game for years. Love it
9497,burger
9498,bgfv ndc
9499,yes
9500,If you are a fan of idle games/ant farm games this is a good game.  While you don't have to watch it all the time you do have to pay attention to it.
9501,
9502,"It's a perfect game for playing casually, there are challenges and objectives but the overall game is long-term. Ideal for the single player."
9503,gud
9504,"Despite the fact it can be a bit repetitive at times, it's really good to lose a few hours and the quests are fun and the little comments the dwellers make are hilarious."
9505,Fun game! Just peep my hours played. That should tell ya all you need to know
9506,"Great game for wasting some time here and then, and anway it takes a long time to level all your babies during LVL 1 to an Endurance of 10+7 :)"
9507,"real fun game, mang"
9508,"This was the last, good entry into the Fallout series before Beth ruined it with Fallout 4. RIP, and thanks for absolutely nothing, Todd."
9509,"I like this game and it really feels like a Fallout game. The only thing I don't like is it is mostly slow for a PC game. Overall, I enjoy this game"
9510,thumbs up
9511,"yeah its pretty good, devastating when you lose all your food water power and hapiness"
9512,"Trying little bit, good game"
9513,its fun
9514,"i love this game, well since i love fallout i didn't like it much on my mobile. But, on my PC is much enjoyable and easier for me to play. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes fallout the game series. I love the fact that you can but your own vault and assign the vault dwellers to do certain tasks."
9515,"So I once had this game on my phone, and once i found out that I could download it onto my PC I was so excited! I love Fallout shelter because its an easy quirky game. The only thing that I wish that there was more to do with all of the other Fallout games, Like Fallout 3, New Vegas, 1 and 2. It would be nice to be able to see some characters and old areas and have them in your vault."
9516,Super addicting and very fun. Big time waster.

9523,Nice time wasting game
9524,"Game is fun but pretty addictive, and I find myself wasting loads of time on it. My recommendation is don't open this can of worms."
9525,played the game for a day and decided to spend the $4.99 on a start pack. next day i had a power outage and it erased my save file. unable to recover the previous save and unable to get a refund. game is trash just like the devs....
9526,"everything
"
9527,"it good
"
9528,"Dumb fun, time killer."
9529,the game freezes when i select a dweller at the beginning.
9530,g
9531,"Good, balanced time-killer. Don`t need donate (as many games same genre)."
9532,really nice game
9533,.
9534,"its good, cuz it isnt stress like others
"
9535,somewhat good of a game for people with adhd lmao. but gets repetitive at times. specially with those damn deathclaws.. lmao. so this game isn't to bad. just a time killer honestly.
9536,Good to play during lockdown :D
9537,kinda boring but gud game
9538,"Wow, good game."
9539,its a good and funny game
9540,"Its fun but addictive. Its good not much to say about it though. Of course im a big fan of bethesda, I have been since i first played prey but this isnt exactly their best work. But it is a free game so i guess its good quality. Any way. to re cap good fun but kinda boring after a while
5.9/10"
9541,one of te best free games ive played
9542,dont waste your time
9543,"very nice game ‚ô•

9544,I won't give up until I get all the achievements! :)

9547,To build up shelter for nest april
9548,bruh its finer then the kardashians
9549,This is a great game. I love the ability to go on missions and find key items.
9550,good game
9551,It's grinding to the max but yeah it's fun :P
9552,o
9553,The game is fun but after a while it gets boring which is fine because its free and you don't need any extra purchases to make it more fun. I've only had like two glitches but all in all a pretty good free game.
9554,For a free game it's really enjoyable and a good time killer
9555,nice
9556,k
9557,Naizlaaaa~
9558,it has real time countdowns which wastes a LOT of time
9559,"cool game , but its better for mobile"
9560,Great for if you have children and they cant play the major games.
9561,It's good
9562,"Be careful. You cannot spend more then a few minutes on your vault before you will be attacked. Your weapons are never strong enough to take out the attacker. you will loose a lot of dwellers, your power and food will be gone and your dwellers will die a slow death.w.Death claws, Rad Scorpion. They come in and kill your dwellers. You can't stop it. Then you spend caps to revive, and can't progress. They come again, same thing. If I had to pay to play I wouldn't waste my money. But free, I mess around. Just killing time till OI can afford a game. I like he build games like Sim City. This was the closet I could find in the free range.But could be interesting if you could spend time but you can't."
9563,"Good game to play while bored, requires you invest time and you have to check in periodically to earn new items and check on survivors you have sent into the wasteland."
9564,meh
9565,"This is ofc a very good and chill game, i would recommend this any day to all of ya!"
9566,Time killer..
9567,"a good time consumer 
"
9568,"I like playing this on PC better, it can be hard to be accurate on mobile. However, there are mobile sales on loot boxes and pet crates that don't seem to be on sale with Steam. Disappointing."
9569,"This game is a lot less frantic than regular Fallout, I think, and that lends to the other aspects of the game. Having the resources to manage as well as quests is different and a lot of fun. I play it a lot whenever I can, and I think it's a lot of fun as far as a little game like this goes. I also love that the daily reward doesn't reset if you miss a day."
9570,+
9571,stupid deathclaws killing my
9572,"Simple, but addictive!"
9573,YES
9574,kk
9575,"I like your Skechers, you like me my Gucci shoes"
9576,12/10 would collect caps
9577,"Great Game. Not that much grinding, either."
9578,fun game
9579,everything
9580,"A wonderful addition to the fallout franchise in which you can run, organize, protect, and expand your vault to defend your dwellers and thrive in the post apocalyptic wasteland."
9581,Good stuff.
9582,"This game is easy to grasp and can be a quick check in (that ends up being hours of play time if one is not careful). I have learned to not leave the game run without observation. I accidentally wiped out my vault in about one hour, when I fed myself. Each new vault gets easier to do things a little more efficiently and there is always room to do make vaults that show savage survivalists or to be creatively bizarre. I like the story lines though I wish the dialogue would go a little slower, or allow a repeat if one did not catch it originally but it is not a necessity."
9583,this sends skyrim to obliven
9584,"played on my phone when it first came out. it said 0 downloads when i got it it was that early, it was trash because when you got off it would still use all your resources so fast and everything. it was buggy, but idk if they fixed it nor do i wanna see. but pc version is great, there hasnt been any bugs yet, many hours to come."
9585,It's fun but it's more meant to be played on your phone or tablet
9586,"Better then other games they """"""MADE"""""" (slapped their name on) and it has yet to crash in the amount of time I have played so that is a huge plus."
9587,Best Fallout out of the last 3 released!
9588,it is a good game to play be happee
9589,its fun
9590,"You're the Overseer, you manage stuff. That's all."
9591,Its a great game for people who arent expecting a game like all the other Fallout games. You upkeep your vault so that your dwellers can live! only complaint is they haven't added anything really game changing in a while.
9592,IT'S A FUN TIME KILLER
9593,It's really fun but it's slow paced. You need lots of patience.
9594,Very Good
9595,Better than 76
9596,"Best Bethesda Fallout game!

It just works"
9597,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9598,Great system! Wish they would release the Chinese version here in the West!
9599,"EVERYTHING love playing it, and doing the quest......"
9600,its cool
9601,mantul
9602,"I enjoyed how simple this game is (compared to the Console and PC versions of Fallout) while also being challenging through completion of Quests as well as upgrading the avatars. Its easy to try again and again to create the ""perfect vault"" maximizing resources better with attempt and never becoming bored."
9603,Really good management sim. But hits a paywall to really get anywhere. So be prepared to get sucked in for several hours then suddenly realize you will actually have to pay for the experiences to make it anywhere.
9604,fun
9605,"fun balance of idling and active play, if only there were a family tree so you don't accidentally try to set up cousin because the they have different last names and can't remember who's whose ancestor XD"
9606,nice
9607,"it's fun! Get to design and build your own vault, fight off radroaches, defend against raiders, send people out to explore the wastelands and more.  Something always keeps you busy, while at the same time the game isn't stressful."
9608,"Good vault builder but to get started, realistically, you need to invest in it otherwise it will take forever to get anywhere but once you're into it and have unlocked quests, it is a really fun and addictive game"
9609,nice game
9610,"I like this game, which is why it annoys me so much that I have to write this. I got to the endgame in Shelter -- cleared most of the quests, got to the last floors I could build to, crammed as many people as could fit into the building -- and then, one day, with no warning, [i] my save data disappeared. [/i]

I was shocked and upset, as one tends to be in these sorts of situations. I checked the cloud save for my files -- nothing. I checked the steam file folders -- nada. I went deep diving in the AppData files and other such folders game devs squirrel saves into -- zilch. So, perplexed, I went to google.

From what I could gather, this is a problem that's been around since its initial Steam release. Sometimes the data will just cease to be for no reason. I have yet to see any official addressing of the matter by Bethesda or Todd, or any word of fixes. Sometimes renaming Vault1.sav.bkp to Vault1.sav brings back your save, according to a Steam forum post I found; can't confirm, as it didn't work for me. My dwellers are, for all intents and purposes, dead.

Other versions of the game don't seem to have this issue; the app and Switch port seem perfectly happy to go about their day without killing all your little dwellers out of nowhere.

[b] TL:DR -- Sometimes the Steam version will just delete your save out of the blue. If you really want to give micropayments to Bethesda outside of Fallout 76, go for the original app or the Switch version. [/b]"
9611,bvzdkjvbSJvHBS
9612,p good
9613,This is a good management game with a few elements of combat and exploration.
9614,"I love putting my fake people in a box and haveing them make fake food to sustain themselves, I guess you could have this on your phone but it makes my steam library look bigger and therefore it makes me look cool"
9615,"Very amazing, I just dont really like the fact that you have to pay to get somewhere fast."
9616,.
9617,a very good and addictive version of the fun casual mobile game.
9618,ye
9619,Great management game. The key to a successful vault is training your dwellers like crazy! SPECIAL!
9620,"It's a very good game to play without a mouse, nice and portable."
9621,Good Game!
9622,Great Game to keep you busy
9623,"I like the vault/city management aspect of it, but as the quests get further and further away, and things take longer and longer to complete, it gets tedious."
9624,"This game is a bit repetitive when you start, but as your vault gets more advanced there's more things to get rid of boredom, like quests. There's a lot of things in this game that I like, such as events that can randomly happen. Overall, a great game."
9625,"Good: Lovely graphics and sound effects. Great setting. 

Bad: Awful UI. The game seems to leak memory and needs to be restarted after an hour. At it's core this really isn't a game; you do well by spending time on it. There are two difficulty spikes that it's very hard to anticipate; but once you're past them (probably by reading about them on the internet) there's nothing left."
9626,Absolutely a great way to kill time.
9627,good
9628,nice
9629,it's good if you want to take the role of an overseer over a completely normal vault
9630,Great fun
9631,Addictive and surprising.
9632,its good
9633,Good little time waster
9634,"Fallout Shelter is ok for a mobile game but I wouldn‚Äôt waste time on it.  If you want to get into a Fallout game I recommend playing Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3.  I prefer these two Fallout games over all the others especially New Vegas with its factions and great storyline.  Don‚Äôt even bother buying Fallout 76, I don‚Äôt even have to play that game to know that it is trash and Fallout 4 isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúbad‚Äù game, I just don‚Äôt prefer it over Fallout 3 and New Vegas because it doesn‚Äôt make a good Role Playing Game with its ‚ÄúYes, No, Maybe so‚Äù responses and the game costs 30 bucks and 60 bucks if you pay for all the DLCs and that‚Äôs just when it‚Äôs a bundle.  So in conclusion don‚Äôt waste your time playing Fallout Shelter yes it‚Äôs good but it is nothing compared to Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas which are only 10 bucks and they are worth it so spend some time playing those games"
9635,I KEEP GETTING ATTACKED BY MOLE RATS AND EVERYBODY IS DEAD AND THE POWER KEEPS GOIN OUT ITS SO ANNOYING

I'm striving to get power armour.

9644,kills time :)
9645,"Have this on console, PC and IPhone, great game!"
9646,It's very fun
9647,good
9648,its a good game
9649,"Overall enjoy the gameplay and mechanics of the game, but twice now it has crashed and deleted my saved game. Would recommend if it was more stable and didn't have the threat of losing all progress in an instant"
9650,Simply entertaining game that is based from Fallout series. Cartoon like graphics and easy to understand.
9651,"A fun game, not too complicated and perfect for lazy days when you simply want to rest. Definitely recommended :)"
9652,"If you love Fallout and you love free, then this game is for you!"
9653,"I really like the idea of this game, especially as it's in the Fallout universe. Build your shelter (base) with resource generators for people to work in (who require the resources to survive) all based on their stats, and over time accumulate coins and rewards that you can use to further upgrade your shelter and outfit your people. 

A simple premise, but the game does a great job at it, and the graphics are splendid (the audio, not so much.) You can also send explorers out into the world who will find goods and gear, though you have to pay attention to their health as they will encouter dangers (all played in the background). Recall them and they'll bring their spoils back (gear to make your people tougher).

There is a birth mechanic whereby two of your people may decide they 'like' each other (nudge-nudge) and one ends up pregnant - after some time, a child appears and eventually becomes an adult. In this way, you continue growing your population (which requires more workers for more resource producing rooms for more advanced rooms like training and medical).

There are danger events that will occur in your shelter ranging from an infestation of radiated rat attacks to fires to scavanger assaults. Any people stationed in affected rooms will fight (the rats, fires, assaults, etc.) and this is why better gear for them is useful. In and of itself, an okay idea to liven up what would otherwise be a bit of a mindless idle-state game.

But that's where the problem comes in, as well. Despite everything about the game I really enjoy, here are a few issues that keep me from wanting to really put any more time into it (let alone spend any more real money...)

- The pregnant weapon constantly scream while the emergencies are occurring, and it is annoying AF.
- The screen 'autozooms' to a room with an emergency, and their is no way to disable this. Again, annoying AF.
- While emergencies are happening, resource production is halted in those rooms (but not consumption...) Worse, during scavenger attacks (which are VERY frequent) then all resource production halts even if those rooms are far away from the invaders.
- Finally, despite this being basically an idle-state game, resources DO NOT COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY. If you don't click your water or food rooms when they have ""made"" their goods, your people will get angry, get sick, and die.
- And what's particularly atrocious (and the primary reason I have stopped playing) is that when you quit the game, while it is offline resources are STILL BEING CONSUMED. So you come back after a few days and all your resources are in the red. If you have positive production, you can eventually get them back up, but this supposes that you don't have emergencies occurring (which you will.)

It's such a great idea for a game, and for a few hours it's a thrill to play and see evolve. But these issues I mentioned are, all combined, too much for me. And that last what... Who the hell programs a game to keep running even while you've shut it down WITHOUT some automated options to keep the gamestate from being ruined when you return? So I cannot recommend. (At least not the Steam version. I've read read the Android version will actually 'stop running' if you close the memory process...)"
9654,"A nice little base builder, not a ton of content but the achievements are entirely rng based. Not all the achievements but the ones that are require you to get all the super rare drops from the lootboxes that drop from missions. The missions take hours real time to complete so maybe a few hours actual play time spread out over time to get through all the content.
If you care about collecting acheiements this isnt the game for you, if you dont care about them and just want a nice little base builder then its definetly worth giving it a try"
9655,"Played this on Android OS when it was first released, never had any problems. However, I do have run time errors in the PC version downloaded from Steam. The game slows down,  freezes and crashes. Pretty odd considering that I can run Destiny 2 and Space Engineers normally without any problems. What do you people think?

9665,hours and hours of fun
9666,"Apart from being p2w, it's still a great resource management game. You can still do everything in game without paying anything, but it is going to take some time. You will especially love this game if you are a fallout fan."
9667,todd stole my lunch money
9668,This is a fun game that you don't have to put much effort into with my only grievance being the fact that today I woke up and found that the game had been un-installed and all my progress reset which was sad because I was in like mid-game
9669,"if you like fallout, youll like this, play this while waiting for fallout and play fallout while waiting for this, havent encountered a bug on PC, Xbox and mobile. great work"

9691,"After 160 Hours of play time, probably 90 Hours just trying to get Legendary Dwellers, I still recommend this game. It's quirky, funny, weird, odd, and so many other words to describe it.

While this game won't be for everyone, it will be very entertaining to some. It's like having your own Vault full of little human ants/super soldiers you are training to progress in the game. Great game to check in on between a busy schedule or in between other games. You can pass anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour+ during each sitting.

The main downfall of this game, is the rate at which Legendary Dwellers are dropped, for those trying to get 100% Achievements. My first month, of 70 Hours, I had 9/20 Legendary Dwellers. 0 the next month, and finally, whoop de doo, my 10th Legendary Dweller the month after.

There are In Game Purchases of A Starter Pack, Bottles, Lunch Boxes, Pets and Mr. Handys. However, Legendary Dwellers only come at a rate of 50-60 Lunch Boxes, which will take you like 1000 Hours, or $100+, which is unjustified.

That being said, this is a great game to check out, but don't bother working towards the Legendary Dweller Achievement, or you'll be saying to yourself, 'Go on Quest. Find Treasure. Repeat.'"
9692,great time killer with zero problems
9693,"was fun, good story, liked the progression. definately something you binge play for a bit and the stop tho."
9694,played this game for 4 years and  i still love it
9695,Great time killer between calls while I work.
9696,dis shit good cuz
9697,ye
9698,great little time waster. worth a download
9699,I just simply love this game. It is adorable.
9700,"Fallout Shelter is a great game! 
It looks like just a way to keep your time busy without using brain but it is a lot much more!
Keep Dwellers safe, happy and proficient is somethimes really difficult. Each one of them has his own characteristics and you should find a way to engage them in the right way. When your Vault reach significant size, game become even more complex! No worry for risking to become boring! Excellent"
9701,"Really linear and addictive, but gives room for breaks and pauses. And it's free!"
9702,bad
9703,good
9704,I like it whatever

9706,100% awesome
9707,"Not a game you spend hours at a time one, but it's a nice casual builder."
9708,
9709,Very entertaining
9710,I like the fact that you don't have to pay money on this game and also you have fun a lot.
9711,i mean yea sure play the game but ya gotta be patient
9712,fallout vibe
9713,Good game to spend some time re
9714,OF course i have no power
9715,"Pros: 
- Hours of fun if you like SimTower kind of games
- Quests are a nice break between gameplay that can get monotonous
- Crafting systems are fun

Cons:
- Family trees can get screwed up fast and there's really no way to keep track
- Inventory management can be better

All in all, nice casual fun for a free game. Nice way to kill time."
9716,Its free
9717,fun way to background waste time. oddly compelling micromanaging the vault.
9718,"One important thing to note before playing: this game is not for the impatient. A lot of fun things to do here - from resources, crafting, to going on quests in the Wasteland - involve waiting for hours and hours, sometimes even for days on end. Whether the experience after all that waiting is worth it is up to the individual player.

I, for one, am not a patient person in general, so I play a modded game, if only to see the growth potential of a vault that I could never see or even notice under normal, unmodded circumstances. I am well aware that I'm cheating my way through the game, but after playing this game on mobile and being frustrated by how much time I have to invest in this game, I figured that playing this game with a mod would be alright.

In any case, it's free to play. I suppose the only thing that can be lost here is one's time, and even that can be controlled by the player by deciding whether or not they should invest their time in this game."
9719,p2w
9720,kkk
9721,This game is very fun and its pretty worth it giving money for something so 10/10
9722,"have nice time in this game try it guys
"
9723,"gud
"
9724,"For A Mobile Game Ported to PC, not to bad"
9725,This game is infuriatingly addictive.
9726,"Clearly Bethesda is not interested is doing anything for for this game which is pathetic.  After their fallout 76 crap I have lost a lot of respect for the company, they used to be solid but now I won't touch any of their games until I read a lot of good solid reviews.  Anyways I have played Fallout Shelter a lot, it is addictive and not in a good way.  As others have stated the ""hero"" dwellers you can get are worse then the ones you breed because their endurance is never maxed and they always have some levels.  There is no end game content, the ""quests"" just keep recycling.  Once you get all the rooms, a bunch of dwellers fully trained and outfitted there is nothing left to do."
9727,"Very addictive, have to get the perfect shelter"
9728,neato
9729,"It's simplistic, uncomplicated, tough to screw up, it's a timesink and something to turn back to every day and get results from. It's like Tamagochi, post-apocalyptic brand edition."
9730,gtwaA
9731,it good
9732,its alright
9733,GOOD
9734,Another mobile game on Steam!
9735,very time consuming
9736,"THE. Most. Boring. And. Shallow. Game. Ever! Even. For. Freemium!

Thought it may be a game like ""Oxygen Not Included"" or ""Craft the World"" or ""This War of Mine""... as it is feels similar designed like them at first glance. But, by far not. While it has some elements, like attributes of the characters (dwellers), they add little to none to the game. 

You are not building in this game. You only PAY caps (money) for placing rooms ready. You are not digging in this game. You only have to PAY caps to remove stones if they are in the way. You are not managing anything in this game. All you can do is, keep pressing RUSH buttons. There are just 2-3 disasters, but you have no control over the disasters or solving them. Just keep watching and hope your dwellers will manage the situation. You are sending dwellers to the Wasteland, but you can't do anything. It's all just a chance game, picking things from a list of events and giving you a log of it. 

And, of course, typical for freemium games, it all takes lots of time, to complete anything. Though, there's not much to complete, all you can do is, wait or keep pushing rush buttons. 

There are literally only 2 resources that truely matter, caps and nuka cokes. And both, can be bought with real money. All the other things in the game like outfits and weapons and pets, are just for collection (even the inventory is created in this way, so you have the feeling you're missing and just hope, you may randomly collect one of the missing ones). You're not using any other resources ever for anything, than just caps (the in-game money currency) to only pay for building rooms and pay for upgrading them. That describes the whole game, actually.

You can't manage shit in this game, and almost everything is just a random chance. Simply. Boring. To death. You're better looking for one of the other mentioned games, as they truely excel. This one feels rather like a money-making experiment, as comparable to similar games, it feels, there has been little effort and work involved in creating this game.

Moreso, the Fallout franchise has been used to get people knowing the franchise interested in it. On itself, if it weren't for the Fallout branding, this game would have had no chance of surviving..."
9737,if you like managing your world this is a relaxing builder with a great theme
9738,"I enjoy this game very much! You can spend relatively small amounts of time on your vault and keep it maintained or you can stick around and find the ""Stranger"" and maybe ""Bottle & Cappie""! Have fun :)"
9739,It gud  built vault
9740,"Game is good, addictive and easy to play. Quests can be repetitive but overall game design is fine. I found few bugs and game crashed more than once but it's not a deal breaker. For a Fallout fan this is refreshing game."
9741,Cool game go play it
9742,Good
9743,"I thought this game was Fun, Enjoyable, and Relaxing. It's free to play, I would suggest trying it out."
9744,because yes
9745,"good time filler but it has to concepts that contrast one being that it's a time consuming focus game that wants you to specific in everything you do however things happen slowly and yeah you can go do something 
else but your food energy and water will still go down so you it's odd in that aspect but fun"
9746,Frustratingly fun
9747,"can get very busy, many things to do all at once"
9748,The quest are fun but I recommend you stick to one and only focus on one vault at a time.
9749,"Actually better than what I remember of it years ago on mobile. Addictive and simple, while also layered a little bit with complexity."
9750,its lit and free #Classic
9751,h
9752,just awesomeness on the phone or on your PC!
9753,"Pretty fun if you're looking for build-up type game. Pay-to-win is possible but still playable without having to spend a dime. Everything eats up time unless you us Nuka-Cola but the game ""idles"" if you're willing to just wait timers out. Very simple to play, recommend everyone to try."

9761,I love that I can do a few things and then come back later. Quests that weren't started yet are still there after a long time and even one's I did seem to still be there so the effort isn't lost over time. Good game to fill shorts periods of time.
9762,Good game Stubby approved
9763,good free game
9764,That moment when in the Fallout franchise a literal mobile game is more enjoyable and functional than Fallout 76.
9765,GG
9766,"very guuuuud
"
9767,"Radscorpians make the game unplayable, Deathclaws are easier. Figure that bullcrap out."
9768,"Super fun, super easy to play, wicked addictive, able to play while multi-tasking too!  Plus it only cost about FREE fidday!"
9769,"It wiped my data. I didn't do anything and it wiped all my work. I played so much, i did so much and lost it all."
9770,Fun time filler
9771,"It's a grind-y pay to win game, with all the tedium that comes with that.  The user interface is annoying and frustrating at times.  Some of the disasters, like fires, get tedious and boring very quickly.  Be prepared to discard your first and maybe second vault as you figure out optimal build strategies.

My biggest annoyance is the way it punishes you for shutting the game down for a few hours so you can, like, have a life outside gaming.  Several times now I've come back to the game to find that my power, which was full, and which is generated at DOUBLE the usage, has fallen below the redline.  Then the game decided to shut down one room - my cafeteria.  And by the time I got power above the redline again, food was below the redline.  It's ridiculous and stupid.  Apparently my vault USES power while the game isn't running, but it doesn't PRODUCE any.  Asinine.  The same thing happens during protracted quest runs.

The user interface was designed by drunken monkeys.  It's very frustrating, especially during the all-too-frequent disasters.

Besides that, though, it's an entertaining little sim that that can be played on computer or tablet.  It has a lot of inside humor.  It'll be more fun if you've played other Bethesda games."
9772,"Simple game requires no serious devotion. can be turned off anytime
"
9773,cool.
9774,This Game is Awesome!!!! It Gives you the Chance of Running your Own Vault and being the Leader of a Community! (Kinda Like Fallout 4) But You can experiment on your Dwellers Kinda! Like the one im going to do is Making a Vault out of One Male and a Female and Let them have kids and Only Use Them! Or A Communist Kinda Vibe where i Kick One Out!                                                        Over All...This Game is the Best!
9775,You can also take refuge while chasing a TV series.awesome!
9776,"In under a month, this very quickly became my most played game. It's very addictive at the start, and it's only really satisfying when looking back at how far you've come. I like being able to name my dwellers, and now that I have over a hundred living in my shelter, I'm focusing more on quests.

Yeah, it kind of sucks you in, and it brings a kind of monotonous fun. I'm just glad I'm playing it on here instead of draining my phone's battery. Plus, the bigger screen helps a ton."
9777,is good
9778,"Great little time waster, once your shelter is set up you only need to spend a few minutes a day to keep it going. Or hours running quests if you want."
9779,:3
9780,Its fun when u dont have anything to do
9781,mod to cheat or money grab to play
9782,I'd say it's a good way to waste your time when you are bored and have a trash PC
9783,h
9784,I like dis game

9789,It's like my own little interactive ant farm!

9791,It's a nice leisurely game that passes time so easily
9792,"It's a nice game.
"
9793,"Steam wouldn't let me post my previous review despite it being within the character limit so here's the short version:

One of the best time wasters I've ever played - just don't spend any money on it and back up your saves regularly."
9794,Love wasting time on this game hahaahahaa
9795,Love it!
9796,69
9797,"Its not too easy, hard or boring. its got its ups and downs but its a definite try xDDD"
9798,fun
9799,This is an addictive time passer.  I am a long-time Fallout fan.  This scratches the itch and is free to play.
9800,this is the best game on steam
9801,"A child can be born with a receding hairline.

9804,it is a nice game if you ask me
9805,"I have Hundreds of hours for Mobile and the Non Steam Version of Fallout Shelter, but it's a Fantastic great time killer, great game mechanics easy to learn, and very enjoyable!"
9806,"If you like managing things... or 200 people this is the game for you! I personally loved it on the mobile just because I can play it anywhere, but I never got too into it on the PC. But hey it's free just try it!"
9807,:thumbs_up_man:
9808,its pretty epic dawg.
9809,"Pretty fun, definitely recommend this game for people who are pay to win enthusiasts. Lots of cool cosmetics to discover and Mr Handy's to own. 10/10"
9810,it's a nice game but radscorpions are fucking aids to deal with
9811,"Its one of the best free games in steam, In my opinion. 

If you want: 

Adventure, Strategy, Manage, Simple, Making baby little weird :}~

Its Worth your time :)"
9812,"It's Fallout Shelter but on PC. It's cumbersome to open and close all the time but it's time system is weird and it isn't portable. Good game overall, just much better on mobile."
9813,"The game is fine, but you cannot resize the screen so it's either full screen or tiny.  Kind of a bonehead move for an otherwise ok game
"
9814,a little addictive
9815,fun to play when bored of fallout 4
9816,I like nukes
9817,"Idk, not bad"
9818,"This is a very fun and entertaining product. You will spend hours on end on this game. Although it isn't graphically pleasing, I love the idea of running a vault and sending vault dwellers to the wastes on missions, or to explore! I would rate this game 4/5, as the only issue is the late game is EXTREMELY difficult. Other than that amazing game!"
9819,It's a fun background game
9820,not a game to spend thousands of hours in but its a good casual game to sit back and relax to.
9821,Yo lo apruebo.
9822,"This game was a cute, easy game to pass the time. I almost had all the achievements and a full, complete bunker with maxed out characters. And then the power outage hit my house. When I turned my computer back on, the save file was gone. Almost 80 hours worth of game play (and a little money put in), gone down the drain with absolutely no way to retrieve the file or previous versions of the save file. Thanks Bethesda."
9823,"This is a great game highly addictive and it is free you can purchase stuff in the game or earn it through doing challenges i have played this on Phone PS4 and on Steam and i really enjoy it, cannot really think of any cons to this game it is what you get and any Fallout fan will enjoy it."
9824,"OK 
"
9825,"After playing the game for four hours and getting pretty far into the gameplay mechanics, I had used a nuka cola, the premium form of in game currency used to hurry things along if you don't feel like waiting, to hurry a survivor back from a long scouting mission in the wasteland. Only after using the cola did the game crash with an error popping up, never allowing me to visit this vault again. Every time I try to load my vault, I get a short loading screen followed by a crash. What should I have expected from a game originally meant for mobile?"
9826,its cool and fun
9827,"Pretty fun for a while, but this game doesn't get updated anymore for years already. Keep that in mind coming into this game."
9828,Very good
9829,"It's a fun game, can be hard to start, I suggest some of the guides for the game to start you off. The only major problem is that even if a free game to get places faster you need to spend money."
9830,"–ü—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞—è, –Ω–æ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–∞—è –∏–≥—Ä—É—à–∫–∞. –ó–∞—Ç—è–≥–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç"
9831,Iz okay I guess somewhat p2w
9832,Good
9833,"i love seeing how much of a failure i am at guiding a human sanctuary from getting overrun by monsters
its also rlly cool to watch all of your loyal followers die off one by one from various causes 10/10 game"
9834,"Good Game, after 76 i was revisiting some older titles and i can confirm this is at the very least a good time waster"
9835,Its a fun game that I go back to every so often. I am 4 achievements away from completing. I wish theyd add more content but I know that its free and came out to promote Fallout 4. So Ill enjoy what they offer. Like I said its a fun small game to waste about half hour on.
9836,Fun
9837,Game is simple and a lot of fun.
9838,The game can be so organized and the missions are so much fun to do!
9839,"awsome game
"
9840,5/5
9841,chill gaming
9842,.....
9843,Makes you want to jump straight back in to the originals
9844,"I am not recommending this game, not because its a bad game or i don't like it (don't get me wrong), I am simply not recommending this game because one achievement is practically unattainable.  This is meant to be a mini-game (like a phone game).  So to add an achievement that less than 5% of your players have attained, along side of players like myself with more than 100hrs into this game going for that achievement is unreal.  I am left to think that is the one and only ""unattainable"" achievement which is meant to lead you into just keep playing knowing only 1 in 1 million people are going to be randomly selected to receive it.  Now before you get on the wrong track, receiving this final achievement wouldn't encourage me to quit playing the game.  On the contrary, its a sense of completion and accomplishment to keep you going and feeling good about said game.  So when the last achievement is fixed/re-evaluated, I would totally recommend this game.  I'm just not on board with the misconception that all these achievements are ""ACTUALLY"" obtainable.  Fix it, so I can fix my review (because i really do like the game)."
9845,Easy to casually play and sink a few hours into
9846,Fun game to play while wasting time. I have been playing it off and on since it came out. Huge Fallout fan.
9847,at the start ist ok and fun but later its just getts so bad recomend to try uot but not for long
9848,Chill...
9849,pretty dank g
9850,very good game
9851,"Simplistic game and time killer. 68 hours I definitely enjoyed.

However Technical issues do exist: If your computer crashes for whatever reason (power out in my case) while you are running the game your save data can be wiped. That is what happened to me, after 68 hours my vault is just gone.
The save file still existed yet was blank. *BE SURE TO MAKE A MANUAL BACKUP* as steam cloud did not save my game. ""C:\Users\*User*\AppData\Local\FalloutShelter""."
9852,Just a good free to play game
9853,Yes
9854,"Really fun game for travelling to play on your laptop or also on your phone. Every decision you make, controls how your vault is going to be. If you decide wrong your vault could be dead."
9855,Somehow better than Fallout 76.

9857,"this game is a vibe. seriously though bro like you come in and you see the constantly pissed off Mr. Handy bot that you named Charles and legit your whole day is just immediately better. Watching these tiny little things beat the daylights out of raiders and like just smile bro seriously it's just wow. Good game good job. epic.

Legit though Charles is constantly angry like he has no chill he's an angry robot nothing gets better than that and it's just refreshing legit though"
9858,Its a good time waster.

9866,"TL;DR: Passes the time, but highly encourages MTX. 7/10

It's a fun and interesting game to play in passing with unique elements that tie into the Fallout universe. Spending real-world money is highly encouraged to expedite expeditions as well as get better gear quicker, but the game itself is perfectly playable without add-ons. When you don't pay-to-play, you can expect 5+ hour wait times for completing quests and other such things, which isn't awful. All-in-all, this game is much better as a mobile game than a console/PC one, but that's okay.

Edit: As others have said, this game has a tendency to crash every so often (like most Bethesda games), so if you value your progress ***AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME AS NEITHER STEAM NOR BETHESDA WILL REFUND LOST PURCHASES*** backup your game."

9870,Didn't really enjoy it.
9871,it's cool to play in the back round during homework
9872,its free why not download it.
9873,"***WARNING***
This game has a glitch with the PC which is a game ender. I lost everything, my whole game. After 70ish hours I would have had to start over. Not interested. 

*** Update*****
I have come back to the game and it this bug seems to have been patched. Im not 100% on that, but my computer has had some recent issues and has shut down unexpectedly a few times, with no ill effect on the game. 
My last comment on the game:
Very fun, but to get the last achievement i would have to pay to get it, or expect to play steady for the next few years to acquire it in game. a little maddening. 

However, if you watch out for the glitch and want to risk it, it is a good addition to the Fallout Universe. Fun time waster. Lots of missions to play and they had added ( at the time) new features pretty steadily."
9874,i liked this game one the phone so why not on pc big mistake if the game does not shutdown perfectly it will delete your save and it seems to be a common problem that has never been fixed everyone keeps saying back up your saves but for a game like this i should not have too its a crappy port that needs fixed
9875,"Horrible game:

* you can barely click shit

* game doesn't even have a goal
* you can barely click shit
* rushing is bullshit
* you can barely click shit
* endurance bug makes it ridiculous
* and you can barely click shit!"
9876,"I really liked this game until my wife tripped the breaker and computer shut off while I was playing. Rebooted it and all my game saves are gone. Would think there would be better protected game saves. 24 hours of game time, purchased caps with real money, and straight down the toilet. 
Now I'm so frustrated I deleted the game. Play this game at your own risk. Don't plan on playing long term, accidents can happen, a complete waste of time.
I'm sure a computer nerd will post on here of some way to retrieve the game saves, well I'm just an average user. Don't bother."
9877,i like it...
9878,there is wall

9880,I recommend this game it is very fun! #FalloutShelter
9881,Fun casual game to pass the time.
9882,"This is a very addictive game that has many features that not only pull you into the game, It also makes you question your sanity XD"
9883,pretty fun 7.3/10
9884,"This game is nothing less than a masterpiece, pure todd howard excellence. the way that man curates these absolute gems is honestly astonishing. i really really wish he would run a train on my bussy as he is so handsome and my dream boy. Late at night when i lie awake pondering the meaning if existence and my particularly pathetic one, he always seems to creep in to the back of my mind and then im enthralled by sexual fantasies and a raging erection for this man. And thats why i give this game my game of the year and a 100/10"
9885,"Such an absolutely blatant cash grab it's sickening.  You can no NOTHING in the game without spending cash money at their store.  Your expeditions to the wasteland will turn up nothing, the game moves at a snail's pace at best, and eventually you pay for the many kits to get the items you actually need, or just give up.
In other words, it's like almost any other game--carefully designed to maximize your need to indulge in endless ""microtransactions"" in order to even survive.  Such a shame, but that seems to define every Fallout product now.  Like so many others, customer enjoyment and satisfaction comes dead last--greed comes first."
9886,"Fun game but a lot of flaws. After looking around online some of these problems are over 4 years old, some should be extremely easy to add and are common sense basic features (like being able to sort by ascending or descending). It doesn't seem like they work on actual improvements for this game very often if ever, so what there is now is what you get. Still fun, but irritating, especially when you can see so many ways to make it so much better."

9891,Game still VERY buggy. Crashes more than a 90yr old blind lady driving a sports car on the freeway. The worst part is the KNOWN issue with the Overseers Office. The game STILL bugs out when trying to build this.
9892,good

9896,"For a Free to Play game, Fallout Shelter is as good as it gets. It's a PC port of a mobile game, and is unchanged from that version. It's the kind of game you play for 15 minutes once or twice per day to keep your Vault functioning properly. It's entertaining and doesn't require your undivided attention.

Unfortunately there are microtransactions, but they are unintrusive, and entirely unnecessary to play the game effectively. I have a strong Vault of nearly 200 dwellers and haven't spend a cent."

9914,"Pretty neat free game.
Had it on my phone, little life sim, tons of em on the phone.
This one is in the fallout universe.
I would recommend this, but more so on your phone."

9916,Good time killer. Casual management.
9917,Just a fun game to play
9918,amazing time waster
9919,games mostly fun but the raids are a hassle to deal with can't even guess how much of a hassle it would be if I got up to a 200 pop vault people with weapons should automaticly chase the raiders from room to room instead of having to drag people to the room an mess up where everyone is supposed to be working this isn't entertaining or engaging gameplay its just anouying
9920,this game has become part of my morning routine. coffee and fallout shelter lol. I recommend.
9921,Like a wall paper you can play with .
9922,...
9923,The game is entertaining and addictive
9924,microtransaction hell.
9925,Get it your phone! it is fun!
9926,"Fun little time waster between other games. Like all mobile games it lacks any real depth and is basically designed to drain your wallet as fast as possible. Thankfully, the game is one of those paradoxical free to play games that is actually more fun when you don't purchase the microtransactions (adding to a sense of challenge and progress that would otherwise be lacking). Spent $5 for the starter pack for a vault, but aside from that no real desire to spend more (just keep 3 groups of your dwellers completing quests at all times and you will get lunchboxes, quantum, etc fast enough).

Also for those who care, the Blast from the Past achievement ... talk about a money pit for that one. Either have to spend $1000 worth of lunchboxes or grind grind grind for 1000 hrs. I highly recommend not going for it or using save edits or something. This achievement is NOT in the console versions so its inclusion here is strange to begin with."
9927,Got Attacked on day 4. 10/10 i totally deserved it.
9928,this game is awsome but its a little slow maby its just me but it could get boring after a while
9929,"Brings back some fallout nostalgia. Obviously nothing like any of the actual games, but a well made civ game."
9930,"Now proposed for Linux, but either crashes out of the box or provides you with a very nice black screen."
9931,:)
9932,This game is almost perfectly made. It has so much to offer and really dives you into the fallout universe. It has incredibly good humor and a lot to unlock. It takes hours of gameplay but its really easy to play while doing something else. I would 100% recommend to anyone who enjoys fallout series.
9933,I can't keep it from crashing for even a half an hour
9934,pretty fun
9935,"So good, very fun, great lore!"

9946,"Fallout is a franchise that exists. Bethesda is a company that exists. This is a game that exists. Those statements are facts. Want another fact? Fallout shelter is better than Fallout 76.

In all seriousness this game is great. I have built and deleted too many different shelters just because I learned something new or something that would benefit my vault more. Its a slow start but you get to the point that you can sit and work on your vault for way longer than intended. I give this game 76/76 vault boys."

9956,it good
9957,"Would not recommend it if there wasn't Quest update.
Quest update makes end-game more interesting to play and most importantly, getting Caps, Lunchbox, sometimes Pet as a rare rewards.

Vault is generally fun to manage but comes with some major complains:
1) HP is not retroactive, which means dwellers obtained from lunchboxes are generally useless because their HP stats cannot be maxed well. HP is very very important in late game quests because high level quest's enemies are very deadly, as well as frequent Deathclaw/Radscorpion attack. So if the dwellers are not grown from level 1 with at least 15 Endurance (which is the most efficient way to get by crafting +5 E Sturdy Wasteland Gear and max train Endurance on level 1 dwellers before leveling), the Overseer is gonna have a rough time.
2) Without Mr.Handy, Electric is gonna drain at a heavy rate despite having a lot of generators. But Food and Water aren't.
3) Low tier production rooms are generally useless after unlocking new ones.
4) Lunchboxes rewards does not scale with the progression in Vault. In short, crappy rewards most of the time. Also issue (1). Not recommend to buy via cash.
5) Can't sell specific amount of items, only can sell 1 by 1 or sell all.
6) Overseer have to plan well on room layout, because Dwellers will not go interact incident on an empty room, even they are on same level. Nor there is an option to have emergency/security team (in which according to Fallout Lore, they do have various management team). Vault door only can have 2 dwellers to guard instead of 4, which is not good."

9976,"At this point that I`ve played about 90 hours,I have maximum everything and there is nothing more for me to achieve.
I even made my vault with only female Dwellers and killed all males :| just to have something to do.
but overall I liked the fact that the game was truly free to play. there is no element that forces you to buy anything and even Mr.handys are achievable in missions."

9991,"great, classic game. spent more hours playing it than i probably should be haha"
9992,This game is just a shameless attempt to monetise 'Nuka Cola'.  The 'incidents' that occur in the game are in no way related to the strength of your dwellers or their equipment - but they're presented in a manner that suggests they are.  The game has also been architected so that you can't just play it.  You have to do a few things and then come back several hours (or even days) later.  You can grind it if you're so bored that the only thing worse would be cleaning the toilet.  There is no end to the game.  There's not even a substantive plot.

10082,Really fun if you have played most fallout games but also lvling up and maxing out that one dweller with power armor is the best feeling.
10083,This game is fun for people who have played Fallout 4 or any other fallout game. It has neat references to the game and it brings back some nostalgia of playing as well. I would not recommend grinding all day I would say just log in and play 30-40 min a day and you should get good progress and not get bored like I did. I've gotten bored only because I have completed everything 100%. Seriously for a free game this is awesome!
10084,great game

10108,"I get you guys screwed up on the latest Fallout, but are you seriously telling me you can't even get this game right? BUGS!!!!! EVERYWHERE!!!! ... I can't even get past building an overseer room without the game locking up on the zoomed in instructions you force on us. Fallout used to be good, one of the best games. I don't know what happened but these games suck now."

10150,"fun game, very simple...doesnt really get ""hard"" anywhere.. but its free :)"
10151,"Made for mobile and it show

would be great if the micro-payments where removed and 
time controls added (speed up, slow down and stop time)"
10152,"This is just another bad bugged game whose purpose is to be a scheme from Bethesda to take your money through microtransactions. Don't waste your time, and specially, your money on this."
10153,"its fun, but not in big portions"
10154,No need to purchase anything to see all it offers. Small light that the franchise isnt completly lost
10155,Fun! Grows. Can have three vaults to juggle.
10156,"4/5

It's as pointlessly addictive as any other city building game, but it has a few things that really make it stand out. The quests you can send your dwellers on are fun; the SPECIAL points have bonus points both inside and outside the vault so you have to choose whether to keep stronger people inside in production, or outside to get better loot. 

There are only so many dialogue options for the random wasteland quests (I've done the 'food critic' quest about 5 times now) but it's still a better minigame than anything in, say, Tribez. 

After a certain point it's hard to save up enough money to do anything worthwhile. It's taken me 3 days to upgrade one room for a measly +3 production. But that only means checking in for a few minutes to either send out or recall explorers, so if you don't care about timing it's great.

I haven't paid any money for extra perks."
10157, The Art style is good. I find it unique and fun. The best thing about it that it's free. Even though I wish u could choose if your vault is a normal vault or an experimental vault.
10158,its cool
10159,"Holy Cow I'm STILL playing this game!

Played this game on console and spent some addition micro coin as well. Enjoyed it but didn't like the additional spending however it's so tempting. Downloaded it on PC 2 years later and man is it good. The secret; don't spend (who'd a thunk). Earn your way. Learn which weapons to use when and where, same with clothing ect. I also enjoy the quizes rekated to other Fallout games. This is actually a very good game and a real challenge when you get right down to it, again not to spend is the best challenge. A rewarding and fun way to spend time for sure and for a Fallout (3,4, & Vegas) fan like me all the more so."

10161,"Fun little casual resource management game. Not really a game you would play for hours at a time because most things are time-throttled, e.g, a quest that takes 2 realtime days to even reach, making outfits or weapons that take days or even weeks to complete. Lots of irritating ""features"" like the vault perspective meaning that you accidentally pick up things through walls, the inexplicable decision to make left and right click on the mouse do exactly the same thing, instead of making one for selecting and one for moving the vault view around, Bottle and Cappy invariably turning up in the middle of a vault raid.

Still, it's free, the graphics and sound are cheerful, and the gameplay is simple and easy to learn, so it still gets a thumbs up.

Can't not mention that if you're an OCD completionist, you will be massively disappointed in that they've included a steam achievement which is basically impossible (get 20 legendary vault dwellers) because you can only gain them from loot boxes. The math works out that you would have to open THOUSANDS of them to get it. Bad form, Bethesda. Bad form."
10162,yes
10163,"All I can say is that this isn't the best game in the world, but it's not the worst either. I do have a lot of fun playing this but after the first twenty minutes, things kinda come to a crawl, especially if you ran out of caps and you're waiting for a dweller to come back with some good loot or waiting on a room to give out food, power, or water. All in all, this is a game best played in short bursts, not in one sitting. The graphics are great though the game does have some glitches but the glitches doesn't deter my game play at all. And best of all, it's free!"
10164,Good for small breaks...
10165,Way to much requirements to be on this every day and way to hard to locate equipment as well as suriving from the demons or whatever they are called.
10166,Cool game for your free time
10167,bruh
10168,"This is definetely not meant to play in PC. Mobile is much better considering; time, investment, no store etc. If this game was combactible with phones i would definetely play this on both platforms"
10169,gets really fun when you spent a little bit of time playing
10170,"Fun, casual, well built. I never get bored."
10171,very fun yes indeed very

10184,My parents do this thing where they just shut off the internet at night so I like having a good time waster like this. I still don't get why people cheat or abuse glitches on this game though it defeats the purpose of everything and its not even online.
10185,"Fun way to pass the time. No end game so can't really ""beat"" the game.  You can master it by getting max number of dwellers though and enjoy building your little post-apocalyptic community.

You can play without spending any money.  Or if you are having fun you can buy Mr. Handy to help out and Pets b/c they are fun.  But, you don't have to."

10197,This game is NOT balanced
10198,"Cool game, easy to follow, for all levels of players. Linux compatible with Proton so win, win. I enjoyed the simplicity of the mechanics. Game is well polished and does offer items for purchase to enhance your game. However it does not cause massive interruptions to your game or the flow of the game. I have enjoyed this and it is a great Free to play game as far as I can tell so far. Thank you for this game, the work is much appreciated."
10199,"Game is even fun, for about 20 mins. After that, dwellers won't come anymore and you stare at the screen, seeing the ones already on the vault super happy and all ok, but either you have to be REAL patient until another dweller show up or spend money (real money - microtransactions) to speed things up. Even the babies take a LONG time to be born.

Since it's free, it's still worth a try, but I can't actually recommend it."
10200,fun game
10201,it passes time at work and reminds me of the fun of fallout 4 but also the mistakes of fallout 76. Just wish i could get it to freakin sync lol
10202,"i bought the mr. handy and he lasts long, but he is on the verge of going to die"
10203,"I'm not really into these types of games but its a great little side game, I'd suggest multitasking when playing because it does get boring/slow at some points."

10206,yees
10207,"This is the third time I'm playing this game. Started when it was still in the B-launcher and inaccessible without VPN.

Things got better since then.

I'm on my third vault, gradually achieving everything there is to acheive.  And it's still as enganging.

For those who would point out this is a money-grabber with microtransactions galore I would point out there are C-words for that, still free, as is this game.

So yeah, give it a spin, definitely."

10255,"I¬¥d like to make a review only concerning this game and not the whole franchaise. It does work nicely, is time consuming as a mobile game and single player only is cool, pricing in microtransactions is kinda higher than it should be, but then again it works like a mobile game. Is really cool and follows the gameplay similar to the other Fallout games. It is fine."

10268,Great game!
10269,A fun little resource management game to check in for a couple minutes each time to check on your vault.
10270,"Good game however the only way to get the legendary vault dweller achievement is to cheat over 500 lunchboxes into your game, otherwise you'll end up spending hundreds of $$$ buying them."

"
10274,Bruh
10275,"..
"
10276,"The game starts off as a charming diorama of Vault-Tec life where you manage your dwellers' everyday post-nuclear existence. It is a slick, well-polished simulation that takes advantage of the rich, irradiated world of Fallout. The signature retro art style is there, the lore references are plentiful, and the Vault somewhat comes alive when your dwellers multiply and start to occupy those underground rooms. They dutifully toil away at their jobs, even if their days are extremely shallow and repetitive. But it's a [i]Vault[/i] dammit, and it's [i]yours[/i], and it's [i]teeming[/i] with these artificial lives!

All in all, a harmless, super casual game if you ignore the sparkling tin lunchboxes Bethesda tries to sell you.  

Until 72 hours later, you've gotten inexplicably attached to your simple, mindless citizens and the mechanical yet satisfying tasks of leveling, training, and breeding them, when the game suddenly decides it's over. It bugs out and you are stuck at the loading screen, forever locked away from your babies who are probably wondering why their Overseer has forsaken them. You know there are ways to fix this that involve messing with the save files and whatnot. But sometimes, it's easier to just let go...

... and leave a pointless negative review instead.

Good bye Bittercup, you were always my favorite."
10277,
10278,Great game to have in the background when you do other things. Don't need to have 100% focus all the time.
10279,"Great game Just needs be a litlke bit more to do in between quests and waiting for wasteland explorers to return
"
10280,sexy game
10281,"Having played this before, it's easy mode. Not hard at all and pretty fun. I do lowkey wish you could put two guys or girls in the living quarters to increase the Vault's happy meter. Why can't we all just smash for fun amirite or amirite fellas?!"
10282,Mobile game. Very slow and limited gameplay. Fun enough to keep playing for a while.

10289,"I've played this game forever when I was little and I hope it keeps up its work. It has a few things they can do to make the game a little less frustrating, but overall its a awesome game."
10290,"I need a place to stay, and a fallout shelter seems perfect."
10291,"I like this game - spent many hours playing 

on another note in a previous review
I don't see how:
""HI!  I like turkey bacon"" violates a terms of service..  I've read through the subscriber agreement and find nowhere that any mention of turkey bacon constitutes a violation of the TOS.  I think you just made that up and want to be a complete jerk because you're a heathen and you don't like turkey bacon.  is turkey bacon spelled out in the TOS of steam?  if so and Steam is inherently against turkey bacon i will cry.

Anyway this game does not contain any turkey bacon, and the bacon content of the game is sadly void.  the game itself is highly focused on eating though, which is what prompted the turkey bacon comment.  there are no turkeys or pigs in the game so bacon as aforementioned is not present.

Still recommending the game and not recommending steam moderators.

10302,A lot of fun if you have at least a bit of patience.
10303,"10/10 so much better than fallout 76. No glitches or ""extra features"" but of course there are loot boxes (lunch boxes) but who cares when you can get everyone into the barracks and double your vault population with the snap of your fingers. Since no one can die of old age, people are an infinite resource. So you can get the kids to works in the Power stations, Diners and Water purification centres whilst the adults grow the population. Everyone is equal in this game and that's good. 10/10 Stalin would approve."
10304,Good game to play in the bus station or in the Bathroom !

Like many others, I enjoy the Fallout franchise... to an extent. I loved Fallout 1 and 2 back in their hay-day to the point of obsession, so when Fallout 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4 came along I was more than willing to jump head first with no questions asked. 
The same cannot be said for Fallout Shelter I am afraid. This is a glorified mobile game, and although it has been done well, with story-line quests, character bloodlines and key NPC's from the newer Fallout games remodelled into the Pip-Boy format, it is worth remembering that all mobile games are essentially cash-grab.
The same can be said here, with 'lunch boxes' being the loot-box criteria here, alongside the option to purchase bottle-caps with real money. Although this is not game-breaking and yes, you 'can' complete the game without ever spending more than the initial game price tag, this will take far more grinding than the game is worth. For the first 50 levels you should be fine, and the game  is enjoyable. But once you start unlocking the higher tier rooms you will find that caps are very hard to come by, so purchasing them will be another story altogether.
All in all, another cash-grab mobile game, albeit as good one.
TL:DR
Pros -
* Nice little vault builder/time sink
* Good to see NPCs from the Fallout series in Pip-boy models
* Easy to play, looks good, runs smoothly on most devices
* At least it's not 76

Cons
* Cash-grab mobile game from a company that really doesn't need the influx
* Real-time waiting for quests (10+ hour journeys before you even get to start the mission, 5 hours return)
* Nuka-Quantum is the 'diamond resource' which is rare to find, encourages to buy with real money to shorten journey times
* Bottle-caps become difficult to find (2100 caps per small room, for last few builds upgrades cost even more. Lucky to get 20 caps from level-ups or luck bonus)

10314,its a no brainer
10315,its very fun
10316,"Though at times it can get a bit dull, it's also really fun seeing what types of vaults i can build"
10317,lol
10318,"for players who never played a fallout game,dont play it.i assure you,you are gonna hate the game.for fallout fans,very good game"
10319,"The game is fun.  I have played it on my xboxone / mobile phone but cannot for the life of me get it work on linux/steam it just will not work with the proton thing at all.  The game itself is good, just linux support sucks."
10320,This Game seemed Great but then you play it for a while and your stuck can get caps not enough food and then the game gets so boring because you start to do nothing. DO NOT GET THIS GAME.
10321,Good for chilling

I enjoy playing while listening to a podcast. The game is a nice chilled game.
Needs more updates for new content.
Great game"
10324,fun
10325,"Very complex, reasonable learning curve, highly stable, lets you basically ply middle-management. Not a huge amount of creativity, and a little repetitive (Not to mention the stats take forever unless you pay-to-win)"
10326,If you are bored?
10327,Yeah just don't spend all your rent on lunchboxes!
10328,"A great game, very addicting. One second it's 5:00 then you launch this game then all the sudden it's 12:00 and it was a time well spent."
10329,"Great game, my wife and I have really been enjoying Fallout Shelter, very cool concept."
10330,"Good game, loads of entertainment"
10331,"It's free to play, and for such type of games it is not too demanding for real money: you can achieve high levels without too much grinding, and the ads are not being shoved into your face. Graphics level is decent even on hi-res monitors. It has a neat quests feature which allow you go explore in other location, which can be a welcome change of scenery. If you like that type management games, feel welcome to try it."
10332,"just cheat, thats the best thing you can do to improve your experience"
10333,its a fun game i liked how it was a whole building type of game with some fighting it is a little pay to win i recommend the starter pack

10342,no
10343,A fun and chill game for anyone looking to vent off from other games.
10344,"Roaming the wasteland takes time, producing goods takes time, leveling takes time, fights take time, building is instant... the fuck Bethesda?

This game is shit. You can bypass the microtransactions with a save editor and give yourself what you want/need to speed everything up.

It's made with Unity, so you can mod it how you want.

They stopped developing it, because it wasn't the cash cow they had hoped.

It's full of stupid mechanics that only a retarded Bethseda employee could ever love.

Why do I play it? Because I fixed some issues. Should I work for Bethesda? Nope, because I don't believe in releasing shit products that require the community to fix, then keep the pricing the same for years to come because it's ""supported"" by random patches for a dumbass community market hellhole that fucks other community work over. Anyway, I digress...

Good job Bethesda, you continue to release shit, but I'll never pay for your shit, so shit on that shit, shitbirds."
10345,
10346,"A good time killer when you want to play a solo game or need to update games in the background, being that Fallout Shelter doesn't require a good connection to play online or anything. Not P2W either so you're not risking bankruptcy if you're an impulse buyer. There are some queue skippers with in-game currency, but the currency can easily be earned through quests and exploration. The gameplay is pretty fun overall as well. Good times."
10347,good time waster lol
10348,Great little game for time poor people
10349,kinda good i guersss

10353,Cool
10354,fun when you have to burn time
10355,Good game.  The type of game where you can play for 5 minutes a day or 5 hours a day.  Highly Recommend.
10356,Always love the manage sim type games and EXPECIALLY Post-Apocolyptic games. this is a no brainer but fun and great for when you are tired but still wanna play something.  it also dont take long periods to play. short play times then come back later or stay and collect necceities PLUS its Fallout love that game too
10357,"awseome game better than mobile too.

its all about chance though so good luck"
10358,better now than when it first came out and i played it on my phone back then...
10359,"Yeah, it's Bethesda, a company with a good reputation for quality work.
Yeah, I had a bunch of fun playing this.

My fun was diminished last week when (as I figured out later) I accidentally sold some special items that I wanted to keep, when returning from a quest. At that point, I figured out that Bethesda has zero avenues for solving player problems within the game. They'll help you solve your money problems, and they'll let you submit bug reports they'll never answer directly, but there's no way to say, ""Hey, the game glitched. Will you help me fix it?"" They're simply not interested, apparently.

My fun evaporated today. There was an objective to kill feral ghouls without weapons. Some feral ghouls invaded the vault, so I unarmed my defenders. In the first room, I had only two defenders. Both died. Okay, fine, they died. I revived them. Repeat, I REVIVED THEM. I gave them RadAway and Stimpaks. I made sure both were in perfect health. Then I moved on to something else. When I went back to that room, rats were there. Zero Dwellers. I looked everywhere within the vault, but they were nowhere to be found.

After spending a fair amount of money on this game, I am EXTREMELY disappointed that: (a) the company has no system to help players when the game glitches, and (b) the game can glitch pretty fucking hard. I will never play it again."

10369,its fun
10370,Pretty fun time waster.
10371,.
10372,great game.
10373,thee only thing i did not like bout this game is the fact that the whole time management thing could have been better. waiting 24 hours or more for a avatar to finish training or questing is a bit long.
10374,good game
10375,For me far so cool...  I think its a pretty cool game wish I could send some of my dwellers to raid other caves that'll be so awesome...
10376,good little time waister
10377,I don't even know how do I have so many hours on this game. It's not that interesting or engaging. There is no clear objective but to collect everything. This was just another scheme from Bethesda to cash in on Fallout fans. I would just suggest you spend your time somewhere else.
10378,"Fallout Shelter is a fairly simple building management game. Gameplay revolves around earning caps to buy facilities to provide life-sustenance (food, water, energy), crafting stations (for better weapons and gear), and training rooms (to improve your dwellers' stats). Caps are earned by leveling up your dwellers, scavenging, and completing missions and milestones. Dwellers level up by simple being assigned to work stations or defeating bad guys (which are found on missions and occasionally in your vault, should there be an attack or infestation). There are rare lootables to be found in the game, as well as crafted. These can be in the form of gear or weapons, but can also be characters which are more powerful than your average slob that shows up on your doorstep. In addition, you can find pets that accentuate abilities on the characters you assign them to. You can also breed within your vault, which always gets an Overseer's thumbs up!

Fallout Shelter is essentially Fallout Extreme Light. It's a mobile style game that does have some real time elements, meaning that traveling to locations can take real time. This time can be sped up by using Nuka Cola (which can be found in the game or purchased with real dollars in the store). Outside of that, the game is completely playable without having to Pay2Win. If you run out of Nuka Colas, you just need to come back to the game later after the travel timer has expired.

Exploring Overseer missions are pretty fun. You get to actually explore the building from a side perspective. Hidden rooms are covered in a fog of war and are randomly generated. So is the loot. This makes the game replayable and always offer some satisfaction for the curious. Ultimately, you want to continue upgrading rooms for the increased vault size and equipping characters with better and better gear.

It's a fun time-killer that I keep coming back to in short visits."
10379,terrific little game.
10380,"still better than fallout 76 and Very addictive, requires strategy and feels rewarding"
10381,I love the game but I don't care enough to write a review.
10382,Really fun game
10383,"For a free to play game, it offers hours of entertainment and customization, but can get repetitive, overall I would recommend this game if you are a Fallout fan, and it is better than 76."
10384,"It's a good game if you're a fan of Fallout, and it's not that bad if you're just a fan of casual games like this. Can be a bit ridiculous but it will give you a few hours of entertainment."
10385,"Fun Casual Survival Base Building game. Don't know that it would appeal much to those that have not played the Fallout series, but it is a fun addition to the universe. Completely different gameplay than the other Fallout embodiments. Early game can be a little slow, but once your vault and population grow there is plenty to do, if you want to speed the beginning a bit do the Bottle and Cappy quests quick and make the most of their vault visits.
There are some major flaws in the rules of this game wrt other fallout rules, but as it's own game I have found it a delightful distraction to play for 10 minutes to a half hour at a time."
10386,"Meh, didnt like the grind of it.

10397,"I first got this game because i wanted to find out what it was about. When i saw the trailer i already knew it wasnt going to be fun to play, well at least to me, because it had no story at all and it didnt have many gameplay options.
After playing for a couple hours it was indeed really boring because its always the exact same thing over and over again.
So basiclly its just a 2D game with nothing to do.
I personaly wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless your into 2D games like ""Oxygen Not Included"" since its the same type of game."

10421,"I had this game on my phone when it came out, I honestly don't know how many hours I poured into this game on my phone, but my shelter got so big my phone couldn't handle it. Now the PC port for this game should in theory mean that your shelter can be as big as the game allows. I'm starting this up again in the hopes that the above issue isn't a thing anymore.

Pros:
simple easy game play that is made for using up awkward amounts of time
the mtx's in the game can be p2w but they aren't thrown in your face none-stop

Cons:
the mtx's in the game can be p2w

10429,"GREAT 'EMPIRE BASED' BUILD THAT I LIKE, A BONUS BEING FALLOUT SERIES OF COURSE... MUST BE MY 40TH VAULT.. MOBILE AND PC USER."
10430,"A cute little overseer game.
The first 30 hours of game time are spent building a vault in a post-apocalyptic time, and the experience is awesome. The game is very busy at first, has great little stories, and lots of humour.

After finishing the first phase of the game ,reaching 100 dwellers and having a balanced vault. The game slows down significantly, and you are practically only left with waiting out the long missions wait time, or throwing money at the game to speed them up. Unfortunately the missions themselves aren‚Äôt very exciting. The fighting mechanic is semi-automatic, and isn‚Äôt very comfortable, completing the missions has little to no challenge. And the only thing good about them is the amount of resources they generate, and the funny stories.
The best part of the game is the initial build of the vault. It has meaning full choices, and you can build a perfect vault. 
The worst part is that the game doesn‚Äôt scale well, and when your vault gets too big, the game doesn‚Äôt offer many tools to help make the management of so many dwellers simpler. One example is the battle management, there is no simple way to heal an entire room, or move a big group of dwellers all at once from one room to another.

All in all, the game is defiantly worth playing, if only for the achievement of reaching 100 dwellers, which is probably the most fun I have had in any game I played.

"
10431,This game is simple but addicted. It makes me want to play fallout series ...
10432,"What a Fantastic Game to have on Steam and Mobile.

This game is a great time killer, if you are a fan of Fallout of Bethesda Studios games then this game is for you! You can bring your save to mobile and play where ever you are, whenever you want. The wide array of quests/missions keep you entertained for endless hours and the push to max out your vault is ever so important. 10/10"
10433,"I have played the game for four hours. It is a bit more difficult than I imagined it would be but enjoyable all the same. A bit more of an explanation to some aspects of the game would be useful. I've had to Google a few things that were not explained well (or at all) but overall, it is a good game and I like it thus far."

10443,"Can be fun even without money but only for so long, then you accomplished everything (this is my second playthrou and game account so the 3 hours here don't say anything by the time I played on the Bethesda Launcher)"
10444,"Hmmmm not the sort of game you wanna spend a lot of money on like I did
"
10445,"its a really fun game , you can spend hours of your time playing .
I love the graphics , i think its his best element !"
10446,"It is a funny little game with good entertainment value. It's very relaxing and doesn't take much brain power, kind of like a digital form of meditation. It becomes repetitive quickly, though, and almost overwhelming in size and scope after a while."
10447,Good times
10448,This game has a couple downsides but really it can be quite fun with being able to make your very own vault! And also exploring the wastelands. Plus you can complete missions that give you cool gear for your dwellers so you can lower your chance of losing dwellers via being killed or because of sickness. To conclude I strongly recommend this game.
10449,This game can get very addicting very fast!
10450,n
10451,"If you play the fallout series, this game definitely suits for you. The only difference is that this game is more relaxing compare to other fallout. Recommended for just for fun playing. Cheers.."
10452,"For a free to play game its very good with all you can do, base building and a little bit of combat mixed together made for an enjoyable time while playing. Overall would recommend."
10453,good game
10454,"Fallout Shelter is a totally awesome game! Super relaxed and easy to use, heaps of fun, especially if you're a Fallout fan. Ever wanted to be an Overseer? Now's your chance ;)

Do yourself a favour, and play Fallout Shelter!

10455,its amazing
10456,If you've ever played Fallout you've likely always wanted to be an overseer. Who wouldn't? This game allows you to do just that. Keep them alive? Send them out into the wastes? It's your choice. If you want a real challenge play on survival mode.

Good game to have in the background and pop in and play for a bit at a time. Game is buggy as hell!!! Will close out for literally no reason.... that's just one of the annoying issues. To get all the achievements it is a grind.... Use a game editor DO NOT spend money on this game. Have fun survivors and stay out of the radiation.

10467,"Honesty amazing, There is some need for patience, But other then that it is really good. It gets your brain working at times and can be scary when the raiders come in and attack you, but if you have the weapons for it, You should be purrfectly fine.

10475,"seeking for fallout shelter 2 , its great game indeed :)"
10476,"I actually never thought that if there is going to be a fallout game  would come up to base building ... In my opinion , this is actually a fun game ,  I  usually spend and fill my spare time  playing it on mobile  , i'll give it a thumb as the same they did it in game logo ."
10477,it is a gud gume
10478,"A very well designed, simple resource management game that will steal countless hours of your life."
10479,"A fun little game to put on the background as you work or multi-task.

8/10 would prefer less PTW mechanics but what can you do? It is bethesda/zenimax after all."
10480,Kill your time! :)
10481,Fun Game Just feel like ill get bored once i get my vault to the max
10482,"yes

10484,"The biggest problems with this game are the controls. It's cute, and has fun moments, but they are surrounded by bad design.  It is extremely frustrating you cannot pause, and clicking on people often misses.  Being invested in your vault means you will be disappointed.  My time is best spent on other games."
10485,I love it because it helps me pass time
10486,This is a fun and addicting game. You might just end up maxing your shelter or maybe you like building them up and watching them fall.
10487,"Love it!... nice and simple, yet fun... and hours of it ;-)"

10493,"Simple yet challenging, good old fashioned fun."
10494,fun and time comsouming
10495,It is very fun
10496,"This game unfortunately suffers from some mobile platform game design elements that don't really make sense on PC, like spending most of your time just waiting on things to count down. It is good though, and abbreviates the XCOM base management structure in an addicting way."
10497,"I like this game because its simple and doesn't need much brain power to play, something I don't like about it is that once you get most of the rooms you will start to get bored and only play for 20 minutes each day."
10498,"I was playing it like for an year and got much stuff but...
everything just got deleted, in the vault list it shows me 0 dwellers even if i had like 120
it's a stupid bug and i don't know how to fix it so fvck this game cause i lost everything i had in it."
10499,v great
10500,"I really don't feel like writing a review but trust me, this game is fun"
10501,Yes I know it is a mobile game but it is pretty fun. A little challenging in the beginning but the most important thing is to keep all your rooms working. Train your workers properly to achieve the most efficiency.
10502,"its a good idle game
"
10503,"This game is free and you can, with patience, earn all the achievements without spending anything. The quests are funny and contain many references to the other Fallout games. This game requires you to plan things out (keeping money aside to build new rooms, sending teams out at night so they'll arrive at their destination in the morning, etc.). At times the game requires your whole attention, but I mostly let it run while doing other stuff on my computer, switching back when I heard the sirens or the radio calls.
After a month of playing, I have all the achievements except one (Collect 20 legendary dwellers), and I might not keep playing to get that last one, as I expect it will take [b]months[/b], since you can only get those dwellers in lunch boxes and I don't want to buy any. I would have preferred to find them in quests instead. I also managed to get the same legendary dweller (Preston Garvey) twice, which does not makes sense to me."
10504,"Could use a couple of minor updates, but still very fun."
10505,"Its fallout and I love it dearly! I'll keep playing as long as I can!
"
10506,for time pass only
10507,its a great fun time waster... Fans of Sims and life/farm simulators enjoy
10508,relaxing game just to take your mind off things no exprience needed in any sence just run the game and enjoy ...it may become dull at some stages but it wont if you play it in conjunction with other games
10509,Everything in my vault is on fire help
10510,Very fun game quite time consuming but for me personally i enjoy a game that takes time to progress in. Lots of content great overall gameplay
10511,Its a pretty good game. Fun.

10520,It's fun!
10521,Good time waster when you literally have nothing else to do.
10522,Very fun game.
10523,"good game, same father to all my humans"
10524,"Despite of the lack of not being able to share natively between smart devices and Steam account to play and share the progress, the games has a small graphical improvement in this version rather than mobile app. It's an interesting game but it can sin of boring and not having variety of missions and events. In addition, there are a huge amount of micro payments which doesn't add something extra valuable.

On the other hand, if you are a fan of Fallout saga you should play this casual game and let the environment catpure you."
10525,Maybe put in an update that lets you keep building living quarters? That way you can move them by building new ones and destroying old. Had to evict like 20 dwellers to move one room
10526,worst waste of time EVER EFFING EVER.  As you gain levels it sends impossible to win attacks/emergencies and everything freezes while the rad roaches kill YOUR BEST citizens.  I was about to pay money to upgrade... GLAD I DIDNT.... THIS GAME IS TRASH!!!!
10527,"A good little time killer with some addictive game play. If things are too easy on the standard game mode, it has a survival mode that can be brutal, especially if you've planned poorly. 
I originally played it on my phone, but I prefer playing it on my PC, as I feel it's easier to manage a large vault with mouse and keyboard on the PC, rather than trying to do so on my phone."
10528,":)
"
10529,"Great game, lots of fun for real. Make sure you plan ur base out early and train ur dwellers well.. Sometimes trash loot from lunchboxes makes me rage but def would reccomend"
10530,"What can I say, its fun, like a fallout sims with jokes about the overseer, that overseer being you. If you enjoy the fallout series this is a cute nostalgic game."
10531,Pretty good for free. The one big drawback is how all the missions require long travel times. It's good for spending 15 or 30 minutes playing once or twice a day.  As far as casual games go it's worth playing.
10532,its stinky
10533,"It's addictive, but it's much easier to play here than on your phone. It's also less of a risk here because on my phone I have lost all my saves. If you're going to spend money and time on this game, do it on steam.

Gameplay focuses on building and maintaining your vault as the overseer. You can send dwellers out into the wasteland to find and collect gear, caps, weapons, and trash to be made into new things. Later on you can build rooms to increase dweller traits, and an overseer's office to do quests."
10534,iz nice
10535,"Good game when you have nothing to do.

10542,"its a nice simple game that lets you play, leave it for a bit, and come back to it"
10543,Yes it might take a long time and yes at times it might make you think you need to buy to win or something but- Honestly no. You can make it my just playing the game. This game is full of strategy and dedication. You can't expect to get the results you want under a short time. Be careful what you place and where! That can greatly change your future.
10544,"very good  
needs 32 bit"
10545,
10546,Just a good Colony Builder not much of a survival game but is quite fun.
10547,Good Game

But just so that you know, this is basically a mobile game, with the things go on while you're offline and you have to wait for hours on stuff.
It's a fun game, it's just that it's kinda slow."

10566,A great time waster while listening to music or some other non visual entertainment.
10567,"I've been playing this game across several platforms, so I have much, much more than four measly hours. This is a fun and addictive game! If you get lucky with your Vault, you won't be tempted to buy into any of the micro-transactions. Even so, temptation is low in any case. This game gives you what you need without you needing to pay. I love Fallout Shelter!"
10568,"The amazing free fallout game you can play anywhere on your phone, computer and its also now on the nintendo switch. a must for any fallout fan. its fun and user friendly."
10569,Fun to play in the background while doing other things
10570,It's good to pass the time.
10571,"interesting at all, but its just so slow, and its boring, its fun but if somehow game goes faster, that would be nice ; )"
10572,"Fun daily kind of time waster game. Nothing spectacular really, just fun. Don't waste money on it though. Just have patience!"
10573,absolute trash i keep losing

10575,"Very boring game, you have done everything in a few hours.

It is an ok telephone game, but that is all."
10576,yes.
10577,Good time waster
10578,Great game!
10579,"easy to understand, specially middle of the night when i'm tired and can't sleep."
10580,"Not worth your time if you want to get all achievements. You have to pay for hundreds of lunchboxes for the very rare chance for a legendary vault dweller or get a game editor to add more without paying... Otherwise it's a fine time wasting game. I only played this because it is a fallout game, and its just a fallout themed time waster sadly. Not sure what I was expecting.."
10581,"Good
"
10582,its ok for a free game. but i have played many other free games that are much better. moving characters is super clunky especially when it matters most. you cant pause and go afk. there is no multiplayer. many other things wrong.
10583,Great game for all ages
10584,This game is great I love fallout games so much
10585,yes
10586,"Solid gameplay for 1 hour, that's about it... Just don't give Bethesda your money..."
10587,E
10588,Very fun but has a lot of pay to win stuff
10589,"Of the games that I have played this is one of these that has daily/seasonal quests and tracks your progress, where some games ask you to build up a base in each mission this game has one base, you can build and advance and customize it to a point and send vault dwellers out on quests/missions.

Pros: Playing Fallout Shelter on Steam and syncs with the Steam Cloud; I've played it on multiple devices connected to the Steam Cloud.

Cons: Every other platform that this game is available on that isn't on Steam Cloud won't sync with any cloud :( I spent $$$ money on an app on my mobile device and I had to start all over on a different mobile device."
10590,I haven't played since 2015 but since the mission update I've actually had the desire to come and play this much more than before
10591,Good Game!
10592,Chill
10593,"I'm going to present this in as balanced a way as possible.

The game is good fun and it's extremely enjoyable if played in a limited way. After your initial build up do not sit there waiting for stuff to happen, log out and come back later. My current playtime is from short bursts of 5-15min 1-2 times a day which is the best way to enjoy it.

Don't rush thing, don't use cola to speed stuff up and save it for events worth it. Enjoy the experience in short bursts slowly building up. This is not a suitable game for playing for 30+ minutes, everything is just waiting after about 15min. Don't try and play it like that or you're gonna have a bad time and/or waste real money.

It is pay to win, but this is only an issue if you intend to rush the game which ruins the experience in most regards. If you insist on buying stuff wait for sales, you also likely lack inventory space for loot you bought so keep that in mind.

Backup saves, I hear people complaining about losing saves. It hasn't happened to me but that doesn't mean it won't happen to you. There are also Save game cheats, I've heard these can corrupt saves. Just be aware."
10594,"I think I like this game because I have been immersed in a MMORPG (Massively Multi-player Online Role Playing Game), and the game ""Fallout Shelter"" does not, nor would I think could it, translate to an internet-based game.  I also like the apparent immediacy of certain actions that need to be taken in order to progress forward in the game.  Naturally, the character development while leveling up is always a plus.  I would recommend this game to other players."
10595,"Interesting, but largely pointless... it's free though, so..."
10596,"I been playing for 121 hours, never really thought I would put so much time into a free game so quickly. It's free! Kinda amazing... and there are things you can buy but don't need them at all to play the game and have fun. Fun is the main word, this game is fun, check it out."
10597,Highly recommended for all ages. Just a relaxing game to play and keeps you busy while killing time. You won't be disappointed!
10598,"""One of the few mobile games I'll actually play within an amazing universe."""
10599,its free and its better than fallout 76.
10600,"Oooh Black Betty, dam ba nam, oooh black betty, dam ba nam"
10601,I like playing this game while eating bacon
10602,Addictive and free :)
10603, It is awesome you should play it to.
10604,Nice game
10605,Its very slow but entertaining enough.
10606,y
10607,its fun
10608,it good
10609,Fun casual game with enough content to keep you busy for hours.
10610,"It could have been a good game. Quests are pretty nice. It's obviously one of those games where paying helps a lot, but that's just the state of gaming nowadays.
It's just a shame that the game sometimes delete your savefile and there's no way to recover it. They recommend doing manual backups.... 
I don't recommend playing it, it'S free but don't spend money for goodies inside, I just lost a 21h savefile, I did have a manual backup but not very recent, this game is not worth the headaches it will cause."
10611,ITS IGHT
10612,It is a fun way to spend the time. It also doesn't need a lot of that (time) since your little people do the work for you
10613,If you like resource management games this if for you

10628,its good (:
10629,"Neat. Aesthetically pleasing. Fun. 
Got bankrupted REALLY quickly by cockroaches though, which made me feel amazingly silly.
Doesn't really require you to pay. No p2w feel. Not buying microstransactions just means you'll progress slower, that's all."
10630,this game is so awsome and fun and its addictvly good love thise game recomed gatting it
10631,"Its cool
"
10632,SO. ADDICTIV... (couldn't finish the word because I had to rush back into my vaults)
10633,"It's fun, but I don't like the time elements so prevalent in most mobile games nowadays. Especially if you are going to put the game on PC. The graphics are cute, the concept was refreshing with the Fallout paint slapped on and the little quests were funny and quirky and I can appreciate that. All in all, yes I recommend but I did get frustrated a little too."
10634,Nice ftp game
10635,Fun game to play in class
10636,Resource manager
10637,A fun little game you can play while doing something else (like draw) and still be able to enjoy it by itself too.
10638,"A VERY FUN filled game. Just who the ***K is that mysterious stranger giving us money/bottle caps when we find him? Its like this game encourages us to find random strangers so he can give us stuff! If only that works in real life!
Either or, REALLY fun game, highly recommend it to anyone since its ""technically"" FREE!!!!!"
10639,"No, I didn't use any cheats."
10640,i like getting invaded by raiders as soon as I am about to close the game.
10641,"Good game but the downside is that the game goes on when your offline so the happiness and food goes down and its annoying other than that, totally recommend!"
10642,",cgh"
10643,good
10644,fun game
10645,"ive had this game since day one, i dont play it 24/7 cause it would kill the gameplay of the game for me.. i played fallout 4 more then this cause it has more content..  great game for being free thou"
10646,.
10647,efficiency is key to this game
10648,It's the Fallout 4 settlement building if the Fallout 4 settlement building mechanic was fun. ;D
10649,this game will do everything possible to suvk any ounce of lifeenjoyment ouit of you. ESPECIALLY when your about to believe it's going well.
10650,"Really cool strategy game
"
10651,"If you like games where you manage an empire, this is great for you. Only if your good at it, however, which I am not. Anywho, still a great game."
10652,"Until recently I had unreserved praise for this game. It was an excellent game, well polished with huge potential for long time gameplay, all without cramming the need for premium currency down your throat. However, my vault of 143 hours recently vanished. There was so much work, so many missions, so many unique stories behind each character that were suddenly lost. I can't recommend this game to people if all the fun you have with it is for nothing."
10653,"fun game to pass time bye, it takes a bit to get used to the point where you are making all the power,food and others to keep the numbers out of the red. I would recommend to others."
10654,Simple and easy afk like game with events when you are active
10655,I like it.
10656,It's awesome
10657,
10658,I loved this game!
10659,idk what to say beside it's just hella fun
10660,good casual
10661,Its a fun fallout themed tycoon. Its easy to understand and play. The time waits aren't too nuts. The combat is a bit weak and boring so the missions aren't too fun but are worth the loot. It can be pay to win to some bit but you would need to pay lots for it to be ptw. Overall a good game and worth a pickup if you're looking for a chill game.
10662,excellent game the mobil version needs work but the computer version is amazing.
10663,.
10664,It is good
10665,Great for casual fun. Although the devs must add more elements to the game as it feels repetitive as your vault grows in size.
10666,"i liked the ability to find glitches and use them to my own ability
"
10667,"Yo mama so fat whenever she play fallout shelter she play fallout shelter, best fallout game in the series, nasally beat ouf allout 68"
10668,XD
10669,great game :3
10670,200/200
10671,"Pros: The game is fun, family friendly, and free. Micro-transactions are not spammed towards you. This game has a more lighter feel to it. More comedy and no gory stuff. Though I do prefer my gritty fallout series this game allows for a break from that stuff.

Cons: Unfortunatly this has microtransactions. This game revolves around waiting. Waiting to train. Waiting to go to quests. Waiting to come back from quests. Microtransactions allow you to purchase stuff to help progress or pass the waiting times. Don't give into that crap. Bethesda is a money hungry coporation that doesn't give a crap about its player base.....just so long as your giving them money. This game does crash alot or it did for my first 20 hours. Sometimes randomly crashes on start-up. Sometimes randomly crashes mid-game which really shouldn't be happening to a small game like this. But that is likely because Bethesda wants to put little money into this cash cow. For those reasons alone Im giving this a negative review but by all means give this game a try."
10672,fun game
10673,"Decent Game, Good Pass Time could add more Rooms though."
10674,Q
10675,second game to now have been erased out of no where. Not worth the micro transactions if it is just going to erase my game. had alot of fun but i wont be playing this any more now that i have wasted 18 hours to have my saved game randomly deleted.
10676,great game recomend slow at first but then lots to do
10677,I love the Fallout series. This is a tower building game.
10678,"Fallout Shelter has been one of the games I have played for years. Simple to play for a while then come back to it a day or a year later. Once your shelter is established, doing the quests are fun."
10679,"it was good cuz it's cool
"
10680,"Good fun for in-between games. Not such a tough grind, especially if your dwellers know what they're doing!"
10681,"i have had a lot of items ranging from commen to legendary in weapons, outfits, junk and pets  just disapear from my storage and dwellers returning from the wastelands and it has happened multiple times. its making items and upgrading my vault very difficult and it hurts the playing experience for me a lot"
10682,"This game is amazingly time consuming ,in a good way! There are so many things for you to do while progressing in the game and yet it is so easy to understand the mechanics that it makes it a very relaxing and fun game to play! I love this game so much ,that i have it installed on my phone as well ha ha , so yes i would recommend giving this game a try!"
10683,"I dislike one thing in this game : it is not comfortable to play this game without cheats!
but the rest is very good and i realy like this game as the big fan of fallout!"
10684,fun for a while
10685,Very bad..cannot recomend due to wait timers on this game..should be a mobile game and not PC
10686,–¥–∞. –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—ë–Ω–Ω–æ.
10687,its pretty good
10688,So with this game I do recommend playing it. BUT BEWARE THAT THE GAME MAY AT SOME POINT CRASH AND THEN DELETE IT SELF. I have no idea why it does this and it doesn't seem to happen to everyone. I would also recommended that you DO NOT spend money on this game in the event that the game craps out and deletes it self like it did with me. In my in ignorance I spent probably about 30$ on the game with the micro transactions in the game. (yes they have micro transactions)
10689,I like to spend most of the time on this game you should play if like fallout but building a GUN its most going to take like 12 Days or less if you add people with the right ability or Example S.P.E.C.I.A.L THEN YOU SHOULD BE GOOD
10690,Its a fun game to just play for hours or just to waste time :)
10691,"i like the progression, it never bored me."
10692,I starved my people and the power went out.
10693,i like it
10694,"Its a good time waster but you should play the mobile version , its more covienient"
10695,Kool
10696,It's a simple builder with some amusing dialogue sprinkled throughout in the Fallout universe. What isnt to like?
10697,"Fun way to pass the time, I normally hop on once a day to complete quests and level up dwellers. Pretty simple style of game and fairly easy yet enjoyable! Its free why not give it a go"
10698,It is a simple game and it is very fun.
10699,very falloutly
10700,not launching on my Linux Endless OS
10701,It's fun to play in your free time.
10702,Nice simple game with a decent challenge. Game runs a variation of real time so you can set it running can come back and check on it later.
10703,"I began listing all the reasons why you should not play this game, but then realised I was just wasting more time on a game that I had already wasted far too much time on.  Just don't, is all I will say to anyone wanting to play this game.  Save yourself the grief and just don't."
10704,it good
10705,"If you ever wonder how well you would do controlling a Vault then this game it perfect for you, build, survive and keep your Vault in a tiptop condition, follow your Dwellers out on adventures on the Wasteland and see your Vault expand. And who does not like pets, seriously pets, they look even better in the art style that Fallout Shelter has, Cats, Dogs and even Parrots. So come down and test your ability to controll your own Vault, beacause the game is Free!"
10706,It's Free.
10707,More of a mobile game but fun none the less
10708,It's a good game to past the time
10709,too gud
10710,Death claws and Radscorpions are gey
10711,Do survival mode if you absolutely hate your life
10712,"It is a very chill game which does not need much attention. You can play it for free, and only pay to progress faster"

10715,There are some games out there that have addicting quality. This is definitely one of them. The building and questing are balanced and the humor is unique.
10716,its fun
10717,At least it's not Fallout 76
10718,Nice
10719,My game is crashing or something please don't wast you time here
10720,"Well.. this game i have already played in mobile, was much better on PC"
10721,my radio is active
10722,love this game
10723,Its a nice low brain-power game without being too monotonous.
10724,"Fun if you are looking for  a quick and easy way to entertain your self. Being a PC port it is very easy to find a save editor and sandbox your way to a very nice vault without having to spend any real world money.

The game its self if you haven't seen it or played it yet is a side scroller vault building game with an exploration aspect built into it. Compared to the original launch its gotten allot more fun with different ways to explore the waste and find unique and fun equipment, guns, pets and characters. DO NOT SPEND any real world money on this. Mr Handy's are expensive in Real life and can be aquired again using the save editor. 

Over all id give it a 3/5 G's"
10725,Idk what to really say but fallout 76 is trash but this is not like fallout but its like fallout + sims but 2d so yeah and i even got attached to my characters before to so very fun and highly recommend if you like fallout at all.
10726,Good time killer and amazing quest story lines but my favorite part is the smart ass lines from your people.
10727,Don't waste your time with this game like I do. Progressing takes forever. Buy this. Buy that. Bad combat system. You don't earn enough caps to keep up with building your Vault.
10728,"Its a lay back game that does not require much attention. You can watch a movie and play this game, (can't explain why I do that) but it is some how satisfying. Its like a cat that can use some attention but it doesn't need it."
10729,Very nice

10761,Fun and simple game to pass the time.
10762,"cool game, but I don't like how I cannot delete a room without meeting certain requirements or that i cannot simply drag and drop a room to rearrange. 
Would be great to be able to see how many are assigned to a room without clicking on each one individually too. 
Over all it is not a bad game."
10763,"can stuck for hours in this game, great!"

10767,"The Good:
Good if your bored
Takes very little space
It's free
Easy to run (60fps at 768p on an Intel HD 4000 laptop, will run at 4k on anything better than a GTX 1050)

The Bad:
Gets boring after a little while

Info:
Singleplayer only, it isn't multiplayer


Do I recommend it? Depends greatly. Your just not going to touch it after hour 3 of playing.."
10768,I'd much rather play this than 76.
10769,"One of the better idle games I've played. If you're looking for something to waste half an hour on, it's worth the download."
10770,thinking about scavenging the wasteland
10771,"While it has some micro-transactions, I believe they don't get in the way of the game."
10772,I like the fallout frandchise
10773,good
10774,"PATIENCE. IS. KEY.
If you are a F2P person, like most are, you are going to start off VERY rough. It is very grindy in the beginning. You have to hold out until you unlock the Overseer's Office.
Then the game opens up!
You will unlock missions, which are so much better than Wasteland exploration. Seriously. Tough it out through the beginning, you will not regret it."
10775,"Nice game, gets boring after a while"
10776,it just works
10777,They should do FALLOUT 5 in this style!! quite fun!
10778,"Rng nonsense & ""just wait""_mechanics | into Overpriced ingame purchases | into Boredom."
10779,Its a game of building up your vault and dwellers.  Its a nice way to occupy time and offers enough stress to make it challenging.  Don't try it on survival unless you pay to advance.    The game is free to check out for yourself.  Go for it.
10780,it is very yeet
10781,e
10782,Good waste of time.
10783,dont buy anything if you play this teach bethesda to treat its fanbase with respect

10785,This game is good but frustrating when you loose your vault
10786,good
10787,Good game and very addictive. You care for your dwellers and strive to make them increase their skills.
10788,It's really fun!
10789,free and fun
10790,yes
10791,"Its pretty good. Hard, but I like a challange. 
6/10, Tom did not dissapoint."
10792,Good
10793,Probably more enjoyable on your phone sice you can play it literally anywhere ( what you guys don't have phones?! ) but still enjoyable at its maximum performance and a clearer resolution.
10794,"[i]War‚Ä¶ war never changes. Unless it‚Äôs Fallout Shelter.[/i]

So I‚Äôve been playing Fallout Shelter for quite a long time and I‚Äôm sure i got everything I could out of this game. 

It was fun. 101% fun playing. Every single quest, every event and the whole idea of it is pure fun. Even the grind I had to deal with makes the game more fascinating. The ‚Äúcartoonish‚Äù and ‚Äúcardboard‚Äù art-style makes it look cute and adorable. It is a humorous family-friendly game which anyone is suitable to play. 

The idea of Fallout Shelter is simple: You start with several dwellers and a Vault to populate. You build new rooms, increase population with newcomers or ‚Äúrelations‚Äù, get resources, make and find some equipment, well‚Ä¶ you expand and progress. [b]NB:[/b] There is no ‚Äúaging‚Äù in FS.

Now, there are two ways you can play Fallout Shelter: On Normal Mode, or when you check the box of ‚ÄúSurvival Mode‚Äù. First one is smoother in a way your dwellers can be revived after they die. The Survival mode is when they cannot be revived plus several other difficulties. The most important thing to know is that there‚Äôs a game mechanic when you send your dwellers to a wasteland to get resources and etc. If you quit the game ‚Äì they are on their own. You can give them some amount of medicine supplies which will slowly go down the count. So you will HAVE to check on your Vault daily to avoid accidents.  And I assure you that it is a disaster if a Legendary Dweller dies. 

200% concentration required. 

VaultTek Recommends: Please avoid playing Survival mode if YOU ARE NOT PREPARED.

So, if you are into sandbox games like myself, then you will find Fallout Shelter a very enjoyable game. It‚Äôs a pity the game is not cross-platform and you can‚Äôt share your PC game progress onto your mobile device and back (Hope someday they will support this)."

10798,A good way to kill time and very enjoyable
10799,Great game!
10800,"Its a fun, simple, time killer type game....  I guess the classification would be a clock game, where you have to wait for certain things and check back in time to time. 
They left the game though so if you play you have to understand that it is what it is now."
10801,Still worth playing.
10802,Very naice

10809,"I like this game! I think I prefer to play it on mobile versus PC. It's the kind of game you check on every so often, and involves waiting between quests."

10817," Very casual to play, which I like. Only bad qualities in this game are the Micro-Transactions being pushed on you, and the classic Bethesda bugs you'd expect to see."
10818,"its more fun than i thought it would be, very addictive and cool for fallout fans"
10819,gud
10820,It if fun and addictive.
10821,"Still just as good, if not better than when it came out."
10822,good game
10823,"It has some of the Fallout ""charm"" and if you want an easy ""towerbuilder"" this one is pretty decent for that. In-game purchases are not needed for a pleasant experience."
10824,A fun way to spend time once in a while. Plenty of content to keep your attention for weeks.
10825,YES
10826,"Why i never started playing this game earlier, so much fun"
10827,Good
10828,"Fun to play but can get VERY tedious. When you start out initially, it's a lot of fun. I personally don't mind, ""the grind,"" but if you're looking for a game with lots of action etc., this ain't it.  You need to continually work at this to get your vault to function, which means a fair amount of time sitting around doing nothing. It's a great game to pick up and play for awhile and then put down and leave. Be warned though that there is no pause button, so if you need to go do something else and suddenly get attacked by Deathclaws...oh well! If you're into city builders, SIMS etc., this is the game for you."
10829,love the casual quick play
10830,Fun
10831,fun little time killer
10832,Honestly seems fun but is very repetitive and feels meaningless.
10833,noice games
10834,"Well it's free and I would say it's worth a try. I can see why people like this game, I liked some parts of it too. Thumbs up for being free to play :)"
10835,It's a fairly fun game- I play it just to pass the time during lunch breaks at work mostly.
10836,IS A GOODA GAMEA
10837,"I mean, it's a mobile game. But for a mobile game it's fun and the micro isn't completely cancer. The achievements seem pretty doable if that's your thing. Pretty AYAYA play for 20 minutes a day or so game.

edit: I had this marked as not recommended for awhile. I will recommend as long as you understand that the jump from 49 to 50 dwellers is actually ass. At 50 dwellers you get radscorpions that benny hill around the base and do radiation damage. High recommend sitting at 49 and massively buffing your dudes with stat updates, weapons, and levels.

Really needs to be a gigantic warning at that level."
10838,was fun playing in the library
10839,Disfrutando de mis horas libres mientras no hay internet :) xd
10840,If you want to pass some time and build a bunker community this is a go to.
10841,Super fun and SUPER addictive!!!
10842,"This is just another run of the mill mobile to PC port. Where you run a vault, where survivors slowly trickle in to run your vault and make it thrive‚Ä¶ the only big problem is that the gameplay keeps you just above the failure and disaster level of your vault going to pieces (i.e. water turning off or your power running out, or your survivors getting irradiated)... but of course you can buy all the micro transactions you could ever dream of from the lunchboxes... and bottle caps (Really again) to keep your vault running and to buy rooms and equipment/weapons. Though most likely you will just end up grinding your way through like most people without $60 to blow on a free to pay mobile game. It‚Äôs a good time waster at best so I would suggest getting it on a mobile device if you‚Äôre going to play this game at all so you can play once and a while, because it is not built for long playthroughs at a time."
10843,Just nice game ))
10844,Miss the good old 2D isometric Fallout action? This is the game for you.
10845,hi
10846,"Fun, kind of microtransaction-y but you really don't need them. Through the quests and objectives you get plenty of lunchboxes, pets, mr.handys, etc. Pretty good time waster."
10847,
10848,"I've been playing this for a while now... NOT THAT MUCH but... you know, at first, I thought it would be BORING (considering I do not have patience), however, I was surprised when I found many activities inside, as long as you continue growing your Voult. Its kinda good for being a free game... You won't regret ;)"
10849,Its super noice
10850,this game is a good time waster in class if you are bored
10851,"While it is easier to play this ""game"" on computer rather than handheld, I can't recommend this game.
It's not really pay to win, but the free loot boxes you DO get haven't really given much good loot. Maybe I just have bad luck?
sometimes it can be a bit clunky, and the gameplay is totally repetitive and feels more like a chore to play.
If you enjoyed the Sims then that would probably be a more elaborate game than this one. But if you really want a fallout style sims game, then this is probably the closest you'll ever get at the moment."
10852,"I have fun playing this game. Seemed my people were too crowded, LOL X'D"
10853,Quite addictive! Good for Fallout fans as for newcomers.
10854,So Sweet Games <33
10855,This game is super Good
10856,Nice casual game to play after Fallout 4.
10857,Better than fallout 76 cuz it's free
10858,Everyone who played this game changed the time on there devices just so they could get free lunchboxes.
10859,fun
10860,Like playing this game. Good idle thing that I can be on twenty minutes and then go to work.
10861,Want some love? Come to my vault.
10862,ggood
10863,"This game is, maybe whatever really not real."
10864,"Really liked the way that each character automatically returned to their job after ever every flight or fire.
Disliked the fact that since there is no room in the Vault you still get pregnant women stucked."
10865,It's a fun time killer or a gme to start and stop like I do.
10866,It's a good game if you can't play PUBG :)
10867,This is a fun little game you can play to pass the time and enjoy. I found it quite fun to play and just leave for a few days as a few vault citizens roam the wasteland for me.

Abit glitchy with mouse controls. You might swap ppl's workplaces while trying to scroll down or change view."
10877,good game
10878,good if ur bored
10879,"Fallout Shelter is a management simulation game where you're transported to a world destroyed by nuclear war, your job is to create a thriving population in a ever-growing vault. When I first downloaded this free-to-play game a few months ago I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it due to the fact the game is real-time so it can take awhile to do things BUT I found that I truly enjoy real-time games such as Fallout Shelter. It's so satisfying to watch your vault go from a tiny unhappy place to a underground paradise. If you enjoy these kind of games I suggest giving Fallout Shelter a try after all it's free so you have nothing to lose. I do have to say it's nothing like Fallout 3 or 4 since it is a spin-off game the only thing they really share is the devastated world they live in."

10914,"Love it. If you build your vault well you play longer, otherwise after 2 days and 10 vaults later . I'm getting more of a handle on my vault. But I go fast to where I have nothing left to do but wait. It's really cool to see the fallout franchise to carry strong into the future. Come on fallout New York or something crazy. Fallout universe. Infinite destruction cataclysmic whatever it is. I can't wait!"

10918,Just a really good game you can play in your own time.
10919,"It's a lot of fun. Every items or mechanic serves something in the game, no redundant stuff. Very minimum micro-transaction as you can achieve Caps, Nuka Cola, and even crates (?) by exploring and finishing tasks."

10937,"A mindless, thoughtless and utterly reprehensible waste of time that surreptitiously wants to bilk you out of your pocket change. A fun way to drag the name Fallout further through the mud."
10938,Good Game..
10939,"Very slow paced game. Actions take hours to perform while you're offline. It's a nice game to log into for a few minutes each day to check on your vault and assign new tasks to your dwellers.

You definitely don't need to purchase anything with real money to progress, and I'd actually advise against spending real money. I think the fun of the game is to slowly build up your vault with the limited resources you earn -- you won't feel that sense of accomplishment if you just buy your way past the early-game. You can still earn the real-money items by completing quests, so it's not a big deal.

I usually play stressful PvP games, so this is a good change of pace for me.

[b] Your game is saved locally in C:\Users\youraccount\AppData\Local\FalloutShelter. If for some reason your Local files are deleted, you will lose your save files and all your progress. [/b] It's a good idea to back your save files up by occasionally copying the FalloutShelter folder and pasting it onto your desktop, or onto a flash drive."

On top of that it's a pain in the ass telling the dwellers where to go, and often times, during raids WHEN I NEED TO THE MOST, I find they won't even go where I drag-and-drop them.

Seriously, don't even bother with this one. It's not even worth free."

10972,Fun and engaging game. The quests are intense.
10973,Good game
10974,"Great Game until the higher levels due to inherently bad game balance.  I quit the game after I had one room get infested with mole rats which I coulldn't wipe out fast enough, despite have fully armed dwellers in those rooms, so they multiplied.  At this point You burn thru stimpacks to keep them alive but the dps of these creatures is overwhelming when you have 80 dwellers and your characters they drop like flies.  You then have to revive them to save your vault, which costs caps and soon enough, i burned through 15,000 caps and still I hadn't wiped out the mole rats.

  Now, your vault is littered with level 20 toons, is still infested, your broke so you cant revive them, all your resources start to suffer because you have no one working, and soon the game is done because its a cascading effect.  At lower levels this isnt as much an issue as you can get gear easily enough thats high enough in level to take on challenges to the valut.  

The issue  at higher levels is that better gear is very hard to get, since it takes literally 4 to 5 times longer to craft and only marginally better (really an enhanced shot got does 1 more damage but takes 5 times as long to create? gimme a break).  You can essentially make one good piece of gear  at a time because you cant buy rare components, you have to forage them so to say with quests, which also is bottle necked since you can go on many quests at once, and takes hours of real time or the better part of a day to finish.  Pure frustration for a great game.  

In essence you become under powered"

10980,Play this instead of 76. Seriously.
10981,"That weird thing when a free2play game made to promote A-grade project is actualy 1000 times better than said project...

Anyway, the game is relaxing base-building routine, ocasionaly punctured by raiders, radroaches, molerats, lack of resourses... You know, your 1 to 1 resourse management made a lilbit cooler."
10982,very fun and its good but you need to be on this game for a long time and just be active in order for your vaults not to fail but overall its pretty fun
10983,Fun game! Great to kill time or just relax in bed and click! Highly recommend if u high all the time.
10984,"someone make a hentai version. do it. DOOOO IIIIIIT! 



10/10 btw"
10985,i like the way the people in the game have to find stuff to survive and yes i would recommend this game to all my friends
10986,"While the game is playable there are a few things wrong with it.
1. Dragging dwellers when you want to move the camera.
2. Dragging the camera when you want to move dwellers.
3. Roaches are harder to kill than a Feral Ghoul attack.
4. Dwellers running back and forth in vault not attacking?
5. Setting targets resets if any enemy moves.
6. Dwellers moving to different spots for no reason in combat delaying there attack.
7. Clipping issues when units occupy the same spot.
8. Quest with no enemies displaying a weapon attack requirement.
9. Can't collect from explorers if you have a few dwellers waiting in line that you want to add later.
10. Enemies attacking an open vault door if a dweller is exiting it.
11. No shots per turn on weapons. (Some shoot more than others, not sure if damage is per shot tho)
12. Can't set targets as battle is beginning wasting the 1st round of shots. (I always kill targets 1 by 1)
All this just makes things a little frustrating especially if you have a finite amount of meds on you."

(as your readying this it will probably be 300 hours or 400 or who the heck knows maybe even 1000"" hope this review helped... okay you can blink and breath now... Bye"
10988,"fun little game, much better to play on a touch screen and runs on anything. the quests do get repetitive, but it is a great way to fill boring wait times wherever you are"
10989,its a great game realy fun
10990,Meh
10991,+++
10992,This is a game to play when you are watching tv and do not need to pay  full attention to the game. When you just mindlessly want to play something to pass the time.
10993,its better on mobile but if for some reason you loose internet at home and your phone is dead then this is a great way to speed up time.
10994,fun as fuck

11005,IT IS SO FUN
11006,fun
11007,Interesting .. you have to manage your vault .. assign dwellers to rooms and send them out on missions.   Fairly low-key .. not a lot of stress but there's a LOT to it!
11008,I really LIKED this game but my vault won't load and I spend money on this. I went through the discussion pages and it seems like this is a common issue. Very disappointed and I'm hoping this gets fixed. Thumbs down for now...I really want my money back.
11009,Very good
11010,EVRYTHING
11011,not so good but addictive
11012,"Rather addictive, there is always something to do, but developing slowly and steadily means you can maximise your production with fewer people. Quite a few witty comments by the dwellers, so worth keeping a close eye on them."
11013,76 hours of misery
11014,I especially love doing the Quests.
11015,"good

11016,"havent played much so i might be wrong about ths game but, it's really boring and i dont really find it interesting or fun"
11017,its good
11018,mole rats
11019,fun
11020,Accomplishes what it sets out to do. Be a mobile game
11021,Fun time waster
11022,"Short game but follows faithfully the very basics...from a vault dweller view, not as any surface sort would enjoy. 

Been a faithful fan of Fallout since the beginning, when it was a post holocause D&D, and, of course, mutated from there and made a major splash as it's own game with particular brnd of humor. 

The humor is here, but very little actual plot, can build yer safe lil shelter, but that only gets you so far, and you can only explore so far/so much. 

Limited fer when sick in bed on tablet and cannot play Real Game.

But on those days the brain wants something mindless to fuss with, when sick and down, this is a great Fallout piece for hard core fans."
11023,"basic, yet fun! Awesome to play for any downtime and time passing!"
11024,Great fallout game!
11025,Other than saying I enjoy this game I can't really say that much about it despite the going on 500 hours i have spent playing it *shrugs* I don't play very often now except to check in on quests during the holidays honestly. For the type of game it is I believe it to be excellent even if I can't exactly tell you why.
11026,"I played this quite a bit on Android and now I've been playing it on Steam for a while. I can definitely suggest it. It's very interesting and fun, if not a little slow (i.e. training, quests, travelling in the wasteland, having babies, etc..), but I realize that's a major component in this sort of game. 

I don't know if I'm just a weirdo, but I just recently bought Fallout 4, Frostpunk, Surviving Mars, and This is the Police 2 and started playing No Mans Sky and Destiny 2 again after a sabbatical and honestly, I've been playing Fallout Shelter more than anything.

 Something about this kind of game appeals to me and it might for you too. I figure for most people this game would be on the lines of a simple time-killer, but either way, it's free and if you haven't played it, you should try it."
11027,"The game is okay because it is for free! 

However gets boring after like 20hrs, because rider attacks are too often, and all the other stuff is really slow unless you pay to win. But its ok if you don't need much from life and like to develop stuff. 

Really cheap strategy. Love it."
11028,fun game
11029,"nice
"
11030,Good game
11031,i spend some time here:P
11032,"I played this game on my PC and my iPhone with my kids and we loved it. It is not good clean family fun and that is part of what made it fun. Critical thinking, problem solving, and working as a team made the the game part of our family life. it taught some important lessons while being a game."
11033,very good
11034,Good game.
11035,Good
11036,"I liked the animations and how the game very stable. the only thing i can say  is that the power,food,and water sometimes get a little glitched. Overall, I think this is a very fun game!"
11037,"Not bad and in my opinion quite canonical game with a view from the second person, as for not quite good."
11038,i just like this game
11039,Its just a fun free game that will run on most computers

11043,Fun but simple to play. I would recommend this for casual players
11044,The PC version of this game is fantastic! It has everything I loved about playing it on my phone but i could see the game.
11045,"What better way to pass the time than this game?

Edit: It's still fun, but I really think they need to add a Family Tree to avoid any confusion when breeding Dwellers."

11048,A fun idle game.
11049,"its a  fun game

11050,Quite fun when you have short free time.
11051,Nice game
11052,it's fun
11053,"WARNING !!!   DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME !!! 
YOUR SAVE DATA WILL GET DELETED !! 

This has happened to multiple players who played long enough. After awhile regardless of what you do, your save data will be gone, and the developers do not give a damn. 
This is the only review I have ever written and most probably the only review that I will ever write, as I usually do not even bother. Only reason is because I do not wish for anyone else to experience that feeling of sheer frustration and despair as you see all the effort and cash invested into this game all wasted as you open it and see that your save files have mysteriously disappeared. It really sux BIG TIME !!
(See number of hours played)"
11054,"...
I hate this game.
might be intentionally addictive
DO NOT PLAY"
11055,For all fallout series fans its a must try at least.
11056,"Addictive and yet playable in small doses... I have put more time into this game than some larger titles given how immediately accessible it is. It takes time and patience - and a bit of tactical trial and error - to build a sustainable and defensible shelter, but it is easily achievable with a little regular input. 

An ideal game to complement your daily coffee-break :)"
11057,Better than Fallout 76
11058,"Fallout Shelter made me realize how much I actually wish for this world to go ablaze, and let humanity start anew."
11059,Good if you wanna casual fallout themed experience
11060,its fun I guess
11061,nice and relaxing to play
11062,"its pretty good 
"
11063,a great casual game that can be addictive at times. 10/10
11064,"quite addictive and needs thought, very enjoyable"
11065,It's a great game but deep down i feel guilt bu excessive incest possibility going on there
11066,pretty good
11067,Definately a good time killer.
11068,"its a very slow game (uses real life time). its hard to navigate and move people from room to room. i still haven't found an easy way to reject peopl from entering the vault. its annoying that handymen cant lvl up people. 

all and all.. not great"
11069,Good game THOUGH spoiler alert....no ending LOL.
11070,
11071,i feel like the 40 hours i spent in this game on steam is too much for the kind of game it is.
11072,"I give Bethesda props to this one.
It's like the hidden niche they finally squeezed out; a legitimately charming and well developed addition to the Fallout franchise."
11073,"its fun
"
11074,It has p2w elements but it isn't absolutely broken unlike some another game with the same engine
11075,good
11076,fun little game to kill time - max amount spent for me was 5 dollars ..I like it :)
11077,"Addictive, and much better than playing on a tablet or phone."
11078,it's fun and energetic and hope for the best that you get lucky
11079,many fun (:
11080,BOOM
11081,Why pollute the good Fallout name?
11082,very nice game
11083,Plenty of content to keep the game interesting but still simple enough to keep it relaxing and fun.
11084,"A bit bland, but enjoyable nonetheless."
11085,fun
11086,"One of the best games to kill a few minutes with, you will enjoy."
11087,"Great port with perfect controller support -- beats Fallout76 and that says a lot. If you want more fallout to enjoy and like casual time consumers, become an overseer."
11088,just here to experience the baby-making-factory way of life
11089,"This a time consuming game, you should try this game out."
11090,"I'll suggest you to play this game.
But don't buy any stuff like nuka-cola pack , pets pack or sth like bottle caps , that's doesn't worth at all."
11091,That's sucks...
11092,yes
11093,eew
11094,":D
"
11095,It's a time sink. Just don't pay for things in game and you'll get more then your monies worth.
11096,It's exactly the same what's it on mobile.
11097,I approve.
11098,Bored? Play this game!!!
11099,I like everything.
11100,this game is epic. very cool fallout
11101,"Nice game, enjoyable and leisure"
11102,i have like 60 hours or so and its sad imo
11103,"fun game that just dont know what it fun it just is
"
11104,good
11105,It's just a fun game and I enjoy it!
11106,Its better on PC than mobile
11107,"Very nice game.. Vault building and more more minigames :D
"
11108,gud
11109,Good game for killing time. And humans. And ghouls. And deathclaws.
11110,"Pretty fun game for rainy days or if you are bored, gets a little repetitive over time due to the fact you spend so long getting more dwellers and spend so long sending dwellers out on quests which leads to hours and hours of doing nothing.

You often end up looking online for ways to lower power consumption and how to increase dweller happiness
as you have no clue yourself, once you leave the game and come back your food water and power are ready to collect but the vault dosen't seem to have aged a single day.

Overall
Not bad 
6/10"
11111,yes
11112,Pretty great game
11113,Better than Fallout76
11114,"Fun Vault Sim Game game 

I can't fault this game i have never a problem with it 
it's not as fun as say fallout 3  upwards but defo a fun time passer
the microtrans are not needed to enjoy the game but the option is there if you need a helping hand 
"
11115,I like the ability to build and upgrade rooms.
11116,"The game is fun and pretty relaxed if you're looking for something to do in the meantime like wait for a long download
I would probably recommend this to my friends who are bored and want to play something relaxed.
9/10"
11117,Fun time/resource management click/tap game
11118,It's a great game for fans of the fallout series who lack a system that can operate the larger games that demand a powerful graphics card and processor.
11119,Great game to pass time with.
11120,yes
11121,"The game is addicting, well made, with tons of possibilities"
11122,best game :)
11123,"Great pass time for anyone who enjoys the Fallout series. A lot of References to the games and the gameplay is simple but fun and not as repetitive as I would have expected. It's free without being pay-to-win, so I'm happy!"
11124,"Played it as a mobile game. Finished my vault. So much time invested. Then, steam version came. Oh boy, really? must I restart this madness to unlock those achievements which I could have done? And there is so much microtransactions. Wont die if you don't have it but very annoying to deal with the pop-ups daily. Just as bad as the mobile version.

Play if you really love Fallout Shelter. Or else, overseers from many vault devices: no point restarting the same shit on steam."
11125,"Overall, its okay.  The game itself is good and if you've played Fallout 4 the cross-over references are fun.  But it is heavily designed to push you to want to make in-game purchases WHICH ARE EXPENSIVE and single use.  Plus once you play for awhile you'll figure out that you DID EVERYTHING WRONG because there are quirks you have to know about to build correctly.  So you'll really want to start over with a new vault but any previous purchases would be lost.  Not cool.  I'd rather have just paid to buy the game and there not been in-game purchases.  Or, at the very least, for the purchases to be more reasonable AND persistent (if you started a new game/vault all prior purchases would be available in that new game)."
11126,55882017
11127,"This brings a rather well known aspect of the Fallout Universe to the light of day. Usually where you come from is of vast importance to who you are and who you want to be. However within the common Fallout environment that is left behind so much that the ""Vault"" you came from, that your family survived because of, becomes legend. A thing of mythological value, relegated to the mysterious, the arcane, and the unknown. 

Here you get to see the troubles and difficulties such a mythological ""utopia"" can be. Demystifying vault life to a broad introspection. Not from the 1st person perspective consuming your focus but from the abstracted position where you monitor everything within the vault. In essence: Overseeing survival of the many instead of just you."
11128,it big good
11129,It's a really fun game but the only thing I would like them to add is like watchtowers in front of the vault for like raids and stuff but other than that its really good
11130,It's a cool game.
11131,It's another money grab from Bethesda.

11133,"You've played for xxx hours

Well yes i would, but im just writing this so steam stop asking me about it every f*ing time i open this game"
11134,very cool
11135,Good game! Would play more.
11136,"I don't need to explain why this is a good game, just know that it has very enjoyable aspects that you can find out for yourself.

11137,Good enough
11138,For a game to kill a little bit of time this is perfect.
11139,
11140,Surprisingly a fun game!
11141,"This is a fun game, mostly play it when I want to get rid of time, but it does get harder, but that does not bother me."
11142,The only good Fallout Bethesda ever made.
11143,Its aight
11144,Don't know why but i enjoy it even after 300+ hours... Safe to say that i like this game. A lot.
11145,very good 10/10
11146,"Really fun background game, even if you're not a Fallout fan. Just don't waste real world money on any of the microtransactions, you can get it all for free by using a save editor (there's even a browser one so you don't have to download a program)."
11147,meh

11149,Just fun time grinder
11150,good game
11151,One of the few truly enjoyable casual games
11152,"It's one of my favorite games, but I don't play for hours. Fallout Shelter is a good game to pick up for 10-20 minutes after work or before bed. You feel like you accomplish rewarding achievements and it's alot of fun! I don't have much free time with 10 hours of work everyday, so it's the perfect game for me right now."
11153,i love this gme
11154,Great game for downtime. One thing about this game are those f'n radscorpions that keep spawning in your vault.
11155,"The game-play is mostly very good.  You get to explore the wasteland, build your vault and inhabiting community, develop their skills, outfit them.  It's thoroughly enjoyable... EXCEPT FOR THE MICRO-PURCHASES.  I know it's ""free-to-play"", but that's just code for ""we designed the game to make people impatient so that they'll spend a ton of money to make the game actually tolerable.""  That's a HORRIBLE business model for at least two reasons: it's greedy and anti-consumer,  I would have gladly paid $20+ for this game and $1-$10 for seasonal upgrades.  As it is, I believed the game was worth at least $20, and purchased lunchboxes for about that amount.  I'm not disappointed so far with that purchase, but I will be when they run out and I'm expected to purchase more to make the game continue to be enjoyably playable without completely unnecessary headaches that were purposely made part of the game in order for Bethesda to make $$$$$$$$$$$$$.  This game has made me like Bethesda a lot less.
"
11156,"really


[EDIT]
20 hours into it still good."
11157,Ik no one gives a fuck but i just wanted to say that my vault is goals
11158,It's a great game honestly it just take a little bit to really get into the fun stuff
11159,this is a bruh moment
11160,I absolutely this game! It's great for a game play or break.
11161,"good mobile game, playing on PC for the kicks, but better as a killing time app for traveling."
11162,If you don't buy things it's a good game to check in on now and then.

11165,nice little game
11166,k
11167,"Nice compilation of bugs.  There is also a game if you have nerves of steel, and can handle your game rolling back to your last login everytime you login."
11168,"I am a Fallout fan for many seasons and a gamer since late eighties , early nighties when DOS still ruled. Why I love this little nifty game is that it is relaxing to the senses (not continuously  shooting, killing, heavy enemies in other good games) with some challenges to build your own vault. By the way I am a 66 year old gamer and still gaming my heart out."
11169,"It's sad that a f2p mobile game ported onto Windows is a better game than Fallout 76.

11/10 Would make 40 little Tenpenny children running amuck in my vault again"
11170,Good.
11171,"7/10
It's fun, and good to stream, but GOD is it hard and slow at time, even BS on very spisic moments that rng , but overall its fun and enjoyable"
11172,very good
11173,This game is really boring and intentionally designed to be so you pay for speed ups.
11174,"nice casual passtime, only thing I hate about it are Radscorpions! :-D"
11175,"Really cool game, great if you have nothing to do"
11176,Fun game for time passer
11177,"nice game, but u want more time for make best shelter"
11178,I like that more.
11179,Do not try to 100% this game.
11180,fun
11181,"if u enjoy the fallout universe and this type of game ur golden.....I've never played this type of game b4 and I enjoy it....it can become repetitive but if u just launch once a day to upkeep ur vault & dwellers it doesnt kill the enjoyment...I love Fallout games & dl this game on day one to an android cell...dont even recall how long ago that was but i've had this gem on 3 different cells since, my xbone, laptop and steam now.....mind u i only bother with the steam vault nowadays but as u can see 66 hrs and I'm still going"
11182,"...but I only recommend it to people who are able to control their gambling/shopping instincts.

This game is free to play as it is little more than an app designed to bleed money out of you via it's game advancing purchasing options. So, if you're someone prone to shelling out real life money on a regular basis, but can't really afford it, and lack personal control/willpower in not doing so, then stay well away.

Otherwise, for any persons, it's a fun little time waster."
11183,better than 76
11184,cool lmfao
11185,

11205,very fun game if you have some spare time
11206,Nice game
11207,Great game
11208,Not 76
11209,omg this is so fun  i love it you should play it
11210,"The best mobile game I've ever played now on PC, great."
11211,Good Game but hard
11212,A simple and fun game. A perfect thing for a fallout fan.
11213,ez game
11214,A great way to pass time. Art style is beautiful and the mechanics are pretty unique.
11215,Love
11216,"It's real fun my dudes! Build that vault, make those babies and drink some Quantum!"
11217,good  ... just easy play game
11218,"My 100hrs of playtime says it all - It is Addictive!
If it was not already a free game I'd buy it instantly. It is a fun and plentiful survival simulator with quirky details, fun gameplay and hours of quests and assignments to keep you busy. It also plays itself whilst you are away, neat!
___________________________

Play this game if:
- You want a game that plays itself whilst you play other games
- You love the Fallout Universe
- You want to build up your own vault, train your dwellers to the max, seek fortune in the wasteland and fight fearsome beasts! 

Do Not play this game if:
- You want a story driven experience
- You are not too keep on survival strategy


Verdict: 9/10"
11219,"It is a interesting spin on the Fallout universe, since it seems to be an idle game, you can play other games while you wait for something to finish.
"
11220,7.0
11221,"Bethesda dont deserve your money.

And it crashes a lot. (like that is something new with Bethesda games)"
11222,"for fallout fans, its simple and nice"
11223,"Lots to do, quite a long stretch to get anywhere close to completing,end game."
11224,yes
11225,"If, like me you like to max things out this is a great FREE game to do so. Takes time, but is fun all the same."
11226,weoirsdfjhsdkfjhasdklweou yeah its fun!
11227,"A attention clicker for morons. WTF is this?  Waste of time and if you are stupid money.
There is no strategy and no plan, just try and error. 
Stuff breaks into your shelter, your dwellers dont react you cant move them to the right rooms in time.
This is not frustrating after hours of building a base, in the opinion of the devs
A game should have options to react to a problem, not just let stuff happen to force you to grind and waste your time more. 
I hate this game!

I continued to play it to see what it is about. 
i had a hard crash and my Shelter Savegame is gone for no reason. Impossible I deleted it.
Who make games like this?
bethesda wants to test how far they can go with their customers....it seems!"
11228,"This game is fun, offers a lot of fun, you can hack it and/or download a jailbroken save with lots of lunchboxes. This was before Bethesda became controversial."
11229,"meh
"
11230,"Easy to play and plenty of info on how to improve on the etherwebs. This is my first free-to-play game in a LONG time and I'm hooked. I've got three vaults going: one on iOS, one here on Steam, and the final one on my PC (XBOX)"
11231,Awesome game!
11232,it is alright
11233,yes
11234,great game
11235,really fun i play it alot on my phone
11236,YAY
11237,Great game when i need a change from fps and rts games
11238,its a game
11239,"Pretty typical mobile type game. Very casual, but can be a bummer waiting so long."
11240,Good fun game
11241,Its a great game if you like Building and all that stuff.
11242,This is a addicting game that is very fun :)
11243,7/10
11244, I am ok
11245,"Fallout Shelter is a fun time waster.  Unfortunately, if you want to get all of the achievements, it will take a long time due to the loot-chest requirement to get 20-legendary dwellers.   Only a hand full are given as a quest reward, the rest are strictly random from the Vault-Tek Lunchboxes.  Lunchboxes are gained only through quest reward, weekly report card or through cash purchase (Pay to win).  From what I have played, there is less than 5% chance of getting a legendary vault dweller per lunchbox."
11246,"A nice little build-a-vault-game, great for spending a little time. But it lacks the depth to be motivating in the long term."
11247,It's good
11248,it fun 10/10
11249,Best game even on PC
11250,game is far to slow in everything.
11251,"I can't believe I've already clocked up 7 hours...

It's a cute little game, simple mechanics, I have it running in the background when I'm fiddling about online, when it starts beeping, I check what's going on a get a quick dopamine hit. I like the gradual sense of achievement. Even if you get caught up with something and forget to check in, and when you do you've accidentally killed some dwellers, you just pay to revive them.  I should be playing Deus Ex, but keep coming back to this one instead. It's very low stress.

Maybe it's a little slow. Once I've clicked what needs clicking, there's nothing to do. It's hardly a negative though, because I appreciate it not needing my full attention. Yeah, I could pay real money to speed it up, but it's not essential to progress and it isn't shoved in your face."
11252,A very simple yet entertaining game.
11253,very good
11254,"Played this some time ago on iPad, still lovely balance and push-your-luck timekiller."
11255,its FUN
11256,Fun little game that you can spend a little time on every once and a while. Once you finish the quests and max out vault space there's isn't much left to do. My only gripe is the in-game transactions - but perfectly playable without spending any money.
11257,"not a gay game
"
11258,fun
11259,Great game just try it you will not regreat it definitly top 10 best free to play games!

11261,very easy to learn
11262,this game gud
11263,"amazing gameplay! diffently recommended to play, specially people who have lots of time and patient as well :D
"
11264,.
11265,it's free
11266,"silly but fun, if you have played Fallout 4 you may enjoy this"
11267,"it's kind of like playing a Sims game, I believe it's basically Sim Tower; although i've never played ST to compare.
I absolutely love this game, but i wish you could speed up time like in The Sims; my guess is because it was a mobile game, and they all do the real-time aspect."
11268,"This game is absolutely amazing! A great time killer as well. It may seem like things take too long, but there are ways around that."
11269,yes
11270,:)
11271,"good game, you basically manage a vault and that's it. you have pets too"
11272,this is a good game
11273,"Pretty chilly game, like it"
11274,"Entertaining, easy to play, simple...what's not to like?"
11275,. . . . .
11276,Dang this game is addictive!
11277,"It is a good time waster, play for about an hr each night."
11278,no off line progression and it takes hours to do almost everything.  i'm not going to just sit there and wait 3 hrs for a quest to be complete.
11279,"It is quite surprising how simple yet difficult it can be. There is a strategy to the different selections which will either keep your vault functioning and growing, or dying out as the last person is eaten by death claws."
11280,I guess it's okay
11281,"best game ever, hope they do a sequel some day but don't do anything like 76 just keep it basic."
11282,yes
11283,"Simple enjoyable game, I love it :'D

The only downside it doesn't have Steam cloud saving, your progress will be gone if you format or something like that."
11284,"three words

fun simple cash grab"
11285,"great game that i enjoy
"
11286,"Depends on your opinion of the franchise

11290,l
11291,Nom.
11292,Been a long time supporter and lover of Fallout series back to the original.  This just added to it as now i can play mobile and on my computer at home.  Excellent work by the dev team and a must for your Library.
11293,its gud
11294,"Simple mechanics, good for people who want a distraction, without having to tap candy or blocks.

Pro: 
Game seems to know when its about to kill a Dweller, and moves on to another victim.
Simple collection technique, reasonable learning curve.
Fun.

Con:
During Vault attacks/emergencies, directing a Dweller to another room to help can sometime reassign them to that room.
No easy way to sort Dwellers by Health (i.e.; who needs StimPaks the most).
During mission battles, clicking and dragging to have a specific Dweller aim at a specific target causes the Dwellers stats to show up, which blocks 1/4 of the screen.  In small rooms, thats a pain.

11295,A fun mini-game
11296,Very fun
11297,"i'm GOD
"
11298,hatz
11299,Love This GAME much ... Much
11300,Very easy to play
11301,"fun game, not sure why Bethesda is so hands off... oh, thats right '76. Well anyway, I'm just happy the game hasn't been puled yet."
11302,great game
11303,
11304,This is a Fallout version of simulation micromanagement games where you control the inner workings of a vault. You do get to send your Sims out to the waste land to do little quests to help grow and defend you vault from normal Fallout wasteland pests like feral ghouls rad roaches and death claws.  I find it a nice way to take my mind off of a days stresses
11305,"sesuai nama gamenya, Fallout Shelter, ya disini kita akan membuat Shelter kita sendiri, yang dimana setiap ruang memiliki tugas masing-masing untuk memperkuat shelter tersebut, apalagi saat Shelter kita diserang terus-menerus itu bikin Frustasi sih, ya untuk beberapa orang gameplay nya cukup membosankan, ya sebenernya main karna lg gabut overall ini mayan bagus, tapi kelemahan nya cuman kalo dimaenin makin lama ya bosen deh

Good
7/10"
11306,Progression and loot has been reduced to entice additional in-game purchases. It would be a fantastic game if Lunchboxes were more readily available.
11307,good :)
11308,Epic time killer made in true Fallout style. Cross platform so you can carry on with your wee survivors anytime you like. Plus it's FREE!! Doesn't get better than that.
11309,it is a nice timewaste.
11310,It keeps you entertained. Very much like Sims.
11311,"A decent pass-time, if you're bored. Not recommended as a real full-time game, but more for when you're waiting or looking for something to do."
11312,"Bad game, not what we wanted from it"
11313,A nice relaxing play.
11314,"Honestly there is just not much here, its a mobile game that was ported over and entirely geared to take time so you will buy the microtransactions.

Also when your attacked anyone thats pregnant will just run around screaming and not defend themselves, and its just demeaning."
11315,"Nice and simple, loads of fun!!"
11316,"gam
"
11317,"Really fun game and a fun time killer, but too many RNG elements in the game and their needs to be more freedom
"
11318,It's a cool game...
11319,"This game fulfills my casual gaming needs. I like the quirky and silliness that the Fallout series provides in their games. The continuous time aspect allows me to intermittently play here and there when I find the time, with the game progressing making weapons, gear, and adding people."
11320,Its a fun game to passively play i pop in and out of the game like 4 times a day to check on it its almost like computer pet
11321,Great time killer
11322,"It's alright. Nothing extremely innovative, but there is a satisfaction in building up your dwellers, and collecting the weapons and outfits and dwellers. Microtransactions are present, but you won't really feel compelled to spend if you normally wouldn't. Lunchboxes (lootboxes) are easily earned through missions, and so is Nuka Cola (for skipping wait times). It's a good idle game."
11323,it is a very fun game to play
11324,"its pretty good for a bethesda game, oh wait they didnt make this one either"
11325,This is a fun distraction. Being patient with it can yield multiple levels of success without engaging in the micro transactions offered.
11326,please make for windows 7 its my favorite game
11327,.
11328,"This is fun game to play when you feel like it, beware though that if you do not play for a while you may lose your vault"
11329,good game to waste yout time üòÅ
11330,kills time
11331,"nice, i love it
"
11332,very nice and casual. hardly no chance to lose. very forgiving gameplay. UI is a bit clunky at times.
11333,"Despite this being a good game, its a very greedy game i had been playing it for free from the start and there is plenty to do then it comes to a very sneaky halt, this is were you need to spend some money. Fair enough!, i would say this game is worth about $5 so i brought a couple of items, 6 Nuke cola and a suitcase to the value of about $3 Aud. The Nuke cola is is what keeps the game going and and for $3 i got a couple hours of action. If you expect to conquer the game then expect to spend hundreds of dollars and that would be stupid the game is not worth it. I will not spend anymore on this game. 
"
11334,It's good.
11335,meh
11336,S
11337,Its one of those games that is just fun to play while doing other things. its smooth and rewarding enough for the effort you put in.
11338,"Its, fun. It's a fun Fallout game, more on the comical, quirky side. Its not a game you need to spend countless consecutive hours on, you easily just quickly gather some resources from your room, send dwellers on quests and come back a couple hours later and see the fruits of your couple minutes labor. if you can keep on top of your vault, it doesn't turn into a pay to win. It's a fun, quirky, idle-play game. I really enjoy and definitely recommend it."
11339,Fun game great for burning time or a little distraction
11340,Awesome Game 9/10
11341,"Amusing, and a good way to waste some time. I love the fallout series, so this is a nice little addition to the 'world'."
11342,"Cute game, but Bethesda is crap"
11343,I love this game a lot.
11344,it is a fun little management game that can spend a few minutes if do not feel like getting actual work done. I love it
11345,decent for a f2p game
11346,"Es un juego simple, tiene sus momento de dificultad, tanto para hacer las misiones como conseguir recursos. Es el mundo de FALLOUT en una version mino, no tiene desperdicio alguno."
11347,fun game needs more quests once u finish them all only dailies and weeklies
11348,"precursor to the ingenious ""pay-to-lose"" philosophy utilized in Fallout 76."
11349,its a fun click on game running in the background while your writing a paper or something
11350,"its so awsome i love this game i think its right in the top 2 best fallout games
"
11351,"Good ""ant farm"" management game, but would be better without the lootboxes."
11352,It's fun and pretty interesting once you get 100+
11353,yeah
11354,uren spel/game plezier
11355,fun way to spend a few hours. make sure to save before you log off or your vault will continue with out you.
11356,.
11357,"Fallout Shelter is a decent free to play model game.
You must organise a colony of vault people and help them grow bigger and survive.
You can breed people and assign them to rooms to work depending on their stats.
Has time mechanics so things can take awhile but it's not to bad."
11358,easy to pick up
11359,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]

In Fallout: Shelter, you are a Vault Overseer. You are tasked to ensure that the dwellers you have invited into your vault are happy, you have to make sure you manage your resources carefully - to make sure you don't run out of power, food or water - and you must assure that your shelter is secure for your dwellers to live in from raiders and the odd Deathclaw attacks.

As a fan of the Fallout series, I saw this on Steam and thought that I would try it again and see what it was like on pc. I had an idea of what to anticipate from playing it on my phone and the E3 footage from a few years back when Fallout 4 was announced so I knew what I was diving into. To be quite honest, Fallout Shelter after a week already feels lacklustre and tiresome. I've invested a few hours in the game and I'm pretty much done with wanting to play it anymore. Here are some deductions why.

[h1]Reasons[/h1]

[b]1:[/b] Once you've got 30+ rooms, managing the interface and each vault dweller becomes an ordeal. Having to handle well over 50 dwellers with a menu becomes tedious and frustrating. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it's more manifest than mobile versions as I invariably select dwellers accidentally on mobile but it would've been nice to see an improvement to manage each dweller more easily.

[b]2:[/b] You have to click on each room to collect resources from it. When you have 15 resource-producing rooms, it's needlessly tedious. When you have five to six rooms? Sure, it adds some interactivity to the game. But later on, it's just a big pain in the ass and absolutely nothing else. There is the option to purchase Mr Handy's to collect the resources but only for the one floor. The purchasing of Mr Handys can rack up drastically if you can't be arsed clicking on each finished resource when you have 15-16 floors.

[b]3:[/b] As the overseer, what am I progressing towards? More rare dwellers? Oh boy. So I can send them out exploring to collect more guns and outfits, with a solid guarantee that 90% of what they collect I already have (despite only having around 10-15% of the total weapons/outfits in the game)? There's no incentive. It's not worth the tedium for these truly tiny payoffs.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Fallout Shelter is a game with little purpose, and its replay value suffers excessively as a result. Incredibly bothersome adversarial mechanics, lacklustre end-game goals, and a largely absent sense of direction make what could be a fun free-to-play builder into a tedious and often pointless-feeling exercise in repetition. Beyond that, aggravating controls make managing your vault late in the game even more frustrating than it should be."
11360,"Downloaded yesterday, started a vault, was going fine, came back to play and my vault was gone. Way to go bethesda."
11361,"it's a good game, i like it
but it did crash my computer once
other than that, it's good"
11362,"Can't recommend the game due to severe logical faults.
1. How can a RAID from literally 3 RAIDERS steal 20% of all my resources if all of them are killed in the vault door room - the very first room, and defensive area - before they even enter the shelter at all?
2. Why are the resources not returned if the RAID is unsuccessful and all RAIDERS are killed?
3. How come I can only place 2 defenders in a 2 space room which should allow 4 defenders per se, but since it's a defense room, it should even allow 6-8?
4. Why can't I add at least a basic weapon system to the defensive area?
5. If you close your game, the game still runs for a fixed amount of time (seems to be a few minutes). After that, resource consumption stops. But the people on mission in the wastelands are NOT stopped, effectively killing them if I don't remember calling them back before going to sleep. Why is this design decision necessary? To feel more mobile-clicky?
6. Why is exploring the wastelands dangerous, getting back to the vault from the wasteland totally safe?
7. Why do I even bother?

This is not a base building game, as you don't have to maintain resources necessary for building it.
This is not a tower defense game, as your means of defense is laughable, and stolen resources are integral part of the game, and not avoidable.
This is not a strategy game, as 80% of the game is luck/random.
This is not a card collector game, as you can not upgrade or evolve your cards, and the game mechanics are not stone-paper-scissors.
This is not a management simulation, as it is lacking any depth necessary for that."
11363,"Amazing game but very slow, if your into that"
11364,"Free game but they try to get you on the nuke colas.   You can send your guys on missions and log off, then come back on after X number of hours, and your guys are ready to explore.   But on the way back, its' broken.. if the travel time is 5 hours back, you have the be IN the game for 5 hours for your guys to return.. unless you want to spend money on nuke colas.. and that can get expensive after awhile.     This was not the case for the IPAD version of this game.. but this PC version seems broken.

Positive recommendation ,  but I would give it a 60 out of 100"
11365,"I love the simplicity of the game and the ease of use, you can play it with just a mouse. and it's great to just kinda' play it in small bursts. I loved it on my phone, and PlayStation 4, and now am enjoying it on steam also."
11366,I've played this game on Phone and xbox but they need to add this to Mac it is a great game very addicting and fun.
11367,"A game that you can put five minutes into at a time sorting out quests etc, or can also spend a few hours playing if you want to go into depth sorting your dwellers out. Very simple game play but still satisfying."
11368,It's a great simple game..
11369,good game as well
11370,YOUR SOUL IS LOST THE MOMENT YOU PRESS PLAY
11371,Fun little time sink. My heart died a little when my survival vault got it's butt kicked by a deathclaw leaving only the pregnant and the children and yet I still keep going back to it.
11372,I spent 5 hours doing objectives and murdering radroaches 10/10
11373,"if you rush a room with 20% fail propability it will fail 8 (FUCKING EIGHT) out of 10 times, DO YOU DIPTARDS EVEN KNOW WHAT PROPABILITY IS"
11374,"Fun and free, really fun for good while! Love coming back to it every now and then to check in on my vaulties!"
11375,"I like the way the game works, building rooms and training characters. The one thing I don't like is that sometimes it freezes. The other suggestion I have is that there should be a 'family' feature. When 'mating' partners, it is hard to keep track of who is with who and it's a bit awkward and creepy. I think it would be fun to play some kind of city building game based on the Fallout theme. I don't care too much for the combat."
11376,yea
11377,You have nothing to lose (except your vault) darn you radscopions

I will be refunding this game, and will use my $0 to go and purchase some air."
11407,"Fun little mobile game as long as you treat it as such. If you are looking for some kind of competitive gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere.

11419,Yuh
11420,Had a lot of fun until my vault vanished. Complete bullshit.  :/ I had so much done and now its all gone.
11421,"Casual and addictive game. Despite some of the comments, you really don't need to buy anything to enjoy the game... it's actually more enjoyable not to. And of course you still have access to everything without paying. 
At first it can be a bit slow, but soon you will have so many things to do at the same time that you will almost regret the more quite times ! 
The only flaw I see is the combat system... it gets REALLY boring after a while. I actually stopped playing because of that. But well, after a long time as you can see :)"
11422,"A good game which is great when you consider that it's free to play. 

The microtransactions are not necessary to survive and make progress in the game either. A rare win for the Fallout brand."
11423,"Unsure how this game still has the same issue years after being released
- Files being irrevocably lost, losing all your progress as a result

How is progress not automatically being saved on cloud?
Simply cannot recommend under such circumstances, even as a free game (as all your hard work may just disappear)"

11429,"The first time playing this game I did not know what to expect and the first time one of the girls in the shelter gotten pregnant I was like ""Wait why does she look different than the others what happened"" my entire family was laughing at my reaction but overall a great game to play when your extremely bored."
11430,"Its as great as it is on android, a must have for steam users and fallout fans!"
11431,"This is nothing but a real-time chore simulator. It's even like in real life, where the only way to avoid chores is to pay!
 It looks nice and all, but the fact that you have to wait real-time hours for some tasks, or pay real life money to accelerate them, tells me that it's but a micro-transaction platform preying on people with addiction problems. Ant to top it off, sometimes it just freaks out and stuff dissapears off of your inventory. save yourself some time and don't play it."
11432,good

11446,"I once would have posted a favorable review for this game.
It's simple, but somewhat entertaining.   I hadn't seen any major problems with anything.

Now, however, I can't recommend this.    Items purchased vanish for no reason.   Vaults that have been fine for literal years suddenly stop saving progress.  And customer service is essentially non-existent.

Both Bethesda Softworks and Steam point fingers at each other should there be any problems.  Both claim there's nothing they can do and suggest talking to the other one.  Until you suggest legal action might be needed.

No.   It might be a free game, but it's simply not worth the price."
11447,its an alright game :)
11448,"The game itself is great, but gets too slow too fast."
11449,"It's nice to see something new from Bethesda. Tho I have no idea how to rate this game. It's both good and bad at the same time. In the beginning, the game is extremly boring and when your population gets high the game starts to shine. But, after few hours of that, it gets extremly repetetive.Will continue playing to see if this state changes..

[h1]The good parts:[/h1]
- It's FREE
- Extremly easy to play
- Save game can be imported from mobile version
- It's nice to see something different about Fallout games


[h1]The not so good parts:[/h1]
- Game gets repetetive 
- It's empty, they need to add a lot of content
- You lose stats even when you exit the game"
11450,I love it
11451,"Playing this both mobile and desktop versions, very saticfied with gameplay."
11452,:)
11453,One of the only optimized fallout games on steam!
11454,Now I know where babies come from.
11455,"Game sucks, but i'm trying to like it!"
11456,good ez game but it locks up every 5 min on off line mode it can get hard as u go but fun
11457,Have too much caps...  NEED MORE
11458,"Fun game. Can be really boring when your first starting off, but once you get around 100 dwellers it makes it a lot more interesting and gives you a lot more options to play around with."
11459,I filled it full of Conners. 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è-_-üíß

11461,"It is fun early on, but as you progress, you notice the odds stack against you unfavourably. Rushing a room when your average dweler strength is high etc and still fail on chance of 28% equals a radscorpion as punishment. Radroaches or Moles deals lots of damage in a vault, but three level 20 heros squish them no time on a mission. talk about balance! I did not have to spend a penny on ingame items, so you can play thru. It is the room/rush ratio that is unfair, the vault damage received from non-raiders etc and the whopping 18.000 caps for a tier 3 nuclear reactor! its better to upgrade 4x power rooms to tier 3 than have any nuclear reactor at all. 

And untrue to the game itself, fallout series is about nuclear power stuff, it was suppose to be cheap/affordable in that setting.

My downrating is for the unbalances that throw it."
11462,"It just stopped working one day. Crashed every time I tried loading a vault. Other than that, great game and a great time killer."
11463,"Truly excellent game, loved it to death then it crashed and I cant get my game save or start a new game.  Something is wrong with the steam link up.   To play this game you must go to the Bethesda web site directly and play from there.  Best free game on the market, love the era feel of the game and the funny things the characters say to one another.   If you do the quests you will get the robots for free."
11464,"no steam cloud save or way to get your vault back.
dont uninstall or get a new computer if you ever want to come back to this.
absolutely fucking ridiculous after ive spent money on this game in the past."
11465,"so sad my vault list missing 2 times, how to fix it guys ??
maybe i must uninstalled this game, this game so make me addictive"
11466,"When my team are playing CSGO,the awper always plays this game . Then he try to get the clutch with a glock and 30s."
11467,Yep.
11468,"I have spent more time in this game than others I revere.....

It's good."
11469,It's basically the mobile game but on PC. The game is not bad but gets repetetive and on your nerves when some idiots raid your vault again.
11470,"I love having a background game going when I'm working, this game is perfect for that (as is Rim World). You can't pause it but you can save and exit, then relaunch.  If you play it like this, you have no need to buy the in-game currency, to make it go faster.
"
11471,"Vault Protection, Resource production ,and baby making?"
11472,cool free game does have micro transactions but they are not needed you can get the same thing with just grinding
11473,"stupid
this game trash because you have to spend REAL money for stuff on a FREE game"
11474,"It's a 10/10 game I reccomend if you're silly like me and love/like Sandbox/Simulation games.  I say it's VERY VERY POSITIVE


-Edit

I am now a Synth and I'm from the Institute Of Society  ""IOS""  Get it, becouse this game is on ios android and all mobile platforms."

11477,"The PC adaptation of the mobile game, Fallout Shelter is a game about resource management.

Build a vault for people to live in, invite people to live in your vault, and have them work in their ideal roles while you try to survive in the tough world.

I personally don't feel it's engaging enough to devote too many hours while sitting in front of your computer, but it's certainly worth trying out if you are used to playing mobile games."
11478,"You have a message *beep* ''Good morning! This is Vault-Tech speaking! You have been choosen to live inside a vault shared by other lucky people and boy oh boy! Isn't that wonderful? Now since this is one of a kind offer, we do have a little something to make it a once in a blue moon chance, think of it, as a promotion... If you got it right, then yes! You have been selected as the Overseer with the advantage of numbering your vault! To accept this offer, you have to give us your personnal information with your signature and send it to Vault-Tech Inc. and if I were you, I wouldn't miss this for anything. So, interested in building the chaotic future underground?''

[h1] Story: [/h1]

By some miracle, you have been hired by the shady company Vault-Tech as the Overseer with the task of creating and expanding an underground civilization. As you progress, you soon discover that you are not alone under the wasteland as ghouls, raiders and other species tries to invade and feast on your dwellers while some survivors wants to find refuge in your vault.

[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]

No need for the keyboard in this game since it's a point and/or drag control feature by the mouse or the touchpad in the laptop.

You start in this game by just having a small handful of dwellers and some caps, with time you develop your vault with better resources than before with improved power plants, cafeteria, water treatment plant, this three representing the basic resources while the power is the most needed and crucial, and other types of rooms present in the game and caps represents as the main currency for such development as the Nuka-Cola Quantums are a special type of currency mainly used to speed up quests, finishing crafting equipment and such. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L system is in the game as well the dweller's leveling, not only for combat outside of the vault, but to increase the productivity of the indicated room's perk. Outfits, weapons and junk are also included in the game, each with their own statistical values in the sections of ''common'', ''rare'' and ''legendary'', while junk  is, fundementally, for crafting recipes, this also includes the dwellers and pets well. In case you can't go on quests, at the start, and tired to wait for your dweller to return the vault, you have objectives to complete, the harder they get, the better is the reward.

The EXP system is based around how many dwellers you got, the more you have, more rooms and upgrades will unlock, unfortunately, the limit of dwellers only goes up to 200, I wonder what would happen if it reaches 201...

By choice, you can play in the ''Survival mode'', which by the name you can tell that it sounds like fighting a deathclaw in Fallout New Vegas with your fists, in other, short and less complicated words, the need of resources increases, more daily visits of raiders and ghouls and with the removed feature of reviving your dead dwellers.

Microtransactions are present in the game, you can buy lunchboxes, which can give you random rewards, Nuka-Cola Quantums, caps and other stuff available at the store, totally avoidable and doesn't make a big impact on the gameplay, unless you like donating money... or burning it.

The game's design is more 3D while the characters are 2D with bright colors combining with the destruction present outside of the vault.

Achievements are as well unlockable, not with dwellers, unfortunately. Most of them are easy which you just have to upgrade some rooms, complete a certain number of quests which is on the medium difficulty and change hairstyles of the dwellers, near hard but not that much. The hardest one being ''Blast from the past''  which, in order to complete it, you need to have 20 legendary dwellers, sounds easy right? The truth is, the only way to get them is by either spending money on microtransactions, owning lunchboxes through objectives, completing quests or trying your charisma and luck at the radio studio.

[h1] Glitches/ bugs/ errors report: [/h1]

The only thing that happened to me was the game crashing once without saving it which lead me to repeat the same stuff but in case of this constatly happening, like what the community says, it's best to always save the game, even when in doubt and on quests, when the characters die, they, sometimes, glitches through some walls and it is barely impossible to click on them to collect their stuff.

[h1] Overall: [/h1]

Patience is a requirement for this game if you want to have the best vault ever, it'll take weeks and months for you to complete it, if you want to get everything and every character maxed out but, from my perspective, I believe the main currency in this game should've been more usable than the microtransaction store, using caps to buy different and unique weapons and outfits or even using it at some quests where there's hostages or even pay somebody to work in your vault. This game should've been more explored and a complete different experience from what I was expecting when I first played it.

I really like the design of the game with a guide that tells me the information of weapons, outfits, pets and dwellers as well the fact that the dwellers sometimes breaks the fourth wall, truly is funny as hell!

Do I recommend it? For people who are bored and like this type of games, sure, I mean, it's a fun little strategic game, even tho in my opinion, more ideas should have been created to make it more unique.

Score: 6/10

11479,"Went in with low expectations but looking at the review gaves me some expectations, however minor. I was pleasantly surprised. Despite appearing pay-to-win, it's not by any means. Granted, it is slow going at first but once you put some time in, it starts to snowball and everything goes a lot faster. For a free game, it's worth giving a try, especially considering that the in-game world still progresses even when you're not playing.

I share the common criticism that it lacks depth, but not enough to make it unplayable. Also, the lack of an ending or real goal does hurt it a bit. In short, I'd just say there's worse ways to spend your time. A solid 7/10. If you're into management games, it's fun, albeit slow fun."
11480,I am having a bug where the game will crash every 5-10 minutes..
11481,very good game
11482,"A lot of negative review says the same exact thing and still... with no fix!

As I'm reading reviews and whatsoever, I saw how people are having issues with the save files and how the vaults they own disappears!
Well, after playing the game for 45 hours, mine just did the same thing...
I even wasted more time trying to download the backed up save file from the Steam Cloud and other common fixes...

Never had such a problem even with games from the late 90s!"
11483,WTF I AM BIG TRAMATRON YEET maSTER
11484,^^
11485,This game is awesome as long as you don't sleep when you are playing this game.
11486,.
11487,"Good to kill some time, from time to time"
11488,"Games solid, failry addicting.
However. When it crashes, ya can kiss yer Save Goodbye.
After 16Hrs of play, the game crashed. And my sweet, sweet save...my sweet vault....was no more.."
11489,Update this shit.
11490,"Really, really fun and simple mobile game brought to steam. Wish there were more chances for lunchboxes though. Quests give you chances for those and other stuff but still."
11491,My god this is a time sink.. totally brain dead fun.
11492,Best tycoon ever
11493,"I haven't played this game in a long time, and I'm only leaving a review because the new Steam layout (currently beta at this moment) shows my reviews on the game page. Whereas the old layout I'd have to go to the store page to see if I left a review or not, and to see if that review received comments.

Fallout Shelter was probably the first serious idle clicker game I played. I'd played various web browser idle clicker games, but I didn't get involved as much compared to Fallout Shelter. I probably spent a $100 over the 1710 hours I've accumulated. Probably less than a 100 hours of actual playtime which really is just maintenance and some timed clicking for battles. The rest is just running in the background and occasionally watching for Mysterious Stranger popups for bonus cash or some daily goal.

Anyways, as someone who became a fan of the series starting with FO3 and in love with the lore, Fallout Shelter is a really nice niche game. I don't know what the state of it is now as I haven't played in probably a year or two. You can get into the game now and get all the weapons, outfits, and pets as well as maximizing all your vault dwellers statistics with careful planning and strategy guides. I could imagine you could spend a whole year or two since accumulating the holiday events items takes time, but you could probably play this game for years. I have too many games I still want to play, so I don't imagine myself revisiting this since I've pretty much gotten all the achievements.

Finally, I'd like to say that I really liked this game so much that I hope they release an improved sequel."
11494,"""Oh, yes, let's develop atomic energy. Because that worked out sssooo well before...""

- Mister Handy

===================================================================

I've been playing this game for quite a long time with my old account, now I'm back to play it with my new one. The game is pretty simple yet fulfilling (in the early stages at least). You get to place the rooms needed for supplies, bigger population and to train your dwellers. Make sure you aren't low on any resource and equip your dwellers with the best weapons to defend the vault from dangers. You get to send your dwellers to the wasteland to do some quest or just to find more supplies, armors, weapons and more people.

For the long run, you'll find that this game is pretty boring and repetitive. Although there're many ""quests"" to do, they're just gonna be almost the same ""go out of the vault and do some killing and/or looting"" kind of thing. Some of the quests' backstories are pretty funny tho. There are microtransactions, like, to buy nuka-cola quantum which is gonna come in handy for speeding up the time of crafting, for skipping objectives, for instantly completing trainings, etc. So, yes, to get complete achievements for this game is either you work your ass off and be one of the most patient human beings or spend quite a fortune to buy some nuka-cola quantums to help you get the achievements faster.

All in all, it's a really good game for killing time. Don't stress yourself too much for playing this game. Just enjoy the process or move on to another game if you feel bored.

===================================================================

I'm gonna give this game a ""That guy could feed the entire vault only by sitting down and eating"" out of ""Cappy always gives me Bottle Caps, so I expect you to always give me Nuka-Cola Quantums, Bottle!"""
11495,Game was okay until i found out there's a common bug where your vault will COMPLETELY DIASAPEAR! lost tons of played time
11496,Yeah its really good but feels a lot like a mobile game. Waiting time is long there is not much to do. But overall its a big plus
11497,booyakasha
11498,A really fun game that doesn't require constant babysitting or monitoring. Come and go as you please. Hoping for a bigger and better version of this in the future.
11499,Played like one second of this game
11500,"Pretty good game..... with a save editor... Completely idiotic to pay for any of the microtransactions in the game. It add ups way above any newly released game with 100 times better graphics and gameplay. 

1000 nuka colas are 99‚Ç¨ which is just insane. Thats 2 new games. You can buy Monster Hunter World or some other good game for that money.

With save editor, those are free.

Don't support microtransactions, play the game for fun, the way you want it to be, use a save editor and you save yourself alot of money and time, better wasted elsewhere. 

If they actually want to make money of this game, make it a paid game instead 10 - 20$ is fair and remove the microtransactions and timers, let the dwellers increase their special stats as they level up. Wasteland exploration timer is fine, but not for missions.

Also.... Don't buy anything in this game, don't support this disgusting microtransaction trend. Even if you buy anything in the game, your saves can get corrupted and you lose everything you bought, completely wasting your money.."
11501,good
11502,"Boring.
All you do is drag your guys from one room to another."
11503,beats 76
11504,"Very fun, i highly recommend playing this game!"
11505,"Good game. But not many dwellers come to your base when your just starting so, For Beginners put alot of dwellers. But i do recommend playing this, Very fun. Iv'e beaten it and it's amazing.."
11506,is better useing wemod
11507,"This game taught me that not all mobile games are bad. The only issue with it is that it's very slow to start. You're always waiting on something; whether it be for dwellers to finish a task, explore, get to quest locations, or whatever. Thankfully, after a couple days your vault does become busy enough that there will always be something for you to do. Otherwise it's a great game for just how simple it is."
11508,Good
11509,Boring
11510,Nice game but hard
11511,good game when u bored
11512,Better than Fallout 76 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
11513,good
11514,very great game
11515,"This game is great for some casual play or if you're going to be busy but still want a gaming fix. Take your time when advancing, prioritize quests, and level your dwellers and you should do just fine. 

You can even find save editors online - super convenient for those that don't feel like waiting forever or treating this game like a typical freemium game."
11516,"good time sink and OP molerat attacks... too hard to recruit enough people before everyone is dead and no cash to revive.

only good thing about it is that its free..."
11517,"While I generally enjoyed the game, I can't recommend it for a simple reason.

Blast From The Past
"
11518,"Fun casual game to play on the side.

Takes time to get stuff but you don't really mind since you play 10 minutes twice a day max if you're actively on it."
11519,"When i first played this on console a few years back i expected it to be like a traditional mobile game, you have to pay to win but i was pleasantly surprised that you actually don't have to spend a dime to have fun with this game. Everyone and everything you get from buying things, you can get completely free with a little grinding (which makes the game fun) 

now ive downloaded it on pc to relive the fun again, so yes if you have time on your hands buy this game it is so much fun.

only downside i can see is that quests do take a long time to start, but its pretty simple."

11521,"Pretty good game, shame that on two occasions my saves were blanked which is a bit of a issue."
11522,"A very funny and cute city building game. Eventually it gets repetitive, but by that time you have enjoyed it dozens of hours."
11523,i like this game so much (:0)
11524,Bad quality. Invincible bugs kill entire vault. Wasted hours for nothing. Not starting again. Can't see hit count on enemies in vault. Poor UI. Don't bother.
11525,"This game is super fun, it takes a bit for a steady flow of resources, and the quests do take a while, i purchased the 5 Lunch-Box pack and got 2 Mini-Nuke launchers, making me invincible with only 18 dwellers."
11526,Decent game you can play to kill time here and there. It's nature let's you play a game while you wait for a mate or whatever.
11527,"Excellent game! Highly recommend and have been playing on Playstation 4, Mobile Phone and now on PC and in the last 4 years I have enjoyed every moment of it! If you think you won't like it, just try it and I guarantee you will."
11528,thank you vault tec man very cool!
11529,Fun to kill some time.
11530,Actually fun game. Good for people who like fallout games
11531,"vault 69, nice"
11532,so cool old game.
11533,"Great game! I began playing on IOS and as far as I can say it's a perfect game for ANYONE to pick up and play for free! It's fantastic how a game like this is available across platforms as well as mobile so you can play anywhere at anytime! The game doesn't require internet connection to play however you do need it to access the store where you can take part in many micro-transactions. The downside to the payments available is that most of them consist of buying 'loot-box' style things and receiving random gifts. The positive is, though these gifts can vary from decreasing the time certain actions take to increasing traits of the game. If this review helped please be sure to say so and if you have any questions be sure to drop them down in the comments below! Thank you for reading and enjoy fallout shelter!"
11534,this game is so hard and once your happyness is at 60 to 10 you cant rais it up again it is a waist of time i spent 5 dollers and i was failing so i deleted the file and i never got my money back so don't spend you money on this game its kinda like a scam.
11535,its like sims but survival.
11536,crashes a lot
11537,I like the concept
11538,"It's a fun game. Slow burn early on, but it does become boring after a while. That being said, if you want a post-apocalyptic vault management sim, then I guess you could try it out. My least favorite part of the game is running out of space for all the dwellers to stay and stuff."
11539,"First of all and most importantly, this game is definitely not pay to win. This alone makes it really good for a free to play game. I have almost 50 hours on PC alone and have never spent even a cent in it but I have a complete and working vault with all the bells and whistles. Gameplay could have been deeper with more customization options but I wouldn't call it shallow either. You get what you pay for, except I got even more.

Of course if you want to collect all in game items or get certain achievements quicker then money can get things moving faster. Seeing how scummy Bethesda have been lately I wouldn't recommend spending money. Nevertheless it's the last Fallout content I can say I had fun with and it doesn't even mess with the lore that much, something amazing when you consider... Bethesda."
11540,Fallout Shelter a solid game but gets repetitive as you develop your shelter and get into the late game (tedious is a great word for it). But it's fun to go explore areas outside the shelter and customize your vault dwellers. Fallout fans will have fun playing this game.
11541,"i really enjoy fallout shelter, i have always been a big fan of the fallout franchise even though it can get a little repetative its still really fun to play.i am always recommending it to my friends trying to get them to play with me. i hope they keep making this game as great as it has been and i am excited to see what they do with it in the future. the fact that its free is what makes it even better. the in app purchases are pretty neat as well."
11542,I N C E S T
11543,really love this game 10 out of 10
11544,Awesome game super addictive
11545,Robert sugi pula
11546,"It has a nice UI, but the gameplay is rather easy and offers no challenge.

It acts like a pocket / time waster type game."
11547,yes
11548,"It's free, for what it is it's good."
11549,yeah bethesda really balled hard with this one fam
11550,"The game is really fun, has enjoyable graphics and gameplay. I like how this is basicly like humanity raising again. Since you have to get babies, make them grow and become good ol' soldiers. There is a lot that you can do with people. There are a lot of rooms. which specific people specify. I would higly recommend it to people who are bored."
11551,Just For Fun LOL
11552,Funny game! :)
11553,"HELLO, GIVE ME FREE GAMES PLS 
"
11554,"Casual 'n Slow-Paced.

I've been playing Fallout shelter on my Android for years now.
And for quite some time on Steam too.
Fallout Shelter is just a great game.
Real slow-paced gameplay; Unlocking new rooms
Leveling up your dwellers, equipping your dwellers.
Sending them out to the wasteland to find junk or weapons etc.
Everything you do and everything you'll improve will eventually result in larger waiting times for things to finish.
U can compare it with Clash of Clans a little.
Difference is that there is no multiplayer in fallout shelter.
And no real purpose either.
U'll be leveling up, finding gear, making better gear etc. until you reach a certain limit.
If u're into that kind of games, then ""Fallout Shelter"" is for you.
I've enjoyed it a lot, and still do.

Try not to buy the lunch boxes or anything, I've had quite the experience opening them.
and the rewards are not worth the dough.

Further more; the Achievements seem to be a bit wonky every now and then.
If you're hunting for them, then I advice you to focus on 1 Vault for all of them.
Because the Progress will not stack across the 3 (possible) Vaults."
11555,"It's not worth spending too much time for, but if you want to spend small amounts of time every now and then just to manage everything quickly and then leave again, this is the game for you."
11556,good
11557,uh i unplugged my pc and i lost all my data to the game and now i have to restart even though i saved the game sad times ;(
11558,Sal is tonight's big loser. His punishment: to review Fallout Shelter.
11559,"I made male kids pregnant.

11/10 Realism"
11560,"Good
"
11561,"A fun little ""set-it-and-forget-it"" idle game. The grind can take a bit at higher levels but the fact that this game works while in idle makes it a great quick game for the morning before work while eating breakfast. The fact you can collect stacked daily bonuses is nice to, it makes it so you dont have to check it every single day. Definately recommend for casual gamers."
11562,is very nice
11563, smash
11564,"I like this game but it somtimes forces you to spend money other then that its good

6/10"
11565,"Got hooked on mobile version, then Switch version, then PC version, I don't mind it :o"
11566,This is a very fun game! Other than being pay to win its fun to build up.
11567,really fun game but it is pay to win.
11568,I love this game the ability to control you're on vault in you palm. I just love this game.
11569,More fun than Fallout 76.
11570,"A very fun 2D shelter building game, based off the Fallout game series. Would recommend as an easy to play, somewhat relaxing game."
11571,"Fun little game. It starts slow so its one of those that you startup and play for 10-15 mins here and there. Once you get up and going theres enough to keep you playing for longer period.
I read a few of the strat tips online before I invested too much time. I will say that there is a huge downside to trying to grow too fast. Once you go over certain numbers of dwellers the game starts sending harder events. I would suggest getting to 40-55 dweller range then packing up on weapons/gear to equip and training your dwellers points. 
First is raiders(Attacking from door). Then its roaches/moles(Spawning in random rooms). Then scorps/ghouls(Scorps spawn in random room. Ghouls from front door and they cause radiation damage). Then at 60 dwellers deathclaws start attacking. Just be sure to have the gear to deal with these before pushing numbers too high and the game goes pretty smooth."
11572,"Wow, did I really spend that much time on this silly game? If only Fallout 76 had been able to keep my interest like this. This is a good game to leave running in the background while you do mindless busy work. And it's free."
11573,"EDIT: I tried to get the ""Blast from the Past"" achievement by stockpiling lunchboxes which I got from quests and objectives: I only got 1 legendary dweller out of 90 lunchboxes.

- A mobile game port full of micro-transactions and pay-2-win mechanics. Slow progression during crafting of weapons and outfits, and training to gain SPECIAL stats. You speed things up using Nuka-Cola, which can be acquired in quests, lunchboxes or buying them with real currency. There are also lootboxes which can be bought with real currency called lunchboxes and pet containers which provide in-game items.

- Several bugs encountered such as inaccurate Steam achievements tracking, clunky controls, and inaccurate objective tracking (objectives are in-game tasks that you need to complete in order to gain caps, lunchboxes, pets, or Nuka-Cola).

+ It's a great past time as you do quests, craft weapons and outfits, train dwellers to reach their maximum stats and levels, and collect from ordinary to legendary pets and dwellers."
11574,"splendid game, yes. indeed it is."
11575,nice game must play
11576,"This game would be really cool with multiplayer system.
That means: Trading, Exploring, making enemies and making allies!
With that. It would be reaaally cool.

I rate 8/10"
11577,Good game ! Best !
11578,not bad
11579,geff
11580,Easy to pick up and very addictive.
11581,pretty cool i reccomend
11582,"This game is simply great. Bethesda making fun of themselves (Fallout-like). I simply continue playing this game and go for another (new) quests only because i want to see (read) just another fine fun quest lines. WIth every vault i begin I actually voluntarily pay for the start package (you dont have to, its really not p2w) just because i think that creators deserve money for this funny experience. Thank you ""Beth"". Fingers crossed for another good games. Hopefuly 76 will get better soon too ;)"
11583,"bhra
"
11584,"good but make it easier to take care of the vault
"
11585,"Hey guys its me,pee pee poo poo,this game is okay. 10/10"
11586,"I used to play this back when it first came out of the phones. I decided to try it again here on pc since its been so long. I was very quickly reminded just how boring and uninteresting it was. Don't get me wrong, it's nice enough since it's technically free. However, in my opinion, there's just very little to do and the wait between repetitive actions becomes pointless. This probably wasn't helped that transitioning from phone to cp meant I restarted from scratch, which wasn't any fun either so I quickly lost interest.

Positives: 
+Free
+Decent enough premise
+Looks nice
+Is okay for what the game is supposed to be

Negatives: 
-Repetitive
-Tedious
-Wait times"
11587,A really fun way to waste time!
11588,"love the game kinda suck at it but it's still an amazing game. The only problem i have with the game is if you move the camera too fast it has a flicker,  and if you continue to move the camera (witch is basically needed) the game freezes). its only a small glitch though dose not affect my  opinion on this game though"
11589,i haven't played this game much on PC but i have played it on mobile and its a good game and it doesn't have to be pay to win. people may say it has to be but I've gotten further than a lot of other players without spending a dime on the game because i did quests and sent many dwellers in the wasteland because its the best way to progress. also don't produce dwellers faster than you can handle. what I'm saying is its a great game and the people complaining about it either did things improperly or just didn't give the game a chance
11590,IT aight
11591,"Very fun and addicting, and the best thing about it, it's free! There are so many objectives and quests to complete and it's always fun exploring the wasteland. A very cool game."
11592,i love this game have it for my phone and xbone... 5*****
11593,"It is super addicting! Probably my favorite feature is the quests. It gives you something to do instead of watching your vault. You never know what you'll find. And when it gets boring, I just switch to a different game and come back to this later. Definitely a 10/10"
11594,"ok. after a few hundred hours on this grindy money making scam i think its time for an honest review. all i have to say is this is bethesda... dont really have to state much more this day and age to portray the anticonsumerism involved. yes its a micro transaction based fuking pokies machine they are selling to children and all. (regardless of the morals or criminality of selling gambling to children), best way i can discribe this game in its greed, say for one questline, talk the 4 horseman questline for instance, there is as much wait time between travling dwellers to the quest location just to start the quests through this quest line if not more time than it takes to play fucking skyrim 100% through the main story line 4 or 5 times over... the way bethesda are seeking money here is just seedy... for a multi billion $ value corporation this 180 degree turn bethesda has made in the last few years is just sad. todd howard went from being the go to guy in gaming to being the but end of every joke... he went from jesus to peter molyneoux over night... thats this game in a nutshell. fallout shelter was the precourser to the joke that was fallout 76... in the end , fallout shelter is playable without micro transactions, IF YOUR FUCKING PATIENT. but its also fucking buggy... yes bethesda is known for bugs, n, yeah, when its a MASSIVE game like skyrim or oblivion, its TOLERABLE and UNDERSTANDABLE to have bugs. sometimes it can be endearing. but bugs, glitches and lag galore in fallout shelter isnt understandable or excuseable in ANY WAY... if say two rooms pay up at once while all of a sudden a fire breaks out while bottle or cappy are dancing or the stranger appears and your trying to click on something at the same time, have fun with that freezing and feel good when you miss out on the nuka cola when that happens... or you cant click on a dweller to give them stimpax while their being attacked due to lag and they die... yeah... well done bethesda... really showing your care for your art this day and age. such remarkable integrity from the old number 1's xD... would still be number 1 now as well if they didnt go all greed and corruption driven after skyrim... todd howards a cocksucking twat."
11595,"I beat this game a long time ago and forgot to write a review. You can play this game in any way you want but i play it like a idle game and for an idle game its pretty cool. Its very detailed in a lot of areas with lots of fun quests. I dont think i spent any money on this.  I did start playing this game a long ass time ago, maybe 2 years ago off and on. The main thing i can tell is the core game never changes. The tutorial is what most of the game is. I cant recommend this game if you didnt like the tutorial. This game is more is more. You get more stuff but nothing actual changes. Having better stuff doesnt help you as much as you think it does. As for beating the game, I mean I did every quest. Even the repeatable ones. As far as i can tell, the choices you make during them doesnt make a huge difference. Sometimes you can skip a fight which is what i reccomend or you can force a fight. I think 50 percent of the choices are like that. Still fun to fight. For a free game that you can put on most devices, i say its better than average but dont expect quick anything. It takes awhile to get better stuff, it takes while to get more people. You get the picture. The quest are always fun. Just fighting is fun so ill give it that. One tip is when you start a vault, they usually give you rare stuff to survive to the mid game and if you dont get what you want, I would start another vault on another file. Im not sure how many vaults you can have but each one can be completely different from one another. Another tip is power and water is most important f I remember right. Happinesss doesnt do anything from my expirence. If they starve, its ok if u need to make tough choices. You can torture your people like that if you really want to. The game doesnt take death seriously. Its fun if you need a good laugh or whatever. Probably the most advance thing you can do is organize your stuff or plan out your vault. You can make your vault anyway you want. My only tip  is to put bedrooms on the very end. If you build a bedroom first and then extend from there, it makes it super tough to delete it months or years later and then your screwed. I do like all the weapons are clothes in the game. When they reach lvl 50, thats when i dress them up in silly stuff. Anyways, game is defiantly above average and i like it but its game where its takes a lot time and commitment to get the most out of it. Oh theres also no downside to deleting or kicking people out. Very handy when you in the red. Also spend you quantium wisely cuz it does become super rare after you do everything in the game. Anyways, its a cool interesting game which i recommend but it make take months to get where you want your vault to be at or get a certain unlock. I think I talked about everything. I have more tips but this is a review so ill end it here. Its best played your way and do your own thing."
11596,have less updates than tf2 lmao
11597,Sometime it just work even in windows 7 cause each and every vault and player is real and I gladly to say this game is entirely offline
11598,"I like the game alot but am having one issue with it . i downloaded it on my android a with my phone and thats where my problem is i bought a bunch of nuke cola with my phone to use in the game there but it still hasnt showen up i found the charges for
the game but todate have not received  my nuke cola. i like the game but wih mtproblem was fixxed"
11599,"?
"
11600,"Even though it's a small and free game there is still quite a lot of fun to gain out of this game.
I'd definitely recommend this game to those who are bored or seek a game to spend small amounts of time on.
You can either spend a lot of time playing it or only check it for a little bit and still make progress in the game.
You can save and quit at any time so you are not bound to stick around to finish any tasks.

Rating: 6/10
"
11601,"It's a free crew manager, very simple to pick up, but survival mode is a challenge and permadeath, which is hard to find that kind of challenge on mobile.  I'm playing FOS on PC, console and mobile.  I've made no purchase.  If you're a fan of XCOM you will probably like this.  Or it's hard not to like because it's simple and can be intense, uses the art of Fallout.  Some gameplay SIMs thrown in, i think there's a genetic system going on.  You try to score phat loot or epic settlers.  Uses the SPECIAL from fallout."
11602,not bad.
11603,end me daddy
11604,w
11605,"great game bc it just is
"
11606,"It is addictive and makes you want to play more, yes, however it's also pointless. There's really no strategy, no plot, no challenge.

It also corrupted my save file so if I ever want to play again I need to start all over."
11607,Dandy
11608,Addicting.
11609,"Great game! 
1. because its free
2. it introduced me to the Fallout Franchise
3. great time killer (sometimes too great)
4. management game, and surprisingly has interesting and enjoyable quests

I wish there was a way to sync/connect the progress on my steam (PC)  to the android mobile game.
"
11610,"After 9.8 hours of game play this happened; I sent my 3 best equipped fighters on a mission then the game for no reason dropped all my 5 maxed out food outlets to zero output and refused to add more food, then the rats moved in and killed everyone of my inhabitants before my fighters could return.  Then as soon as everyone inside was dead Hey Presto all my food was back to maximum????

Also during the massacre everyone stopped producing all goods so I ran out of stim packs needed to heal my people and the 25 fighters I had left stopped fighting and just returned to the rooms they worked in????

It annoys me that you cannot issue defence commands as soon as a room indicates that there are resources to collect until you collect those resources only by then the enemy is so far inside my shelter that they clog up one room so until I can empty that room of workers I CANNOT add fighters to protect them!!

Another annoyance is when you are about to be raided the game auto locks on your front door for 3-5 seconds, now understand this THERE IS ONLY A FRONT DOOR & NO OTHER WAY OUT!  So sound the alarm yes, however FFS allow me to defend the front gate not wait until they have killed most of my defenceless workers!!

Currently contemplating uninstalling this P2W game?????"
11611,You have kids? This is the game for you.
11612,Paid for some in game items.  Game rolled back 2 days some how now i no longer have the in game items.  Fun game dont give them any money
11613,"Pros & Cons

Cons:
-Unable to choose which rooms get power
-does not start from last save, after a day of NOT playing, all resources go to zero
-I am certain a pregnant mother can fire a weapon, why are they so useless in the game?

Pros:
-Entertaining at the beginning
-Polygamy"

11617,"A great time killer for fans of the Fallout franchise.

I must admit I didn't expect much from this, and the pay to win aspect is definitely apparent. Luckily for the devious, you can easily give yourself premium items for free using 3rd party cheats, and you cannot be banned for it because it's a client based game, not server.

I really enjoy messing around this game in my second vault, but of course I have a legit main one too.

I've played the hell out of this and managed to get a self sustaining and geared up vault with power armor soldiers ready to defend.

It's also a good game for base builder fans too."
11618,"Played for a while on mobile, but then my device was not compatible. This version is much better than mobile, but the default controls aren't very good. Overall, 8/10 stars."
11619,Best game xd
11620,"One of this games that when I start playing I can't really stop (""There's so much to do!"") and am constantly tempted to start multiple times a day to see if some process has finisehd. Toxic if you want to acomplish something in the near future (... like exams or writing a paper or doing taxes or whatever... write a symponie or book... win a climbing competition .. travel the world...). Effective if you have currently nothing else to fill your life with and/or are longing for the sweet numbness of playing a simple yet satisfying game."
11621,cccc
11622,great but hard
11623,"Had it on mobile, but mobile couldn't keept up. Let's hope nvidia 1060 can. The game? It's a great game for casual gaming full of Fallout nostalgia and lore."
11624,it gud
11625,goodfdrtmibgtm/aeklnjnjcskjffrkkkkckmcs
11626,better than fallout 76
11627,"I hate this game.  I do.  Just being honest.  

I got obsessed with it when I first played it, and uninstalled it.  I recently downloaded it again to try achievement hunting and got even more obsessed.

At 70 or so dwellers, I went insane and got all my women pregnant.  I had them all give birth right after each other, because who doesn't want to click on baby faces.  My vault was not prepared for the influx of people.  I've spent the last seven hours catching up, with no chance of rushing safely, 100% chance of radroaches and radscorpians, and 30 lunchboxes. 

Then, the deathclaws came.  Killed forty people.  Now, I'm working at reviving all of them (I'm literally at 99 people, come on) and I'm at 13% happiness.

Don't follow my example."
11628,"It's free and it works.  If you think you'll like it, get it.

Quite a few annoying mechanics that, I assume, are because it's a phone game (having to click rooms to collect resources & restart production, no pause, etc. etc.).  Not my thing but it took me more than 50 hours to give up on it; not bad for free entertainment!"
11629,good
11630,Save game error reported since 2017 at least just erased my 70+ crew Vault. Lost lots of time end effort. Only recommended solution - back up save (apparently ani fix is too hard for developer). Avoid game to avoid dissapointment.
11631,Cool
11632,It's ok.
11633,With 7.1 headphones you can hear where the Mysterious Stranger appears.
11634,"my vault people were weak minded

is all."
11635,"I really enjoy this game but sometimes it doesn't remember my last actions and it's really irritating when I want to select a dweller it somehow shifts and the dweller is placed to an other room. And I have to click into the dwellers one by one to see which weapon they wear.  And I can not list them by their life.
Actually it gets boring especially with the I login then an attack happens. And the dwellers die way too easy. I'm at that point when I don't want to participate when an attack occurs but they still die."
11636,this some good shiz 10/10 would recommend
11637,An interesting survival game. The strategy to survive is fun to play with!
11638,So Entertaining
11639,Bethesda sucks!
11640,its fallout shelter. todd howard is the devil but this game is fun
11641,good game if you like mobile games
11642,if you like the fallout games you will like this but it's not your normal fallout game but it's still a good game
11643,"I put several hours into the game, saving every so often. I load up the game, and my save is gone. Garbage."
11644,"Nice killing time game, but as a veteran player with hours of ingame, i'm daying for new content like more quest or weapon"
11645,"I can‚Äôt get enough of this game 
10/10"
11646,"when theres a shutdown the game erases the last vault you were playing in  even if you saved the game as many times as possible , and many other errors but that one is the worse  BETHESDA should know which errors his game has , this error has been in game since it started"
11647,"Pretty dope, huh"
11648,a good game to kill time on.
11649,"Summary:
The quality of this game is just what you'd expect from a Bethesda game, with Fallout 4 and 76 in mind. It's just as dull, except it's a minigame and not AAA. Developed halfheartedly and without any effort. Just to have something to throw on the mobile market. Anything. Don't waste money on this!

The long criticism list:
- astonishingly idiotic game concept. there's nothing happening and nothing to do, but if you leave the game running and go to the bathroom you might come back to find half your dwellers dead. Reason: they are too stupid to take a stimpack. That's why survival mode isn't necessary more challenging as much as it's more annoying / frustrating
- incidents keep interrupting whatever you do. they take forever to go away and block all functionality
- annoying UI. scrolling or equipping dwellers is such a pain. many animations you have to sit through. informations lacking in some menus, functionality lacking in others. no overview for dwellers you have sent out, you have to scroll 25 pages. maybe this game wasn't supposed to be played on phones, but on smartwatches...
- responds badly to user input. sometimes just nothing happens, if you click on something. sometimes it just keeps zooming in and out instead what you want. buttons aren't exactly where they are displayed, they're offset due to badly programmed 3d, sometimes offset quite a lot. so are rooms. 
- certainly not for PC; more incidents while game is idle, as well as resources empty. if you restart the app, it loads long
- save files get corrupted over and over (3 attempts ended with broken/deleted save, 2 times on phone)
- no interesting rooms (last unlocked ones do the same the first do: generate food. just... more of it)
- bad balance & no progression. You need a rare weapon from one of these lootboxes and it will carry you through the game. at least you can get some for free. Also all this legendary junk, but crafting takes waaaay too long
- out of the 7 stats only 2-3 are required. rest is filler
- utterly stupid dwellers, complete morons! these idiots dont use stimpacks, they don't return from expeditions when on low health (they rather die), they only grin stupidly...
- fights so incredibly very extremely lethargicly slow. they fight automatically, so you watch bored, but they don't take stimpacks automatically, so you have to watch them like a babysitter. every 10 or 15 sec these stupid morons need a stimpack spoonfed or they die.
- bugs (of course)"
11650,Still better than Fallout 76
11651,"A nice, casual game. Can be frustrating at times, but every playthrough will always be different."
11652,"The only available pets are dogs, cats and parrots.
Why not turtles, hamsters, raccoons, chickens, goats, tarantulas?"
11653,One of Bethesda's better games.
11654,"Fallout Shelter is a great game with a huge hangup, that being the fact that it can periodically delete itself from your computer along with your saved game. I have started over four times and I am done giving it chances. Play at your own risk."
11655,"I play this game for a good month and at my peak had a population of about 70 people. For some god forsaken reason though the devs thought more people meant more and harder attacks which I guess makes sense. the real kicker was when I had a deathclaw attack followed up by yet another deathclaw attack. I used all my heath packs on the first deathclaw attack so all my dwellers were badly hurt to near death. The final thing was when I tried to to rush the food because I was low for the attacks and did not anyone else to die of hunger, this was a mistake. I had myself a molerat invasion that swiftly took out my entire vault within minutes. All I am trying to say is that they need to scale back the attacks a bit. I would still suggest you play this game though because up until this event I got 28 hours of free entertainment from this game."
11656,very cool game
11657,"Tried the handheld version before; got bored fast. But my main issue is that you'll have to watch over the game constantly in order to collect the various resources your vault dwellers are generating every two minutes. If you just leave the game to run in the background while you do something else, then your vault faces the possibility of thirst, hunger, or running out of power. You're basically playing a nanny throughout this game until your dwellers produce more babies to increase the vault population (and manpower needed for the various tasks), which can take forever. I'm in the game for hours and the babies haven't come out yet, so the game's pacing is pretty slow to say the least.

Basically, it's your typical sit-and-get-bored mobile gameplay. Many people seem to dig this game enough to give it a pass, but IMO, it works better as a mobile game, when I'm bored out of my ass enough when I'm outside to play this kind of click-and-play game to take my mind off things, not when I'm sitting at home trying to get engaged with a game I can actively take part of.

Also, the random events can get a little annoying, particularly the raider one. I kinda wish there's just one simple button where you can get your dwellers with the best weapon to go after the raiders. What happens is, after the raiders break into your vault, you can send two vault dwellers (there's only enough room capacity for two) to the entrance and fend the raiders off. But after killing one of them, the raiders will move on to another room - but the catch is, you don't know which one they're gonna go next! So you have to sit there like a dumbass before you can send your ""fighters"" to the raiders' next target, which by then they'll have start attacking your more helpless dwellers. If you have plenty of good weapons later on, yes, you can just equip every single of your dwellers with those and this wouldn't be a problem. But early-game like me, and you're fucked, forced to buy those stupid lunchboxes so you can get more and better weapons.

Also, why couldn't you just send your dwellers to attack the raiders' base so that they would stop attacking? It makes no sense at all.

Finally, why couldn't we just explore the wasteland on our own? I don't know if it's a feature that only unlocks later on, but seeing just text descriptions of what the dweller explorer is doing out in the wasteland is a travesty compared to the Fallout games' exploration. Has Fallout sunk this low?

tl;dr: Just stick with the mobile version. It's not even worth it free of charge."
11658,It's similar to any mobile game you played. At a certain point your progress will be blocked by microtransactions and there is at least 1 achievement that requires ridiculous amounts of real money or dedication.
11659,idk why ppl really like this game it's good but SO BORRRRRRING
11660,love it
11661,great  game get it          now
11662,"I've played ""Hustle Castle"" a lot on the phone. This oddly feels the same but still different. Grindish and repetetive game. But overall ok."
11663,"Boring as hell, there isnt much to do, just waiting and clicking basicaly, progress is too slow and nothing really happens. I fail to see how this game has such large amount of positive reviews, maybe because its free and its fallout brand."
11664,"Provides lots of fun, can get stale, but mostly a pretty good tycoon. Although. I do wish the Power, Food, and Water Supply was more sparing."
11665,Casual point & click shelter builder
11666,"this game shall be eschewed by all mankind, possessing a soul untainted"
11667,"Good morning! Vault-Tec calling!

You see, Vault-Tec is the foremost builder of state of the art underground Fallout shelters. Vaults, if you will. Luxury accommodations, where you can wait out the horrors of nuclear devastation.

Must have for any Fallout fan as it's a nice little time killer. That's... everything... Just gonna walk this over to the Vault! Congratulations on being prepared for the future!"
11668,This game is fun and addictive to play...
11669,This game made my forehead taste like strawberries :)
11670,wow this game has so much to offer and sorry if my very glitchy icon disturbs you lol
11671,This game is ok just have to understand some of the stuff.
11672,i eat dog cumb
11673,"This game isn't like any of the other Fallout games, game play wise. But it's a VERY smooth game that has alot of stuff to do, Especially with being able to send Vault Dwellers out into the wasteland and all that.. But I REALLY like how you can go on missions if you have built the Overseers Office, as a Fallout fan I definitely recommend this game! I just can't believe it's free. My only complaint is that I didn't start playing it for PC sooner!"
11674,Still one of the bestestest bestest best best games ever. :P *thumbs up*
11675,I've actually only played a few hours. The rest of the time has just been relaunching the game after it crashes for the 17th time in a row.
11676,"Hello dear community, 

I recently purchased something through steam for Fallout Shelter and I can not claim it in game. The game says ""To access the Store, please enable the Steam Overlay in the Fallout Shelter Steam properties""

I looked all over the internet and nothing works !

What I tried and did NOT work:
Verifying game files
Restarting steam/game/computer
Disabling Bitdefender
Enabling/Disabling steam overlay
Disabling ""Game Bar"" (screen recording on windows 10)

Please help me, I only want to claim this purchase in game, I don't want to give this game a bad review because of the over complicated purchase transactions."
11677,i only have a nice a totally acceptable 314 hours on this game
11678,This game is fun but my save lost 3 time now my last save i play hard way no sex no male only female in shelter is very hard why you do this to me T_T
11679,"You know, I like this game. I really do enjoy it and would love to recommend it to everyone who has no money to spend on any paid games. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it due to the lack of innovation and care given to the mechanics of the game itself. 

For years I have played this game on and off. To start off the microtransaction store was broken for a long time (back when I was dumb and addicted to microtransactions). As quickly as their clumsy team could muster it, the issue with the store was fixed. Ridiculous amounts of money can be spent on the generous amount of nonsense they offer within the store. It isn't as predatory as other microtransaction based games but surprise mechanics are still unappreciated. 

The worst part of it all is that as long as this game has existed the UI and mechanics are still nearly the same as when the game launched. No innovation to make things simpler and/or more fun. This is why I cannot recommend the game. They pooped out a product, as they so often do, and let it die in stagnation as soon as it became moderately functional."
11680,"Disgusting game.
1. If you don't buy built-in gift packages, it's really hard to get through the game, especially the early stage.  But if you cheat, the early stage could be passed smoothly.
2. The disaster system is terrible. Especially the scorpion, it eats your power, moves to another room randomly. It's very hard to defense such disaster even if you got ~20 max level dwellers with RARE level weapons."
11681,Sweet Home Alabama
11682,"The game shoots itself in the head with random bs events that have no other purpose than to drain your resources to force you spend money on it... And you obviously can't modify difficulty settings to your liking, AND devs constantly fight mod makers who actully were the only salvation to this...

Which is sad, the game has depth, and huge potential, if only bethesda actually made a strategy game out of it, instead of mobile money grab. :(
Don't waste your time."
11683,It's a baby i love it
11684,It's very relaxing and fun
11685,"Probably more fun than fallout 4, new vegas, and skyrim"
11686,Amazing game
11687,"Fix the godamm 76 shit already
I wanna see mah boi Sround play it
"
11688,Mobile game that i somehow ended up with 40 hours in. Still better than fallout 76-
11689,"Since 29 Mart 2017 I added this game to my list, so I will play it when I have free time to focus on it as I didn't want just to play it along the way whenever I had time. And finally I had time at my hand, so I downloaded it. But... What is this? Like seriously, I played a lot of similar games, and personally it is one of my favourite genres, but what on Earth is this? I know what genre this is, I know how you should play this game. What I mean is that this looks like mix of ""Neighbours from Hell"" with Sims. Such games should look like this, but I expected something much better and innovative. Plus, green colour doesn't really suit the game, maybe yellow would fit more."
11690,"0/10 OMG NO !!!  It Stinks

Totally AWFUL mobile port that is buggy, and bogged down with microtransactions and  just doesn't cut it on PC. My rig is an 8th Gen i7 @ 5.0GHz (OC) & a GTX 1080 ti, and Fallout Shelter often lags between 4-19 fps (totally unplayable), yet at other times it spikes to over 1400fps - INSANE. Lots of other users have experienced this same nonsense - a few don't - who knows why. Naturally, this PC rig rips through anything else I play with ease BTW.


Initially, the game looks cute & nostalgic if you are a fan of the Fallout series, but the unplayable lag, excrutiating waiting to click one single item, and then wait 5-10min to one-click something else is absurd...B-O-R-I-N-G. The Bottom Line is this: The Game simply was NOT FUN. It feels & looks like a sim-builder game when it 1st launches, but it's not. Everything relies on RNG, & skill has little if anything to do with it. I actually put in several hours, playing multiple vault types, and nothing really matters. Even the 'Achievements' bored me - they didn't seem to represent anything other than simply enduring the game. Mobile Games are for tablets and phones - and have no business on PC.

If you enjoy the Fallout series (and Who Doesn't) - then play Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, or Fallout 4, but this Fallout Shelter is a P2W Mobile Steaming Pile POS clicker. You've been warned LOL - Happy Gaming."
11691,"This mobile game is a repetitive buggy mess, a real time waster."
11692,"I genuinely don't know why I spent more than 140 hours on this game.

Don't do that."
11693,"i love never feeling a sense of fulfillment, if you do too, get this free game!"
11694,good side game
11695,nice easy management game. Last achievement locked behind a paywall otherwise not p2w.
11696,6/10 should be less P2W
11697,"Its good, all my dwellers died first day. 10/10"
11698,It's a good fallout game that anyone can play!
11699,"I hope my dwellers are still alive...

9/10"
11700,"I love this game, Love to manage the vault, The best part for me is reading the Explorer logs and he ventures out into the wastedlands"
11701,"I am a Fallout series fan and I appreciate this little title. Lots of people say it's repetitive. Yeah, so what? This game is FREE, both here or on mobile platforms and It's not supposed to be a game for serious playing hour streaks. It's just a really nice time killer - if you need one. I usually play this when waiting for something to download or before some online game round comes to an end where I died and need to wait or just when in a bus with my cellphone. I don't get the hate it receives.. Just don't take it too serious and you are fine! 

Microtransactions? Please.. You don't need to buy (unless you want to support the devs) a SINGLE thing to play and enjoy this game, the trick with the time change is always there if you need to speed things up."
11702,Gonna keep it short nice game decent concept but once you reach the point of getting noka cola the game just degraded to a point where i rushed the process of getting 2 success and waited still nothing grinded to 100 and 2 dwellers where we could survive deathclaw attacks 10 waves of them not back to back but no one could die had it very well set up and did not make a single purchase to get just straight bored with the something fake saying it can produce noka cola but just produces food and water what sense does that make to call it that and put that in title and room detail at least if it was really doing that i would have keep playing just to see if i could reach the bottom sadly i stopped playing at 14 floors with everyone mostly good guns and training everyone else it truly is just a time waster just avoid it
11703,good good yes yes
11704,really fun for a free game! lost track of time quite a bit while playing....
11705,its awesome and i recommend it to all people
11706,"The mechanism of this game is a piece of trash, for the invasive disaster like radroach, it depends on your mouse speed and accuracy. Hotkeys are designed like to fast open the build menu???? seriously?"
11707,good game.
11708,"Meh, its ok"
11709,Fallout Shelter is a game I always come back to if I'm kind of bored. It's really simple to get your head around and can let you waste a lot of hours on gameplay easily. The graphics and mechanics do fit really well into the Fallout universe and can be a great game to play at times.

11712,"A typical mobile cash grab, down to all the interaction for the sake of interaction. Got to click rooms to collect ressources they just produced because hey, having actual gameplay deph isn't fun, better mundane interactions & loot boxes. Hell..."
11713,"Although little repetitive, but man I love this game nevertheless. Being big fan of Fallout and Fallout 2, this freebie gem is just ""my cup of tea"""
11714,mobile game
11715,i love this game
11716,"Suck's at Data Saving, i played this game 3 days and.. today i lost my vault, well what the hell, i only dislike due data saving, hope i can get my vault BACK or maybe there's a way to fix, now let's talk about the real gameplay, it's a good game, the actual gameplay is nice, EX: You can send people to explore, Quests and more in the the shelter. 10/10 Gameplay, Hope you can fix the Data Saving."
11717,"Nice little Fallout style ""city"" management game. Take care of your Vault Dwellers, send them on quests, send them to explore the Wasteland, and keep your Vault stocked up on Power, Water, and Food! 

You can equip your Dwellers with weapons, armor, and pets. This can further increase their survivability in the Wasteland, thus bringing you more loot!"
11718,im going to strangle bottle and cappy
11719,Good game to have running in the background or if you are just straight up bored with everything else. Not really fun after a while of playing sadly.
11720,"It's a good game to play if you only want 5- to 15-minute sessions. Pretty useful when you're at work and your brain is about to explode. :D Good way to de-stress. You can't push your dwellers though so after a time, it's a good idea to let them be. Perfect for mini-breaks."
11721,Bad game!
11722,"Good game.... Played it on Mobile as well as via Steam. As expected PC experience was better. A little bit of microtransaction but nevee necessary.

Given it's a free to play, nothing bad to say."
11723,Mobilegame for a pc. thats pretty much it
11724,"It's fun but if you leave the game, your vault will go to shit"
11725,The least buggiest bethesda game evermade

11727,Hey look! A free game that's good!

Fallout is a rich universe and this resource-management game allows you to be the Overseer of a Vault. Build facilities, grant jobs, build families, explore the wastes, recruit wanderers, repel raiders. All at the click of a mouse!

[b]Hook[/b]
A storm was coming, and one man was to shelter the last people on Earth: he was the Overseer.

[b]Mechanic[/b]
A side-on subterreanean grid of rock to drill out and fill with rooms, lifts and utilities.
- protect your tiny vault-dweller population
- dig-out and expand your Vault.
- earn caps by performing tasks
- maintain power, food and population
- women bearing children and small children are invicible, however unable to work - so families need to be planned
- occasionally, build a taskforce to go and run a mission into the wastes
- keep the caps, power, food, happiness and population booming as you grind your way through all those achievements
- the game also provides timed-challenges and the option to buy power-ups with real-cash transactions

[b]Accessibility[/b]
- super user-friendly layout
- nice, classic iconic Fallout Pipboy styling
- small avatars and large Vault that requires scrolling to events off-screen can cause confusion
- while no profanity, there is violence - and sex is obviouly alluded too (love hearts)
- graphically looks like a flash game suitable for classic Facebook genre

[b]Delivery[/b]
- a grinding, resource-management game that maintains it's appeal by offering a lot of customisation and variety as you play
- the game would work well on mobile or social-media; it has daily challenges and offers pay-to-win shortcuts
- it is a bit too cutesy to be considered a weighty addition to teh FAllout universe, however it keeps to canon

[/quote]

[h1]Summary[/h1]
[quote]
[h1]Now, it is not isometric nor is it 3D, however it is a solid Fallout game. 
It does have layers of skill to it and is a lot of fun. 
By far the most light-hearted entry into the Fallout universe, but not one to be dismissed. 
A guilty pleasure for when you want a break from splattering ghouls into a bloody mess[/h1]

Pros:
- attractive game-style
- really challenging resource-management game
- plenty of variety
- lots of achievements and all the classic hooks to push players to invest time (and money)

Cons:
- it's one you cannot take too seriously
- the micro-transactions are never too far away, but you can grind through fairly nicely without paying a single bottlecap

7/10: a campy game with a satisfying vault-building premise - better than awful camp-building!

11731,"Fallout was always one of my favorite games i've played fallout 3, fallout new vegas, fallout 4, and the terrible fallout 76. But Fallout shelter is very unique in its own ways the bunker idea and building mode is very nice and the story fits with the other fallout parts."
11732,"Don't bother getting it, There is nothing bad about, it is just SOOOOOOOOOO mediocre and there are much better F2P games out there."
11733,"An interesting city-building game that has some associations with Fallout due to the Vaults and Wasteland. To be honest it's entertaining for the first few days or weeks, depends on your way of upgrading the vault. Right after you become well-developed your only function will be sending and accepting your troops from and to Wasteland for missions. Well, for the fans of Fallout it will be a great mobile game."
11734,"Fun To Play, i'd like mods though."
11735,my game bugged
11736,Very addicting and well made for a free game. Would recommend to calsual players.

11743,I like it.
11744,NICE
11745,Good time killer
11746,"This is a very fun time killing game.  It's pretty easy, and once you've established a well defended dwelling it's just a matter of planning the outings.  It's somewhat addictive but does not penalize you if you do walk away from it.  Sometimes I would keep it ruunning on the PC while I was doing other things, checking to it as I pass by it.  If you actually manage to complete the majority of the timeline quests, it does get a bit 'grind-ish' and ultimately why I stopped playing it."
11747,Addictive! Love this game!
11748,I highly enjoy this game. I have been playing for awhile and go back to it all the time
11749,"Cool game, really enjoy."

11762,Good game i recommend it!!!
11763,"perfect time killer, i love it"
11764,"Fallout Shelter is an adorable ""manage your people"" game.  You take the role of the Overseer and your job is to take care of your Vault and make sure first that your vault produces food, water, and power so that it can sustain the whole vault.  Simple enough at first but then you have to have more power the more rooms you create and you have to manage the look of the vault.  Raiders, radiated cockroaches, and random fires are a tremendous pain in the ass, but i digress.  If you want a game that you can just relax and chill while watching the game go this is the game for you.  Oh and I must warn you this was originally supposed to be a mobile clicking/farming for resources game but on the PC it looks and runs so much better, believe me I know.  There are microtransactions but they are not necessary in the slightest.  I've put 2.5 hours into this game and I haven't put a cent into it and I've already gotten 16 settlers and that includes a legendary one. I definitely recommend this game."
11765,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI love this game‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
11766,...
11767,very fun past time
11768,very good game :)
11769,"I played it on my phone, and I played it on my computer. I enjoyed it on both platforms (but to be fair, it's more fun on the computer)."

11773,"Addictive, with fun fighting segments, and overall better than most mobile games of its type.

However time invested in the game goes punished more than rewarded. Unless you really need something to do, I'd advise you steer clear of the hooks this game will try to force into your brain."
11774,Good for casual gamers and people who love management style games
11775,This is cool game! But i like Fallout 4 more :P
11776,Strangely addictive and i never spent a penny.
11777,Quality Free Game.
11778,pretty snakey
11779,good
11780,"Addictive, fun... but man... fuck that last archievment..."
11781,fun but screw roaches lol
11782,Nice game to pass the time
11783,"cool little afk game would recommend, but me for me personally I prefer to play it on my phone as then I can play anywhere"
11784,Great game Highly Recommend it
11785,"Its Addicting to say the least, in a good way XD"
11786,It's a nice and chilled game to play on the side and check a couple of times per day.
11787,"Its the same game you find in the mobile platform. nothing new, i wish for a mod support."
11788,A wonderful game to play while doing anything else. wooow!
11789,Pretty fun for a extreme phone game on pc.
11790,Free
11791,Fun
11792,Free. Fun. That's it.
11793,Pretty fun and simple. Nothing I would sink a bunch of hours in to but its fun to play occasionally. Would Recommend
11794,great if you got time to spare!
11795,Strangely addictive.
11796,Easy management game that's pretty much completely free.
11797,Meh
11798,"Its a port of the mobile game.  basically a time waster, but a fun fallout themed one.  it's pretty simple and straightforward.  Build rooms to gain resources, train your dwellers to be more efficient at their jobs, eventually send people out to explore or complete quests to get even better resources, expand, rinse repeat.  It's not amazing, but it's fun enough, especially if you are a fallout fan."
11799,Very good casual game to pass time or to relive the fallout series without playing the entire series again.
11800,Great little time waster
11801,Great mobile port if your into Fallout.
11802,"Good game yeah
Gets boring pretty quickly"
11803,gg
11804,Probably better for mobile than PC since things tend to work in real time and I think the people in vaults are dead due to me forgetting to play. :/
11805,Nice!
11806,nice game for chilling. just play daily at the short time breaks
11807,Nice to waste time in.
11808,pp
11809,Its fun but time consuming.
11810,A great time killer with lots of little achievements and harder challenges.
11811,great game
11812,Great game
11813,good way to kill a few minutes
11814,"10/10, although I keep getting raided by deathclaws. .-."
11815,"Very entertaining game. At least for a short while. Things can get a bit repetitive after awhile, but it kept me playing long enough. Definitely worth a shot."
11816,try it its free
11817,amzing game!
11818,great game for the price of free.
11819,Become THE EVIL Overseer!
11820,"Took me about 60 hours to play ""through"" the game, but its still a cool game to play after you have completed it."
11821,Not a Bad Game. Somewhat of a Game i would play when i want to pass the time.
11822,good.
11823,"Good game, just very grinding and lots of time walls"
11824,This game is time consuming and micro tansaction intended 7/10
11825,Good game
11826,great game good time killer.  Always enjoy a fallout game
11827,Really fun and chill game to play.
11828,waste of time but cool
11829,"Sign up today, and prepare for the future!"
11830,"For a free game it's alright, still better than f76"
11831,"Always find myself coming back to this game, be it on Steam, Android or even Switch."
11832,Great game to just sit back and kill time with. Would recommend to anyone looking for a casual experience.
11833,Dont buy anything like lunchboxes or mister handy's. you can hack the game super easy.
11834,amazing with (out ) friends
11835,yeah its pretty good
11836,It's a pretty good game but i reccomed it on a phone cus its annoying to go in the game evryday on the computerüòÉ
11837,The Game has a good overall concept but gets boring after a few weeks
11838,"Lag on mobile, Great on PC."
11839,"It's alright, but God forbid you have a power outage and it erases all of your data."
11840,nice f2p game
11841,Yeah. It's Ok. Nothing huge to be expected from a time farming game if you dont wanna spend money.
11842,"Great! Not so bad for a 2D/3D game, and I'm glad it's based on Fallout!
It gets a bit boring waiting though. I suggest trying to complete your missions/objectives to kill time."
11843,passes the time
11844,Epic game
11845,Great Idle Game if that's your jam
11846,Bruh
11847,"this game is pure time passing goodness wether you like the fallout series or not,
this game offers you an effortless fun with a lot of missions ,items and daily quests so the fun never ends.
in my opinion both experienced and new gamers can enjoy this game as its mechanic is simple yet leavs a lot of room for creativity in creating your own vault.

the only downside in my opinion is the macrotransactions that feels forced and the time you have to wait for quests, in that sense you can feel the game is just a mobile import for pc.

overall i give this game a 7.5/10 and i reccomend it to anyone basically that wants a casuel game that can also be turned into a serious one if so one desires."

11849,Moe :3
11850,good free game recomending it to everyone.
11851,pass time
11852,top kek
11853,Somewhat addictive
11854,"Surprising good, easy to pick up and play and is quite addicting.

Absolutely hate the lunchboxes though."
11855,"What I imagine is a faithful port of the mobile game, onto your computer. I have not played the mobile version, only this one, so if you have played the mobile game, and want more of the same grinding content, then you'll feel right at home. If you want a different experience from what you've already played, this is not it.

You can occasionally meet famous ""dwellers"" (NPCs) from previous Bethesda Fallout titles (Three, New Vegas, and Four only), there are ways to train your dwellers to improve them, and protect your dwellers from harm (Deathclaws, Raiders, and the dreaded Radroach) or send them out INTO harm to get you scraps of military clothing and tape.

It's a desktop version of a mobile game, expectations should be low anyways. Good for killing time."
11856,Good game but forces you to play every day.
11857,Todd bad
11858,yes
11859,This is a good mini-game to have and a great pass time. Would Recommend!
11860,Fallout Shelter : 10/10 !
11861,This is a Vary fun Game.
11862,a really well thought out game
11863,Enjoy building my vaults.  Need to be strategic about how you build and where you build your rooms.  Like a game that makes you think.
11864,God
11865,Great game very addicting
11866,Good game to play on a plane.
11867,"Good game, good to wind down to"
11868,great game to play when ever your downloading another
11869,A fun time burner.
11870,This game p dope
11871,Awesome. Utilizes the stats of an RPG and uses it in a way to make dwellers perform their best and make a successful vault. Really fun.
11872,"Very good game for a free game, I recommend it"
11873,"So simple, yet addictive!"
11874,Typical mobile guff. Full of timers and microtransactions. Everything goes to hell if you don't log in in a few days.
11875,It's exactly what it looks like (ie. a fairly simple phone game) but man is it addictive.
11876,good game for time down
11877,pretty fun game lots of free bonuses from the devs and loads of play time building up your shelter and building your perfect a team of settlers.
11878,"great time killer, recommended for all who likes management games"
11879,Was fun but very repetitive.
11880,great
11881,cool cool cool
11882,gg
11883,"I really enjoy this game, management games I really like to play where I have to take care of something and make it thrive. Like fallout shelter with growing your vault and surviving against the unknown of the wasteland! It is a great game and I really recommend it to anyone who might be like me and enjoy games like this."
11884,dont know how its still fun but it is
11885,the first 30 hrs was fun but it the tasks became repetitive after that
11886,game gets boring after a while. it could be better.
11887,Best game on my phone!
11888,Bingo Bango Bongo I don't wanna leave the Congo
11889,manific
11890,It's ok
11891,Been playing this game on my phone for SO long.. I'm addicted ! Love it well done guys !
11892,"Worth playing. I find this version easier to play, then on a cell phone."
11893,"loving it!
although im trying to manage my vault that eriely name 666"
11894,Very good
11895,odd but fun
11896,Nice
11897,"its cool i guess just not ideal for PC, on mobile its more much practical"
11898,"Mobile game on pc, click stuff, wait, click stuff, wait. Etc. Still kinda nice"
11899,This game is pretty good for what it gives. It is a free game with in game items you can buy which is pretty typical of free games. You are able to send your dwellers into the wasteland to go and find you things to get better loot to help your vault upgrade. I think it is a pretty good game with it being free. Although I have not played this game a whole lot it is one of the games that I can hop on real quickly to do any changes to my vault that I need to then get off. I do recommend.
11900,"As far as time sinks go, its perfect."
11901,Great game!
11902,Love idle games
11903,good
11904,Fun time killer while waiting in ques
11905,"This game has a surprising amount of staying power.  My vault isn't huge but it has almost everything I want it to have, but I still have tons of quests to do, and those are always amusing.  I've never felt like I need to spend RL$ on the game."
11906,yeaaa... pretty good game...
11907,"A great game despite the microtransactions!

Fallout Shelter is one of my favorite Fallout games in that it is something very different, most people would be turned away from microtransaction but 'free' games almost immediately but I'm glad I gave FOS a try!

The game makes it actually much easier to earn premium currency than other games I have tried, which is a huge plus than it just being more of a cash grab to shell out money. I only do pay for these games if I genuinely enjoy them, and FOS is just that!

I am very happy this is also on Steam as the whole closing/opening application on your phone makes it quite hard to keep progress from time to time. The steam version feels much more secure on my progress than the phone version which gives me a relief when wanting to spend USD for more in-game items.

As good as it is as it comes down to the Quest mechanic and storybuilding for myself, I do have some cons in general.

First, I feel there should've been a 'family tree' sort of thing introduced, and to some people it probably doesn't matter but I'm pretty sure you can breed any two adults as long as they are opposite sex and adults, which means inbreeding is possible, while it does not hold any meaning in the game. I also feel implementing it would be a good challenge as inbreeding would cause some problems down the line for dwellers affected by it.

Another thing is progress saves, while it is much less obvious on the Steam version, it still persists that sometimes you can lose progress or things you have done for no reason at all, be it a problem with the game, Steam, or the Cloud. I feel it should be more secure so people spending money on the game itself don't lose the money's worth if their game decides to freak out.

Another thing I think I should bring up is the 'Bottle & Cappy' Quests, which are stated to be 'available for a limited time', which however is false as I remember that quest line being available right when the app came out on iOS. That being said, don't feel pressured to finish it within the 'time limit' as there is none, completing the quests as well is very well worth it for free caps and free nuka cola.

TLDR;

Pros:
- Quest mechanic is tons of fun
- Easy to earn 'premium' currency/items
- Storybuilding for those who like it
- Interesting artstyle in how the buildings/vaults make it look like you're peering into a dollhouse
- Easy to pick up and put down when needed; not a game you pursue hours on end and great for short attention spans

Cons:
- iCloud Save is Finnicky at times earning lost progress or mistakes
- Inbreeding is possible (personal con)
- 'Limited Time' is false."
11908,Spent more time than I should on this game
11909,great managment game
11910,Its free and decent
11911,yes it is very nice
11912,This game is becoming disappointing when they put too many elements into one game.
11913,"I haven't gotten super far into it yet, but so far I'm loving it. It is slow so I'd recommend just getting it on mobile if you can bc there really is no point of playing it on pc. It is really fun though, I recommend you try it if you love the fallout franchise."
11914,I got this for free and i still want a refund
11915,I've played this game A LOT on mobile and I've really liked it! Most of the games in the Fallout series are ones I like. But! I wholeheartedly recommend this game because of the graphics. The style is very reminiscent of the comics and posters in the main Fallout games.
11916,all of it just works
11917,Fun little game.
11918,"What can I say about this? nothing everything that needs to be said has been said it was great on mobile and it's even better on PC, now I'm just hoping they find a way to bring Blades to PC, don't fail me now Bethesda!"
11919,"Addictive and a lot of fun, great procrastination tool. Probably better than Fallout 76 IDK."
11920,good shit
11921,Honestly this is probably one of the most fun management games I have ever played.
11922,Meh
11923,this game is something kinda fun to do on the side when bored. The game does get repetitive after awhile but good for the most part
11924,"Just download this game onto your phone. There's no reason for it to be on PC. It's incredibly slow and it is all time based. Not to mention the overwhelming Bethesda classic, microtransactions. Yeah, it's free but still isn't worth the time."
11925,Played the game on phones and tablets loved it so glad it came to pc too
11926,free fallout game
11927,just get fallout new vegas
11928,great game
11929,"Weirdly addictive in all the right ways. The game starts slow but quickly gains momentum once you unlock certain blueprints. At this point you will soon realise that, between quest rewards and daily objectives, you don't NEED to spend a penny on this game"
11930,free fun
11931,a
11932,Best for killing time
11933,gud :)
11934,"THICC, DUMMY THICC"
11935,Nice timekiller.
11936,Well its good enough to spend some time with... its not a activly played game but i liked to manage my vault.
11937,<3
11938,gud
11939,XD
11940,very fun to play very addictive and its free
11941,A good time killer
11942,a nice time sink
11943,"Oversee and care about your tiny yet active, working and horny vault dwellers as you try to help them survive the perils of the wasteland. Lots of room options, weapons and job varieties."
11944,Great game to pass the time
11945,"Like Burger King Chicken Nuggets, its....fine"
11946,FAT NUT
11947,Objectives of this game is unclear. Easily get bored after 2 weeks of playing.
11948,good for passing time
11949,Simple game with timers that take a while to get going. Its fun for what it is as long as your not looking for heavy complexity. Thou you can find that too if you dig deep enough and are willing to put the time in. Personally its to shallow to hold my attention but it was fun for a few hours.
11950,Still my favorite way to kill time.
11951,"There once was a game called, 'Fallout Shelter'
Which was launched as a mobile people helper
It drained the batteries fast
But could surprisingly last
Unlike the game that came after."
11952,hi
11953,gets boring after a while
11954,Better than Fallout 76
11955,Extremely fun and addictive game
11956,Good fun. Not as heavily pay-to-play as I was originally led on.
11957,Fun and addictive little game.
11958,Nice way to pass some time.
11959,Best Bethesda's F2P game
11960,I like that even years later you can come back and pick this game up.
11961,"Yes. very game, much review."
11962,fun to play while waiting for a friend or you just whant to be layed back
11963,"Such a great free to play game, all the fallout fun wrapped in a real time mobile style game."
11964,i forgot to feed my settlers in survival mode but pretty game overall
11965,I fucking love this game :D
11966,axyenna bratan
11967,This game checks your management skills and your building skills. perfect balance of resource and survival game. I am great fan of fallout series. its fun to watch small references through out this game. There are plenty of missions. various ways for keep tab on your people. Make your population. check on your resources. Very fun game. You spend hours and hours on this games.
11968,You can make your racist fantasies come true and send your most despised race die in the wastes or enslave one of the two genders.
11969,"This game's pretty great! The first thing I should point out is there's optional lunchboxes and such for purchase but they can be obtained regularly through normal play so I definitely love how you can make it just fine without spending money, and perfecting my vault hasn't gotten boring despite all the hours I've spent here as well as on Bethesda's client, which doesn't go towards this one's hours. 

ALSO I'm not sure if this is on purpose but it's really COOL: My vault is available on my brother's account and I think it's just b/c we both use the same PC!"

11971,bueno.
11972,"Lots of fun, there is always something to do!"
11973,"I've been playing this game every morning when I wake up and evening before I go to bed, for the past I don't know how long, 
Without even realising I somehow now have over 250 hours in this game and it's still very enjoyable.
I highly reccomend this game."
11974,good
11975,"This game is free, it fun and I love it. But there some thing that need to be add or improve. I want to player my base on android and my computer but I can't do it :(, now I has to start over again. The thing need to be improve is the damage and attack role. THEY ATTACK ARE TOO SLOW, when ever they are attacking, I just go to the bathroom and later it may doesn't end yet. It need to improve the attack system. It very hard to managing 100 AI and try to seperate with one is  vip and which one is normal. It's very easy to miss click and transport them to other job by accident."
11976,"There's a lot to enjoy about this game if you enjoy management-style games; its not that complicated but given that you can't pause it, it keeps you on your toes. Initially its quite addictive but within a fairly short time you'll realise that the gameplay becomes rather repetitive. It should be obvious to most that the purpose of these games is to make money through in-game purchases but unlike some of the other games I've played where this is the case, Fallout Shelter doesn't depend on these to enjoy playing it. All in all, a fun diversion and the price is right."
11977,<3
11978,"Nice little time waster, too bad the last achievement (collect 20 legendary dwellers) would take forever to get if  you're not paying."
11979,pretty fun casual game
11980,Casual and fun
11981,"Well... What can I say... It's an addictive game. It's not the game you would play to get a complete challenge out of it. But if you're looking for some past time game just to relax. This is the kind of game you need. 

It's not pay to win. You don't need the extra's you can pay for to achieve something. Just have patience at start and well before you know you have a thriving vault..."
11982,Great game. Excellent blend of fallout and tycoon games.
11983,Get addicted.
11984,good
11985,"Good Casual Fun, Had it in my phone, tis a delight to see it on windows!"
11986,ove it
11987,Nice Game for Time pass
11988,Good.
11989,yeah...its ok
11990,ok.
11991,Yes
11992,very fun time waster
11993,"This is a pretty good game just making a base and collecting materials, kinda like a terraria/minecraft type game but its 2d and instead of building you use caps to expand."
11994,it bee god
11995,pretty fun but gets boring quite quickly
11996,Meh.
11997,the only fallout they got right after fallout 3
11998,its a ok game but full of Micro Transactions to make things go faster but Basicly its ok if you got a few min to just jump on and grab stuff send out missions and quit and go do som thing
11999,"It's a fun Mobile to PC port game, if you're expecting anything else more after playing the mobile version you'll be disappointed. its easy to pick up and hard to put down but it does get a little grindy at times, but what can you do, it's a little nudge to get you to buy the in-game microtransaction lunchboxes.

But in short fun, sweet and a nice time waster. 


"
12000,Fun Game
12001,rip steam making me review for summer sale b.s.
12002,"Thank you Kanye, very cool"
12003,I haven't and won't give this game Money but it dose not need it need micro transactions to be playable.
12004,poop
12005,"Simple to pick up, hard to let go. Easy to sink hours into without realising it. Only downside is the waiting for stuff to happen."
12006,Pretty fun idle game coming back to it once every now and again
12007,Not bad
12008,Fun game. Still fun in 2021.
12009,great if youre ok with grinding
12010,"Could use some more functions added in future updates, great time waster at least"
12011,"Very goood game, still fun after being released so long ago"
12012,A fun game to past the time.  Definitely recommend.
12013,"Very Fun Time Killer, Quests Ect Sometimes Glitch But Works Mostly."
12014,Boring not much content
12015,"I'm just writing this because the Steam Summer Sale wants me to write a review.

But it's a good game for a F2P time-waster, and I never felt compelled to make a purchase to progress."
12016,"Probably will destroy my own vault to play from the beginning again.
it's a pretty good mobile port with all the normal pay items (that if you're patient enough about getting, you don't need to fork the dough) involved with such a game. I started playing this on my phone when it first came out but didn't really start digging in, until i found that it was a free game on Steam. 
If you enjoy a little fun a bit at a time, playing this might make you smile."
12017,Fun little phone game that doesn't need you to actually spend money to enjoy and advance.
12018,"Fun game, but quite grindy if you dont want to spend years on building shelter"
12019,cool game
12020,Fun. PC best platform to play on.
12021,A very good game to loss half of your life savings to unlock that new power armor that you will never get!
12022,cool
12023,Great time killer.
12024,"Boring but I still play it, use mods!"
12025,Good
12026,its alright pretty grindy but it gives me something to do

12028,"Fallout Shelter originally released as a teaser of sorts for Fallout 4 here you're in control of a new vault, building new rooms, changing the layout, upgrading your vault dwellers and their equipment, and sending people out scavenging in the wasteland. wery good game if you like building management. XD"
12029,"It's a good game w/ VERY grindy aspects aswell as the usual bethesda Add ons (Such as the Starter Kit), I don't like the level of grind... so bad?"
12030,"Nice game, only reviewing this for the summer sale."
12031,üëå
12032,Best game to play when youre bored.  I've never paid any money for this game and im very successful.  Highly recommend
12033,Better than fallout 76
12034,good
12035,"Fallout shelter is good game, i like it, everyone should play it"
12036,A relaxing casual game of managing your dwellers in spirit of Fallout. At the price of 0.00$ you can't make a mistake by at least trying it out. Avoid microtransations at all cost.
12037,is lit
12038,"Easy free 2 play game - very nice on PC 
far more potent than the mobile version.
Check it out."
12039,Nice game for mobile
12040,good game to waste time on if you got some free time
12041,"Easy game, remember to download save editor and DON'T buy them boxes!"
12042,every time I play it it makes me play Fallout 4 VR :)
12043,yes
12044,10 caps of 10
12045,"Fun game, played it on mobile when it first came out and still have fun with it. Good Graphics, good game play, just good all around. I love the new missions you can send your dwellers on"
12046,bad
12047,nice
12048,A fun little idle game.
12049,Good game to play casually
12050,Fun game if you go into it knowing that it's just a slightly more interactive clicker game. Good for killing a few minutes as you make sure  your dwellers haven't killed themselves while you slept.
12051,Still better than Fallout 76
12052,10/10 accidental incest simulator
12053,Great game
12054,It's pretty fun.
12055,Engaging and quirky real time strat. Well-illustrated take on original Fallout visuals. Layered game-play allows continued play on different difficulty levels - Definitely Recommended!
12056,Best of the best!
12057,Pretty addicting for a free to play
12058,Sure its a good enough game but bugger me trying to get all the achievements takes a long time.
12059,Get boring after a few days and so slow and grindy to play.
12060,I agree
12061,"Great, mindless fun"
12062,It's fun to play
12063,This okay.
12064,good stuff
12065,"Fun game to play when bored.
"
12066,Good game easy to get into and lots of fun.
12067,"Very fair f2p concept, you're not forced to buy anything, you just need patience.
"
12068,nice litlte game
12069,"Still fun to play, I play it from time to time. I do recommend it as great fun if you can't spend hours and hours into game, I have it on mobile too, playing it a lot while traveling."
12070,Great time killer!
12071,‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏î‡∏µ
12072,"literally a waste of time
a waste of money
and a waste
oh wait
i need to gather resources!!!"
12073,"Yeah, I guess I liked it or something."
12074,funny action all the time
12075,"fun, good idea"
12076,Deathclaws are the most annoying things ever otherwise great game
12077,A good game for a casual fun! Vault-Tec's best at your service.
12078,Great game for when you are bored.
12079,really interesting game for busy people
12080,"Witzig, f√ºr Fans von Fallout eine nette Nebenbesch√§ftigung mit lustigen Eastereggs :D"
12081,es muy bien
12082,"good for a free game, spent lots of hours managing the compound working towards getting all my newer people full stats and level up to 50 with +7 E gear on.  Going on missions outside of the compound is a bit boring. You click to enter the rooms then just sit there waiting till the fight is over then click on another room."
12083,A really nice game which you can play passively at any time.
12084,Fun and interesting.
12085,Nice game when you are bored
12086,"911? no, pls."
12087,surprisingly good but takes a lot of patience to play without spending money.
12088,Last achievent is hard to get. :D Of you wanna play without paying for boxes.
12089,"This is the third time I have installed this game. I get burned out on it but after some time passes, I want to play some more. It's a great ""chewing gum"" game! Play it, it's free!"
12090,One of the best games to kill office downtime! ^^
12091,"Pretty much pay to win, but its fun"
12092,This is an ok game if you can't be bothered to play a proper one.
12093,"Its fun for maybe like few hours where you explore the game mechanics and what it has to offer. Becomes monotonous very quickly, and saturates once you have enough dwellers with high stats."
12094,"War, war never changes..."
12095,Surprisingly addicting and fun to play <3
12096,its good
12097,play this doing this for the event :P
12098,ok but not deep
12099,I have this game on steam and on my phone. One of my favorite ways to waste time. Love letting my dwellers explore the wasteland. Fun little game.
12100,...... just a review....
12101,"Excelent idea... play all is possible until end, when all was developed at maximum available.
Hope the game will have an expansion. 
Usually I don't play 2D games, but this one was a little addiction for me. Very enjoyable."
12102,"I dislike playing with mobilephone, but this mobile game ported to PC is actually pretty sweet! Tends to get repetitive, but stays fun for surprisingly long time. Remember originally playing this years ago with some old generation ""smartphone"" and it started to jam up at 20 dwellers and soon crash, damn the thing felt like going up in the air as smoke.

Even though it's a mobile game it has S.P.E.C.I.A.L. spot for me as a mobile game. Good time passer to be had and it's totally free except if you like the whale road, but you get rewards to play game without problems well enough from quests and such.

Think still that controls and selecting character and using commands could have been done better as it's bit hard to hit the spots at points, but when comparing to phone it's still hundred times easier. :3<

Game contains exploration, random events, quests (some with storyline), vault defense, base building."
12103,I had soo much fun playing this game!
12104,"My first game i ever played on my account, good enough, any pc could handle it"
12105,this game is a fun way to pass time.
12106,good
12107,Entertaining and free to play. If you like building things this game is for you.
12108,fun game
12109,"Big Fallout fan, been playing since olden days. This is just a great chewing gum game, and I only wish it were pause-able."
12110,"I still find it fun and you can play the game without micro transcations but you do kinda have to try to get the robots as they will gather your supplies. Also, there are hidden unknown endurance and strength stats for your dwellers. So leveling up a dweller then working him out...his base hit points will be lower vs. having a charter maxed and then leveling him. IE he will ahve more hit points. Gets dull after a bit but still a good time sink."
12111,Better than Fallout 76
12112,"Micro-managing your own lil Vault, with really adorable SD-characters and incredibly repetitive actions.... Is kinda fun for a couple of days when you just wanna brainlessly game"
12113,Addictive little game and the price is right.
12114,"Interesting and fun at first, but the microtransaction grind gets old fast.
Interesting game that starts off solid, but quickly gets old and repetitive."
12115,"It's a pretty good game to waste time on, quests can be pretty fun.

About my only issue is that it's a pain in the butt to deal with radscorpions when they pop up in your vault, but they're usually taken care of fairly easily when managed properly"
12116,Never gets old wish they will give us the online version eventually.
12117,good game i play it all the time on my phone 10/10
12118,"You will spend some nice time playing this game if you chose so. I definetly recommend it , after all 
-It is free and it is avilable on multiple platforms (would be nice if I could sync all devices but hey its allright.)"
12119,A game that is fair with microtransactions but is not overly dependent on them. Easy game to have running in the background as you work and progresses quickly enough to keep your attention. Quests are fun with funny dialogue every so often. Highly recommend using a mouse than a mousepad for laptop users. 10/10 would waste my hours of time played again.
12120,You won't find much of a game here but it's a good daily time waster for 10-15 minutes.
12121,Fun little bunker city builder. I recomend!
12122,Got this game when it first came out. Currently stuck on the last achievement where I need 20 legendary dwellers... Yea its been a while. Fun point and click game.
12123,Still the only free-to-play grindy mobile-style game that I've ever enjoyed.
12124,It catches the spirit of real Fallout. At the beginning at least. After a while it becomes repetitive but I always make up lists of reforms to keep me occupied. Would recommend.
12125,bad
12126,"It's a mobile game brought to pc. Loads of microtransactions and micromanaging. It is a unique experience despite all the obvious mobile game fallacy's. You can build your own vault which is neat. You must keep up with getting electricity, water, as well as food for your dwellers. You can also let a dweller go explore the wasteland by dragging them to outside the vault. That is your main source of items and caps, until you unlock quests. You can get little amounts of caps and lunchboxes by doing little side missions the game assigns to you. They do not give much, because they want to emphasize questing and letting a dweller explore the wasteland. You have to wait a large amount of time for exploring or quests to even start, unless you speed them up by using nuka cola quantum. Which you can only buy with real money, unless you get super lucky and get them from a lunchbox. All in all, it will hold your attention for a few minutes, then you close it out and wait the several hours it will take to get somebody back. It is a time waster in all the right senses, I give it a 5/10."
12127,Pretty Good!
12128,A fun game to just keep in the background and click back to every 20 or so minutes while doing actual work.
12129,Love this game because it is a simple management that I can run in the background as I work. I love that you can eventually go out with you people and explore the wasteland with them as a team. Just a nice chill game to play.
12130,"Started playing this game as an app when it was first announced, the Steam version is just as much fun. I like how the game has developed over time for the most part, though don't find much use in the weapon/outfit crafting rooms, which seem to cost far more than they are worth. Otherwise, I would really recommend this game."
12131,"Another Phone game on PC, its good, if your on the go."
12132,ayayayayayayay
12133,It's good.
12134,can't stop playing even if a mobile game could be much better on PC
12135,"good
"
12136,<3
12137,Nice vault bro.
12138,A nifty little game that is fun whether you are killing time or hyper concentrating on it. Pretty fun but it does get a little stale after a while.
12139,"Easy beginin, hard middle and again easy on end.

Do you want to be a boss of underground vault? For free?

Small advice - train endurance / use armor with endurance always while leveling if possible. The higher the endurance is while leveling - the bigger HP on max level."
12140,"fallout shelter is a fun little game that is very enjoyable, it will keep you hocked and it will make you want to collect all items and fully upgrade your vault.

would recommend 8/10"
12141,"neeto
"
12142,I don't have a phone
12143,"Played it for couple of hours, I think its ok."
12144,"This is a free game I'm pretty fond of, if only because you don't have to buy anything to progress.  I mean, you can if you want to, it's just really not necessary.  It's also a fabulous time waster, as I can lose an hour easily with my 3 vaults.  The writing is also a bonus-- my personal favorites are the flirt lines between vault dwellers (they're a good kind of cheesy) and the stuff being said when a vault dweller does quests alone.  It may not be the deepest game out there, and it may bother some that there's no real end to the game (afaik), but I still think it's worth checking out if you want to lose some time."
12145,"Great game to pass some time. Gets a little repetitive, but overall pretty fun!"
12146,great
12147,Fallout 76 but underground?
12148,A very fun game  once you get into it.
12149,Delivers a lot for a free game
12150,nice!
12151,"Nice game, just writing this review for my achievements, don't mind me."
12152,Amazing game!
12153,Mindless time wasting mobile game. Best played for five minutes at a time. Definitely worth it for the price of $0.00.
12154,Very addictive!
12155,OKAY GAME
12156,Chill game. Only playing for achievemnts
12157,"funny but kinda grindy, and it has tons of ""time-gated"" missions anyway it's a good option when you waiting for the pizza or any 50gb update in any other game, ignore the lootboxes imo expensive."
12158,The best Fallout game we've gotten since New Vegas.
12159,"It's ""free""* & an okay time sink with basic gameplay but uses a lot of timed waiting mechanics that can be mostly bypassed using in game item/s. If your looking for something else/more I would say look elsewhere.

*Uses pay to gain items that can be gotten via regular gameplay."
12160,A very fun game that is great for passing time.
12161,Great time waster
12162,Free. Good time waster.
12163,"Fun little clicker simulator. Simple to learn, but takes thought to master (but not too hard.) It's got a good dose humor mixed in, though some of it you might not get unless you're familiar with standard titles from this franchise.

I've enjoyed playing, and will again from time to time. Nice free game"
12164,Takes too long to do anything;. Can only play for a few minutes then have to wait for several hours for a timed quest.... Feels more like a phone game that you hope on every few hours to update it.
12165,"This is a fun mobile management game. I got about 24 vault dwellers, sent a couple people on quests, and started building a great base.... thats when the mole rats came. They sucked up all my power... like really? Mole rats sank their teeth into the generators like it was a slurpee.  Now everyone is either dead from the lack of medical supplies, or wandering around in the dark.  5/7 would play again."
12166,doing this for the summer sale
12167,"I do throughly enjoy this game.  You can build rooms for dwellers to work in to gain resources to keep you're populous happy and therfore gain bonuses.  You can send Dwellers on quests to retrieve junk, caps in order to upgrade your rooms or make new weapons or uniforms."
12168,"Playtime at time of writing: 35h + ariund 10 more offline.

For a free game and simple time-killer this is surprisingly fine and somewhat addictive.
The graphics are beautifull, lovely and with some attention to details that would suit some more expesive games well.
Theres some minor storytelling from the rich background of Fallout too.

In-game purchases are optional and not required to have some fun.

I highly recommend this!"
12169,I can jump in to this game and play for a bit with no issues.
12170,"Thank you, Todd! My wife also says thanks!"
12171,"it's a nice resources management game, and survival mode really tests your knowledge of the mechanics
i've been playing survival mode and it's like it's a whole new game
And it's free to play"
12172,good
12173,one of the better fallout games lately... and it's free
12174,Nice!
12175,P2W. Its a garbage mobile game on Steam. Still pretty fun from time to time.
12176,Great little time waster.
12177,"This game is pretty fun to kill some time with. Although I got attacked by raiders 3 times in about 20 minutes, I'd say i'm doing pretty well in it"
12178,"Fallout Shelter for PC, March 29th, 2017."
12179,"In my opinion, it's not really worth your time. But if it looks fun to you, it doesn't hurt to try. After all, it's free."
12180,If you remove the worst eliments of this game you quickly realise how unfun it is
12181,I laughed. I cried. It was much better than Cats.
12182,JFF
12183,fun game for killing time
12184,"It's a time sink if you want it to be, enjoyable for a free game. But nothing special."
12185,It's Ok
12186,It's free.
12187,Good time killer. Keeps you coming back to check up on it! Do not need to spend money to play! easy to play and fun. You could also just run it off screen or on 2nd screen.
12188,great game to play with half an eye .
12189,"This is a fun, easy to jump in to game.  The game is great as you build your perfect vault and customize it.  It is fun and filled with little satire moments too.  You even get to choose who ""repopulates"" your vault.  The end game is filled with missions to gain resources so you can continue to survive and gain more loot.  

I continue to come back every few months to check on my vault and check on new updates.  The game is fun and worth playing for fans of Fallout and base sims."
12190,really cool game!
12191,Very fun time waster.
12192,Gets repetitive very fast
12193,yes yes very nice...
12194,"It's alright as a time waster, it does however have micro transactions which can be completely circumvented by save game editors."
12195,"Simples, mas interessante - se voc√™ tiver jogado outros jogos da saga."
12196,I want to know who the brave soul is that put a mobile game on steam
12197,um this is my first time doing this kinda stuff casue you know this lame race steam thingy is going on  i am not looking for spelling errors my grammerly is not connected to this my Gs. But this game is simple fun its more for like people who like app games and dont come here thinking its like skyrim or fallout it short fun and simple. OK
12198,pretty fun time waster.
12199,"A really good game I mostly use for time killing, of course it doesn't compare to the other Bethesda games but still, not bad"
12200,Pretty much delivers what it's supposed to. Fun enough to pass the time occasionally.
12201,"I ignored the game for a long time, but my curiosity finally caused me to download the game. 

What I feel was good: 

- Giving you multiple things to do such as quests
- Training the dwellers 
- Customising the dwellers
- Exploring the wasteland 
- Better rooms to unlock later on, giving you a reason to expand your fault

What I feel was wrong: 

- The incredibly long waiting times for nearly everything 
- Needing to pay for things (although I'm okay with it since you don't need those things to advance in the game) 
- Feeling as if training dwellers is more of a job than a game sometimes 
- Losing my vault due to it being deleted 

Since it's free, I really cannot complain about it. It was fun for what it is."
12202,"Game name should change to ""My First Orgy"""
12203,Good way to waste time.
12204,Fun Free Version of Fallout
12205,good mobile game
12206,Really good game to kill some time.
12207,on
12208,"Fun Game to kill some time.
Doesnt really have an endgame though and you need to buy lootboxes to 100% it"
12209,Awesome!
12210,This is hands down one of my favorite games to play in the morning. Great game by a great publisher
12211,"If you like the game on your phone, you'll like it here.  . .  ..just don't spend any money on it . .. it's really not necessary.."
12212,Nice bit of fun on the side.
12213,"Hours of fun, but does get a little tedious. Alright to return to every now and then (once the original novelty has worn off). Still recommended from me."
12214,Cool game
12215,good
12216,Awesome simple game
12217,really ok
12218,fun game for when you have nothing else to do
12219,Take cover
12220,So simple and yet so addictive. I really enjoy this game.

It is more of a keep in touch once or twice a day-game. Then I forget to play for weeks on end, resurrect my dead minions and carry on as if I haven't been away. Rather relaxing."
12225,Fun to play...
12226,really enjoyed it
12227,war. war never changes.

12229,"It's a well done game and, although you can 'pay to win', you don't need to spend money if you are patient. There's lots of references to the older Fallouts (all the way to the first) and lots of holiday based quests."

12231,I have no life and its fun
12232,"It's feel like unfinished and droped game in the middle of developing
Nice start, empty end game.
I finished it, using bugs, to speed up game"
12233,love this game good time waster
12234,Joguinho pra relaxar
12235,Incredibly addictive !
12236,"Good Game, as always sayed begining is the fun part.its geting hard."
12237,good
12238,fallout shelter so pretty game :)
12239,addicting.
12240,"Always coming back to this game. No p2w/need to pay at all, you can get everything relatively easy by yourself. Very fun to play."
12241,nice
12242,"Don't see a reason to spend money in this game... its not a blatant cash grab, which is nice :)"
12243,Great game
12244,"Quite a fun and entertaining game, very addictive you'll spend a lot of hours overseeing your vault.
There are many activities to do: you can manage your dwellers or send them to quest, etc, and the game is simple enough that you won't mind playing every time you get a chance.

The game is very polished and Bethesda has supported it for a long time. Even though is nothing like a main Fallout games, it has enough of them to be engaging. It's a mobile game, you shouldn't have any problems playing on your computer.

One downside is that the Steam version doesn't seem to get all the events the mobile version does, and sadly saves files do not sync automatically with other versions, you have to copy and paste if you want to transfer your data. Additionally, you can progress without buying anything, do not cave into Microtransactions."
12245,"Fun game to mess around with ,  some times i wish you had more time to just hang out and listen to the funny things they say."
12246,OMG SO AMAZING ME LIKEY
12247,–ü–æ–ª—Ö–æ
12248,"Its pretty laid back and nice, reminds me of Virtual Villagers a lot. Can take months to get a functional vault. Scorpions are annoying though and can destroy your base in seconds, best to play in window and close the moment a scorpion appears. Or your power can be sapped and it will be game over. I once lost a 4 month old vault to a pack of rad scorpions. Bethesda truly needs to nerf them, to make a super enjoyable game, without the nerf patch then its moderately fun. As of the 29th of June 2019 they have yet to be nerfed. Have a great day everyone"
12249,Really fun. Made a big vault.
12250,Fun game to play if you're bored
12251,Fallout Shelter is a good Idle Game with a few extra mechanics.
12252,"This game is alright and i'm glad its free because all you do is click things and expand but it doesn't feel that rewarding. also the game kinda grinds when you get to a curtain point because you vault becomes that good early on, the only things you can really worry about is the amount of caps you have to buy stuff and storage space. so yeah its alright for free to play, and there's micro transactions that aren't outrageous but it becomes pay to speed your progress rapidly. i would say play this game if your bored or like business construction strategy games."
12253,nice casual game
12254,A really fun game to play from time to time. And it is actually playable without paying anything for it. Manage your own fault. A very good free game.
12255,Tiny Tower meets Fallout - I love it!
12256,Good game for killing a time :)
12257,cool game by the way tho
12258,A really good game
12259,"Fallout Shelter is a great game if you're simply looking for an occasional time killer, however if you're an achievement hunter, the game is hideously pay to win. One of the achievements, ""Blast From The Past"" requires you to collect 20 legendary dwellers. The thing is, these dwellers can only obtained from lunchboxes - the games main form of micro transaction. 

Feasibly, the only way to get this achievement is through the use of any number of the exploits and bugs that Bethesda doesn't care enough to patch out of the game.

Tldr:

A good time killer but a completion-ists worst nightmare."
12260,"I just use a file editor and boom, 10k lunchboxes... But don't tell Todd hehe."
12261,10 lunchboxes / 10 toddhowards
12262,"[h1]Fallout Shelter[/h1]

The game is quite an interesting and simple asylum management simulator. We take on the role of the Superintendent and must control the situation in the shelter: happiness, health, satiety and the number of people, their clothes, weapons, electricity for shelter and in general all the welfare of the shelter. (Fight raiders and monsters that they want to take our shelter and lives from our people)
Moreover, in this we have complete freedom. You can really build anything, the only question is whether people will survive in this 'building'...

As our development progresses, new rooms, characters, room customization options and many interesting quest tasks will open and the game will not make us bored, at least for the next 100 hours. 

I really liked this game, because even taking into account that it is completely free, you can open everything in it, nothing really depends on whether you put money into the game or not. It's all about time.

The game is really addictive, the only thing that depresses me - the appearance of being ported from mobile devices. Because of this, it has a kind of strange mouse control, but for me personally. This isn't bothers everyone, but I didn't like it. On this, in principle, the cons of the game ends. 

I advise this game to anyone who does not have money on the account, but you really want to play something interesting. That's what you need.

[h1] Thanks for your attention ‚ù§ [/h1]"
12263,This is my cocaine. So stupid but it still play everyday.
12264,free and gud
12265,"Its good. Like you'll spend way too much money on it, but its good"
12266,"If you played this game on mobile before you are going to feel right at home. It's pretty much a straight port, including the in-game ""mobile"" microtransactions. It's quite fun if you want a game to run on your second monitor but I wouldn't recommend it if you want to really focus on playing. There is no micro-management since it is a typical mobile game. You can play for ~5 to ~15 minutes, send your vault dwellers out for exploration and then wait until your resources are generated again. All in all for a free game not bad but don't expect anything more then a mobile game.
"
12267,"good game
"
12268,"This game is free, so that is a plus.  It will keep you entertained for a few days, maybe weeks, yet you will probably get bored eventually.  I played it for a couple of hundred hours on Android, so I do enjoy.

Like I said, it is free, so no real complaint."
12269,Good timeburner.
12270,"This is a great free game for those who like Fallout Shelter's world and humour but want a little point and click, platformer, for free!"
12271,decent F2P game
12272,Its a game to be played between other games online matches.
12273,"PRETTY GOOD TIME KILLER ... 
 
JUST DONT BUY LUCHBOXES PLZ ..
"
12274,"Played on my phone and on pc as a nice casual game to drop in on, don't expect to get much done by hanging around to play it as a full game, you gotta leave it alone and come back later."
12275,"too many microtransactions, crap game"
12276,"The best game on the App Store, now for PC!"
12277,Just chill
12278,"If your a fan of Fallout, you'll love to just spend a couple hours building your own vault and seeing some of the past characters from other fallout games. 7.9/10"

12280,"Well, I downloaded this game for the sole purpose of getting a boost in the steam race event.
I'm sure some people love it, others may not as much.
Best wishes
Me, the guy who wrote this"
12281,It's a good game to kill time.
12282,so excited with this game
12283,Great game to pass time while having some fun
12284,"Fallout has an interesting world that has a lot of story happening, Fallout Shelter doesn't have a whole lot of interesting lore but it does have unique missions to complete out in the wastelands. Besides building up your vault, sending vault dwellers out, and completing tasks there isn't much to do in this game which is a shame because it is fun. Multiple years after this game came out and it's still enjoyable, if you got a lot of time on your hand it's enough entertainment to kill that time."
12285,Clock changing simulator
12286,Great time waster if you're looking for one!
12287,"Pretty nice game, but not too casual, after a while, your vault basically sustain itself.
now you only have to do is complete the collection, and it's not easy.
this game demand you to give it a lot of time, not very suitable for this kind of game, imo"
12288,"It's a simple and enjoyable fun game.

Tip: Don't get blackout or random PC shutdowns mid-game or else your vault will get corrupted."
12289,"This game is fun, but if you're an achievement hunter, it can be terribly frustrating. The desire to sell lunchboxes outweighs the needs of the many and expect to spend a lifetime getting the 20 legendary dwellers achievement if you're not willing to pony up the dough and pay-to-win.

Other than that little niggle, the game is addicting and will provide hours of entertainment as you torment your dwellers by making them dress up in funny costumes, explore the wasteland, and die fighting deathclaw attacks."
12290,"An enjoyable little idle game with enough heart and flavor that you want to keep playing despite the time restrictions. I don't recommend buying any of the micro-transactions, but fortunately the game plays fine without them. Regular quests and the occasional wilderness loot are able to supply you with the boxes and bottles you could otherwise pay for, giving you something to work for (or you can replace one a day if it's too tedious).

Overall a great mobile game that I'm glad was ported to PC."
12291,Decently fun if you're bored and want something quick and easy to do.
12292,Sometimes I just get re-addicted to this and get on for hours every day for like a week and then I quit.......
12293,Fun casual game but easy to cheese if change your computer clock.
12294,"The Deathclaws are really disappointing, as soon as they arrived and died like common mole rats I turned it off."
12295,constantly crashes and full of bugs. u can lose all your progress by chance. complete bullshit
12296,Pretty good time killer
12297,0/10
12298,Its a good time grinder but I wouldn't buy lunch boxes since that micro-transactions from a mobile format

12301,"Good, nothing to say at all!"
12302,Super fun game!
12303,Dead.
12304,This game is more fun to play then Fallout 76.
12305,"Although I still play this game sometimes, I can't recommend it. It seems better suited for mobile. On PC I can't tell when it is counting time and when it is not. Sometimes  I don't play it for like, a week or so, and when I come back I notice that some vault dwellers haven't arrived from their mission..."
12306,Love it

12310,I play this when I'm too scared to go back to Fallout 4 Hardcore mode. Definitely recommend.
12311,its alright
12312,less pay to win then fallout 76
12313,nice
12314,It's a good game. Could it be better? Of course. Is it full of in-game purchases? Definitely. It's still one of those mobile games that's on the better side and still works fine as a PC game. Good thing it's free though. No way it's worth money. At least anything more that $5.
12315,good for having in background
12316,easy and nice game
12317,its fun to every once in a while just sit down and play
12318,better than fallout 76.
12319,Good work Bethesda.
12320,"trashgame... spend too many hours and money.. but the saved world get bugged and cant play anymore gg

stupid developers why dont you care about these bugs?

steam should ban this game"

12324,üëç
12325,I like the game but I can't play 24/7 if you have nothing to do ever this games for you
12326,"Fun to play as a time-waster.  Whether on PC or Mobile, you don't need to purchase anything.  Get a group of peeps to leave and explore as soon as possible.  Also be deliberate about adding the rooms that give your dwellers more stats (Strength, Endurance, Intelligence first).  Maxing out the peeps before you change them will make everything easier.  Only make babies when you need to fill rooms.  Keep upgrading to send more people out (the maxed S/E/I with weapons that go with their stats)."
12327,Good game this is. Recommend I do.
12328,this game is really fun exploring the wasteland and building your shelter
12329,make babies
12330,"This game reminds me of those Facebook Mobile games. It's addictive, and can be both fast and slow paced. Its great to log in and play for an hour or so each day. Early game play is much more engaging than later on when your vault is full, but it's still a decent game. I'll forget about it for weeks, then I'll remember it and get back into poking around. I've pretty much run out of quests, and have been crafting to complete my collection of items. the graphics are cartoony, but that's just fine for this game.

I give it 3 out of 5 Stars."
12331,What kind of fuckn game progresses while your away but still requires you to save.
12332,cool game
12333,"Game is too slow, it's designed in a way for you to almost force you to pay just to advance the game. Also my game has a bug that if you start the first quest, it stays zoomed in and the tip window stays there. At that point I just uninstalled and quit. Would have been a bit more fun to play if the bugs were fixed and it wasn't so focused on micro-transactions without having to wait hours or just put it on for five minutes, shut it down and get back to it an hour or two later and just do that constantly."
12334,amazing 6/9 would try again
12335,Great time killer and it's free so what can i say?

12339,"I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game, and no, not because it's Bethesda. :P

I absolutely love the base concept of the game, and when everything is going smoothly and totally under control, I'm content to just sit around for hours ""playing"" the game, doing quests, sending out teams to scavenge the wastes, and so on. I enjoy the ambient sounds of the vault, too, though some of the sounds of other things--I'm looking at you, ferals--aren't so good. cx

The trouble I have with this game starts with the early game. It's free to play, sure, but they strongly encourage you to buy into their microtransactions by throwing some tough stuff your way before you're necessarily ready to deal with it (I mean if every vault started with a compliment of Fat Mans and Gatling Lasers to give to your dwellers then maybe it wouldn't be so bad, but you have to go find those or find the junk needed to craft them, and you can't even start crafting until you reach a particular number of dwellers in the vault, and it's not cheap). Not to mention the constant nagging that I have ""low storage space"" (dude I have 250+ free slots, go away), though that's more just a minor nuisance.

Overall, I feel the pros do outweigh the cons, although I definitely need to stress that microtransactions are deplorable and, as much as I enjoy opening lunchboxes to see what I'm gonna get, I strongly recommend -not- buying them, especially when they're not on sale--$14 for 40 is still bad, but it's better than $30 for 40."
12340,This is a bethesda game. There are gamebreaking bugs.

12344,"[h1]Review[/h1] 
I personally dont mind these grinder, afk type of games aslong as they offer fullfilling gameplay. Fallout shelter is just a mobile port and it definetly looks like it. But i really like fallout so i gave it a shot.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
Fallout shelter is more of a mix between a management game and a afk grinder game. You basically come back every day and click on everything and it makes these nice sounds and fills up your bars and gives you some sort of progress. You can build downwards into a mountain and upgrade your basic rooms. There are around 24 rooms aviable And they deliver various goods or services to you. You train your citizens or send them on quests to gather items so you can defend yourself against random attacks from invaders.

This is already where the negatives come. There isnt much to strategically plan. You cant fortify your base really, the waves of monsters are devastating in the beginning until you find out that the monsters strength gets higher the more dwellers you have. So keeping your vault pre 24 and 49 dwellers is a key goal and basically one of the only few ways to really get progress in the game. They only start to be annoying but not something that is a threat. So you treat the game as an idle game by setting all unneeded dwellers to training .

The ui is at times terrible you constantly missclick and there is no viable method to sort your citizens and send them to rooms they fit best to work in. Its a real hassle but the idea behind the whole managament system of a vault isnt bad. It starts out really fun but as soon as you are having a couple of weeks into the game you find out more things that bother you.

During quests you traverse trough buildings and only click on loot while in combat you can barely do anything except target specific things or click at the right time to get a critical hit.

The whole gameplay isnt bad per se its just a bit underwhelming and only in the beginning kinda complicated. 

Also if you see achievements as part of the game, have fun unlocking them without using sam or adding (lots) of lunchboxes to your game as one requires you to get 20 legendary dwellers. There are like 22 in total and they dont stack meaning you have to probably open over thousands of lunchboxes to get all of them.

[u]Story[/u]
Yes the ingame quests even deliver some sort of story with minor dialogue choices that mostly end up in two outcomes but can offer some hilarious stories or dialogues. Its definetly not on par with new vegas jokes but its not bad either.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Great artstyle that doesnt get old. Looks good on the phone and looks good on the computer. The game is very stable but it can be annoying that it kinda paused/reloads if you did something else like browsing youtube videos for a while.

[u]Sound[/u]
Battle sound effects are pretty poor but the rest is pretty neat. Especially gathering ressources is pretty fullfilling.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
I dont really recommend this game since it does offer interestening ideas but as a managament game having bad ui and oversight over everything it totally kills the game. Its just overall lacking in many things and thats sad because the game could have been so much more but in the end its just a borefest to grind out lunchboxes in order to 100% the game.

4.5/10 Below average"

12346,good gayme
12347,"TL;DR;
5/10 - Good idea, too repetitive
A game with some good mechanics, based in Fallout Franchise with too repetitive and long gameplay.

Is not a really bad game, but after you reach some point becomes so repetitive, is graphically correct themed with fallout like drawings nucacola and other stuff that makes fallout a fallout.

Dont get me wrong, I spent lot of fun hours, but honestly I think you should use your time with other game.

Isn't free to play, is free to wait."
12348,"It's a fun little game and it's free!
It has cloudsave so you can always get back to your vault after a break.

I would recommend NOT to buy lunchboxes.
If you are an achievement hunter, don't bother.
They put in an achievement to get 20 legendary dwellers in your vault.
If you don't want to pay to win this would take more hours than the game can offer in gameplay.
example: I have 90 hours of gameplay and 2 legendary dwellers
It's a free game, so it's normal they want to encourage you to buy some stuff. But lunchboxes bring you legendary dwellers very randomly and apparently very rarely. So don't waste money on that.

If you remove the needles limitations the game sets to make you buy lunchboxes, the game is great

I'd buy the game for 10 bucks, but not the lunchboxes : - )

Data on my computer is my data, change my mind"
12360,"Imagine this:
You are playing a good game, this game has micro transaction but for the most part they aren't intrusive.
This game plays well with a theme that is very pleasing, sticking with the style of Fallout
You spend hours on this game, investing lots of time and money into creating the best vault humanity can thrive in.
Very smooth gameplay

BAM, out of nowhere this game just deletes your save file, all those hours just POOFED out of existence.
You are crying now.
Fix this Bethesda.
Seriously."
12361,"After having a fully built vault with 171 vault dwellers (who all had the best working outfit and a weapon with 20 damage or more), I'm pretty satisfied with the overall experience. Fallout Shelter is a idle game you can play for hours, or just minutes. If you make tactical descissions, you pogress over time. It gives you the experience that can last for months. I must say that sometimes it can get pretty difficult and sometimes the progressions feels pretty slow.

Anyhow, would recommend."
12362,Definitely a fun addictive game that incorporates one of the greatest game series ever made into a simple game with a good interactivity.
12363,"I'm very disappointed.
The game was fun at first, but over time, what was amusing in it became a torment. e.g:
- mysterious stranger show up almost always when someone is attacking your vault
- constant attacks - my personal record -> 3 times in ~1 min. (u cant prepare for such thing)
Camera work is very annoying, when you trying to protect your dwellers from death by using stimpacks. Oh! There is remedy for that - You can zoom out! But try then click on this F**** little dude while he or she is moving.
Some one can say: ""but there is stimpack icon above their head, you can click on it"" - Yes! It is! But it do not work properly. I've lost half (3 of 6) room squad because of that. clik clik clik and.....he dies FU*****.

I love fallout uni. But this is an abberation...

....and where the F**** are supermutants?

12366,Honestly I didn't play any Fallout Games before but I kinda know what's it about. I wanted to try the game and I played 8 hours in same day. This game is so fun to play. It's simple but quite addictive. So I really like it and recommend. :)
12367,"Sure, it's a timewaster but boy howdy is it addictive"
12368,"Very fun 2d mini game. After getting into the later levels it gets pretty repetitive. A pattern starts if you dont want to do micro transactions in game.  Send your people to a quest and log out. Hours later log back in, complete the quest, and send them home. Log out, rinse, repeat. Youll get several hours of fun game play out of this game before you really notice the slow down if you dont spend money. I would recommend at least playing it until that point or spend money on the game to continue the consistent fun when you get deeper into the quest lines."
12369,"Game starts off with a relatively fast pace initially, and noticeably slows down to a grinding halt after you've sunk a couple of hours in the game; follows the standard mobile p2w model where to progress quickly, you can rush things with premium currency or spam loot boxes. Game is alright overall as long as you don't buy any premium currency or lootboxes; those things are a total waste of money. It is designed to be mostly a passive waiting game after the initial boost so don't fall prey to that temptation."
12370,"I honestly thing that this game could have got more and better updates so it won't have to be so repetitive. If even this gets to be seen by the devs i would like em to see this post on the fallout subreddit with my opition on this game:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/c0bz6o/i_honestly_think_that_fallout_shelter_should_have/"
12371,this game is good to play but it has crashing problems
12372,"ok

12373,"savegames suddenly delete themselves. I pity the fools that spend any actual money on this game, just to see their progress vanish."

I recommended it"

12379,No
12380,Hey it's  fallout shelter on pc. If your expecting anything more than what the mobile version has then you'd be disappointed. However  if you just wanted to play fallout shelter from the comfort of your computer chair and on a screen bigger than your phone than you'll have a great time :)
12381,"This is how you let your players wait, before the next big game comes out. With a free high-quality mobile app.

oh wait



it is"
12383,I play this game fingering my self. ever since i have played this the fingering has become so out of control that Rebecca took the kids. But why have kids if I could have pleasure. 10/10
12384,"Excellent time killer, you can either log in, send dweller to explore or a team on a quest, colect your resources and logout in a matter of minutes, or stay in-game for hours and mess around."
12385,"Some rules for playing:
 - don't buy lunchboxes,
 - don't lvl up dwellers with low endurance (give them armor with +E first) - they get additional hp based on endurance they have when lvl up - making their E higher later or giving them better armor - doesn't work retroactivelly!
 - don't buy lunchboxes,
 - special dwellers from lunchboxes are useless in later game - they have already high lvl and even when you increase their endurance and give them best armor when leveling up - they will still have not enough hp,
 - don't buy lunchboxes,
 - if you have ruined couple of vaults - and you know how to run your vault - start new game and wait for first launchbox - if you have armor with +7 to endurance - you can continue. If not - erase vault, start over - check first launchbox... (repeat for next 10h if needed - it's worth it),
 - don't buy lunchboxes,
 - don't buy lunchboxes,
 - don't buy lunchboxes.

Seriously - lunchboxes are quite useless. You have to be out of your mind to buy them for real money.
Beside that - great time killer."
12386,"pretty good game, the amount it markets to you is a bit exsessive though, I would expect fo the amount of marketing it gives to drop after it transfers over to a PC platform but it still is trying to sell you stuff either way its a unique game that still has the old style of fallout weapons"
12387,"I loved playing the game its better on PC than it is on the phone.  You can have fun and play the game without paying for microtransactions.  If you buy microtransactions and then for some reason you lose your save file you loose all the microtransactions that you bought.  So if you do buy microtransactions make sure you backup your save file.
I still love this game.

I rate it 8/10"
12388,"A very fun free game. Can get repetitious after about 50 hours or so, but had alot of fun building my vault, venturing into the wasteland, and meeting all the new people there are to meet/kill out there. Many weapons and outfits to find and create to make your vault stronger to defend against attacks from raiders, feral ghouls, and Deathclaws.

if your going for the achievements, you should get most of them. The one that is the most challenging, and the one I stopped trying for, was to get 20 Legendary people. After 125 hours, I got 6. 3 you get through doing the quests that become available after you build the Overseers office, and the rest you can only get by collecting lunchboxes. I have collected 163 of those, and only got 3. Sooooo....

Was fun while it lasted and from what I hear, this is better than Fallout 76 LOL.  If you haven't tried it, but like the Fallout world, give it a go. Not super exciting, but does get addicting. Happy hunting in the Wasteland."
12389,Just like fallout but you have shelters
12390,"Worth Loading and Playing - This is a fun game, eventually it get a bit redundant but then you can check back off an on as well.  I also love the fall out lore and feel.  It be an improvement to be able to automate and increase the number of available raids as an example.  Also perhaps additional content and game type scenarios for long term players.  Also it be nice to have the ability to completely revamp your colonist such to change men to women, also to do a complete make over if desired.   Perhaps you could even add turret and robots to protect your shelter as raids to your shelter get harder and more frequent in nature.  Things like that to keep it fresher and more interesting long term."
12391,That looks like my house
12392,can not be empty
12393,"Update. The devs have fixed the issues i had with the game. I have started a new save and I am now enjoying the game. All the timers are annoying but hey it's a mobile game at the core and it's very pay to win as is customary. They have added a little bit of new content aswell. Would be nice if they did a mini-dlc or something though, adding some more weapons, equipment and missions.

Old review:
I cannot recommend playing this on the PC. The port from the mobile version is poor. This game gives me bluescreens every now and then. Up until now it was fine just rebooting the computer but after the last time it happened my save is gone! 
I also bought the starter pack for this game. That's completely wasted money now.. 
Won't be playing this on pc anymore. The game is entertaining and all but why play something where your progress can just vanish after putting 23 hours into it? I advise everyone to stay away.."
12394,"Took me 10 hours just to realize how to produce babies, maybe it's because my lack of sexual experience"
12395,"It's very time consuming and you gotta be patient to play and enjoy this game.
"
12396,"Best game in the world, just it '--' *IRONIC COMMENT*"

12400,"I keep coming back to this game, it feels like the old days with my tamagotchi where I always had the urge to do better and better. 
Great game and easy to install/uninstall. Fun to play while at work or school when you have a bit of free time on your hand."
12401,loved it 10/10
12402,tbh absolutely shit. Best mobile game though.
12403,LOVE IT
12404,"A prime example of how bad of a company Bethesda now is.

-Pay to win garbage
-Microtransactions
-Gambling
-Incredibly long wait times in order to motivate you spending money on this shit
-Can get really fucking boring at times
-Next to nothing to do at times, forced to close the game and wait
-Windowed mode is a fucking pain in the ass

I've never spent any money in this ""game"" and I never will, it can be enjoyable at times, but that's about it.




A final message from someone who absolutely loves Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas:
Fuck you Bethesda, you're not getting anymore money out of me."
12405,"If you don't spend money, deathclaws will come and eat your friends. Like all pay to win games, Fallout Shelter is a great time if you turn on cheats. It's built to make spending money feel rewarding, so opening lunchboxes without spending money can be pretty cathartic. The game as it is intended is predatory and terrible. Do not play this game if you do not intend to cheat.

One poorly timed deathclaw attack made it impossible to recover my vault. My resources and defenses couldn't stand against the waves of attacks that followed. It's a shame that an otherwise enjoyable game is built to motivate the purchase of more lunchboxes, with the additional dwellers, items, and resources they contain. Although the game is [i] possible [/i] without participating in microtransactions, spending money makes the game a good deal easier. I personally don't enjoy having to bash my head against a wall in order to advance in a game that discourages playing for free. Of course I also suck at resource management games which colors my opinion, but the game's difficulty is motivated by a commercial need for severe resource scarcity rather than by some artistic decision about game mechanics. Even though some people may end up enjoying the game, my recommendation remains unchanged. I don't think this is a game that curious people should pick up because of its major flaws as another in the long line of mobile cash-grab games. And that's a shame because it has some charm."
12406,Awesome free game to waste your time on. Modern Farmville.
12407,it is fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love it!!
12408,Chill game to play and it realy got you!
12409,"Don't play it.
Every aspect of a gameplay, whether it be, managing colony, combat, or craftring\iteming... is so shalow. You will get bored after day. And the guys who made this knew this. So the games sprinckles here and there few ""time walls"" wich preverts you from progression and the only thing that u can do is close the game.
I have a better suggestion. Just don't even instal it."
12410,Love it! It's incredibly addictive and I cannot stop playing.
12411,"
Bethesda exclusive falloutshelter 2 (online) for the chinese . you traitor"
12412,Fun little free game.
12413,I recommend this game 100%
12414,"I loved this game for about the first year it came out, but then they added a lot of really annoying micro-transactions and ruined the game. It is still free but now I'd say its not even worth that. Bethesda congratulations on ruining a great mobile game."
12415,"this is a very unique take on the Fallout franchise, instead of being a survivor or a rebellious vault dweller, you control your own vault. but my question . . . what social experiment are we told to do by Vault-Tech? every vault has a secret . . so what's yours?

Not a serious question, but the game is fun, not really a game, more of a toy, made for mobile phones obviously, but i much prefer the accuracy and efficiency of PC's, which, im glad, and mad, that it's out on pc, it seems like one of those quick cash-grabs, but it's genuinely put together well . . . overall, i'd give it a 4/10"

12417,very nice
12418,Everything was going well until a Steam update. Most of my people were LvL 15  and we were all very happy. Computer reboots and 12 hours of my life was LOST. Very sad. I feel disheartened and am reluctant to start anew. </3 Zero vaults found in the vault list despite saving several times.
12419,"You find yourself being encouraged to load this up every day.
I don't play games that dictate when I should play. I certainly don't play games that penalise me for not doing so.

Game is actually quite fun. Until you have to instead of want to."
12420,i rlly just wanna die
12421,7.4/10
12422,"Constantly deletes your data for no reason. It's not just me. Several players create a vault, put several hours into the game, and then one day when they log in, just like they always have, your data just isn't there. Your entire vault, your play through, and even your in-game purchases are all game, and I promise that you will receive zero refunds. Even though the issue is 100% on them. Pretty ridiculous. I've had two vaults spontaneously delete now. Save yourself the trouble."

12425,"i know its just a ""feature"" , but could you please stop those fucking random deathclaw attacks? - from a lore sense, why would fucking idiot clawlizards attack an underground bunker? secondly its just annoying if you try to manage the shit out of ur vault and while you do that you have to stimpack-spam half of your vault population (as if deathclaws would be a real threat as they ALWAYS leave the fucking room before they kill anyone - its just fucking annoying to have dwellers with uneven health bars) and CANT DO ANYTHING ELSE but watch those stupid ass lizards run around aimlessly in ur vault. 
those fucking ass lizards dont even make an impact in a late game vault because you have resources en masse, so it doesnt harm you if they steal/eat (or what the fuck ever) some of your energy (?) and every single one of your dwellers just rip them apart with their OP-gatling lasers like nobodys buissnes and they dont even have the chance of dying to them, since they are all lvl 40+ and have HP to tank 3 of those attacks at once. 

how about a behemoth attack, bethesda? its not like you dont have your stupid-ass lootbox gambling in this game too...
- but i understand why you dont care about your mobile game fallout clone anymore, since your last one, the 76 one, was THE BOMB and the whole gaming world loves it. hahahaha

12434,definitely give it a try if you havent already.
12435,"Fallout Shelter is free to play except for the fact it constantly tries to persuade the player to buy ""pay to win"" advantages you may receive upon purchasing lunchboxes. The primary game play runs on a loop which is easy to grasp - as new people are born or recruited into your vault, you have to dig into the mountain to create living quarters for them to sleep, as well as water treatment plants and cafeterias to manufacture their food and water, and power plants to keep all these factories running.

Fallout Shelter is best in its early stages. When your vault has developed itself strongly, all fear of failing and thus the fun will quickly vanish. Combine this with the absence of persistent long-term objectives, and you experience it for a few days, but it does not have long-term appeal. I still recommend playing this when you are burnt out from other games or looking for something easy to put time in."
12436,Ok time killer.  Would be better if it was multiplayer in some capacity.

12451,"Good game, Very Farmy but over all not to bad of a game, its fun to just watch your vault get attacked and see how well they can hold off the bad guys of the wasteland, 11/10 better then fallout 3"
12452,"Yaas very neat game, 
played it since it first came out also my first time playing a fallout at all. well, I thought it was till I looked fallout up, bought 3, new vegas, then 4, when it came out. After realizing all the games were dope, I purchased fallout 1, its expac, and 2. Remembered I had played them when I was a kid and was just that much happier! 


-----------------------------------------

if you didn't ask i'll tell ya fallout 76 sux like a cash and grab btw"
12453,You ll enjoy this game after gridding for long time to get many characters whit full stat
12454,"I love this game!!! I first found it on my phone then i found it on my pc. The game has so much to offer 
"
12455,"fun little idle game has quite a few problems more so than on a touch screen such as the UX having big hit boxes for things and big borders.
sure it has micro transactions but they are not invasive and obtaining the free loot box type items is basically the goal along with building up your vault and getting all the best stuff and completing all the quests played it quite a bit and made it pretty far already using my knowledge of when i played it on my phone before i deleted it due to the heavy battery drain but i am concerned there will be a point where i might complete the quests and have nothing todo but sending settlers into the waste land and mess around with the random generated quests that i already am seeing quite a lot of reused setups and repeat quests that have little flavor after the first time you see them."
12456,A really great strategy game! 10/10 :D
12457,its a noice game

12459,"One of the best free to play games I have ever played. 

Uses all the lore from the Fallout games...thankfully not Fallout 76. So if you enjoy the story of previous games, chances are that there will be a nod to it in this one.

The cartoon graphics are charming, but also have a hidden depth. When you put 3 of the rooms together and upgrade them completely, there is a lot of depth that goes into the animations. *Oh and make sure you click on the ""Stranger"" (guy in hat and trenchcoat) that periodically appears. Drops lots of useful caps. Appears every 15-20mins*

Send dwellers into the wasteland to level them the fastest. The quests are fun, with daily, weekly and special event quests. Also the game is completely free to play, no need to buy anything...unless you want to get all of the achievements in this lifetime. I am stuck on the Legendary Dwellers. They come from quests and in the lunchboxes. The lunchboxes can be purchased or found during quests. 

All in all this is a brilliant game, highly recommend you give it a go if you are a fan of the Fallout series or if you enjoy management games."
12460,"At first this game is an apparent 2* piss poor mobile game. Once you get to grips with the pace of the game you realise it's the best fallout game. I'm not even joking. 5* masterpiece. 

Ensure you find and use the editor rather than buying lunchboxes!

What I like to do is use starter packs to build and populate a complete vault, then switch it to survival mode and let decadence take effect until only a handful of dwellers are alive in the wasteland, then have them return to begin the role play of a crew who find an desolate vault. 

."
12461,reeeeeeeeeeeeee
12462,"It's not that I don't recommend trying this game. Have at it, if it sounds interesting to you. It's free to try, obviously. The problem I have is that the game leads you to either wait around and deal with constant problems to fix, or pay money to get around waiting. Honestly, I feel the game would be better if it cost money and skipped on the pay to make it less painful tactics. I hope they make another game like this that just gives you a cost up front and then lets you enjoy playing the game."
12463,just love it
12464,"Pretty entertaining early on but like all f2p+mobile games it pushes a timegate/lootbox grind onto you pretty early on, and seems to actively reduce the odds of you finding in anything useful in lootboxes (IE lunchboxes) after the first 4-5 rapid fire ones you are given in a new vault. it can still be pretty fun early on, but after about a hour of playing it devolves into something you pop into for twenty minutes a day to collect resources/do a quest/recall people from wasteland/quest and then log back out till tomorrow type deal.

Its okay to play, but strongly discourage people from giving into the lootbox gambling."
12465,"This was an amazing game. My goodness, is this fun to play. No wonder it was originally designed as a mobile game because (like usual Bethesda titles) it's addictive as s**t. It unmistakably has that mobile game feel. The whole 'wait three hours for this to finish' stuff which isn't so bad but also the whole 'or finish now by buying this thing that will speed it up and give us your money and credit card details'. Honestly, if you download a free Bethesda game; you get what you paid for. And they need to make their piles of money somehow. I guess. Not that I've given them a cent for this. It's by no means necessary, which is good. Otherwise, I probably would have given up.

The game has a cool combination of 2-D player models on a 3-D background, which I really liked. It has galore of references and winks to previous games in the Fallout series which I loved. It was so cool even if I didn't understand a good chunk of them. Fallout 3 references I got the biggest kick out of. I will admit it does control better on PC than the mobile version. But you seem to get much better luck on mobile version with the loot crates...huh. It does feel great to play and it's so much fun...but not without drawbacks.

As I said, free game - you get what you paid for. Dear heck. The animations and model can be really lazy. As in, just re-colour but mostly just re-use the same models for everything with a different name. The arms of dweller tend to clip through themselves and if you look closely their guns tend to float behind their hands(which they don't even attempt to hold anyway). Your dwellers are pathetic as. It's hard to tell if they're just super weak or if the enemies are jacked on roids or something. Stimpacks do seem to be much much stronger than ever in this game (which is probably to compensate the paper skin and cardboard bones of your dwellers).

The pathetisism is only made worse by how OP the rad scorpions are now. Geez, they're an absolute menace! Only in the vault. In the wasteland they're quite different. What? Yeah, I'm not kidding. The death claws are complete midgets now. Like, seriously. My dwellers might be taller than them. Huh? Kinda weird how a fifteen ton (or whatever) weight vault door powerful enough to withstand a nuclear explosion can't stop a small group of angry monkeys that have leprosy. Also known as Ghouls. Don't even get me started about how annoying it is to heal your dwellers when anything and everything busts through your sheet-metal vault door to kill everyone. It's so unresponsive! My dwellers keep dying like morons because I have to sometimes click three times to heal one dweller. And the buggers keep running around like a headless chook when I'm trying to heal them and they just drop like flies. Freaking heck. Speaking of unresponsive: F**K THE MOBILE VERSION! It's so bad! It's controls are so unresponsive I can't do most of anything. I just gave up on it after a while because I was sick of it's s**t and the PC version is better anyway.

The mission most of the time don't even make sense. On multiple levels. You don't even have to stick with the requirements some set when you're on the mission. And the buildings all look the same. They're all just 'copy and paste this here and that there'. Ugh. The combat is completely different in the Wasteland and in the Vault. Outside it works pretty understandably: someone attacks then someone is hurt. Simple. In the vault: don't need to attack, everyone gets hurt by everything. What even? Why are they even different? Why? The was the camera forces you away can be really annoying if you're looking for the mysterious stranger and his sound cues suck. The sounds are liars, I tell you. I look to the sounds and he's somewhere completely different. Sneaky blending in little bugger. Sending out dwellers into the wasteland for supplies can be fun, unless there's a opportunity to enter a building. In which case there's a chance you're either screwed or okay. Mostly screwed. Seriously, they suck. Like, what even is this? I've also noticed they've recycled Elder Scrolls sound effects in here. Even though this is Fallout. What's wrong Bethesda? Can't tell the difference between them now?

So, yeah. It's a great and addictive game. Unless you're on mobile. And have a short temper. And hate lazy game design. In which case you might not like it. I can tolerate it. Probably just because of how addicting Bethesda games are. Good thing they make games and not drugs. Chances are they wouldn't work and would only be addictive. Freaking Bethesda. As long as there's money involved, eh?"
12466,yes
12467,"Buggy objectives.
Play to wait, game mechanics.
Doesn't sync with other platforms.
Full Screen doesn't work.
On most platforms the sync is buggy and saves are lost/ not synced often...
This game killed Bethesda's culture of decent Single Player RPGs, now they want to over monetize with games as a service paid skins/micro-transactions because this play to wait Fallout Shelter earned them too much, with little work, mostly outsourced..."
12468,"Awesome game, Great fun, simple yet addictive!"
12469,very good game

‚úÖ Free to play
‚úÖ Fallout world & mechanics (S.P.E.C.I.A.L.)

‚ùå Bad monetization practises (loot boxes)
‚ùå Waste of Time (only play this to pass time)
‚ùå Too much Grind (It's a mobile game)"
12489,i really enjoyed this game and got sucked up into playing it on and off for awhile. however------------ wouldn't let me open it anymore. kind of upset but eh i'm just gonna start it again fresh and see what happens.
12490,10/10
12491,good game
12492,"i get like 90% at the screen where u click enter vault and 100% after i click enter. and that's when the game is the only thing i have open. so i wouldn't really recommend this game unless u have like the best PC ever made. (Just my opinion)

"
12493,"I like this game, but allow me to name the reasons you might not.  I will assume you're familiar with Fallout games already, since this game seems to be tailored to the fans.

1.  The game is extremely simplistic and limited.
2.  The game is not an active game (except during quests and incidents)
3.  The game expects you to think, plan, and wait.  Thus their money-making..  Read below.

* Also worth mentioning: The game is quite easy, unless you don't understand it.  The in-game tutorial provides little information on how you're actually expected to play the game, being that it's pleasantly lore-friendly.  They expect you to read through the manual, found in your Pip-Boy at the bottom-right of your screen.

But anyway, allow me to go into more details.

1.  What you see is what you get with this game.  Even on quests, it's set up where you go room-to-room like in your own Vault.  The size, particularly width limitations, kind of force you into a single setup of 2 elevator shafts and 8 rooms per floor..  

2.  The game isn't designed to sit and play.  You're an Overseer, your job is to tell other people what to do, then lean back and do your own thing.  It's designed to do things, close the game, and come back hours later or the next day.  There are a few incentives to sitting and staring at the screen, but it'll be boring, monotonous, and mindless.

3.  The game's designed for you to expand slowly, and send your Vault dwellers out into the Wasteland to find supplies..  You should always make sure you have your needs covered before doing anything new..  This includes building new rooms or expanding old rooms!  Even upgrading an existing room raises the difficulty of the incidents that happen in it..

I find the game fun, and see no need to spend anything on it.  The pay options are to speed up time..  But if you're impatient, you really shouldn't be playing this game to begin with, in my own opinion."
12494,this game gets very boring after a wile of playing. do not suggest getting this game
12495,Beautyfull
12496,"From All of the idle farming games out there in my opinion

This gets my #1 beating Clash Of Clans

Nice work Bethesda"
12497,The best free low spec games when you bored <3
12498,Good time killer but no new updates
12499,"Rating 8/10

This is really worth playing if you into Sims and Sims city type of thing. Building your own vault with your own society with the main goal to maintain it from all elements. I really wish there was super mutants like in the original Fallout games that would have made it a 10 out of 10 for me. The quest system is a bit lose and you can‚Äôt see what level of enemies you going up against. All in all this game is really fun and it is free!  
"
12500,it's gooodd
12501,"This is a very cute game, well designed in looks and subsidiary environment. Even with about 20 levels, its not ridiculously over tasked, it gets a very good balance of exterior events and vault maintenance. Always something to do, but its usually varied, and interesting.
Why negative review?
Because at v13.13 and I'm STILL back in FO4 and bloody Boston frame-rate drops and game crashes every 10 minutes now.
I don't have any gripe against Bethesda- they make excellent games, but... they really should get a new Head of Nerdness in to optimise the programming.
It looks great, is well designed.. but doesn't work properly at the post 15 Level stage, which is what you're basically trying to achieve (its about then you get to make good weapons to defend your Vault). So its ultimately frustrating and completely pointless.

Well- I suppose I do have a gripe against Bethesda. I love their games in terms of content, but always end up pissed off with them, because they don't work properly in ways that are sufficiently critical to game play- to make you stop playing.

And the crashing wipes out the 'hours played' too I guess, I've about 40  hours on my fourth Vault alone, not 5 total as stated above."
12502,"Only started playing because i broke a finger, essentially making me one handed. For a game where you just click the screen its fun and addicting. HOWEVER it is COMPLETELY RNG DEPENDENT.

after my third vault, I finally know how long each room can be, and what I need to build up, so I start a new one. Every dweller i send out barely gets any drops, meanwhile the lunch boxes they handed me out didnt have any guns. I had 2 10mm pistols do defend myself until I had an overseers office or a weapons workbench.

Right about now I feel like my luck has gotten better. Well im up to 50+ dwellers, but unfortunatly I had a lot of rooms where I didnt have any dwellers in for a time. The RNG bot decided to drop a pack of mole rats in an empty room and continues to multiply them everytime they have another adjacent room. I tried my best to save them, used up all 35 stimpacks that i had in a matter of seconds. Also the armour that you equip doesn't seem to do any DT.

After about 25 Dwellers died I just deleted the save. After that attack I felt like the game either expected me to have a non pregnant dweller with a gun in every room, or its just telling me to quit playing. and for the meantime im still playing it until my hand gets free from my bum finger.

If i learned anything about this game is to try to stop playing it befor RNGesus decides to smite me. 

Thid piece was written in memory of my dwellers :("
12503,Failed 4 times or more in a row to rush and all died. Worst game of fall out series
12504,Deathclaws ftw
12505,It's a good game for people that are good at building homes (or vaults) there's bandits and i love that anyways about a 9/10 there's still a bit of flaws but still a great gam
12506,i LOVE it!
12507,"a ton of crashes and deletes without permission but otherwise good work. If they fix those, it will be 10/10"
12508,it good
12509,Bethesda...
12510,"So I played this on a variety of platforms, but the PC is definitely the superior version.
I am glad however that bringing my saved data over from Android was so damn easy (and possible).  I had lots of hours on my phone with this game but I always found it extremely glitchy as it would often crash or run slowly and in the early incarnations the microtransactions sometimes failed (though the Google Pay integration helped that tremendously).
On the PC I have had zero issues, which is what you'd expect.  The game runs smooth and no problems with the Steam Wallet integration for purchases.
The game itself is a fun way to pass some time.  It isn't really in depth and a lot of the mechanics are about waiting (quests are the worst) and much of the interacting is just finding things and clicking them.  I find all of the tie ins to previous Fallout games fun to spot and remember.  While the game is free and there is no real pressure to buy anything I found dropping a few bucks here and there gave me a modicum of joy back when the game seemed ""stale"".  Opening a lunchbox and getting a Legendary Dweller or Weapon was always a treat as was opening a pet crate and getting a pet with a super useful ability.
My one major complaint is the lack of expansion to the game.  Once you've built your vault to be sustainable and have all the rooms you need there is nothing more to build.  They haven't added much content for the core of the game itself.  I would have loved to have seen new room types added like a playpen for your pets to hang out in, or upgraded versions of the skill training rooms and some additional cosmetic room designs.  There is a lot of untapped potential with adding just small things like this, but it seems unlikely Bethesda will ever do anything of the sort.  They occasionally have seasonal themed events going on (the norm with most mobile games) but these are lackluster in most regards."
12511,Its a fun game that follow the outher fallouts
12512,"Quickly gets boring and the microtransactions are scammy af, Cheat Engined some instead of loosing $."
12513,it's alright
12514,"Hope this game is put in a museum someday. So I can show my kids. ""See kids, this is what games were like with microtransactions! the horrible abomination, where you grind grind grind for years, but never get the exact thing you want from a lootbox, lunchcrate."" but I imagine this is the new wonderful hell we all look forward to thanks to people spending so much god damn money on Fortnite."
12515,This is a good game to spend a few hours on. Definitely one of the best free games there is.
12516,sorry i hack your game
12517,"EDIT: v1.13.13 is the current and 'now and forever' version. need to be online otherwise it crashes after 10 minutes due to a status check loop.

It's Fallout.
It's Free.

Those are two things you hardly hear together after Fallout 4 and the 76 fiasco... All kidding aside, it's a good way to kill some time or have running in the background... just don't forget about the dwellers you send into the wastes when you log off... they can die..."
12518,This game is best
12519,Absolute classic game. And for free too! Fallout Shelter is seriously addicting and such a well thought out game with definite replay-ability for months after first opening up the game. A great casual game that'll make any persons game library that little bit better.

12548,"Mind numbing, Boring, with a really stupid AI that is propped up with cheap parlor tricks to make the game seem like it's good. Frankly the biggest shock is other games have stolen code from it for their own game. I guess if you aren't trying to make a good game, why copy a good game. 

Biggest complaint about the game is how hit boxes don't line up with the actions. I thought the screen on my tablet was going out, now on PC it does the same thing, so the dev's made off center hit boxes so you can't perform actions by clicking where indicated.  

  Instead of being challenging, game just throws literally random shit at you when you are doing either too well, or too bad. The entire game is designed to keep you taking care of bullshit fires(sometimes literally), because there's no real content to this game. 

I only play it because I literally want something mind numbing at the end of my day, I will likely delete it soon, as there is good games that don't use cheap tricks to pretend to be well developed. If you never want to spend money and don't mind feeling like you wasted your life, then give this game a chance. If you like being entertained, a good story, entertaining graphics, or character growth, then this game isn't for you. If you like staring at a screen mindlessly while a terrible game plays itself with little to no interaction from yourself, well you know the rest."
12549,"Fallout 76 ruined my life. When I loaded the game a Todd Howard busted out of the monitor and stabbed me in the kneecap. Then pissed on my as I was on the floor withering in pain.

Then Todd came back up, and started kicking me in the face while singing country roads until I was unconscious. When I came to I realized by wallet was stolen, and when I checked my bank account was empty. Then Todd emerged from closet, dragged me downstairs and chained me to a radiator. While i was chained up, Todd impersonated and went to work, and kicked my boss in the balls. After that he went to my girlfriend's house and punched her in the mouth.

When I got out I ran upstairs to call the police, but Todd had cut the phone lines, and threw my cell into the garbage dispenser. And on the table was the note saying ""I'LL BE BACK!"""

12558,Nice
12559,"Fallout Shelter is one of the best time-wasters ever. The whole concept of the game, the gameplay and the graphics are pretty good, and highly recommend it to everyone who‚Äôs looking for something easy yet interesting to play on the way to work."
12560,nice:)
12561,guod
12562,A port of the mobile game. Lots of micromanaging. Solid OK game for time wasting.
12563,"A really good game to pass the time, been a fallout fan for years and i still find myself coming back to this."
12564,"War, war never changes..."
12565,yay
12566,nice
12567,"I have this little screen on a 60"" tv the game looks ridiculous, guess you only get what you pay for, in this instance it was free, so I will leave it there."
12568,Whats not to like
12569,"It is a fun little Fallout Minigame.

Being the overseer of your own Vault and controlling all the inhabitants is fun. I just hope that they add some of Vault-Tecs signature experiments soon to this game.

As it is its a fun time waster."
12570,"Cool game cool when there is no internet
"
12571,good
12572,Really good game play but I seem to never have enough power.
12573,Good game
12574,"Very fun and simple game! It seems a bit simple and boring at first but, it's actually pretty addictive after a while. Would recommend, it's a very fun and time consuming game that'll keep you occupied."
12575,"I have played this game on mobile when it first released as well as on PC.
Certainly, it is far easier on a computer on account of the larger screen and a mouse pointer. I have tried it with controller and it wasn't comfortable -- but that is just personal preference.

Would I recommend it? yes.
It is a small game of which is good to play in your spare time.
Do not expect a whole lot out of it though."
12576,"the save data files get easily corrupted after a couple of days, uninstalling itself, forcing to recreate one more vault again ;D"
12577,war never changes
12578,GG
12579,"the first couple of vaults i spent way to much money , the game glitched and every thing was gone. The thing to remember this is a game that you play for a while  , check you're dwellers , build rooms , do quests , leave for a while come back update ,rinse and repeat. the thing is to do things gradually. i do like it"
12580,"Even though I don't have many hours on PC, most of it is on mobile. I have around 90 hours from 4/3/19
I totally recommend this game, it can be very frustrating at times but it's mostly having fun and leveling up your dwellers, and going on quests. What I don't like about this game is the most stimpacks and rad aways you can have is 25 each. It would be way better if I can set out a dweller to the wasteland with 50 of each. This game is really good with a mouse and just overall a fun game. Considering that it's free makes it alot better, I wouldn't mind paying $5 for this game. The highest level for a dweller is 50, which can also be kinda annoying. I love finding new things and just playing the game and the whole aspect is to survive. 9/10"
12581,this game is awesome
12582,"I was going to give it a positive review, then I failed five rushes in a row at around 30% failure chance. Whoops"
12583,"This sucks, fallout 4 sucks, and fallout 76 sucks, elder scrolls also sucks, make more stuff like fallout 3 and skyrim"
12584,Pretty good game. I like the variety of items and characters you can get. If you're into resource management type games then I would recommend you try this game.
12585,slightly above average
12586,We need the arabic language
12587,"Yeah, it's cool. Fun 'check in once in a while' game.

What is there to say? It's a neat little game. I like makin' my own shelter and sending guys out in the wastes. Only late-game have I started to notice a lot of grind. For the first lot of hours though there's pretty quick progression if that's your thing. I'm getting sorta bored simply because I don't have anything else to unlock room-wise, but its still a fun game. I'd recommend you play it like a phone game (which it is): Pop it on for half an hour a day or something. It's enjoyable. 

"
12588,"good game
"
12589,so epic i cried out of my headphones
12590,Fallout Shelter= China
12591,"epic
game make more plz"
12592,"Fallout is one of the shittiest game series of all time being comparable to that terrible series ""Borderlands"" but this is where fallout shelter revolutionized the series as it isn't a piece of shit."
12593,"Got many Power Armor and easy to defend vault, the hardest thing to get are legendary dwellers
Deathclaw is always a threat"
12594,So some how all of the dwellers in my vault were finally fully healed and not all automatically dying after like a month of not being able to get them all fully healed from rad poisoning. survival mode is fucked up its like it has a fucking mind of its own. 100 dwellers is already uncontrollable
12595,"it is fun, but doesn't really make me come back... pretty boring next day"
12596,MEH
12597,"Its so much fun to just sit here.. Drink some coffee, watch some netflix, and play THIS game. fantastic game everyone give it a try!"
12598,"I played this on my phone when I was waiting around. I figured why not download it anyway. I hated I had to start all over with my shelter, but it is a good time waster."
12599,"[i]""I admit, I've never seen another Vault, but ours MUST be the best."" ~ Vault Dweller[/i]

Fallout Shelter is a entertaining little time killer which made its way, quite successfully, over from mobile/tablet.

As the overseer of your own vault you get to build rooms to expand your vault, staff rooms with dwellers to keep the vault running and try to keep raiders at bay.

All of the dwellers in your vault can be renamed for customisation (as can the pets) and once the barbershop unlocks [spoiler](at population 50)[/spoiler] your dweller's appearance can also be customised (but not the pets).  Equip your dwellers with weapons and stat boosting outfits to make your vault the best vault a vault can be.

Quests can also be unlocked through the overseer's office [spoiler](at population 18)[/spoiler] to send your dweller's out on specific missions.  Alternatively you can just send them out to wonder in the wasteland, they might find something useful (better chance the longer they're gone).

Well worth the cost of the game!

12601,"So, did anyone else try to get a father to have a kid with his daughter? No... Just me? Come on I had to find out. (They won't, which is probably for the best)"
12602,"heehee
"
12603,"I love this game, and the best thing is that you can play it in class if the subject is not interesting. The game takes long time to get finished with, that's just best for me cause i have to be in school for 3 years now.. But definitely recommended for young kids and teenagers in school :)"
12604,A little slow on the up and up but so far a rather okayish idle-like game that so far keeps me reminded why nuclear weapons are bad and also keeps in mind why I dont own any fatman launchers either
12605,1/10 couldn't arm the child with a fat man
12606,"
I think that no one will argue with the fact that this is the best part of Fallout
"
12607,A proper sequel than fallout 76...
12608,"A very interesting, strategic-economic game. After 15 hours, it's better to play every few hours, on the principle go make, take, leave."
12609,"Game for mobile (good), but for pc? (Fallout 4 on laxative)"
12610,Very good and intertaing!

12612,"The game is good for when you need to waste some time, however I can't recommend it because one of the achievements. 

One of the achievements requires you to collect 20 legendary dwellers, from what I could understand you can get legendary dwellers from lunchboxes and quests, but it's very rare to get them from quests. The game gives you three from lunchboxes the game gives you, after that you won't get any more from the lunchboxes the game gives you, so your best chance at getting the achievement is to buy lunchboxes, using real money, and hope they give you a legendary dweller.

I can't reccomend the game because one of the achievements requires you to spend money in order to have a real chance at getting it."
12613,The game removed itself from my library and I couldn't play it and had spent 7 hours on it.
12614,It's alright.
12615,Good game
12616,"I started playing Fallout Shelter within days of it's release 2 years ago.  The game had a chronic issue with save files disappearing or corrupting, forcing the player to constantly manually back up the save game files every time you played to counter this.

It seemed like that after a while that the problem had been dealt with and so I stopped the constant file back up and enjoyed Bethesda's little time-water.  I even made a couple in-game purchases to support the game.

Fast forward two years (almost to the day) and I started the game to find out that the problem had never been solved.   The Vault that I had spent two years building (aiming for 200 dwellers with max level/max stats) had corrupted and, with no manual back up, has been forever lost.

Multiple backups of save game files is something from the 1990's and has long since been solved so why it is still an issue for this game is beyond me.  Personally, I think everyone who has had this issue should post a negative review to alert potential new players away from the game.

Many would ask ""Why bother?  It's a ""free"" game.""  To this I would say that Bethesda HAS made money from this game and will most likely continue to do so.  They have obviously done little or nothing to fix the issue and most likely never will since any revenue from the game is trivial by their standards.

Also, let's be honest, they've got bigger problems as they are busy imploding their company."
12617,"Almost fun game with visual appeal.  Annoyingly amateurish programming.  Clicking is either amazingly imprecise, or the precision is in choosing any possible element you didn't want over the character that you're directly on.  The bonuses provided in game are perfectly timed to be massively interrupted so that you get the least possible benefit from them.  It does work sometimes.  Once in a while the rng throws you a bone.  If Bethesda wanted me to recommend the game to others, they would have to fix the very real issues with the game.  They have enough fans that they won't bother. Cheers!"
12618,"Really good game for being a f2p, not much grinding and a lot to do so you won't get bored anytime soon. Not really a freemium kinda game where you can pay for everything. A must play."
12619,Its a good time killer.
12620,8/10
12621,"I really enjoy playing this game and it couldn't be better but the only issue I have is Rushing resources with under a 30% chance for an incident and having the very off chance of an incident actually happened. If I could rate stars, I would give this a 4 until the chance for an incident happened less and actually depended on the % for it and not happening every time at 30%. It's ridiculous and I would really have a much better time playing and not worrying about rushing for resources whenever I'm low and then dealing with RadRoaches or fires. Everything else is honestly great."

12628,iz gud
12629,Fun but very frustrating toward the end.
12630,"It's trash mobile port of cash cow game from Bethesda, but given Fallout 76's existance bad games now suddently start to look like ""good"" ones, and don't be fooled, lesser evil is still evil.

Pros: my PC can actually run this (but so is my phone).
Cons: mobile game design is fundamentally flawed from the get-go"
12631,gud.
12632,Fun but time-consuming. Lost interest after a week.
12633,    E
12634,"Okay game, but too slow for my liking."
12635,"10/10

My vault was taken over by mole rats. All hail the mole ratking."
12636,GREAT!!!
12637,Amazing game
12638,"This feels good with a mouse, just wish I could cross save between here and my phone."
12639,1000000x better than Fallout 76
12640,free might as well download it
12641,one of the better idle games in the genre for sure
12642,A super easy mindless game.
12643,HELL YEAH
12644,"Fun at the beginning, frustrating towards the end."
12645,"I didn't play this much, I swear."
12646,"Great game for wasting some extra time you may have on your hands.
The early game is pretty even paced but when you finally get to a certain point of buildings it becomes the waiting game for what can be days on end before something happens, unfortunately.
None the less, the game has a lot of replay ability so, if you feel like sitting around after a day of work, wanting to talk to friends or just listen to music, this game will have you constantly thinking of one thing or another before it becomes boring or uninteresting."
12647,Yeet skeet eat my feet
12648,good game
12649,this game is fun but it is fun on the phone
12650,"Man pasistojo ir poto telefnas nukrito ir mire ir tada man buvo depresija nes negalejau zaisti fallout shelter ir tada a≈° pamaƒçiau ≈°itƒÖ ≈æaidima ir tada a≈° buvah toks YEY FALLOUT ANT KOMPO REIKIA MAN nes kai bus stajakas,sisteminis blokas....nenugriuuuus"
12651,"Fun, easy to play while I get homework or other stuff done in the background. Easy to switch back and forth with little issues doing so. But, whenever I play offline after about 10 minutes the game starts lagging/freezing and crashes. No issues with any other games or online though."
12652,good game
12653,Nice
12654,Addictive time sink. Avoid and get a life.
12655,very good would recommend
12656,Pretty fun lots of cool stuff that you can do and yeah its a pretty good game if you like building or getting new people to live in your vault you also can get this on your phone or ipad but I still recommend you to get this game
12657,"Once you unlocked every single room, you're done. Yeah you could play the story.. but all in all you're done when you've gotten the last room. But till that it's a nice game."
12658,meh could be better
12659,For me I am a pretty big fan of fallout and I do enjoy playing this game and I highly recommend it is you like grinding games.
12660,It alright
12661,"Wow,i can't even open the game"
12662,Awesome.
12663,"Very fun game, can be frustrating at times though."
12664,I got bored after i've reached 100 dwellers
12665,Just perfect strategy.
12666,this is
12667,Simple not hard.
12668,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT A MINUTE THIS AINT BURGER KING.
12669,better than mobile version
12670,"More playable and more fun than Fallout76 
10/10 would rather waste their time here"
12671,Good
12672,A decent time waster but it is basically a phone game ported to steam
12673,DO NOT BUY anything in this game every time i get a vault with more then like 70-80 people weird stuff starts going down like my stats resetting too 1 or things i bought with cash just vanishing or random crashs that when they finally stop all the tings i just said happen at once i wouldnt even play it =-P im done with it wish i could get my money back i put in too this crappy game
12674,I would play this when board at Goo Lagoon
12675,I love this game and think it is amazing lol
12676,"Started out as really fun. Until all of the unresolved bugs pop up destroying your progress, deleting the Vaults you've built, and numerous bugs that halt the progress of completing achievements. Some people have spent ""hundreds"" on this game, only to be told, ""Oh well"".

No updates, no content, no bug fixes, no communication, no Dev presence, but you can dang well bet that the cash shop is still working flawlessly (they need a steady stream of suckers to fund their Fallout 76 disaster).

Even if you're extremely bored and have no other option that looks entertaining, steer clear of this mess until someone over at Bethesda realizes the game still exists."
12677,"one think i should mention

the revival of dead explorers should depend on their armor and the items they have collected and the amount of items they have collected

besides that i like it"
12678,"Bugs bugs, full of bugs, can't acess the game after 36 hr of play and money invested."
12679,"Its free and still boring, we only downloaded it while we waited for fallout 4. I'd still rather play shelter.
"
12680,"Nice, I love this game because it's so fun"
12681,"Free and Fun For Fans of Fallout, but...

YOU HAVE TO NAME YOUR PEOPLE WITH NUMBERS, because health bars have no numerical display anywhere (like really? WTF?) and each dweller's max HP is based on their Endurance at each level-up (a number which can vary greatly over time and from dweller to dweller). Roughly, a lvl 1 dweller has about 100 hp, a lvl 50 dweller raised with 1 Endurance has about 300hp, and a lvl 50 dweller raised with 17 Endurance (the maximum amount possible) has over 600hp. This is a huge range of values and SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IN A GAME THAT IS ENTIRELY NUMBER-BASED. Without viewing your save file in an unofficial editor, you will never know the actual number, instead only inferring values based on how much damage they take relative to one another."
12682,"What can I say... Fallout + Old School Facebook games + a twist = Fallout Shelter

If you like base building casual games, then this is for you"
12683,"An unique game. I've played it for nearly a year.  I loved developing my vault, finding weapons, pets etc. If you like base building, development, resourse managing - this is your game. There are some side quests which will destroy your nerves however. They were frequently updating the game with new or special content, and it never gets boring - especially when you build a bigger vault, with more dwellers - there is always something to do. I recommend it."
12684,"gg
"
12685,"Fun little game to play from time to time. It's kind of boring at first, but once I unlocked Overseer's office it got a bit better. I have this game on Steam, console, and mobile. It's fun to play while waiting for something, or on a long trip. Can't complain for a free game."
12686,Cool
12687,"Mole rats are way too overpowered in the game, it ruins the whole experience."
12688,suck my gopher nuts
12689,Fun if you want to kill some time.
12690,"Free to play, playable even when I don't have any access to the network. Low PC requirements. Nothing to complain here."
12691,"This game is amazing!! 
although i'm having a slight issue where the Graphics freeze but the game continues in the backround, but other than that it is an amazing game."
12692,its cool but sometimes when i buy things it doesnt work and is a pain
12693,"I had quite a lot of fun with this game. Feels Fallout for sure, and you have your own vault!
And pets! AND in this game Preston Harvey is actually useful! 
If you like Fallout than you have to try this. Did I mention there are pets?"
12694,its amazing but they should ad an adventuring you can control (the missions don`t count)
12695,good
12696,"The game is fun BUT it takes to long. You should have am option to speed up game play otherwise you'll wind up waiting forever. The crafting and outfitting elements are fun. So is the ability to send vault dwellers on missions. To make any meaningful progress in a reasonable amount of time you have to spend microtransactions on nuka cola. Until this issue is addressed, I can't really recommend the game for too long."
12697,"Come back to your game after a week. ""Oh look, everyone died"""
12698,For a free game really good. It is very time eating tho. I think I played this game everyday for 3 hours since I have it. All in one a free and very cute game to waste your time :)
12699,"great game.
is all i have to say"
12700,"Now I have the ultimate power, finally!!!"
12701,"1. Played a few hours.
2. Realized that the game is trying to mooch my money. (If you don't buy in game items with real money then you are forced to needlessly waste your time.)
3. Quickly forgot about the game and never played it again."
12702,Played it on my phone and i hacked it and everyone had max stats and power armor. 10/10 would cheat again
12703,"Note: don't worry if you don't have any of the healing-things from the lab left. Dwellers will heal automatically over time (tho it's a wait of a few good days). And I also recommend to heal people on the highest floor first, since they're the raiders' primary target."
12704,"This game was great until it wasn't.  When it was working it was a wonderful time waster, then one day I was not able to log in.  It stops at the screen when you can enter vault or list vaults.  Click on one or the other, and game crashes (shuts down).  Tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, and nada, it does the same thing.  If you do a search for this games for bugs, it has others and apparently nobody is doing anything anymore to fix them."
12705,better than 76
12706,How do I hide this from my parents
12707,"its fun a time waster (in a good way) 
and COUNTRY ROADS TAKE ME HOME"
12708,The constant fires killed this for me. I come back to the game to several people dead. or constantly have to heal them because a fire erupted out of thin air 3 times in 10 minutes.
12709,since last avast update the game does not work!
12710,"Nice game, good looking graphics.. kinda grindey, but isn't that in all the fallout games?
For a real review, don't go for this one. And i hate those people who copied it."
12711,robots will kill us in the future end my suffering 1/10
12712,"Create a bunker, develop, recruit people, improve the bunker, etc !!!
I recommend!!!"
12713,"Fun at the beginning, frustrating towards the end.
One can see this is a mobile port, but this doesn't bother. Easy concept with basic management of the vault. There is some questing, leveling, training, impregnating, looting, plus Mr. Handy and Pets. The game is loaded with fallout references and has quite a big load of humor. 
Now, the problem here are small issues and difficulty carve. The deathclaws and radscorpions (btw. seriously? I ware killing those with the spear in original Fallout) are serious challenge. That wouldn't be a problem normally, but the click boxes are not align correctly, and health bar is eaten rapidly (btw. I don't know why but the damage is always much bigger in the larger room then in smaller ones). At the end although player is clicking on the dweller, the stimpacks and rad aways are not always activated, and dwellers die. Again, that wouldn't be a tragic, but like game says itself, rushing rooms is main caps earner (and at some stage radscorpions occur frequently). Sure, one can pass the rushing future, as well as turn the radio for vault broadcasting only, but deathclaws and radscorpions will still come. At earlier stage of the game incidents are somewhat countered with mysterious stranger and ""cap and bottle"", but later with larger vault it is really hard to keep up. This is not only due many floors to be scanned, but also due click boxes problem, as well as positioning. The last one is mainly Mysterious Stranger problem, who likes to show just behind the dweller or in the corners of the room that are not visible from all perspectives. With almost no arrival sound while zoomed out that renders him almost completely obsolete, and reducing him to a ""lucky shoot"" only.
Now, some people are saying the save future is flawed since it doesn't safe basic resources. Well, if one will study closely the truth is revealed. This is a future not a bug. Mr Handy can collect those while not playing the game, and since those are extremely rare, but can be easily bought up, well it's the player and his/her wallet problem :) 
Speaking of micro-transaction, generally they are not so bothersome like in other games. Sure Quantum Cola can speed things significantly, and pets, robots and legendaries can improve things significantly but the game is still fun to play without paying.
Speaking of I really don't understand Nuka-Cola plant. The description is wrong, as it's not producing Nuka Cola. It looks like it was suppose to produce Quantum Cola at the beginning, but developers found it too powerful and change it for resources. That move makes on the other hand some buildings questionable.
The game runs without problems under Steamplay (Linux)."
12714,"Perfect for anyone who enjoys management, levelling up and construction. I think it's a terrific game, especially great for short bursts when you're having a break or waiting for something."
12715,"The game makes for a good mobile game.  Not so much fun on PC...at least for me.  I liked the feeling of progression, but I was really bothered that if I tried to play for any decent length of time (over 20 minutes), I seemed to always be attacked by Deathclaws.  These attacks were so very annoying and made no sense to me since I wasn't even heading out into the wasteland and yet these creatures constantly were finding us, breaking the doors, and somehow making their way through my entire 8 floor vault.  Not cool...not fun...no more playtime for me.  If you enjoy the game then I say great for you, but after 19 hours, I have had enough and will not be playing this anymore.  Thank you for reading."
12716,the game was really fun for me i really enjoyed it!
12717,fun little game to keep you busy
12718,Vault crashed and won't load after I put 200 hours into it. Tried everything to fix it.
12719,Nice little game.
12720,I really hate the deathclaws my  shelter nearly got destroyed
12721,It's OK for a free game but gets really repetitive later. It felt like I had won the game about halfway and I kinda lost interest. The 200 person vault limit was annoying and I maxxed my money also.....Most of the quests I had left were just daily and weekly quests and it was pretty much nothing left to do but what I had already done.
12722,"An amazing addition to the fallout series, that is also playable by the younger audience 10/10"
12723,"If you like SimTower, or similar games like Project Highrise, you might like this one. If you are content to wait awhile while your rooms produce (2-30 min real time), and don't mind managing hands on with matching your characters attributes to the rooms, and constantly monitoring your consumption to production ratios, you will be rewarded.

But, if you are only in it for your characters to run the quests, odds are, you will be disappointed. Be forewarned, this one does continue calculating time in the background while you are not playing it, and room production is in real time.  Fortunately while you aren't playing the game, the negative game events (infestations, fires, raiders etc) don't happen, and production appears to be autocollected since the characters don't die. There is no way of pausing the game, nor of manually speeding up the game. However, you can finish some tasks faster (such as armor or weapon building or speeding up overseer quests) with Nuka Cola Quantum, which you can either find by your characters going on quests, or by buying with real world money. There is no shortage of microtransactions in this game, unfortunately.  You can even buy ""lunchboxes"", which contain loot cards, or pet crates, which contain pets that enhance your characters, with real money, although some quests do reward them as well."
12724,i literally cannot stop playing. the radiation sucks and it wiped out half of my population so i had to restart but otherwise 10/10
12725,any idea when this game will last longer then 5 mins without crashing its like fallout 76 before fallout 76 there is no reason this should run like shit on a asus rog predator js optimize this shit please and thanks lmao
12726,The idea of managing a Vaultec vault is pretty nice. But on PC this game doesn't work. It consists of endless grinding. If that's too boring you can skip the required time by spending Nuka Cola. You can buy those for real world money.
12727,"nice game btw, for killing time"
12728,"Enjoyable game, would recommend to those who want to pass the time."
12729,"
I've abandoned my shelters for the last 6 weeks and hope they're not all dead."
12730,"Solid free game, 5/7, apart from the every-10 minutes-crashes"
12731,me leik veri much survivel 9/10
12732,PLZ ADD A SANDBOX MODE
12733,try it dont buy it
12734,"Pretty great game if you're a fan of the Fallout series, and dont care if its mobile game port."
12735,"It is an engaging game and I loved it to a point.  But I hated it forcefully trying to destabilise your achievements, by means outside the established mechanics."
12736,looks like a beta.
12737,its fun when you are not doing somthing speschel?
12738,fun and addicting
12739,I've only played 7ouers and I can defenly recommand this game ( never mind its free) its a one of a kind 2de game and is very fun ( I don't like 2d games ... infack I hate 2d game ) But this one has that special somthing thats rare in a 2d game and its a keeper!

12741,"howdyyy! m'lady, thanks for coming to ma bunker so now you can become my official slave and work for me all the time and never get any food or stuff to survive on! :)"
12742,The Game Is recomended To Played
12743,It is FALLOUT!
12744,Just like the mobile version. I love it 10/10
12745,Sure would be nice to place fallout shelter on both the PC and my phone not sure why that not a thing pretty fun over all
12746,"Fallout Shelter is shallow, simple, occasionally frustrating, and nice to look at. It is a tolerable waste of time, but nobody with access to a PC should bother unless they want to cheat their way through to see how meaningless it really is."
12747,i like this game because easy arrangement
12748,"As far as free to play games go this one is fairly good and non-exploitative.  The special currency Nuka Quantum can be earned in game just from doing quests and completing missions, and none of the buildings are locked behind needing the currency. Lunchboxes are kind of a bummer to have a RNG box but you can also earn them in game.

It does however have some short falls.  End game gets repetitive since once you've built out your vault its mostly crafting legendaries, training/collecting vault dwellers, and continuing to do quests.  The quests also suffer from a limited background scene pool and are missing some variety in Fallout enemies such as the robots and super mutants.

Also from a game play perspective it hampers the experience that you can't set dwellers exploring the Wasteland to automatically return when they run out of stimpacks, which feels needlessly punishing if you only want to log in once a day or so like you'll likely want when you reach end game."
12749,"Characters such as Butch and Lucas Simms make an appearance. Neat game to kill time or when you have nothing else to play.

**EDIT**

*cough*cough*trainers*cough*cough*"
12750,"Time consuming, but worth it to a certain point, like if you have time to waste. Many of the Steam achievements shown are unachievable due to the system not recognizing (1) your main vault and/or (2) your progress within the game not being detected, so a bit of a downer for those of us who are both Fallout fans and achievement hoarders. Also, if you don‚Äôt monetarily invest in the game, it is rather difficult to progress."
12751,Chips
12752,Great to kill time. The Vault-Tec style of characters makes it very eye-pleasing. It's so much fun to watch your Vault grow and overcome the obstacles that come along with it.
12753,bad game it's all about luck
12754,nice
12755,oh. ya is good
12756,"I love this game! I first played it on my kiddo's Switch, since she wasn't really using the damn thing, and got addicted pretty quick. So, when I purchased more Switch games for her and she started hogging it, I decided to pick it up on the PC. I have to say, as a native PC gamer, that it's a lot easier to navigate here. I love the customizable hotkeys and simple but appealing interface. 

Like most free games, it does have microtransactions. You can either get what are essentially loot boxes containing random items, all of which can be obtained by playing the game normally, or Nuka-Cola to speed up time-constrained things. The game is still completely playable and fun without those purchases, so don't let that put you off!

Also, if you're worried that it won't be fun because you're part of the tiny percentage of people who haven't played any of the previous Fallout games, don't. I had next to no knowledge of the Fallout universe when I started playing Shelter and it never stunted me. There are trivia encounters where they ask you questions about previous games, but those are uncommon and all the answers can be found on Google (or, in my case, by asking your nerd boyfriend who HAS played all the Fallout games)."
12757,"50000 people can't escape to a vault, 9/10"
12758,I really love this game but it gives me every reason to hate it. I have spent many many hours playing this game and for whatever reason it says I have 2 hours of play time on record which doesnt bother me. The part that does bother me however is the fact that after starting the game that I had all those hours in to I realized that ALL of my items were missing. All 35 of my characters had above average weapons and armor that took a very frustratingly long time to aquire and now every one has on vault suits and no weapons which will be awesome when its time for my shelter to be attacked. All 15 of my nuka cola were gone but for some reason it decided to spare my caps. I have no idea why it happened. Nothing went wrong with it while playing and I always shut down the game properly rather than just just exiting out of it. As much as I love this game I cant recommend it unless you are a HUGE fan of frustration and aggravation.
12759,"While it is a mobile game, it does a great job at making itself not feel quite like a mobile game.  It is very fun, very addicting, but can grow to get a bit repetitive or dull if you play it for long sessions.  Its a great game to spend anywhere from a few minutes to an hour a day on, and does a decent enough job at keeping your attention.

End game is a bit lacking, especially when your vault basically becomes max sized.  You can basically do everything and collect everything there is in this game, although i'd imagine it would take quite awhile.

This was a mobile game at first so there are micro-transactions.  While they are briefly advertised to you, I never once felt like micro-transactions and Lunch Boxes were being forced on me nor did I feel like they were overly advertised.

My overall verdict on this game is a 8/10.  The best element of this game is balance,  Bethesda Game Studios did a great job balancing this game, and keeping just enough content in front of the player to either hold their attention or ultimately draw them back into the game.  I've lost count of how many times I've revisited Fallout Shelter over the years!"

12761,get 5 girls pregnant at a time. see pregnant girls jumping at the athletics gym. recommend 11/10
12762,Gets boring over time. Glad it‚Äôs free tho
12763,"Fallout Shelter is a fun clicker-slash-management-sim game where you take the role of a vault overseer, sending your people to quests and explorations throughout the wasteland while managing resources back home. It's quite an addictive time-burner. Both hardcore and casual fans of the Fallout series should have no qualms stepping into this one, especially as it's free - and it isn't pay to win, either.

Highly recommended."
12764,I dont know.. i would love it if i was able to cheat =\ oh no that's right pay 2 ply so dont cheat pay big money to cheat
12765,"I heard you like timer, so I made a timer while you waiting the timer, so you could watching your timer while timer running."
12766,One mom to rule them all!
12767,a good chill timewaster game :)
12768,fun. it looks exacly like the perk page with its graphics!
12769,I just can't with this game
12770,good
12771,fun when ure bored n have nothing to do :/
12772,"Satu lagi versi PC dari game mobile pada smartphone, memerlukan kesabaran dan waktu yang cukup panjang untuk dapat mengupgrade bunker bawah tanah, segala fasilitasny dan tentu saja penghuninya. Cocok untuk mengisi waktu kosong saat tidak ada pekerjaan di kantor."
12773,GOOD
12774,something to do while waiting for a dl
12775,"It's simply a fun game a good time waster, i like the cartoony feel to the game (yeah I know its mobile port) and the old school rpg combat elements when questing.....the only beef i have with the game  is the only beef i have with all bethesda game, it crashes.....alot, for once i would like bethesda to release a game that works correctly from the jump, not that it's ever going to happen, but one can hope"
12776,"playable just about, trust bethesda to make even a simple game glitchy. don't expect to get far without paying rediculous prices for in game purchases."
12777,i recomend vault-tec to any person in the fallout world
12778,When does this support Mac platform ?
12779,hard but good game love it
12780,"Fallout Shelter is simple to play and addictive as hell, might just be the best free-to-play game out there."
12781,"I always found it funny that the Fallout world is antagonistic to communism, but the post apocalyptic world has forced people to rely on it to survive lmao"
12782,waste of time
12783,Good little 3D game but it‚Äôs a boring game after 2 or 3 days.
12784,If you have time to kill and enjoy sim type games then you'll love this.
12785,"After roughly accumulating 140 survivors and the stupid amount of hours/days that it took to plan, build, and grow my lame little community the game UNEXPECTEDLY had an error while playing -The vault/save became unplayable and unfixable; verify file integrity does not fix anything. Now the only way to play this game would be to restart a WHOLE NEW VAULT. Game was a mediocre OK at best moments - Its like a Plinko machine with casino noises. Bethesda has fallen from grace and is not recommended - even when they release free stupid shet like this."
12786,"I like the fact that we can see the way our vault/s look, we can place the pieces wherever we want and a lot of other things, too."
12787,nice game
12788,"Very nice, the only downside is although there is a version for Android, Steam doesn't support it, or at least I didn't find a way to sincronize the app between pc and Android phone."
12789,"(+)    Fallout Shelter... Its a good game with really pretty graphics, run smoothly, and you can meet people, weapons from fallout 3 and 4, gameplay is really satisfying for exemple when you finish quest or unlock another room because its a ""waiting game"" so quest or wastland exploration can take for exemple 30min. to 24 h.
Its type of game that you let run in backround while you watch youtube video, do homework and other things. 

(-)  
-   One big thing that happened to me, its a little story- i was playing and my pc crashed no big deal just restart and good to go but when i wanted to play the game my vault got deleted. so if your pc crashes sometime, dont waste money on this game you dont have to buy anything, with time and patience you can get everything but is easier, i lost about 15 euro in FS stuff and somethimes my vault wouldn't even load but if that happens try load it again and it should work just fine.

And thats about all, would i recomend this game ? yes, but as i said, if your pc crashes quite often dont buy anything and save your vault any way you can, thank you for reading my review, and if you dont agree with me or i miss something write it in comment on this review.

12794,"Fun little time killer that doesn't require you to spend cash in order to progress. Also, fuck Bethesda! ;*"
12795,"Well i actually like this game. But i cant seem to stop thinkin that maybe the progression takes more time for the microtransactions to make sence. and thats a shame, since the game is fun and makes you loose time without even notice. Still could be better

"
12804,Still better then Fallout 76
12805,"Great little game, lots of fun in a lightweight package. Low resource usage, loads fast, plays fast (except waiting for items to complete, time to destination on quest, etc). Simple, cartoonish graphics, 2D view with perspective (""almost 3D""?).

I've yet to find a pay wall, you can play for free & have fun doing so. Gameplay is faster if you buy robots (""Mr Handy"") and Nuka-Cola Quantum, but that's up to you. I've played nearly 300 hours & spent under $20 at this writing. The game hasn't crashed except when my computer did (including power outages).

Aside from mouse pointer accuracy (think shotgun instead of rifle), I have no complaints about this game. It will challenge you at times, but any decent game should present challenges. Hark, I hear the Wastelands calling..."
12806,What a GREAT time waster. the perfect game for busy people. Easy to pick up and put down. But don't think that you can't spend a few hours on this game either. If you are patient you don't have to spend a dime for their pay for extras. Have fun!
12807,"Not too bad for a mobile game port. 

Doesn't require spending money on. I never did. You could if you like, but there is only one thing to buy. Lunchboxes, which contain pets, dwellers, caps, items etc but there is nothing you can't obtain in the main game with patience. 

Just a fun little management-lite game. Not a lot of depth to it, but enough to be fun to click in between doing other things while you're on your PC. Most mobile games are just blatant cash grabs with little to no, and mostly mindless gameplay. This is one of the few mobile games I've ever actually put more than 5 minutes into so, maybe that says something for it all by itself. 

If you like Fallout, or like achievement hunting, or both, definitely install it and click away, using your dwellers to play out weird fantasies by renaming them and breeding them etc. 

:D

12808,Not a bad game
12809,"Interesting, but the downtime between actions is too long to be addicting or hold your attention for very long."

12811,the best damn game i've ever seen
12812,"Fallout shelter is an amusing simulation of what it would be like to be an oveseer of a vault. The gameplay sometimes grows a little tiresom, but it can be an entertaining diversion. 3.5 out of 5 stars by my recconing."
12813,"Was a fan of the mobile version for a long time, then recently built a PC. Gotta say i still love it even with hundreds of hours already played on mobile. and playing on a moniter is so much more pleasing. If had a recomendation to improve the game it would be to add more room types?? posibly more option in the hair salon. I also think it would be great if you could have more than 200 dwellers. overall great game, just wish there were more room types!"
12814,breeding simulator 2277
12815,"FALLOUT Shelter :
a managment simulator game which you act as the overseer of your own vault . simple and good gameplay beside the vast customization system and a variety of quests makes the game even more exciting. 
P.s : you will enjoy the game if you ignor the annoying crashes when rushing a room."
12816,"It's an ok game.  I played for about 35 hours total and then the game got corrupt and I lost all of my progress.  At that point I just stopped playing.  I'm surprised that very few reviews mention this but you may want to create a backup file for the saved points, otherwise you will lose everything and all that time you spent was wasted.  This is mainly a PC issue."
12817,Westworld is a better mobile game.
12818,Wanna waste some time? Great game to do just that.
12819,honestly for being free this game was good and i got super addicted real fast
12820,"While the combat system could definitely use an overhaul, or better yet: a complete rework, as a whole the game is rather fun to play."
12821,"Even though It's interface is simple, It's very detailed. You must calculate every step and every area that you will built your rooms and place your dwellers. You must place your dwellers due to their abilities to get maximum products. Also, you gotta be the best pimp ever and mate them because, you always need more dwellers. Baby dwellers are annoying because they are hanging out all over and doing nothing. Like every kid does, actually...
Anyway, It's good. It's free. Worth to give it a shot.

12822,I just wish there was more of an endgame.
12823,Eh...
12824,love it
12825,Tbh Its the fallout experience just free and its fun for a while 7 out of 10
12826,this game is as badass as the games before it. i am addicted to it. only things id change is the organizing as in maybe make the possibility to favorite some dwellers so they will be visible from any distance. Love it none the less :). im a perfectionist so its my kind of game!
12827,100 hours played good game
12828,"This is bullshit.
The overall concept may be good but then youre in a situation with low food and you have upgraded the kitchen, equipped them for extra agility but you are still  forced to rush. Rushes on all stations fail (i dont rush above 43%) and half the population dies - ragequit. The failing of rushes is the worst  mechanic of the game and  wants me to smash something. GOD KNOWS I WANT TO SMASH

You are the overseer of a vault and have to manage it. There are a different rooms you have to build and maintain. There are people in your vault which different skills the S.P.E.C.I.A.L skills from the series. Each room have a skill assigned to them. If you put a dweller with the same skill, will the room work more effecient. This is basiclly whatthe game is about at the start. However it will pick up, when you got dwellers with higher skills, that can scavenge for you and later, go on quests. This game does have some RNG to it. First of all, when you sent of your dweller to the wilderness, there is a chance they die out there especially if you just leave them for hours. The loot they bring back also depends on the amount of time they are out there and it also seems to be affected by your luck skill. There  is also loot crates in this game and you will get them frecently while playing. These give everything from resources to a known NPC like Preston Garvey or an OP fatman.

[h1] Story [/h1]
There are not really a story. There is quests you can go on and they do have small stories to them. However, there is no ""main quest"" and the stories isn't good or serious like the orignial series.

[h1] Other [/h1]
This game is a free game and a mobile game, so there is a ""P2W"" part, but it is not really gamebreaking. This game will does NOT have a paywall and gives you the oppotunity to use money for completing the game faster, but it is in no way necessary to enjoy the game. The game does have a starting package which will help you in 1 of your vaults. I bought that for 5‚Ç¨ and helped get through the boring start.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
This is a fun little game you can play if you are bored or want to shit a chill with a movie and a cold drink. If you are like me, it is hard to just sit and do nothing while watching series and movies. This game is perfect for that ""stay busy"" feeling."
12839,"its a cool game to spend your time i can see my self playing it and after all its free ofc you can buy stuff in game but you dont have too so if you just want a game to chill its a good choice :3

(ALSO you can get adicted with this game easy xd)"
12840,"this game kept crashing my windows 10 pc, developers any solutions?"
12841,"The game is fun on mobile versions. I would enjoy this game as well, but for some reason it keeps on freezing on my computor.Eventually my computor crashes. Game is pretty much unplayable,even at early stages."
12842,First lunch box : power armor. Nice. Second lunch box: guided missle launcher. Wow.
12843,"Great little game to kill the boredom with.

10/10"
12844,"THis is a very fun relaxing game .its  easy   the graphics are decent and doesnt take a long time to learn.
so you enter a  fall out shelter and have to get it up and running with  a crew ..send people out side to try and find supplies, new people will come and try to join your  shelter , and you can have babies to  help improve your population,
diasters can happen and you can even get so  bad off you trash  that  game and start over ,"

12848,"I totally recomend this game, not laggy at all. But I did encounter a problem, when I bought 5 lunch boxes I opened 2 and left 3 and the next time I wanted to open them (15 min later) they already dissapeared!"

12853,Game works great. Runs really smooth even on my old Surface 3.
12854,"Good game. Tycoon games can get boring but they cover that weakness with quests.

Just one complaint, turn down the difficulty. Every 5 minutes, Mole Rats attack my vault and I can never recover to my original state.
"
12855,Even when you get to maxing out your vault there is still fun to be had. A must for anyone who loves fallout. Excellent game even for those who do not live fallout.
12856,nice
12857,"Good little time killer.

Tho sometimes mouse interactions seem off when trying to move or select someone.

7/10"
12858,A classic Fallout-styled mobile clicker game - 'ported' to the PC. What's the point? Just to waste time and hopefully enjoy doing it.
12859,"Fallout Shelter on the PC is a lightweight strategy game that takes its time to gain momentum but generates reasonable amounts of fun. On one hand it has some issues, on the other the ""just one more click!"" syndrome is present and finally the game looks the way it should have from the beginning. Fallout Shelter needs some polishing and isn't perfectly suited for this platform but it definitely deserves your attention."
12860,I pretty muh like it but id love something to speed up tme as it can get boring just waiting on stuff
12861,Single player is fun for wasting/spending free time on
12862,good
12863,"Does it sound bad if I say that this is the best game that Bethesda has done since Skyrim? :-( FeelsSadMan

But I love this game. It has all the things to tickle my addiction to mobile pay-to-win games. I loved. 10/10 NO JOKE."
12864,"It was a fun game to play.  Interesting concept, decent system for quests and getting items.  Just lacked the depth I was hoping for; but what can you expect from a mobile game on PC?"
12865,Port of the mobile game on to the PC platform. Has microtransactions but are completely optional and everything can be either built or found in the wasteland.
12866,It's pretty cool game! But i prefer to play it on phone.
12867,"Its good on both mobile and PC, something to have in the background when doing mundane tasks on the computer, keeps me a little more sane, not a demanding game, but can be if you choose to play that way. customise your base with scale, i've had a smaller pet base that was easy to maintain and required little input, the bigger base is more work and will occupy allot of your time if you let it.
This game is unique and looks really great with the style it has, I was at the launch of this game and played it since day one, on and off, coming back to it again seems to have a new take, however this time I know how to manage recources without getting bowled over by hazards."
12868,amazing game can be very fun and devestatiog
12869,Great for a 2D game
12870,"Heyho Pipboy and Pipgirls!

Nice and funny Game!

You can play it without using real cash!

You need time to finish your Vault...but there is no need for hurry up!

You like the Fallout Series...? you should try this!
"
12871,"i lost my ENTIRE vault, an entire month of grinding, just because my computer overheated during a mission\


im not very happy bethesda, but its ok, fixing your broken fallout 76 game is more important than this dumb issue"
12872,This game makes you feel Earth has been repopulated only thanks to you
12873,"Good game for being free, worth about 5-6 hours before you will be bored out of your mind waiting on tasks to finish, but i guess thats what pay to play is right, good for free but the moment any money needs to be introduced, not worth it"
12874,"the normal mode is good but the survival mode needs a lot of improvements :
 1/In both modes ,you can't really predict if you will lack in ressources or no , not enough information.
2/ the recommendation for the quests miss the amount of potions you should take with you because in survival mode even with 3 legendary dwellers you aren't sure if you can complete the mission."
12875,"Pretty good game. Nice mechanics and overal good idea. I think the game would be better with trading or something like it though.

Recommend 9/10."
12876,"A nice game to play whilst waiting for something/someone, or maybe on the trip and don't have internet, I just boot this baby up. 
The wasteland system is a exciting to read while your characters go out you can see their logs which sometimes lead to many crazy outcomes, and weird scenarios

[b]10/10.[/b] Would [b]HIGHLY RECOMMEND.[/b]"
12877,"It was a good game - Until the game glitched - 
80% of vault dwellers gone - Now my vault fell apart -
Wouldn't suggest getting into this game if you are going to put
money into it like I did. 
Not a worthy drop  when the game wipes majority of your progress at random.
This has happened twice - The first time losing one room of dwellers which I thought was my fault somehow - Now 80%
(My vault was in perfect condition so no one should've died or left either which confuses me the most)

"
12878,"This Simple But Fun Game Consmued Me 
But Once I Got 100% Achivements I Was Bassically Finished With The Game But It Was Fun While My Quest For 100% Was In Progress Anyways Lets Talk About Yhe Graphics They Are Actually Pretty Good For What They Are They Are Animated Like The Vault Boy Videos In Fallout 4 And Thats Ok I Love Animated Graphics On Serious Games Like Borderlands And Madworld But Now Gameplay Talk Time The Gameplay Is Superb And It Is So Accessible For What It Is It Plays Like A Point And Click Game But Bethesda Perfects It And Addicts People Easily Even Though This Is A Mobile Game That Doesnt Stop My Vault From Being Amazing And Having Tons Of Dwellers
8.2/10"
12879,"The quest to find a management sim to replace my HunieCam Studio addiction continues. And continues to fail.

   Well over an hour in, I don't seem terribly adept at making much progress [i]or[/i] screwing up spectacularly. So while I can't personally attest to how much forking over extra dough helps, I'm inclined to believe those who say that this game requires an extraordinary amount of grinding if you're not willing to, ahem, ""make a small donation"" in order to speed it all up.

   Honestly, after said hour-plus, I'm kinda bored. I'm still happy to ""recommend"" it, 'cause it's free, it's cute (in a bleak kinda way), and I can see it appealing to a certain kind of person. Since I'm not much of a ""grinder"", I'm sadly [i]not[/i] that kind of person.

   And whoa, some of the [i]prices[/i] you can choose to pay! I'll pass...but it was a mildly interesting experience for a wee while at least. (I certainly understand more about human reproduction now. Not to put it indelicately, but I believe one of my womenfolk may have canoodled in the diner with two men, while another woman watched. I'm not sure how she got pregnant otherwise...)

   Verdict: 6.5/10.

12880,"Subcribe to Pewdiepie !!!

12881,5/10 Gets really boring after a while and hard to earn some achievements
12882,The microtransactions are unnecessary to play the game.
12883,this shit lit on folks
12884,"Hi Fallout shelter is a great game to kill time and have some fun and if you have played other fallout games as Fallout 4 or something you can play minigames ""lose your head"" if you say incorrect aswerg you lose ur head XD and i beleve you should try it out"
12885,"It's an okay game, I'd say. At first it was on phone, and it was a pretty fun way to pass the time. The PC version is just as nice. However, the definitely freaking annoying thing with this game is that when you quit... it goes on. No save. So, you can have plenty of food, water and power, but later when you come back, boom, all of this has disappeared and you have the levels in red, with possibly one or more dead residents. It feels like having a leash and not being able to go away and have your game still in good shape, if you see what I mean? Like, if I go on vacation or I just don't have the time, I'm fucked. Not sure if I'd recommend it. I'd say yes if you're ready to get entirely addicted to something, but no if you're the busy, or just ""hobbyist"" Fallout Shelter player."
12886,BEST GAME EVAH
12887,fun and addective too
12888,"I love this game. It's addictive, intriguing, fun, triggering (deathclaw attacks) and great. The only issue I had with the game was that it lagged and the fps would go drastically down from time to time (from 60 fps to 10 or less fps). I recently noticed that this lag occurs when I play offline. It's a great game, it just needs to be a little fixed."
12889,"Highly recomdended, very addictive and a gameplay is a rollercoaster of stress and sucesses."
12890,"this game taught me that communism works, and that, men can impregnate as many women as they like.
still, chill/10."
12891,"Good game except the thing that I had to backup save files by myself.
When it crashes sometimes save file will be corrupted. Steam cloud can't restore it back.
Don't trust the developer nor steam.
It's on your own."
12892,"For a Fallout game, it gets very slow and boring after a few days. It could have been much more but Bethesda‚Äôs Greed has taken over completely, first this game and then Fallout 76. Even though its now on PC, the stench on mobile games monetization is still there and they try to get you to PAY very very very hard!

The PAY to skip the wait time BS is in everything ‚Äì quests, training, fast travel, crafting, etc. By the end of the game you unlock the Nuka Cola room that produces Nuka Cola but NOT Quantum, which is whats used as premium currency to skip the wait time BS. Really now? Pay to skip! NO just NO! Turning Players into payers!

I looked at the Store for the luls, and theres a $140 dollar Nuka Cola Quantum pack! The paywall is there and the struggle is real!!!"
12893,Only play on mobile plz
12894,yeah good
12895,No bugs No cost great little time filler more of a mobile game or one for children but hey its free
12896,"My personal experience with the game. Must be around 100-200 hours on my phone.
It's a good game:
- If you have no internet connection. 
- You didn't have time to install anything better on your phone. 
- You're desperate for escapism from you head-numbing nightmare reality.

A very big pro for this game: You can create a Bowl Cut Cult Shelter. All dwellers could be white. With bowl cuts. Just like Elliot Rodger. Even pale white if you have a decade to spare. The result will be oh so satisfying."
12897,Fuck bethesda.
12898,its originally fun but after a few hours and 30 people in its just a grind. I played to the max capacity of people and its not all that entertaining.
12899,"Fallout Shelter makes no apologies for its outrageous nature. It's a power fantasy in every sense of the phrase, placing you in a world rife with destructible environments and giving you creative instruments with which to destroy them. There are intermittent technical problems, and scripted moments detract from the freedom found elsewhere, but in the end, Fallout Shelter provides a spectacular, explosive sandbox experience.

The plot revolves around returning protagonist Rico Rodriguez, who's arrived in the fictional Republic of Medici during the height of Sebastiano Di Ravello's military dictatorship. The story here is forgettable, but delivers an effective invitation: dozens of military installations cover the world map, and it's your job to blow them up for the rebel forces.

Rodriguez himself is a mashup of masculine action stars and comic book characters, so it makes sense that I often felt like a superhero in his shoes. By supplying you with a wingsuit, parachute, and grappling hook, Fallout Shelter gives you an effective means of transportation, as well as a smooth, nuanced traversal system.

There is a steep learning curve, but with practice, I was leaping from helicopters, gliding through enemy bases, and floating over farmland with ease. It's thrilling to leap from a cliff, free-fall for 10 seconds, grapple to a nearby rock, and use the momentum to launch back into the air with parachute deployed. Rico actually felt like a hero learning his new skillset. It's as if Avalanche Studios combined Batman, Spider-Man, and The Punisher, and thrust its creation into a vivid Mediterranean landscape."
12900,meh game
12901,better than 76 said no one ever
12902,i come from the perspective of loving the original fall out games all the way to Vegas but this is addictive but ultimately unrewarding. Even if you like to play this type of game you will find a better game elsewhere.
12903,Yes I do like to experiment with my vault dweller minions

12909,"I like this game except here are some problems here are three of them

1. The starter pack is for ONE shelter ONLY so if you buy the starter pack, don't delete the shelter

2. The game is fun until you become super powerfull/ run out of room/ or complete all the quests (belive me I played for 70.6 hours)

3. Don't cheat. It bugs the game."
12910,Not my kind of game. I'd still play this over Fallout 76 though.  You've let us down Todd Howard. For shame.
12911,Worth trying. It may get you hooked.
12912,"this game is the greatest time killer what i have ever seen. But a lot of payments sometimes repel me.

but it is still better, then fallout 76

10/10"
12913,"Fallout: Micro-transactions 

I'm pretty sure this game was an experiment by Bethesda to see how people reacted to micro-transactions in their games. 

"
12914,I really did not expect much from this game.......but its kinda good
12915,"If we'll look from the REAL Fallout realitives, this game is doomed. But lets look at it like at a game with a long and weird ""storyline"" 

6/10"
12916,"I'm really confuzed why this ""game"" has so many positive reviews, it's barely a game. It's made just for micro transactions, if you like that go for it. It's ridiculously easy, no challange. Only good thing it's free to install."
12917,"Fallout Shelter is a game where the player owns his vault and can manage as he want.
The player starts with some dwells that helped build the vault, given the status of each one, if one has higher strength, it is logical to go to one of the resources that requires this status. When more features more dwells will be accurate and vice versa. They may come from the desert or as babies of the next generation.

The player can send dwells on missions that may take real time. As soon as they arrive at the destination, you have to explore by clicking and attacking the mission boss and waiting for the return of these dwells to arrive.

We must defend the vaut of the invaders from time to time, and for this the player can equip their dwells with a booed number of Armor and Weapons, being able to Crafting or catch of the dead enemies.

The only drawback to this type of games is that they are repetitive after some time, but I think the Fallout Shelter is great for chilling out in short breaks.

But attention!!!! Always record before you leave the game because otherwise you will lose all progress.

And besides it‚Äôs free, existing almost for each platform, so anyone who wants to spend a good bit in the short pause strength in it."
12918,"From the very beginning the game has small issues, but they are for the most part bearable. It feels like a rather bad PC port because of how often you will be unable to click dwellers even though you were clicking right on them, and you will often accidentally move one when trying to click-and-drag the screen. The way combat works also makes it so you will waste stimpacks and radaway very quickly, even more so when the game decides to have a difficulty spike around 50-60 dwellers.
Invasions are also done extremely poorly, and you might as well not bother upgrading your vault door or even bothering to have someone sitting on defense because of how little they matter in the end. Enemies will move from room to room so fast that your actual defending dwellers will be unable to keep up and deal any significant damage, and because combat causes a whole room to take damage over time a single entirely-random radscorpion or deathclaw attack can require you to waste half your entire supply of stimpaks. There's no actual challenge to take on, and balance never really exists in the game.

The game itself quickly becomes very frustrating to play, however. Once you reach a certain point you will end up facing enormous problems and are almost forced to pay. Not too surprising for a game like this, but considering the frustration with many other features of this game its hard to convince yourself to drop any money on it. 

Honestly, its really hard to recommend, especially if you want a game to throw money at. It has a ton of design problems that you can't even play around due to how awkwardly events are programmed. It's worth trying since its free, but you will likely uninstall before you ever consider purchasing something.

12921,meh.
12922,"Fallout Shelter is a rather lazy mobile cash in of the franchise. It lacks any kind of depth or challenge and is the kind of mindless busy work you expect from similar management sims that are a dime a dozen in any app store. Super mutants and the Brotherhood of Steel are inexplicably missing, and missions are a randomly generated exercise in tedium. This is especially true once you fully upgrade a few dwellers and they become virtually impervious to anything the Wasteland has to offer, at which point the game really starts to cry out for an Auto Play button that would auto clear missions and auto grab the loot, while you browse the web or watch a movie. There is a Survival mode which is supposedly more challenging, but considering how broken the click detection is, I can only imagine the kind of frustration that mode would entail. If losing dwellers because the game refuses to acknowledge your clicks on the stim pack button was not frustrating enough, just wait until it starts playing with your camera, zooming in every time a dialogue starts or flying to a different room altogether because something ‚Äúimportant‚Äù is happening there. The idea of being an Overseer and running your own vault is an exciting one, but sadly, this is not it."
12923,"Lacks the depth and many possible aspects of an actual game (its a mobile game, after all), but a good way to kill time every now and then. Though its wiser to grab a book :)

Wish they would make something more serious and tactical on the same subject in the future. Vault management and world exploration could have many more opportunities.."
12924,It is very fun and is hard for younger gys to play but very fun and deseves a thums up!!!!!!!
12925,Great game. Loved every minute of it. Worth every cent :)
12926,Great game!
12927,"Good, cheap way to get a casual player interested in the fallout universe, doesn't require micropurchases"
12928,it will be more fun if you have played Fallout 4 before
12929,"Pretty cool game to pass time with, to make real progress in this you need to grind though."

12931,4/10
12932,Great game! 7/10

12934,"fallout shelter could have been a really fun game if it hadnt been slowed down to strongly encourage payments, im pretty sure most of us are hitting micro fatigue at this point, its too slow to sit and focus on and its too fast to not pay attention to, they encourage tedium to get you to pay WAY HARD, i dont care about the money this game made or the generally very positive reviews, because after fallout 76 everything this game is, is nothing but a sloppy wet dick slap in the face, and its clear that if we had realized that this was a pretense of things to come, maybe we could stopped fallout 76, i just want this company to go the way of atari or sega at this point, just go the fuck away bethesda, keep your pathtic aging IP's at this point, seriously getting into this game with hindsight knowlege its pretty easy to see where the souless corruption begins, or at the very least this is when they said ""fuck it, we dont need to hide how corrupt we are, we are too greedy AND rich to bother with hiding it anymore"" or at least feigning ignorance, these fuckers should never have made or encouraged todd howard to cash in his chits with the fans to buy fallout 76, cause its been called in and now everything they do i look at from a neutral stand point, which means these guys look like disgusting garbage"
12935,"the game whas fun,but then came the new update and delete my shelter , i report it on steam and on there official website , no help from this comunity , or answer , 
for a recommend 
i like the game its fun to play if you have notting to do 
 if for support i dont recommend its not easy to contact them ,
"
12936,This is a fun game :)
12937,ok
12938,gud
12939,1 thumbs up. it keeps crashing.
12940,"First, let me say that I liked this game. It's a new take on the Fallout universe and it's fun to build. It was highly addicting, at first, but quickly becomes monotonous. Nothing ever really changes. You have the occasional attack by raiders or beasts that have little trouble destroying the vault door (with pistols or claws) and then go on a rampage through your vault. The dwellers on the floor will fight, but the rest just go about their business as if oblivious to the flashing red lights and alarms. The expeditions aren't any better. Six hours to travel to kill some raiders holed up in some SD Mart or office building. Of course, you can use some Quantum, which is rare and usually requires much more than what can be looted so must be purchased with real money or just wait and wait and wait while trying to remain interested in what's going on back at the vault. There too is a bunch of waiting to build skills so dwellers are more capable at their duties and more combat effective. I liked this game, but I cannot recommend it to any other than those with a lot of time to kill that just casually peek in on their vault from time to time. I played six days and lost interest. Have no real desire to go back either so my vault is probably dead or in dire straights anyway. In short, it's a shooting star that fizzles out rather quickly."
12941,Good game
12942,"I use to love Bethesda, now they feel like my abusive ex boyfriend."
12943,"Deleted all my progress with no reason, nice..."
12944,"This is a fun game to spend time on.
Its so satisfying looking at your little people bounce around your Vault and scream at walls. :)


Get's frustrating if you get raided. :c

7/10"
12945,GG Bethesda
12946,"An okay-ish free to play mobile game. 
I wouldn't recommend the steam version unless your like me with a cellphone made of dinosaur bones and held together with spit and dreams.

Honestly though this game should have been a pretty big sign that bethesda was going to absolutely dog bugger the fallout lore and cannon. 

Don't play it unless you've got a really crappy toaster of a PC and nothing else will run, theres probably more entertaining flash games on Newgrounds that won't try to nickle and dime you or waste every last second of your life. And unlike games like Girls Frontline or kancole collection theres no cute waifus to keep you invested/fapping like a degenerate so this game doesn't have much to offer.

Even cookie clicker has more gameplay as you have to at least click the cookie a few hundered times to get yourself started properly. 

Also please god tell me no one has picked up the 140 dollar nuka cola quantum pack."
12947,"Why not? This game was already very nice for the mobile phone.
Just play it with some other games.
You wait and wait for your friend in civ ? Well play Fallout Shelter in this time.
"
12948,The only thing more constant then death claw attacks is crashes
12949,"One of those casual ""running in the background"" style games where you play a bit here and there, but with the time gating getting longer and longer with my progress I mostly lost interest at a certain point, it's good for a free game, worth checking out, but there's little gratification down the line. If the game weren't free then I wouldn't recommend it, but with the sheer quality differences among free games I'd say this is middle of the road, it's got the same downsides as most."
12950,"I broke the game pregnant women cant die, i win send all men out to wastes, and have only female dwellers, you have beaten the game, your welcome"
12951,better then 76 lmao
12952,use to love the game on mobile but it keeps crashing on pc uninstalled nd reinstalled it 2 times still crashes
12953,"Very addicting game, you'll wanna play it until the very end. I hate this game but also love it."
12954,I like it you can even get it on mobile!!!
12955,I like it.
12956,"BEST ""FREE"" GAME ON THE MARKET!!!

I've always had a passion for Bethesda's work, from the first production, onwards: they have continuously brought out some of the most entertaining games within their genra... never failing, beautiful, exciting, time tested artwork.

Shelter, while a simplified version of survivalism/ basebuilding/ rpg, proves yet again that Bethesda understands their customer's desires.

I personnally played the beta, prior to mission inclusion, without purchasing any accesories; finding it possible to enjoy without spending any money what-so-ever. That simple fact (they are not putting their hand out for a quick buck, as so many other developers do) has allowed me to make in game purchases enhancing my gameplay; all without having buyers remorse.

Support Developers that deserve it!!! Bethesda is among a few, who provide true love to their art <3"
12957,fhh
12958,"Hard to do Even on Mobile 
the First time i built a power generator the fricking room caught on fire
and i lost 1 person"
12959,love it
12960,i play this in class to make school fun ;). my grades may be low but my level is high!
12961,"great game i love killing the ghouls bc it reminds me of the japs in ww2, with their heads popping off and shit."
12962,its fun thats it
12963,"Very nice game no complains so far

And still better than Fallout 76 :)"
12964,Still better than Fallout 76 xD
12965,Awesome
12966,Good at start but gets boring once you progress 7/10
12967,one of the best Bethesda games I have played yet.
12968,still better than 76
12969,"It's fairly dull. Just regulating meters and buying more rooms. Every once in a while it shoves a microtransaction down your throat as though Bethesda doesn't have enough money. Not all that rewarding, just an endless loop of waiting for water and power. Don't see the appeal."
12970,"Another game that does nothing but crash, what a timeline we live in."
12971,One of my favourite free to play games can't wait for Elder Scrolls Blades :)
12972,"I played this game a long time ago, and I just rediscovered it. It has been greatly improved from when I last played it. I like how there is a quest aspect to it now, and many other things. It makes it so I'm less bored with it. It's no longer trying to maintain a vault, and just waiting for my dwellers to get things done. Now, I can use them to go on quests, and other things."
12973,"Fun, addictive, free to play game. I check up on my little dwellers a couple times a day ^_^"
12974,I feel sorry for anyone who paid for Quantum Nuka-Colas.
12975,build house for tiny baby
12976,"No depth, base building starts to get repetitive once you have the rooms to boost special statis.
Quests are stupidly designed, with the 1200 hour wait time, there is no point to read background story as you are goona forget it when quest begun. Having to search for loot manually in every room is also a pain in the ass."
12977,"Won't get banned if I cheat.

4/10"
12978,A very nice and relaxing stratagy game.
12979,fun little game
12980,"Addictive Game
Better than Fallout 76"
12981,"check out my fallout project at #https://www.renaissancemusings.com/mutants-welcome-c

I like fallout shelter. I'm using it to think of ideas for my fallout 4 mod. im out of building space but i have a lot of space in fallout shelter, so i will continue designing with it. my dwellers can't seem to reach max occupancy of rooms."
12982,10/10 would use save editor again.
12983,"It is a very addicting game, but after a while there isn't really much to it anymore, since there's nothing new left to build in your vault (I personally reached this point very quickly). I think it would've been more fun if there were more different structures to build. The game is also pretty easy to play (too easy in my opinion), but besides these points, I think Fallout Shelter is one of the best free games out there, so it's definitely worth a play. :-)"
12984,"Survival, crafting, base building and micro management game developed by Bethesda as an offspin for the Fallout series. It is well made and fun to play.

Fallout Shelter is a Free to Play (F2P) idle progression game that wears a mask. It pretends to be more of a base building game and a survival crafting game but really it is just another idle progression game. You must send a dweller out into the Wasteland to explore and bring home resources and those all important Caps. You don't controll that dweller it just does everything on its own and it takes time, while that dweller is out there you concentrate on building your base out, you can build power, storage, living quarters and a canteen for food. Each room must have at least one dweller in to produce whatever resource they are making, it takes time. You can eventually have upto 6 dwellers in a single room which speeds up the process of making resources and you can also build a large variety of rooms. 

Dwellers each have their S.P.E.C.I.A.L skills that can be trained up in training rooms similar to the Fallout series and more dwellers can be found in the Wasteland or by opening lunchboxes. Lunchboxes can be either found when doing quests in the Wasteland, by completing challenges or you can choose to buy them with real money. Most of your dwellers will come from breeding with each other in the living quarters. Once a male dweller warms upto a female dweller they will begin dancing and one thing leads to another and you have a child.

Once you have built the Overseer's Office you can send upto 3 dwellers on a quest in the Wasteland to fetch certain rewards, these can be anything from Nuka Cola Quantum, Lunchboxes, Pets, Outfits, Weapons and so on. There are quite often new daily and weekly quests to go on and when there are Seasonal updates such as Halloween or Christmas there are also some special outfits and themed quests you can go on too. Seasonal updates also change the look of diners and living quarters in your vault.

All in all this is a very fun free game to play, I love the fallout theme, the base building and crafting gear or weapons, personally I like the idle progression type aspect to the game and I think that the fact you don't need to spend real money in the game to enjoy it has been done really well, all things can be earned in game without spending money.

Is hard to farm,but is something different and I accept that.
It's worth playing=))
This game deserves to give her a 9,I do not like the place of construction small(down),the content of the game is small,should have more things...
Have a nice day/night!"
12986,Better than Fallout 76
12987,"8/10 
Fallout Shelter is a great game for spending alot of hours into. It was a mobile game from the beginning with classic mobile gameplay when you play 10 minutes every few hours. For free it's a great game with long gametime, but there isn't any endgame and from stereotype when you will be after few hours of the game it will be pretty much the same after you reach maximum number of dwellers but with some limitations and awful situations. For example, some great dweller found your vault, or dropped from lootbox and you want him, so you need to just abandon one of your current dwellers and let him go out. What I mean, it's great game for free, but i would be so much happier if they did free version and paid version, with endgame, with more content. It's good to see game like this, but after more than hundred of hours (mobile + pc) i would appreciate endgame, support for developers and more content. For me, after what is Bethesda doing with their normal games and how stupid they are, this is for me the best game made by Bethesda (not included Prey, Doom etc made by other developers and just published by Bethesda."
12988,BETHESDA! :steamsad:
12989,So addicting!! I love the strategy needed to keep ypur people happy and alive. It's comepletely free too! I have a more detailed review here https://jaxsreviews.wordpress.com/2018/11/20/fallout-shelter/
12990,"What is there to say? It's fun, it's mildly addictive, it's Fallout, and it's free."
12991,Where is the sex in this game?
12992,fun love it
12993,"Fun little game, gets a little slow sometimes though. Close it and its fun again the next day. My advice is build an overseer office, it makes the game a lot more fun. I like that this game is playable without the need to take part in the pay to win stuff."
12994,"Make no mistake, this is a PC port of a moblie game full of microtransations. Still better than Fallout 76."
12995,"There are just so many things wrong with this ""game"", that I can't be bothered to list them all."
12996,"What a shame, this could have been a realy great little game if it wasn't for the dirty great big pay wall stuck in front of you.  If you want to make any headway in this game you have to either invest the best part of your life or your wallet.
Iv'e thumbed this game down only because there is no inbetween. 
"
12997,Very addictive!
12998,I love this game!!!! I totally recommand it!!!
12999,"good game,"
13000,Game is far to slow and repeadative. Cant imagine how bad the game mechanics become after more play.
13001,"I have played this game for almost 300 hours over 3 computers. One this game was meant to be nothing more than a fancy advertisement for Fallout 4 so if you get any enjoyment out of the game great but what is here is here and don't expect any new content. It probably isn't going to happen.

I have lost a few people occasionally, maybe 5 total and usually because I leave them dead for too long. You are the 'overseer' you are supposed to watch all your people from 1 to 203! I have heard a few complaints about losing a vault. Lost a vault, never, maybe your if computer corrupted your file but that doesn't mean it is the games fault.

Moving your people is easy but tricky. It has a 2D/3D feel which anyone has tried to code knows is difficult at best. The nice thing is that it highlights the toon you are moving and gives you a green frame where you are dropping them. 

You can zoom using your mouse and scroll or select with either mouse buttons. Much more convenient than to make you have to use one button for one and one for the other. Otherwise, you have to code left and right-hand options, why do that?

Also, the vault isn't so big that you have to go more than half a page down unless you do some weird design layout which is your option but not necessary.

My only complaint about the quests is running out of them... but I guess if I wanted more I could start another vault there are spots for four but I only play one vault on my PC and one on my tablet... yep, you can get the game for free on your tablet too. Good time waster if you are having to wait on people and need something you can close quick.

Saves in the middle of events or any other time quickly and easily."
13002,"You are the Overseer of an uderground vault after a nuclear apocalypse.  Decide where to build, what to build and who mans the stations.  Send the dwellers into the wastelands on adventures who then come back with great rewards.  It's not always easy running the vault.  Wastleland monsters and raiders are constantly trying to get in and kill the dwellers!  Give your dwellers guns to fight back.  Manage the vault well and watch it grow....mismanage it and suffer the consequences.  Strategy is key.  Try to get Bottle and Cappy as soon as possible.  Bottle will sometimes give you a Nuka-Cola on the house!!!  Free to play!"
13003,Its So Beautiful
13004,"Fallout Shelter is a Mobile game. It is fun and addictive. (There is microtransaction, but they are not neccesery)

Charming little game, that can definately keep you entertained for hours!"
13005,"The perfect game to vent out your emotions on small little people who try to survive a nuclear fallout's aftermath! You can build your vault, assign them rooms, force them to do whatever you feel like and entertain yourself whenever you feel like playing a less challenging game."
13006,"[h1]Fallout Shelter[/h1]
Fallout Shelter is a free2play mobile game based on the Fallout franchise that was ported to pc and console due to its popularity. The story is extremely minimal; you are the overseer of a vault, and your job is to build and maintain your vault. giving your dwellers jobs, making them happy, have them ""reproduce"" so you have more dwellers to populate the vault, protecting them from the wasteland (or sending them out into the wasteland to look for supplies). and when you get enough dwellers (18 to be precise) you can send a team of dwellers on special missions that can get you some decent supplies if completed. but the main job of an overseer is...to rebuild America. pretty much the game is a resource management sim based in the Fallout universe. you have to juggle power, food, and water. if you don't have food or water, your dwellers die, the more dwellers you get, the more rooms you'll need, which means you need more power, you also need to make sure your dwellers are happy, so they make more resources. There are also other rooms, such as stat rooms (which train your dweller's special stats), med bays and science labs (which allow you to produce Stimpacks and Radaway respectively), crafting rooms (where you can craft weapons, outfits and even themes that change the decor of your diners and living quarters), dweller quarters (which you need for housing dwellers as well as dweller ""reproduction"") and many more!

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Simple click and drag gameplay, that's easy to learn
+ A cute cartoony art style
+ Fun quests to send your dwellers on
+ You can customize your dweller's names and appearances.
+ a survival mode for expert players. Your vault will have constant attacks, resources deplete faster and if any your dwellers die, they die permanently (this mode is not for the faint of heart)
+ It's free

[b]Cons[/b]
-  Lootboxes. Lootboxes in any game are absolute garbage, do not buy them! Don't make the mistake I did and buy fallout shelters Lootboxes (i brought the cheapest pack when the game was first brought to pc, and I only ever did this once), because if you lose your save file, all that money you spent is wasted. But if you REALLY want them for whatever reason, you can always get a Fallout Shelter savefile editor and just spawn some in. and for those who are worried... No, because it's an offline, singleplayer game, so you won't get a VAC-ban for editing the savefiles (mainly pointing this out because I've seen people ask that question in the past), also, no, there is nothing wrong with ""cheating"" in a single player game.
- It can get a bit repetitive and boring after a few days
- This is more of a minor complaint, but I wish that there were more enemy types that you could encounter on quests (some example that would be cool; Super Mutants, mirelurks, Enclave soldiers, robots, giant ants or even synths. More varieties of enemies would have been cool)

All in all, the PC port of Fallout Shelter is okay for a free2play game (unlike the Xbox and PlayStation ports of this game. Those had absolute shit controls). It can get quite boring after a while though, but at the very least it's free."
13007,Gwud Gwame 7/10
13008,"Its a good game but I wouldnt reccomend any Purchases. 
There are online hacks that let you change your source code so you can have everything for free.
Im not advocating this but its a good way to get the same experience for no cost instead of spending a lot of money only to realize that the only difference was a few changes in the lines of code.

"
13009,A lot of fun. Kinda hard to keep my dewellers happiness up but still fun.
13010,"Switching to resolution 1280x768 failed, trying lower one
All resolution switches have failed
Screen: DX11 could not switch resolution (1920x1080 fs=0 hz=0)

C¬¥mon, no one knows how to fix this?"
13011,"A lot of these free to play games are pretty cheap and unenjoyable, however, Fallout Shelter is a very good example of NOT this. Instead of rare and legendary items being a hassle to get to like in other free to play games, Bethesda's game is very generous by offering a Vault Lunch Box at leasy every 7 days launching and playing the game, and offers these lunchboxes as rewards for quests by sending out vault dwellers or by completing challenges around the vault. Of course there is an option to purchase them if you really want to. For me the game doesn't get boring, collecting vast amounts of loot, items and weaponry is always a thrill as I increase the strength of my vault and ensure each and every vault member becomes stronger and stronger on their own with higher levels and better weaponry. A game which allows you to get high up, for free and with some fun, is what Fallout Shelter is. The combat system is simple, yes, but it doesn't seem to get to me as I build my vault larger and stronger, explore the locations of the wasteland, and complete all of the quests I got with my special team of elite vault dwellers. One of the best free to play games out there, for sure."
13012,luz dis gam
13013,Still better than Fallout 76
13014,I liked it at first but then i don't know why i kept losing... there seems to be a problem with my built.... it takes too long to have a new worker.. or im just being too lazy to wait..

13018,"One of the best idle games out there, really cool mechanics and art style. It is free to play, with the money you can spend in game just helps speed things up but to be honest its much more fun going it slow and to enjoy it.

13045,Great game.
13046,this game is like fallout 76 but better
13047,"Fallout Shelter does not offer a story-filled experience, but the action revolves around gathering resources and clicking. It, like many other idle games, consists of short sessions during which only the necessary things are done. The collection of resources takes place in an instant, and no other activity takes much time.

In addition to collecting, the brave can be sent to explore the environment and their activities will be monitored in real time in the form of text. In this case, your own imagination acts as an illustrator. A fun feature, even though the events are almost the same all the time.

The visual style works just as well as the original Fallout. It even works so well that it gives the desire to play through Fallout: New Vegas again.
Fallout Shelter is a bomb-proof package for a true fan, in which even real money may be accidentally embedded."

13056,yup
13057,"Rating: 4.0/5.0

I have played Fallout Shelter on Android and iOS first, but always felt there was something missing. For me, mobile is a system for casual gaming only, where you make few clicks and then close the game for couple of hours or a day. I was never very interested to advance in the game on its mobile version. I have decided to play this game again on PC and boy the experience is totally different! I like it a lot. When I have some work to do on my computer I keep it open but do not ignore it and keep playing and making some changes. Those little Dewllers has become important to me! The game is very addictive and I am taking my time in advancing.

I have to say that the game plays very well with mouse and keyboard as well as a controller (I used both Steam and PS4 controllers). The experience is flawless in both cases. I thought this game was a casual one that is why it is available on mobile platform but if you play it more you will know that it is not, it is more a game of micromanagement that needs you to play actively. You will advance faster and grow further if the game is open and you actively playing it which I like.

Fallout Shelter is more fun on PC than on mobile, The micromanagement aspect of it needs you to have the game open and you actively playing it. I rate Fallout Shelter 4.0 stars out of 5.0 for the addicition and replayability values."
13058,not bad
13059,"You can't just make an addictive game for the entire Fallout fanbase and do it entirely free of charge. 
Bethesda did just that."

13061,"Ok so basically... it's fun for the first 15 minutes. Then you pretty much have to grind an hour a day for a week just to upgrade once on a single room, rinse and repeat. One of my buddies showed me an easy hack that made the game actually fun and allowed me not to spend real money on this pay-to-win mobile port. I only reccomend this game if you mod it."
13062,Sch√∂ner Zeitvertreib.
13063,"i cant play because my view of the came keeps on flying up to the top left corner, i can use R2 and L2 to move around but it still wont work !!! Can Someone please help me ?????!!!!!"
13064,this is a good game xD
13065,This Game Is Awesome
13066,"So what is there to say? It's any other Fallout. But, without all of the fun fighting mechanics or missions. It's clever, and simple. Being an Overseer is fun, and it puts you into the shoes of a real one. It's brighter than most Fallout games, it's easy to control, and the premise is easy to grasp. So, in all, I recommend Fallout Shelter to anybody who thought, ""I wonder how it feels to manage a vault.""  Play if you don't have the money for Fallout 4!"
13067,i love this game
13068,i think this is a good game nut it needs something more.
13069,"Fun F2P.  Eventually feels a little overwhelming. For instance, once u have 150+ dwellers, it feels like all u can do to collect ur resources, let alone play quests.  Mr Handy's help with that, but u may need to spend $ for it to make enough of a difference.  Microtransactions in this game don't feel invasive, but may feel necessary in the aforementioned situation. Still, a great way to waste some time."
13070,10/10. Best fallout game by a landslide
13071,This is such a good game. My dwellers are quite happy in my vault so far. Well done Bethesda Game Studios!
13072,"played fallout shelter quite a bit and since i have a 30 minute bus ride to school cause im the last to get picked up in the morning and an hour bus ride on the way home from school cause im the last to get dropped off after school, i have to say its nice to have something to do on the boring ass bus rides other than listen to music and sleep lol
have to say, it IS fun but once you reach the ""end game"" or max out everything you can in your vault (which i havent done yet, but still), the game can get boring because of lack of content :/ 
But it would be nice if maybe there was new content added to expand the game with a bigger max vault dweller limit (higher then 200), and maybe more weapons, armor, definitely new rooms for the vault to expand with, and maybe even more places to explore on quests, or a new similar to quests exploration type mode
That would be nice to see :)"
13073,One of the best free to play games.
13074,Failing is the key to wining in this game!
13075,Funny game
13076,nice game
13077,Can't have enough Mr.Handy
13078,da best to waste ur worthless life
13079,More Fallout than Fallout 76.
13080,"Gets booring pretty fast. Felt like you could do so much more...

Shame."
13081,"can bethesda stop.

Dont try to make money on and offline game lol

People literally can edit their save games smh"
13082,Really great game for playing whilst working on something different. The dialogues implemented in the game are always funny and really do fit the humour of the Fallout franchise. The graphics are nicely done and the quests are¬¥nt too repetitive due to the fact that you can always dicover new locations and places.
13083,Good game.
13084,Good wee game. Slightly annoying some of the quests are a joke the later you go in the game for example your dwellers being killed by one single hit regardless of health.
13085,I have like a lot about how the game was played out and it is overall a good game.
13086,great time killer
13087,Nice
13088,Better than Fallout 76.
13089,"Pros:
--Free to play (but do have optional micro-transactions)
--Simple and relaxed concept. Equip and send someone scavenge the wastelands, or send a team of 3 do quests. Build and upgrade your vault shelter.
--Great for achievements hunters. They`re somewhat easy to do, but require some grinding. On a side note about the legendary dweller one, you can found duplicates of a legendary dweller you already have and they`ll all count towards the achievements. You have the achievement with 20 Sarah Lyons, for example.

Cons: 
--That being said, doing all this stuff will eventually get repetitive. Although, some quests will appear for a limited time. Like in Halloween or Thanksgiving period, and give limited edition outfits and stuff.
--The click and drag function can get glitchy by having the camera dragged instead of a dweller, it`s really annoying.
--Strangely enough, no super mutants in this game. I mean, seriously?!? Human kindness wasn`t even great enough to put Strong as a legendary dweller. Sad.."
13090,Nice game
13091,"Fun at first, get boring later"
13092,Decent game if you're looking to pass time.
13093,Fun time passer

13097,Good fun.
13098,really amazing game. a lot of thpught and hard work has been put into it and it is worth adding to your library.
13099,Great Game!
13100,"Wait times are incredibly long, but overrall it is excelent to pass the time, I sent my dwellers before going to work on quest so by the time I get back home they have reach they objective."
13101,I can not stop playing this game. Help!
13102,This is a Fallout game that gives you choice which i like.
13103,Like on phone but on PC.
13104,It has to be the best game for OCD people in my oppinion.The level of attention to stats that influence eachother and other things you need to keep in mind before you make a decission is the highest i ever seen in a game that can be played for as little as 1 to 2 hours per day.
13105,This mobil game could very well of had the same development time as fallout 76. It worked for this title
13106,"Best relaxing-time game EVER!
This game came out when I was still in middle school!
And now I am on my way to college. This game is still releasing new stuff!
Thanksgiving update includes new clothes, weapons, quests, and themes!
All these drew me back to this game.
Unbelievable game producers!
Keep up the good work!"
13107,Really good and addictive. One of the best free games I ever played!
13108,Good fun as a random game to play when you don't have hours to spend in another game
13109,Very fun game!! Kinda hard without lunchboxes though. Helps with wanting to play fallout but not real fallout. My nomination!
13110,good
13111,funny little game to check in once a in while.
13112,amusing diversion
13113,"Decent time killer set in Fallout Universe, YAY!

13154,"After all this time I still find myself coming back to the game, creating a new vault and enjoying all the little tasks like going on quests and training an army of uber dwellers. It‚Äôs very entertaining and charming with its cartoonish art style, even if it gets too repetitive after a while it‚Äôs best if you just let it rest and come back after a few months to try experiment some more with the vault."
13155,Not bad for time wasting.

13160,Ge me that steam awards badge
13161,"I used to play this game on my tablet when it first came out. I decided to pick it up again as a way to kill time when doing other tasks. The nice thing about this game is that while there are microtransactions you don't necessarily have to ""pay to win"" like other free to play games. While it certainly becomes redundant after some time, the nice thing is you can easily pick the game back up after being away from it."

13173,Great Game
13174,This is a brilliant little fun game.. good for killing the time and ive been playing this via my phone since its release.. love the art style and is all round a well made game. Was over the moon when I see this on Steam. Well worth a try.. its free too! :)
13175,Good for quick brakes
13176,Really good game for a smartphone app.
13177,It's a boring repetitive game that shoves micro transactions down your throat.
13178,Nice
13179,Good
13180,This game does take some time but once you get everything you need you'll basically have a vault that runs on it's own
13181,Normal and Survival modes are completly different games(if you want to roleplay a bit and with no donate=) ).
13182,"A fun resource base management game, fallout style. 
You have to manage a base and grow it so that your base can stand up to raids from the wasteland and have enough resources to go around.
There is an option to pay to make the game  easier, but that isn't necessary.
A nice feature that I enjoy, is that certain rooms can change their look to be more festive. For Halloween, rooms had bats and pumpkins for decorations and an orange and black coloring. For fall/Thanksgiving, there are assortment of colors and leaf decorations but I haven't seen a turkey... yet."
13183,"Pretty fun game for some time, but then it gets boring for doing everything same every single day. Should make those 20 legendary dwellers kinda easier to get. Overall 5/7."
13184,Good game !
13185,"Maybe a mobile game ported to Steam, but one of the best free to play games on Steam. 

Game is very generous with lunchboxes and nuka cola to the point I've never felt it would be to anyone's advantage to buy any packs, so can be truly F2P (hopefully the devs don't read this!)"
13186,Love Fallout Shelter and you will to
13187,Simple hotel and restaurant management game with a twist. Reminds me of those classic Playfish games on Facebook. Still overall an amusing time waster. :)

13208,Meh.
13209,good game to waste a little free time
13210,"The pain of having your level 25 homebody eaten by radioactive roaches while you are hunting down that ever elusive spy is such a beer drinking experience.

13211,A game I can keep going back to
13212,free is good.
13213,"I can't believe this game is free! The microtransactions are done well, I don't need to pay to play or advance in the game. The only problem I had is that from time to time you have to wait and you have nothing to do in the game. Overall - great game"
13214,Its good when your boring and have litterally no other games to play...its a waste of time if the save does not store online... and easily get deleted of 1years worth  of stuff and items that u buy using money....good game i guess?
13215,as fun as free can be
13216,GOTY.
13217,A fun little time waster.
13218,"Pretty terrible PC port. Reversed scroll directions, buggy seasonal events. Strange bugs that wipe challenge progress. This is just a microtransaction hole/money maker. Aside from the recent Hallowe'en bug that somehow locked up two of my vaults behind constant crashes, all the bugs are small but add up to an experience that is a pale shadow of the initial iOS and Android offering."
13219,Better than Fallout 4? Maybe.
13220,Definitely obsessed with this game for a good chunk of the year-- very fun

13238,"I've spent way too much time in this game, but it's a chill game and just pretty fun."
13239,"A fun game to pass the time. No need to purchase anything, do the quests when you're able and you'll find that you have everything you need. As of 2-27-19, I've been getting these crash reports and they happen right before the game loads. Download at your own risk, but you can probably get by without this Bethesda title in your library."
13240,Fallout Shelter is a fun little game that i enjoy
13241,"Free, fun!"
13242,"Great time killer, over time, not all at once.

The best tip I can give anyone who gives this a go is to be patient. Don't worry about trying to rush progress. 

The game is also intended for those who intend to spend time over several months playing it, so if you like to smash out progress, then this isn't the game for you.

Even with a lucky start, progress will be slow. Even once you have made progress, progress will be slow. 
To make a legendary weapon, it takes 10 days to craft. I'm at the point where only legendary weapons will improve my dwellers and that kind of time for crafting massively delays any real progress once you get to the midway point of the game. Missions are beginning to take between 1/2 and a full day to travel to. 

This is in no way a negative review, the only negative aspect I have found in the game is the quest combat, which has gotten my dwellers killed a couple of times as they sometimes like to run to the opposite side of a room before they start shooting the first enemy they passed. Sometimes they just forget to shoot at all for like 10 seconds. Sometimes you will get a mission which requires everyone to be in hazmat suits, but be aware, it's a trick. Forget the radaways because the real danger is damage.

All in all, solid game, solid gameplay for what it is. Enjoyable but it starts to fade as you make progress and realize further progress takes ridiculous time."
13243,MY NAM3J3F
13244,This looks better than fallout 76 WOW
13245,"Got addicted on my phone. Saw it on Steam, got addicted at my couch.

Pay to win REALLY sucks however. Still enjoyed it though."
13246,Fabulous!!
13247,"Great little game being for free.

Was fun to go on missions and see whats out there for a while.
It did become a bit repetitive after a while but worth a play though for sure.
The camera moving about was sometimes annoying in that it would not select what you wanted but otherwise a fun little game and well worth it. Even if you buy the initial $4.99 starter pack will save you heaps of time and recommended.
"
13248,Best free game
13249,"Fallout Shelter is probably one of the most fun mobile games I have ever played and it still remains fun on PC. The game has a lot of depth, fun gameplay, lots of content and oozes Fallout atmosphere pretty much every and anywhere.

Just save yourself the trouble of going for microtransactions. They're not worth it."
13250,Very nice. A role model for all the clicker/builder type of games.
13251,Really great game!
13252,"Very fun game, it's like a Sim Tower or Yoot Tower but with quests to do. I enjoyed playing it a lot the first 20 hours, very addictive but after that 20hour point it becomes repetitive and boring. The game could be way more fun it they spiced it up with different kind of quests perhaps when taking a quest a minigame would start and there would be at least 16 different types of minigames when taking a quest. Also making it multiplayer would be cool too like two people working on the same vault and the taking over other vaults. Anyway this game is already abandoned so that won't be happening but it would be cool if it ever did, would make this game almost perfect, as it is right now it's good but will get very boring the more you play it. I will recommend it cuz it's free and it will provide some free entertainment for a while."
13253,"If you ever wanted to be the Overseer of a Sims vault, (After the Nukes) Then this is your game."

13269,20 hours on pc and lost track on cell.  really like this game.  its good for passing time.  when working you can run in windows mode.  i just been palying way sick.  passing time. and i guess i got stock in it again. lol
13270,"Keeps you busy with something for a bit, and you can have pretty good fun on it if you use mobile if you are on the go and have nothing else to do, for instance. But after you max out everyone as well as getting the maximum amount of rooms and people in your base or even the best weapons and armors, you don't have much to do other than just quests, and those quickly become boring as well, just go into a room, wait until they are done killing them, move to next room, and if they are low on health or have too much radiation, just give them a stimpak or radaway. That is the stuff that gets boring after a while."

Nice graphics too, no lagg or buggs just manny things to do in your own vault."

13290,My dwellers banging each other.
13291,"Fallout Shelter is a charming little casual Free 2 Play basebuilding game.

The game is playable without Pay 2 Win features which is a definate improvement over most Free 2 Play titles.   There is no PvP mode, which further reduces the problematic behavior of Pay 2 Win.

Unfortunately there aren't purchase limits and most of the purchases are ""boxes"" with unknown content.  Two negative points on the whole Pay 2 Win aspect. 

For Linux users it works near perfectly with Linux under SteamPlay.

As of the game itself, it is plenty fun and will keep you occupied for several hours.   It is well worth the try.  I more then recommend the game."
13292,"Niceness
"
13293,"A good game for wasting time, entertaining and the beginning but becomes repetitive in the endgame. The most fun part in my opinion is when you are just starting out and setting up your vault. It‚Äôs a good game, even if it is old and isn‚Äôt updated anymore."
13294,"Basically a clicker game with some resource management and explore-fight-and-loot quests once you have the overseer center to send your dweller out to specific locations, not just wasteland exploration in general. And if the game runs you MUST click the rooms to collect power, water and food (or have Mr. Handy do that) or you will quickly have everyone die.
It starts of very slow and only becomes more of a real game that keeps you occupied once you have the overseer command center and some dweller to spare for sending them out on quests. I'm currently at a bit over 80 dweller and have frequent attacks by very strong ghoul hordes or those ... upright giant rat like creatures. They do a LOT of damage so I have my upper floor full of guards, the whole 3-room barrack just after the vault door is just full with heavily armed guards by now as they cause so much damage otherwise if they break through. And I go through the stimpaks at frightening paces.
Keeps me quite busy.

But it becomes hard to manage the vault at this size already. You barely ever see the spy to click him and it needs crazy amounts of caps to upgrade rooms like the nuclear plant or the water purification facility (9000? 15,000? Seriously??). The quests don't yield even remotely enough caps to handle this and the weapon I find are way too weak and mostly useless but salvage gives only items that are of no need to craft the high level ones. I basically have a storage of 120 nearly constantly full but can't craft anything useful as the items I lack never drop in salvage or quests or exploration. Free exploration causes usually the explorer to end up dead as the mobs over a few hours or over night just get too much. Can't send them off with so mach stimpaks to survive and reviving them costs quite a few caps again...

So with a bit over 18 hours in after a few month I must say I enjoyed the recent Halloween event but don't feel to pay a cent for this nor play much further. It just seems pointless grindy and frustrating inventory management after a while."
13295,It's good!
13296,"This is a very addictive game, as someone who has completed all of the fallout games this was a nice step back from the FPS style of fallout 4. I love the survival aspects of the game and it is not one of those pay to win kinda games, overall I love the game and highly recommend it to people who like a nice casual game."
13297,nope
13298,"If you say that this is Fallout for poor people, you would be completely right! 
But hear me out, this game is actually enjoyable, the amount of stuff that goes on at the same time really makes you pay attention and the stuff you have to go through to keep your survivors alive is absolutely hard sometimes. Also, the fact that you can give each weapon and armor to whoever you want and also change their names makes this game even better, really gives the player a choice.
I liked it.

13299,Its a fun pass time. It runs on anything. I usually play it while waiting for something else to download in the background
13300,"Maybe one of the very best free games ever made. Addictive, clever, with varied contents, and micro-transactions are not mandatory to have fun. Though if you're on a hurry, you'll certainly find them quite good and rather cheap. Mixes basic strategy with basic RPG, with a pinch of the Fallout dark humour that most of us love."
13301,"IMO somewhat rekindles the elements that made Dungeon Keeper a joy to play, without trying to imitate it (War for the Overlord, Dungeons). I actually prefer this game over those two examples!
And ofc the only phone app I used that's designed for it, with Hearthstone as the apex."
13302,Game is overall good but the grind is annoying sometimes.
13303,Fun but repetitive and this idea has been used so many times. Its great to see it in the fallout universe though.
13304,its meh but its free
13305,A classic mobile phone hit really shines on the PC. Using an exploit to edit your time turns this into a play and wait managemnt game into a fallout vault management sim game. The game is still good if you don't do this but it will turn it from 10 minute game sessions 2 times a day into many hours. If you like the management side of this game then using the exploit will make it alot better. As a wait management game it isw still one of the best so whatever type of playing you like to do with your games you can achieve that satisfaction from your Overseer managing needs
13306,It is pretty good!
13307,‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏ô‡∏∞
13308,"It free to play so why hate? I literally play it 10 - 15 minutes a day (occasionally more depending on completion times), managing the vault and sending dwellers on quests.  Fun and simple."
13309,really good game but too easy to hack 9/10
13310,"So addictive in the beginning, nice to ""play"" on second screen while watching fe. netflix.

Then u reach the max 200 dwellers. The game stops going forward. There is nothing to do.
At this point there is nothing else than achievements left. 

I'll collect them so I can get rid of this.

BUT, since it's free, I cant really expect more :D

"
13311,Nice game :)
13312,Really fun game
13313,Ya its missing from the library - this is a bad fix
13314,"pretty good for a free game. its like a mobile game with lots of timed upgrades and waiting involved, but besides it feels a bit like the sims. 
easy to play while having it in background."
13315,Fun game to play for 1-2 hour a day.
13316,"its a fun lil moble game to kill time when there nothing else to do, just wish there was more to do to wander around, and better written quest (instead of returning to vault for ever bloody thing when theres no point, just follow the quest further into with out returning to vaul since theres no ammo useage."
13317,omg good game nice
13318,"*Sends dwellers on a quest*

*They arrive after a couple of hours*

''I've heard word of a settlement that needs our help'' 

*Abandons quest*

"
13319,"Alright micro-management sim to have in the background while you're doing something else, gets boring fast though, levelling up does not enhance the gameplay, it only makes the automated battles less tedious. Do NOT spend actual money on anything, you can give yourself as many loot-boxes and bottles you want with a simple free edit mod. 

Disappointed the vaults only in-game purpose is to protect the dwellers, no experiments. Missed opportunity."
13320,only pay to win.
13321,Great time killer
13322,"Awsome game!
I've enjoyed on regular and survival mode (not for the faint of heart)"
13323,Game crashed at 31 hours and deleted entire vault. No chance of recovery without seperate backup save. Uninstalling the game.
13324,"NICE GAME, played on the phone version but it just didnt feel right so i switch to pc version"
13325,"Okay so i have played this game for close to 200 hours now and I guess its my turn to give my opinion.
I think this is a great game definitely cuz its free to play, this game could have a max cost of 5 euro but not more cuz this game is not that big more of a game u just chill with late at night. I think the layout and the concept is nice but can get kinda boring after a while. The first hour its kinda fun but then until u can build the overseers office it just a grind. As fast as u get the overseers office the game gets much more fun and interesting. Just give itn some time!

I recommend this game and why not try it I mean its free so give it a go! Btw since the game is free why not buy some ingame stuff to support the game developers for the good job. ;*"
13326,A great game for something that's free. There's a lot of things you can do both inside and outside the vault that will keep you entertained for long hours.
13327,"As is already normal from Bethesda they like to ""port"" all his games everywhere.
Fallout Shelter is a smartphone game that was released in 2015 for Android and IOS, which took to the mobile devices all the hype that was around the universe Fallout with the release of Fallout 4.
I liked to see the game here on the PC but did not notice anything new or different.
It's obviously a thumbs up, but more for my experience of the game itself that from my experience here on the PC."
13328,nice game to pass time.
13329,"Fallout Shelter is a free to play management game with quests, combat, and baby-making. Everything is very easy to learn and pick up and all of the different activities are more than enough to keep one occupied.

The Vault Dwellers, the characters you control, all work very smoothly and offer some humorous comments or easter eggs from time to time.

My only gripe with the game is that it will get stale after a while, but before then you should be able to get in plenty of time to enjoy all of the various actions and events Fallout Shelter has to offer.

10/10, really worth giving it a try."
13330,"Honestly, the game isn't that bad. Very frustrating if you want to speedrun getting a lot of stuff, however."
13331,"Fallout Shelter isn't really a game, it's a trap designed to waste your time. Gameplay consists of sending settlers to rooms, that's it. There's timers for everything. Do yourself a favour and stay far away from this, even if you love Fallout as much as i do."
13332,Fallout Shelter is a fun building/survival game that I have enjoyed playing for a long time. It is a good addition to the fallout series and I would reccomend it to you as well!
13333,"A silly version of an overfed Fallout cast in a side scrolling animated ridiculous environment. The game starts easy adding modules and Vault Dwellers, but after playing this game on Tablet and PC version with the same outcome, I trashed it. The problem is the Raiders show up and decimate the Vault population, therefore making it impossible to run the Vault. There is also the Rad Roach problem which kills off too many Vault dwellers, before you can eradicate them. Even after the $500 Credit - Vault Door Upgrade, the Raiders march right in, and kill nearly every dweller, again. I love Bethesda Studios and have completed Fallout3 enjoying it very much, but this mobile game sucks azz."
13334,"This is a cute game, but it was a little disappointing. I dislike the push to spend real money for things, but I guess that's to be expected with free-to-play games. What really surprised me was the lack of humor I expect from Fallout games. I mean, everyone looks like a Vault Boy; Vault Boy is usually funny! But the writing was fairly bland. Also, it turns out this is not the kind of game you can put down for a week then come back to and remember how to play. In all, not something I wanted to spend more time on."
13335,Good game
13336,"In Fallout Shelter you manage your own post-holocaust vault and fill it with inhabitants. In order to run it properly you need to be able to balance the set-up of the vault. You need power, water, food et.c. and you also need people with specific skills on the right places in order to maximize the output of specific resources.

As you grow your numbers of inhabitants you can dig deeper and expand your vault. You can equip and send your inhabitants into the wasteland. Either on specific missions or just to explore. Defend your vault against raiders and much more.

Overall its simple to learn but still very enjoyable and addictive. I can highly recommend this one.   
"
13337,priti gud
13338,ok good better cool
13339,Good game.
13340,"pretty fun, but turns into a money game later on. Still recommend"
13341,"solid game with a lot of content, would recommend playing!"
13342,"A decent game and I truly enjoy the Fallout series from beginning to end. It gets excessively repetitive but so does the actual Fallout series, so obviously I don't mind. Its good for wasting a day and uninstalling or if you feel like having a Fallout skinned afk grinder/clicker game its fun for a few months."
13343,"**TLDR: requires lots of work, not fun at all, poorly made, exists only as a vehicle for microtransactions

Fallout Shelter started as a typical BS ""freemium"" game, made for mobile phones.  The mobile game market is aimed at those who are susceptbile to addiction, and the games exploit players in a way very similar to gambling.  There are lots of slot-machine-like sounds, and visual stimuli for completing milestones and objectives.  Payouts are randomized to encourage habitual attention.  Unlike gambling though, you'll never get money back out of it.

The game is also a grindfest, making you perform tedious tasks, and wait for long periods of time.  The waiting times gradually increase, eventually getting to as much as 2 WEEKS to complete tasks.  That's 14 days of real-world time.  For example, it would take 1 dweller with decent stats 2 weeks to make one top-level weapon.  The reason it's so difficult to accomplish anything is simple: if you make players feel impatient, the most addicted players will pay real money to advance toward their goals.

The gameplay mechanics are severely broken.  The combat is sluggish, and not interactive in any significant way.  The ""mysterious stranger"" random events are frequently interrupted by incident events, which automatically move the camera away from the Where's Waldo 5-second mini game, which by the way is already almost impossible due to the time limit.

Games like this are not made to be fun.  They're made to exploit players.

If you play this, expect to check in for a few minutes at a time, while you essentially babysit the game all day.  Every day.  Forever.  It's more of an obligation than an actual game.

They could easily make it more fun by reducing the requirements to complete objectives, or by speeding up combat, or adding V.A.T.S. to combat, or by increasing the variety of activities available.  They won't do that though, because it's a lazy cash grab."
13344,cool game
13345,"All of the lines in the ""De-bugger"" quest are golden."
13346,"8/10 ice cream cones, death claws are evil."
13347,Great way to kill time!

-Cute art style
-Good gameplay
-Quiet challenging
-A lot of quest
-Prepare for deathclaw attack"
13352,great free game
13353,"Out of topic of even if i like this series ;) It's a pretty simple, easy to understand, lots of tips, life sucking, small version of a 2dish sims game. xD Its not bad if you are low on cash, but if you want to play something like this....go for the sims series. at least its a bit more in depth..... but for f2p this game is alrightttt :)"
13354,This game is an addiction
13355,this is some good ass stuff mate
13356,i enjoy it quite challenging survival game if u think about it gotta be constantly alert and make sure all the dwellers are assigned to the correct rooms. I reccomend playing
13357,"NOTE: THIS IS A CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION, READ BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS

An okay game that's good in short bursts. The gameplay is pretty repetitive and doesn't really amount to anything except expanding your vault. The quest system is kinda neat and helps break away from the monotony, but you'll most likely get bored of that too if you do them for long enough. If you want to play this game, then you're best off playing for only around 15 minutes at a time. Play any longer and you'll probably question why you bothered picking up this game in the first place."
13358,i love it very cool and innovative
13359,"Mazing best buy this 
"
13360,It is ok however it is a bit repetitive which makes the game not fun after a while
13361,"Radscorpions and Deathclaws are broken. It's a funny game to spend time, but gets boring after you get/do everything. The best way to play this game is playing on survival, but your dwellers will die every time, so be prepared.

Couple of things that would make the game better:
- If you have lots of Mr. Handy, you won't be able to remove them, it's really annoying, add an option to remove them.
- Wish the Dwellers had Traits, like lazy or Hard Worker, would make the game more fun.
- Add Perks for Dwellers, would be hella cool. Like Fast Shot, a Dweller will do more damage, but won't be able to do Critical Attacks. 
- And the combat system is boring, if they changed it to a Turn Based Mode, it would be better.
- And add more enemies, I want to see Mirelurks, Mutants, etc.
- Add ghoul Dwellers (just change the appearence of them, like you can do with the Barber Shop), but instead of changing, they automatically come like that. And make them come with Traits/Perks for Ghouls, like Radiation heals them.
- Add Mutant Dwellers.
- And again, add perks and traits, you're really missing many opportunitties, tons of things would change in the combat system, how Dwellers work and act in the Wasteland (Imagine a Dweller using cannibalism in the Wasteland, he could heal from it, or Scavenger, so many possibilities)
- Maybe add settlements that you can visit to buy weapons, junk and armor and/or recruit people (Add the most known ones, like Megaton, Shady Sands,etc, even if it doesnt make any sense)
- If a Dweller gets tons of Radiation, add a chance for them to instead of dying, turn into a Ghoul.
- And yes, make Dwellers only able to have a certain number of Traits/Perks, maybe 3 of each one, and they gain a option to choose 1 when they level up to a certain level. But Traits and Perks can be gained infinitely through encounters in the Wasteland.
- Make boys be able to wear girls clothes uwu"
13362,"Fallout Shelter is a beautifully simple game from a structural point of view. You have a vault. You can build rooms in the vault, and people can do things in the rooms. The vault is just a two-dimensional grid laid out like you're looking inside an ant farm (except it's a people farm). Rooms are 1x3 in dimension, elevator shafts (of which you only need one, thankfully) are 1x1, and most rooms can be ""merged"" - just build the same room type next to it, and it will expand into a 1x6, and you can add one more room next to that for a 1x9. The latter is the maximum size of any room. You keep building and building to advance in the game.
Inside these rooms, you place your vault dwellers, grabbing them Roller Coaster Tycoon style and plucking them up and setting them down where you'd like them to go. What happens in the rooms? Things! Let's explain the basic mechanics.
The first mechanic to know is resources. You have power (electricity), water, and food. Those are your necessities. You have a baseline requirement for each of these resources, and you gather them by building rooms that generate them. If you have insufficient power, some of your other rooms will stop functioning. If you have insufficient water or food, your vault dwellers will start losing health over time. The only reason I can tell that water and food are separate resources is that Bethesda felt like there needed to be three things to ""balance"" production of. You also have caps, which are the currency you use to build and upgrade rooms.
The second mechanic is dwellers. Your vault starts with a few people, and from there you go through a tutorial explaining how to build rooms, which rooms to build, how they work, and how to progress. Here's the gist: you build your three resource rooms, you assign people to them, and then you also build ""living quarters."" Living quarters are where your vault dwellers will produce offspring (the euphemism for sex in Fallout Shelter is a confetti-explosion of happy-faces in front of an obscured corridor in the living quarters), and those offspring eventually become adults, and those adults eventually go on to work in rooms or produce other offspring. The details go beyond that, but we'll get there.
The third and final major mechanic is the wasteland. The wasteland isn't something you interact with - you send vault dwellers into the wastes and they go ""explore."" You can monitor the status of their exploration via text feed on the exploration UI (you can't actually see what they're doing). During exploration, your dwellers will gather currency, weapons, and outfits. They will also fight enemies and gain experience in doing so. Over time, they will take more and more damage (you can supply them with HP potions [stimpaks] and anti-radiation consumables [Rad-Away]) as the wasteland increases in difficulty the longer they're away from the vault. Eventually, you'll want to ""recall"" them to the vault so you can collect their plunder. During their return, they take no damage and have no encounters, so as long as you get to them while they're still alive, they'll come back.
Bethesda lays a pretty cut-and-dry groundwork for a game here, and I think that's intentional. By making the basic mechanics quite easy to understand, Fallout Shelter is a more approachable and friendly game than the sort of thing Bethesda typically makes. It's casual.
The depth comes in the form of learning how to expand your vault effectively without overstretching your resources or underdeveloping your vault dwellers. So let's talk about those.
As in the Fallout games of yore, your vault dwellers have something called their ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L."" stats. Those, in order, stand for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. They are the quintessential RPG character stats. Each dweller is born with pretty boring stats, and they also start at level one, so there is a leveling system, too. Leveling does not increase your SPECIAL stats. Instead, leveling only increases a dweller's hit points, and leveling is achieved by either working in a production room in the vault (making power, food, water, nuka-cola, stimpaks, or rad-away) or exploring the wasteland.
A character will gain experience while you're not playing, and they level up pretty often (my peak level character right now is at 32, though most are in their mid-high teens). Increasing SPECIAL stats has to happen in dedicated ""training"" rooms, with each room devoted to a particular stat. Over time, dwellers in these rooms will gain a single point in that stat, which you must acknowledge (you can't just leave the game sitting for days, sorry) for each point gained in order to continue the training. Obviously, the higher a given stat gets, the longer it takes for training to boost it another point. While training, dwellers gain no experience, either, and thus won't level up.
he purpose of the SPECIAL stats is in increasing the effectiveness of your dwellers at particular tasks. Want Johnny Nuclear to be better at running the power generator? Send him to the strength training room for a day. Once his strength is at the level you want, send him back to the generator room. Fallout Shelter doesn't just use these as a way to boost the output of resources from these rooms by quantity, but instead in terms of how long it takes the room to spawn new resources. Resources are managed in terms of an absolute quantity, but because they're consumed over time, Fallout Shelter doesn't want you building a ton of power rooms, hoarding a bunch of power, then destroying them so you can make more useful training areas or food production and otherwise attempt to game the system in some way. So, if you have a Level 3 Power Generator (each resource room can be upgraded twice to increase its production and the maximum amount of the resource you may store) that creates 40 power every time it ""pops,"" increasing the combined Strength trait of dwellers working in that room from 10 to, say, 15, will decrease the amount of time between ""pops."" So you'll get 40 power every 90 seconds instead of every 120. Got it? It's a lot simpler in practice to understand than it is to write it out, trust me.
Your dwellers' SPECIAL stats can also be boosted by outfits they can wear, outfits you'll get exploring the wasteland. All your adult dwellers can equip weapons, too (also found while exploring), and these weapons are used in events called ""incidents."" Once in a while, raiders will attack your vault. At this point, you should send two dwellers with guns (and high levels) to your vault entrance, and once the raiders inevitably break in to the vault, a fight will ensue. The fight mechanics are terrible and boring and lazy - it's completely automated and once you have a sufficiently high enough level group of dwellers with decent guns, completely devoid of any strategy or challenge. Worst part of the game, in my opinion. The other ""incident"" requiring guns is radroach infestations (read: giant, mean radioactive cockroaches), which occur both at random and when you attempt to ""rush"" a building into instantly producing resources and fail (success rates are typically 65-80%, though, if you don't try repeatedly). Radroach infestations and fires keep you honest in terms of equipping your workers with weapons and raising their stats, but again, just feel like annoyances. ""Rushing"" a building, by the way, is so far as I can tell just a band-aid Bethesda has put in the game to help people who aren't very good at games. It generally serves very little purpose.
So Your main goal is to expand your vault, equip and train your dwellers, make them reproduce to get new dwellers (note: your dwellers do not age once they are adults that I can tell, so they live forever unless you let them die and don't revive them), and then repeat until you reach the bottom of the buildable space under the mountain, if this sounds pointliess congratulations youve reached the crux of our review."
13363,y es
13364,You have become addicted to Fallout Shelter.
13365,"Great Free game. I like it and my 8 year old niece loves it. It doesn't pressure to buy stuff like other free games do, it is not a hard game. It's about building up a base and the few stats of your people. The best part is getting new legendary weapons or armor. If on PC, expect to click a lot on different rooms. It's strategy, so the battles are not hard, just keep your peoples' health up and save criticals for useful times. Great game, but very challenging."
13366,"This is a very boring game, the time it takes to do anyting is insane. its very much a mobile game on pc. They sell items which cost upwards of 5$ in store that speed up progress in game. That is essentially the game in a nutshel. Very un-enjoyable becasue of the constant sitting there staring at your screen waiting for something to happen to which you just click once to claim your resources then sit waiting again. This is purpose built in to the game to make buying items seem more inviting but infact you need to buy them to get anyware in the game within a reasonable ammount of time.
"
13367,Very boring yet you have to keep your eyes on this boring game. Such a sad life!
13368,Its alright.
13369,It's inbreeding time
13370,"Basically the same as the mobile app, without the convience of being able to take it with you. 
I played more than 70 hours on it nonetheless, I guess, so I can't really complain too much."
13371,Good shit nigga
13372,"me like a lot
"
13373,"This game is good to play when you're burnt out on your other games. Comical at times, this game can really pull you in if you like collecting, fighting, and managing a section of people."
13374,This is a good game - it is engaging and detailed. From resources to social considerations.  Not to complex - just right for a fun run thru the makings of building and maintaining lives in a bunker.  You can't beat the value! (;>)
13375,Realy cool
13376,"Love it.  Much fun!

One thing you have to keep in mind: This game was designed for a mobile/tablet.  Meaning, it's not designed for you to sit and play it for hours.  Everything runs on 'real time' regardless if the game is running or not.  

So, send your guys on a quest... and take a break.  ^_^
ProTip: NukaCola cuts time by slightly less than 2 hours.  So, most effecient use is when a timer is just less than a multiple of two.
ProTip2: They are best used to cut down quest time, as the majority of rewards come from quests.
ProTip3: There is hidden factor on HP->  HP gain is based on their endurance at the point when they level.  So, a char with 1 END leveled to 40, then raised END to 10... with have a TINY amount of HP, whereas a char that raises his end to 10 at level 1 will be a beast at lvl 40.
ProTip4: You don't have to to raise their End to 10, just raise to 7 and put on +3 END gear."
13377,A fun little game for when you are bored. :/
13378,"Its free and kinda fun for the first few hours but all in all its pointless and ends up being just a daily chore with no purpose.
You lack food - build 1 of 3 rooms to generate it
You lack energy - build 1 of 2 rooms to generate it
You lack water - build 1 of 3 rooms to generate it
Now you have lots of rooms that need 6 dwellers in them to operate on full capacity so you ""make"" some babies or lure ppl in with a radio station.
But now you lack food water and energy again, so thats your gameplay loop.

In between you can send dwellers out to freeroam in some text adventure style ""bring me weapons, scrap, clothes and money"" feature or you send them out for scripted quests, which seems to be interactive but truth is that its just clicking on rooms for your dwellers gang of 3 to walk into, wait until they killed everything in it, click shiny corpses and boxes then click the next room to walk into.
And if you get bored of that (which will happen in no time) you can also choose to increase your dwellers ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L"" stats by putting them into 1 of 7 special training rooms for about an irl week or so until they reach the cap, then put them in a room for a different stat and wait another week again, so much fun and you even have to do it 7x200 times! Wohoo!

But wait there is more boredom to be had! You can also build legendary weapons and outfits in no more than just 150-400 hours of real time! Why would you do that? Well to have more fun in all those boring quests and vault assaults of course, since these items will significantly reduce the time you have to spend looking at super boring auto fights!

But wait you may ask, there has to be something, some mayor endgame challenge at the end of all that preparation, training, scavenging and outfitting!?
NOOO there is absolutely NOTHING else for you to do in here except buying a few lootboxes with insulting contents such as 1 Stimpack, 100 caps, 1 piece of junk, 50 Water and many more items that you can generate hundreds of per hour while you're asleep!

At least it made me want to play a real Fallout game again so there's that..."
13379,very nice game
13380,very nice to play solo
13381,why not?
13382,"this game is fun until it gets a corrupted file for no reason and deletes your game that you've played for 100-150 hours with over 100 dwellers, over 70 rooms, ten special dwellers, five pets, and 20,000 caps. also there's no way to get that save back as far as I can tell"
13383,"Just lost a weeks progress and a vault of around 30 people due to a random molerat attack. The game is a miserable grind of slow progress that can be runied in a blink of an eye unless you pay to win. If you try to play it for free you will hit a progress wall immediately and it's just no fun at all.  If you do pay to get stuff, your dwellers that you paid real money for can die and if your vault fails, it takes all your loot boxes with it. Simply dreadful!"
13384,"I would have to say, Its a pretty cool game. It kind of reminds me of Theme Park Tycoon games where you have to wait for certain things to happen, but other than the waiting, I love the idea of building your own vault and doing experiments."
13385,"Its a great and challenging but not too challenging. Light microtransactions but they're affordable and you still have a chance to get them in game in other words 

its not pay to win

In other words it's a really good game.

No you dont need a quad core it will run fine on a Dual Core CPU"
13386,"pretty good
"
13387,this game is worthless and boring and comeplete cancer you run out off food to fast same with water then everyone starts getting sick and dying
13388,i loveed that thay made a game inbetwen fallout 4 and fallout 76 it was a nice filler/littel game
13389,it's good but the cloud sync doesn't save your vaults mine are gone and i think it's something should be fixed
13390,its a cool game
13391,DO NOT PLAY! Resetting your computer at any time can/will eventually delete all your vault data. Horrible bugs that has gone forever without a patch.
13392,"It's like you're vault-tec, do experiments"
13393,"A very addicting game, relaxing, a management type of game, and i have a lot of fun and excitement every time i visit my vault :)
Yeah sure i recommend this game."
13394,"Typical free-to-play modell, but still very fun there are much worse games in this regard out there. I had fun for the time playing, but i dont have the time or nerves to get every single thing (By that I mean legendary characters and pets and such). Still in regards to idle games this is one of the better ones."
13395,like it
13396,it took 22 minutes for me to break the game entirely
13397,Its a shelter what were you thinking of?
13398,"Although it's a mobile game I play it on PC since it's a pain to play it on a compact smartphone. As for review its a good free game for time spending and as a fallout fanboy I like the setting of the game

I rate it 8/10 play it if you have spare time"
13399,This is so much fun to play.I will have another page for Stuff you can do to improve your vault.And what your dwellers can do to improve productivity and be more happy.But back to the review.This game is fun because no matter what ever I do the dwellers dont listen to me and I still cant stop laughing.I recommend this game for anybody that likes building settlements in Fallout 4.And this is like a 2d version of the Fallout 4 Vault Building DLC. The Vault 88 DLC.
13400,Good time killer but gets very repetitive.
13401,Fun and addicting little game. :o)
13402,"I can't believe, Todd actually managed to make a fallout game on new engine!"
13403,"People do know that you can literally get resources from mods right.

I pity anyone who spent real money on bundles or packs. 

Lol it's a fun game, check out the mods you can mod the progression to play as fast as you would like."
13404,westworld is better lol
13405,Now I live in 2060. Yesterday was 2035. Who knows when tomorrow will bring.
13406,best game ever
13407,"I love fallout series. This game is awesome! I played it a lot on my mobile, but on pc is better. (for me) :D"
13408,Shouldn't of made it onto steam. More like a mobile game. (which it is). Should've kept it that way.
13409,Why did I get this on my PC? It's on my S8+
13410,"GG and all that. "" not enough gopniks and gasmasks"" :P 

you have to wait and put your dwellers exploring for it to be fun"
13411,don't know how i've spent over 10hours in this
13412,I enjoyed it :)

13414,My game glitched out and i lost my save after months on working on it. Support isn't much help. GG.
13415,"I really tried to like this game, i did. But, I just can't. With the way the game is set up, it is impossible. Every time I would create something, the game mechanics throws in a wrench early in the game and makes playing this game impossible. 

0/10 I would not recommend this game."
13416,I like how you get one guy who has max charisma to mate with every femoid until every dweller is their child. its all fun and games until one of the babies has an Uncle Mom and Aunt Dad
13417,"WE'VE REALEASED SKYRIM WITHIN FALLOUT SHELTER, YOU PLAY WITH A 2D PERSPECTIVE FROM THE SIDE. TRUST  US IT JUST WORKS!"
13418,Fun way to pass time
13419,"[b]On many levels. No.[/b]

At first, this game appears as simple resource and time management sim with a unique skin, however, it was so hastily coded that there are gaping holes in the programming. Thus far I have lost two shelters one a max stat and dweller facility.  The code is susceptible to force stop corruption.  It is as if the Devs never considered that a cell phone could run out of power or it is impossible for you to be pulled away from your computer for any reason, or hey how about simple brownouts?  This issue is listed all over goggle and despite there being simple programming fixes to update save configurations, we are stuck with complicated file patching that rarely ever works. 

1) [b]Prepare to lose your vault[/b] - It will happen and most likely it won't come back and it will have nothing to do with being attacked.

2) [b]Yelling at the touch screen.[/b]  - Rather than having the GUI mapped to the foreground of your vault,  everything has to be oriented to the background of your vault.  The space that is actually behind your dwellers.   With the 3d viewer, it will leave you clicking on things that are not really there or trying to drop a dweller in the center of an OFF ANGEL room that does not register.  

3) [b]Click locks can lead to character disobedience prolonging battle and costing resources.[/b]

4) [b]Enjoy endless palm scrolling on a computer = major pain.[/b]  You have at least two mouse buttons, and they could not assign one to scroll and another to interact?  This makes moving from the top of the shelter to the bottom a real chore, as you constantly pick up dwellers by accident.  Great way to mess of dwellers' education when they are bouncing between rooms.

5) [b]Some times missions fail to progress.[/b]  Lots of complaints about that.  Played 3 total vaults just to finish the horsemen quests. 

Obvious room for improvement 
1) [b]Multi saves.[/b]  Oh crap, my first save was corrupted.  Solution = Ok here is a save from last week.  OMW what is this?  Do you mean I don't have to lose everything?  Golly gee wiz you're telling me that game publishers figured that out in the 90s? Simply amazing!  

2) [b]Indicators for full rooms[/b] - So tire of counting occupants for classrooms, Circle it with a color or something.

3) [b]Warn before deleting uncraftable gear.[/b]  That crap is rare and can be easy to mistake when it is mixed in with the rest of the crap you are cleaning out of the warehouse.

4) [b]Reaching max junk capacity is pointless.[/b]  Legend Gear is not a money sink only a deterrent early in the game.  Allow players to buy expensive junk.  We can sell everything to nobody why can't we buy at least the junk we need from some traveling merchant.

5) [b]Make HP retroactive.[/b]  Your HP goes up based on endurance vs your level, Simple.  Supper Dwellers raised from level one with 17 endurance and a % to weapon and armor Pets create game braking indestructible for no point while promoting obsoleting the first generation.  Making HP a flexible stat is easier to code.

[b]That is my two cents[/b] but I doubt I will play this again. It is just too frustrating to lose your progress due to bad coding.  This has really burnt me towards the franchise.  I am less interested in the primary games due to the performance of this side game."
13420,Excellent game!! Requires some patience or playing in windowed mode and doing something else.
13421,Surprisingly addictive
13422,good game would play again
13423,"This game is so unbalanced, has a lack of basic information like how much power a particular room consumes making it's hard to plan ahead, it was a failed attempt at a microtransaction GoFundMe, don't expect to play this like an idle Miner"
13424,"First started playing this on my iPhone, but it's nice to play while watching a show since I'm the type of person that has to be doing more than one thing at once. Can take a long time to get enough caps to build rooms etc, but it's a great game once you get into the quests and things of that sort. I like the fact that I can sit there for 5 mins or 50 mins and play it, it's super simple and easy to understand once you've played through the basic tutorial. Can get really repetitive, but that's not always a bad thing."
13425,"It's a slow grind if you don't buy lunchboxes (randomized lootcrates) from the store. You'll be prompted to do so multiple times throughout your gaming experience.

The principle of the game beyond that is okay, but the setup is the same in every playthrough because  they put an elevator right behind the entrance and you'll have to jump through a few hoops to move it if you don't want it there.

Every time you create a new vault, it will be on the same map with just a little change in where the heavy rocks are placed. There's little variety there.

The vault dwellers are varied and can eventually be customized through a barbershop, but it takes a long time to get there.

The missions are decent enough to play through, but it takes hours for your vault dwellers to arrive on scene, and then some more for them to return home.

All in, it's enjoyable to boot up, sink a few minutes in to make sure everything still runs as it should, and then ditch it for a few days again while the background timers run down.
Could have been better, but it's simple enough to be accessible to even the most casual player.

Definitely could have been on Mac/Linux considering it's also available on mobile devices."
13426,"It's great for when you have nothing to do or can't afford fallout 4 like I used to.... (I still don't have it)
"
13427,"So.. ive done all the main quests and keep running the ""blue quests"" and dailys+weeklys when ever theres worthy rewards.. 200 dwellers from where maybe 30 not yet maxed but close.. 91 lunchboxes opened (0 bought) and i have received 0 legendary dwellers from the boxes.. is this normal?!? and i am supposed to get 20 for the achievement"
13428,"awesome

"
13429,Playing god to a bunch of mindless drones has a soothing effect.
13430,"the game is good but it is annoying that when ever Im about to log off, the vault is attack. this game will take over your life. it dont care"
13431,"45 hours of gameplay gone in less than a minute. It'd be nice to have a pop up telling me to ""save because we built a broken game"". Just glad I didn't pour money into it. 0% desire to restart from the bottom at this point."
13432,my dad beays me
13433,A decent enough timekiller. Missions could be more interesting and less repetitive.
13434,"Ok so let's start this of by saying 
if you love fallout series
you should get this game 
9 out of 10"
13435,good game
13436,"Its free and kinda fun for the first few hours but all in all its pointless and ends up being just a daily chore with no purpose.
You lack food - build 1 of 3 rooms to generate it
You lack energy - build 1 of 2 rooms to generate it
You lack water - build 1 of 3 rooms to generate it
Now you have lots of rooms that need 6 dwellers in them to operate on full capacity so you ""make"" some babies or lure ppl in with a radio station.
But now you lack food water and energy again, so thats your gameplay loop.

In between you can send dwellers out to freeroam in some text adventure style ""bring me weapons, scrap, clothes and money"" feature or you send them out for scripted quests, which seems to be interactive but truth is that its just clicking on rooms for your dwellers gang of 3 to walk into, wait until they killed everything in it, click shiny corpses and boxes then click the next room to walk into.
And if you get bored of that (which will happen in no time) you can also choose to increase your dwellers ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L"" stats by putting them into 1 of 7 special training rooms for about an irl week or so until they reach the cap, then put them in a room for a different stat and wait another week again, so much fun and you even have to do it 7x200 times! Wohoo!

But wait there is more boredom to be had! You can also build legendary weapons and outfits in no more than just 150-400 hours of real time! Why would you do that? Well to have more fun in all those boring quests and vault assaults of course, since these items will significantly reduce the time you have to spend looking at super boring auto fights!

But wait you may ask, there has to be something, some mayor endgame challenge at the end of all that preparation, training, scavenging and outfitting!?
NOOO there is absolutely NOTHING else for you to do in here except buying a few lootboxes with insulting contents such as 1 Stimpack, 100 caps, 1 piece of junk, 50 Water and many more items that you can generate hundreds of per hour while you're asleep!

At least it made me want to play a real Fallout game again so there's that..."
13437,GG
13438,Thumbs up
13439,Purposefully slow gameplay with the intend to force you to buy microtransactions. This is just boring. There are so many other and better base building games.
13440,Only have one achivement left and have not been able to find another Legendary Charactor for over a year.
13441,on most platforms which is good and the pc one is good becasue you can zoom right into the rooms and you can have a good look at the very nice rooms thank you for it being on all platfroms when i need to go somewhere i can just play it on my phone
13442,very good game my comrades
13443,"Good Game man, now that i've played fallout 3 i understand who is three dog and what is .32 pistol! :)"
13444,"The game is really fun sure it's a point and click game but it's still very fun and simple and easy to collect item but i recommend someone who likes point and click games to play this
"
13445,nice game to get rid of some time
13446,It's a fun game when your bored. A 20 min log in do your thing and then log out. It's a slow progression game.
13447,Very gud game.
13448,fun and simple.
13449,"Quite a nice little freebie, with relaxing gameplay and some sufficiently nasty surprises. Slightly susceptible to pacing issues. All but the finite details are easy to pick up. A good bit of fun, with no knowledge of lore required."
13450,the best strategic game and survival game i seen
13451,very addictive
13452,Good if you're on a laptop and want a game to waste time. :D
13453,Easy and fun to read the different character bubbles
13454,wish there were more steam games like this
13455,"Its basically at the level of many ""free"" games out there, just at the lower tier of the genere.  Very little plot, charges for quite a bit of stuff, and programmed to the lowest common denominator that they can get away with and still get people to pay.  Doesn't take much to learn how to play, but you have to micromanage far too much for a ""play and walkaway"" type game, the characters seem to have labotimized before being placed in the game, and information is some of the scantest I've ever seen for a game.  They include a ""skill"" bar in the characters bio, but they seem to have forgotten to list what the bars stand for.  You've got to familiarize yourself with it by thaking the individual and check it against rooms until you memorize what bar stands for which.  The characters, as pointed out earlier, are pretty stupid.  You take the character to go and confront an emergency, and the emergency spreads, they will run past the new emergency even though it is the same one they're going to confront.

Basically, this is a throwaway game and not something really worth digging into unless you want to spend your entire day micromanaging.  At higher levels, it is probably more interesting as you'll have enough rooms available/products to recover from your base from running out of items while you were off the game.  But the problems with that plus the random accidents makes it more irritating then fun or challanging."
13456,"good game, has a variety of missions and everything, but... Could improve"
13457,A fun free to play colony management game. based on fallout.. =]
13458,Relaxing
13459,Good game! It's fun. I like it.
13460,i recomend it
13461,thanks tod
13462,Great game! very fun
13463,Great game to be running in the background of all your tabs. Fallout shelter is definitely a mobile game but it‚Äôs nice to play when a game is updating or downloading. There is a bit of a grind and as soon as your vault goes down hill there‚Äôs no going back. A calm game to play at school or work in your free time
13464,Thas pretty good i love my breedertron 9000 aka baby tron 9000 is allowed to be a thing but only downside is ive waited at least an hour for a baby to actualy appear
13465,"Nice game, played it for a few hours. Recommended!"
13466,Guut game :P
13467,relax...
13468,"Never be AFK in this game, just don't!"
13469,"Its pretty good but its identical to the mobile game, meaning it also has the stupid in-app purchases. Its easier to get the app but you get the same experience so do what you want."
13470,"Amazing game! Fun, a little grindy after a while, but really good game!"
13471,"Saving up money can be real hard, but once your passed a certain point it gets real boring."
13472,Fun game but despite having a very fast PC the game slowed down to annoying speed at 40+ dewllers
13473,game for you to learn how people live by helping ech other
13474,"I had a lot of fun with this game, it was very addictive! Unfortunately you have to wait for a lot of stuff so it isn't a game that you can immediately do things. I found the rad scorpions too op to deal with after a while since I was rushing to get to 100 dwellers so I could unlock the best rooms. Unfortunately this game is very punishing with room layout too. I wouldn't spend any money on this game, just play it for free and be patient :D"
13475,"I first played this on my smartphone and liked it. Then I found that it also was on Steam. I liked it as well. It feels like a quick way for Fallout junkies to get their fix and for those unknowing of Fallout to get a very minimal glance at some kind of feel for this series. It doesn't fit into the lore and is very standalone. Hell, it doesn't even have a story. Just repopulate and keep things in order. 


Fun game to play when you don't want anything too crazy.
"
13476,good
13477,"boring
"
13478,"Weirdly addictive and at times funny.  

I think a barrier to people finding it who would have played it is how it is tagged in Steam as simulation isn't there and so Steam was sure it was no relevant to me and will change it's mind based on how much I play. I think Steam will be concluding it is indeed relevant as I always have to check on my dwellers. 

I wish I had heard of it sooner but such is life.  I really recommend it. 

For those who fear the Free to Play model at this point I would say it runs pretty close to the purer intent of an earlier gaming age where effort will make up for what you can't afford to spend. 

Great gaming experience if you want some escape from our world reality.  Your dog may learn how to walk himself and laundry..."
13479,this... this IS AWESOME! #falloutshelterforlife

13481,"If you love to manage, adventure, customize characters, upgrade stuff then 100% this game suits you. It's good to spend your free time on, it tests your managing strategy.

(Also, this game doesn't promote incest)

7/10 Shinobu Kakas
Give it a try ;)"
13482,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH WHY DO THIS TO US TO EVEN HAVE FUN U NEED TO BE ON 24/7 WHY DO SH33T HAPPEN WHEN I'M OFFLINE YE ARSS HOLES
13483,Really enjoy this game
13484,"Maybe I should have listened to the other reviewers here - ""but it won't happen to me, right?"" Yeah, right. I'm glad I didn't play for too long before my savegame was deleted. It was a lot of fun while it lasted (you can let it play by itself for hours), but playing a game that will delete your saves randomly? Uh, no, thanks.
I also won't miss the random PC freezes I only experienced with this game."
13485,"Ah, one of the good ole' idling game. Bethesda had better not to put Android games into PC, because we all know why.

As expected, this game is like one of the Android games. It's just loads and loads of waiting. Then, most of the time, you can skip things by using something, which you have to buy with real money. Typical microtransaction. You get the picture, I won't explain any further.

However, there's 2 silver lining for this game:
1. You can set the clock forward to pass time. You don't even have to close the game, just save and return to main menu.
2. *cough* [spoiler]Fallout Shelter Save Editor[/spoiler] *cough*

Sure, setting clock forward and reloading the save makes everything faster (even more if I cheat, by loading other people's save), but then it turns into a chore. In the end, I feel like I accomplished nothing. There's no progression. Just adding more and more vault dwellers till you hit 200, and scavenge items from wasteland endlessly.

Conclusion: Just don't play Fallout Shelter. If you want to become an overseer, buy Vault-Tec Workshop DLC from Fallout 4, and claim Vault 88. At least they throw some of the lines from the game."
13486,Good game to kill time. Like it
13487,"I had a lot of fun making a female only vault, with 1 male used only for reproduction. 

What I didn't like was Bethesda's rush system. Anything above 30% chance of failure was a 100% chance of failure for me. They also don't give enough detail about how the special stats increase your chance of success and how luck gives more caps. Something about the math involved in this game was just, off..."
13488,"well, fuck."
13489,"[b]8/10 highly recommend[/b]

A good time killer."
13490,love it
13491,EH DATS A PRETTY GOOD
13492,Meh
13493,"had to get this Game on PC, God I love Bethesda."
13494,"To be honest, the game is an Amateur"
13495,"Really good time killing game. If you played this when it first released and haven't touched it since, you're missing some new things that are a lot of fun."
13496,One of the most addictive time pass game ever!
13497,"Okay, you can play this game when you are bored of playing all the other games. Playing this game was pretty much fun.."
13498,"Put two women in the kitchen and got an acheivement for ""putting two settlers in the right place"". 10/10."
13499,Irrevokable nuclear annhilation is fun as fuck! :D

13501,·Ö†·Ö†·Ö†
13502,Good
13503,I like this Simulation game more than the one I live in
13504,Fun passtime for when you are binging series.
13505,"would be better if you could close the game down and whernn you load up all your people have starved to death, makes the game poop when you cant take a break for more then half a day"
13506,Best free-to-play game out there
13507,"this game is honestly pretty fun and you know what?

I have all achievements.

I recommend dis game."
13508,"its pretty good for a free game
"
13509,Really fun game when you get more dwellers
13510,"Got 34 out of 35 achievements completed, 400+ hrs on the record, 60 dwellers with all 10 SPECIAL etc. But the game suddenly decided not to load my saves any more. The previous backup was about 100 hrs ago, so it makes no sense trying to waste any more time on this game. Support can't help, they are basically useless when it really matters. Very sad to face that shitty software quality in the age of cloud storage and other redundant technologies. Do not recommend this game and its developer, since their irresponsible approach and overall low-quality software will likely cause a sour taste and disappointment for you too. Games must be fun, but this one is not after all."
13511,"It was a great game for a few months, just to pass the time.
I really enjoyed it for a while.

However, the cloud saving system is flawed and for some reason today it decided that all of my progress never happened.
It really sucks."
13512,Its ok.
13513,"Lots of fun, a bit of a grind at first, and taking one risk too many can cost almost your entire population, but great fun and the animations, naming, and overall gameplay is awesome."
13514,"A nice little game to play on the side. However, getting 20 special wastelanders to visit your vault was obviously just a ploy to get a lot of your money, because they rarely showed up, and I read that even if you were to buy the little lunch boxes you'd still almost never get a special vault dweller."
13515,it's amazingly fun! i don't really know what else to say... i'm quite bad at writing... heh
13516,Game had crash
13517,"Got on earlier today to my main vault, saved, and quite.  Sign back in just now and my entire main vault is gone. Uninstalling."
13518,"A fun little management sim. You have several types of rooms dedicated to generating power, food and water. Each of these have minimum thresholds that you need to look after otherwise your vault will start to suffer. You can additionally build rooms dedicated to attracting stragglers, crafting equipment and training SPECIAL stats. You can equip your dwellers with clothing and weapons, which get stored in depots. You need also need to be mindful of invasions, which happen all the time from outside and inside. You can also send out your dwellers on scavenging trips, or full-blown quests. 

There is actually plenty to do, but it all gets bogged down by the typical wait-to-build thing that f2p mobile games tend to do. Could be much worse, since the game is pretty generous with dispensing lunchboxes and pet carriers, which actually have a good chance of giving out good stuff. 

Worth a try. Also available for the phone."
13519,"Fallout Shelter is a nice game to waste time or just to relax a bit from stress, because this game is the opposite of skill based games. I recommend everyone that just doesnt know what to do whilst there on the PC or for the people who are frustrated from losing in other games. This game is easy at first, but as soon as you start picking up the pace in building and popullation growing, this game becomes the opposite of ""easy"". There are alot of things that will frustrate you, and an enemy called RADSCORPION will absolutly destroy your definition of FUN :) . They are OP as fuck and should be nerfed, but oh well, you have to get some action dont you? ;)

In conclusion:

+ Timespender
+ No Skill needed
+ Absolutly Free to Play
+ Creativity

- Radscorpions that will destroy you Power Supllies
- Lack of Game Infos (No specific Wiki in the game)

Recommendation : 90% Yes"
13520,"If you are looking for free to play games or If you have a slow PC you should give a chance to this game.This game is easy to learn.You have a Vault and you must make your people happy.That's the goal.Also you can do side quests outside the vault.They give you rewards.As I said, If you have issues with playing games on your computer because of the system requirements, this game won't give you any problem."
13521,"Have you ever wanted to get your Fallout fix, but didn't have the 2-16 hours that those games require for each sitting? Fallout shelter is your answer.

Fallout shelter is great. This is the perfect game for me when I need a break from whatever I'm suppose to be doing. It's the kind of game you can open up, play for a few minutes, then come back later and before you know it you have over 20 hours gameplay time somehow.

You start off with a handful of dwellers and its up to you to build the shelter up. As more resources are required, more dwellers are needed to work. As more dwellers arrive, more resources are required. You get it. Dwellers will show up from the wasteland or you can have dwellers give birth to the next generation.

You can also send dwellers out for supply runs and on quests. Quests can drag, and after you've been playing for a while I feel they get a little dull. It's just a lot of pointing and clicking, then watching your dwellers fight the raiders or radscorpions. But sending dwellers on supply runs just lets them do their own thing, just make sure they don't die out there.

I've played Fallout Shelter on the iPhone, iPad, PS4 and PC, and I think that PC is the way to go on this one, and I'm really glad Fallout Shelter is on Steam now. I originally played it on Bethesda launcher, and after losing a hard drive and updating windows, I've lost a few vaults, but now with the Steam cloud, my vault is here forever (I hope).

It's fun, it's free, it's Fallout, so give it a go."
13522,azrgr!
13523,Fallout Shelter is pretty fun for when your on a long roadtrip with friends then to pass the time you can play this game or when your busy downloading or your just plain bored its pretty fun making your own vault and sustaining the people in it other than that theres not alot I can say its fun in its own special way.
13524,"As for me, this is the best game in my Fallout collection. I really enjoy it. It's incredible and so fun!"
13525,The game is well made and easy to understand
13526,"This is a super cool time killer of all time! It is so easy, interesting and addictive that I can play it for hours. Besides, it's completely FREE!"
13527,"Great game to kill time, can't really say anything bad about it, the microtransactions aren't required as the rewards can already be taken with some time, which I really enjoy considering the amount of videogames nowadays that FORCE you to buy things that you otherwise couldn't get on your own."
13528,"I tried this game on the mobile after it came out in 2015 and couldn't hang to it, but on a big monitor on the PC with a mouse I found it much easier to play, very appealing and addictive!
Microtransactions are not required at all to enjoy the game. Many of the stuff can be found during gameplay, and as the vault grows I found myself  getting busier manging my dwellers, so time passes easily and you don't need to spend a cent to speed up anything.
The only thing I didn't like about the game is how clumsy it becomes to select dwellers or rooms sometimes. Bethesda could optimize that a bit, but other than that the game is so much fun."
13529,"This Game is really fun and quite addicting. I have spent several hours playing it, and it is theraputic to just sit back, relax, and create your own vault in the post apocolyptic wasteland!"
13530,its a fun game has funny graphics good gameplay good featurs its just fun but its only fun for a little bit it gets boring over time but good game overall needs more rooms.
13531,i spend meny money 10/10
13532,gay
13533,its you standered mobile game ported to steam
13534,it's fallout but microtransactions
13535,great graphics and works pretty well on steam play
13536,"Good game to pass the time, but i get constantly attacked by death claws, at least Bottle & Cappy come to cheer my dwellers up."
13537,"Rubbish. Do not waste your time with this game. It is clearly made in a way to 
make you spend money in-game. I made the mistake to buy the starter pack.

"
13538,"At first this game looks pretty cool to play. I did enjoy it for several hours.
You have to click on everything to collect resources or level up.
After clicking you have to wait a few minutes to gather the same resource again.
Of course you can pay in game to increase the speed or get instantly things done.
Graphics is pretty good, this game probably runs on most systems.
Gameplay is average. It sometimes automatically zooms to an event and micromanagement is hard.
Sound is good, nice effects.
After several hours the game gets pretty boring and looks like grinding most of the time.
I can only recommend this game while cooking as I tent to run between my furnace and pc every x minutes, it's ideally for multitasking.
The game would be better if it's not free and the resources are collected automatically. Also level up should be automatic.
I'm also missing an overview of how much resources each room/person is using. There are only a few gauges and no numbers. There's no way to plan into the future. You have to tackle problems on the go.
I do like the idea of this game, story is unique but making it free made it worse."
13539,"hey I love this game, fallout 3 and 4 are also awsome so thanks

13541,"Start Vault

> 2 people set to work to expand vault
> Vault grows
> Start assigning people to jobs, based on their skills
> Build radio station to cheer dwellers up
> Start training dwellers to better do their assigned jobs
> Give radio station dwellers high charisma, to lure more people into the glorious vault
> Send dwellers out into the wasteland against their will to find loot for the greater good of The Vault
> Breed dwellers, based on their skills to create babies that are better suited for their assigned jobs.
> Collect all money and resources to establish order and infrastructure.
> Overwork Dwellers and potentially kill them in dangerous fires for the greater good of The Vault.
> Orders work, go to bed and work again.
> Build another radio station to remind dwellers of the glory of The Vault
> Build layers upon layers of storage rooms to accumilate growing wealth and resources.
> Dwellers never get richer, you own everything. Life is good
> Throw dwellers out that are now useless.

10/10 would Marx again"
13542,Had fun when I had nothing else in my library to play.
13543,fallout flavoured waiting simulator that asks for real money to reduce wait time intervals.  horrible.
13544,ahaha this game kinda undergroud dawg
13545,EZ game
13546,yes but no
13547,"A fun little game thats useful for burning time. I enjoy it, its kinda like Sim City Fallout version, but simpler."
13548,"Love this game. I gotta be in the mood to play it but when I am I can play for hours. Even tried to keep a family tree but that fell thru quickly after a few raider attacks. Anyway, love the style of gameplay."
13549,An amazing idle game fun for hours
13550,Just get it on your phone/tablet
13551,IT IS AMAZING!!!!
13552,"Simple, yet addictive!"
13553,Fallout Shelter has been one of my favorite games for a while now :)
13554,"Once you get to higher levels, some of the charm starts to wear away, but it's still an addictively fun farming game. Plus: Fallout. Need I say more?"
13555,I find this game fun and it helps you  kill time
13556,"got real boring, real fast"
13557,üëç
13558,"This game is Very Fun and Interesting for everyone, it doesn't take a Fallout know-it all to understand the game. It's Very Challenging at times if you don't plan well or prepare well. Some quests may require some knowledge from the series but other than that, this game is amazing and a great game for when you're bored and other games get boring."
13559,"This is a really chill time killer-type game.  It offers up a pretty relaxed game-play.  I've yet to get bored with it, which is saying a lot since I tend to have a relatively short attention span when it comes to most games."
13560,"Garbage mobile game intended to make you purchase loot boxes and power ups. Alot of the tasks take hours to complete, but just pay money to complete them faster, or buy more loot boxes to get gear and weapons. Recently, the drop rate for loot has been severely nerfed, it will take thousand of lootboxes to get what you want. Avoid this game and just watch some videos, or better yet, use a trainer so you wont get scammed by bethesda."
13561,"This is a good game, I love the development and it's like the story in front of the Fallout Franchise"
13562,Fallout Shelter is great

13564,"Good for a free game.

Not very complicated, but with a lot of different things to do.

Glitches a lot, but every glitch is unique - sometimes it just closes the game without warning, sometimes it completely wipes your vault and has no memory of that vault existing.

Money-grabbing achievements and game play (nearly impossible to get 20 Legendary dwellers without spending lots of money on lunchboxes or cheating)"
13565,"Yes on Steam! 
No on Mobile!"
13566,"So I am not really a big fan of these types of games but I love and I mean LOVE fallout so I wanted to check this out,when I first loaded up my vault alot was happening and I was confused but after reading enough and watching videos I understood it.The game can be really confusing at first but it gets better,alot better because unlike a city building game you have to worry about raiders,food,guns,and you need to send people to the wasteland and get stuff and if you dont have alot of money to spend dont worry I got 23 of the blue nuka cola I forgot the name but nuka blue is used to skip time and I have 45 nuka and half was bought but the other half was gotten.All in all I think you should try it."
13567,"Not bad, worth a try"
13568,"the game plays ez if you do not build an overseers room. once that happens(if you can actually complete the tutorial once you build the overseer room) the risk management aspects of the game go nitro and the game smashes the retard button. it makes no sense the pendulum swing of happiness of populace within 2hr span 90%>10% for example. the economy is shit. just the amount of sheer pain watching youre highly skilled/trained/educated/etc completely suck ass even with luck in a fight of a failed rush. you dont get many outside blood, alot of my growth came from inbreeding to reach unlock goals. I bred a dark skin ginger(ginger bred HA!) 

this game is basically half a real game, I guess that is why it is free."
13569,"I love this game, I do. But there's a load of game breaking bugs. 

Example= 

I Joined a quest with 3 of my dwellers, they did well and we found 3X 10mm pistols, or what I assumed that's what it was.
A bolt action rifle that looked pretty fucked up, and 3 quantum nuka colas. some ect shit like caps, those I did recieve after the quest. But everything else including the tailor'd suits were all lost.

Again, I did another quest to make up for all of the lost shit so I got all of my stimpacs and radaway, 5 of each.
I get in raid and one of them is getting the shit kicked outta them so I go to stimpac the fucker and guess what.

I had 0 of fucking both. I alt-f4'd.

Fuck you."
13570,To get all the achievements you need to open more than 600 lunchboxes (500 ‚Ç¨). It's gambling and a waste of time. I'm for banning microstransaction in games. Rating 18+ due to gambling.
13571,"Don't get it unless you want headaches and wasted money. I played it on my iPad, after I spent money, and it had issues with saving to the cloud. It said I needed to have the cloud active and it was. So I contacted the devs and they told me that if I removed it off my iPad it would fix it, wrong! I lost all my progress and all the money I spent over the years was lost. I contacted the devs yet again and they told me that I should have saved it to the could before I removed it. WTF???? They told me to remove it and it would be fine. They said I didn't need to save it before I did so because they would help me restore it but now they say they can't. WTF, really??? All my other games save to the cloud no problem."
13572,"Simple game but very addictive, love it and recoment it."
13573,A game ultra funny and adictive to play totally recommended
13574,"who cares about rules and stuff ""i do"""
13575,"This is the favorite game of Josef Mengele.

14/47 would breed a race of superhumans again."
13576,"Being a Fallout fan, its only natural to play anything related to it.Overall mostly fun and intereesting take on the Vaults itself, but playing it for longer time especialy at later levels with all waiting, paying for skipping time and everything, its best to be played ocasionaly whenever you get bored."
13577,"fun and simple game,good for killing time"
13578,"Fun distraction for taveling or on transit. Best used on a portable device since 'gameplay' is just a bunch of timers counting down until you get to tap the screen again. 
Build a vault, breed the inhabitants, assign worker to rooms, tap the screen.
A nice distraction with cute graphics so you don't get too bored on transit ride to work.
Loot boxes can be earned for free and mostly just contain junk, don't bother with the microtransactions."
13579,"i really like this game is fun to play when i have spare time to kill, its great how interactive you can be when going on mission and the choices you can make. I like the selective amount of rooms you can make and all the weapons and items you can craft. the only thing i would say to add to this game is to add some multiplayer to it, like aid other people, and send resources or help defend friends. and for fun invade peoples vaults maybe, or rescue friends from dying vaults."
13580,"Don't play this game if you like ""Having money."" If you are ok with living under a bridge, this game is fun and addictive and sometimes incredibly frustrating."
13581,"PROS:
-Fun and thrilling
-Customization of characters
-Getting to breed them is pretty fun
-New elements unlocked over time to keep things interesting
-Pets! Weapons! Clothes! Crafting! [i]Rushing wait times, failing, and watching pregnant women run screaming while everybody else puts out the fire or kills radroaches lmaoo.[/i]
-Game is pretty generous about giving you boosts.
-Eventually you can go on quests and get a lot better bounty, and you get to go on them with the dwellers you send out!
-If you zoom in on the dwellers, they say funny things.
-When you send dwellers into the wasteland, you can view a log of their actions in real time, and it's often pretty amusing.
-[spoiler] You can bypass all wait times by simply setting your computer's clock ahead. You can change it back to the correct time immediately. [/spoiler]

CONS:
-Micro-transactions are incredibly tempting, lol.
-Lots of sitting and waiting; LOTS of ""checking up"" on the game.
-NO AUTO-SAVE! You MUST manually save the game before exiting or all progress is lost. Blurgh...

FINAL VERDICT: It's free. It's good. Download it."
13582,"Fantastic free to play game.Starts easy, get harder soon.Cool time wasting thingy. Nice !"
13583,What did you expect from this game genre? 6/10
13584,my pp hurt
13585,"A fun game, would definitely recommend this."
13586,Best Gamer ever deserves to have a sequel!
13587,"Holy crap this game is so addicting! I played it on my iphone hours on end, non stop. Highly recommended!"
13588,"Asshats removed for mac, I'd upgrade to PC but not everyone has acess to mommy's checkbook so chill before u comment."
13589,"I use this game to make up for my leadership skills not being noticed by the people around me, making me depressed, sad, and alone. 

also deathclaws simulator, 10/10."
13590,[h1]Totally worth dwelling on it![/h1]
13591,I Was Playing On 2 Vaults And Suddenly 1 Of Them Got Deleted And I Didn't Mind To Care About It Because It Wasn't The Main Vault Which Wasn't That Big Of A Problem Till Now My Main Vault Got Deleted And I Never Deleted Any Vaults If This Is A Bug/Glitch Please Fix This I Played This For Weeks And Suddenly It Just Gets Deleted.
13592,"Probably one of the best free-to-play games out there. I first encountered this game for the iPad, and it seems most suited for the tablet format, i.e it is a game where you set some tasks running and then ""collect"" on those tasks after a set period of time. Best for occasional and frequent periods of gameplay rather than a prolonged session at the computer/tablet. It is a community-management game where you manage an underground shelter, and send dwellers off on expeditions in the wasteland where they can randomly encounter fights, treasures and so on. Dwellers back in your vault can be set to craft items as well, and fend up the occasional random raiders and other mutant bugs. Great graphics and varied quests make this game very entertaining, especially in bite-sized chunks. Definitely worth downloading - the only drawback is that this is not available for Macs or Linux systems."
13593,I don't see the fun. There are no choises everything is timed and planned out. Always very low on resources and you have to follow the path to survive at all. Only thing you can do is send people out and hope they don't die. Better to watch a youtube video of someone playing this.
13594,"It let's me live out my fantasy of having my character and Sarah Lyons intertwine with one another and become King and Queen of the wastelands. This fits with my fanfic perfectly. What's that, she dies a little after Fallout 3's Broken Steel DLC? Nope, she just ran over to my vault. It's canon. I will be purchasing many body pillows of Sarah Lyons to go with my custom Sarah Lyons action figure that I paid $2000 for. (It is life-size) and has a fleshlight built into it. Thank you Bethesda for this game."
13595,"only got this to hack it. PC version-3/10
                                      Moblie version- 8/10"
13596,try vault 77 challange 1 dude and a bunch of dogs cuz no pupetts :/
13597,It's a fun and addicting game. 10/10.
13598,on se fait chier un peu non ?
13599,Such an addicting game! Can't stop playing it.
13600,"For a mobile style game, I actually enjoy it.

Let's go over comparisons to other such games and why I prefer this one:
- Fewer automatic engagements. For example Quests are performed by you issuing orders rather than a message telling you how things went without you.
- Decent time spans. Usually you could be building things, taining characters, doping missions, etc and be lumped with ever increasing timeframes until you're literally waiting WEEKS for a single task to get done. With this game, you could for example get someone from 1 to 10 of an attribute within a few days, plus have rooms to train dozens of people in all the S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes simultaneously.
- Overall Fallout aesthetic. Blue and yellow Vault-Tec colour schemes, the Vault Boy look to your dwellers and other recognisable things make the game less generic and more enjoyable to fans of the franchise, or at least interesting to new people.
- Liberal premium currency for free. If you do quests, you will earn enough to boost various activities and not even spend a penny.
- Other premium items for free. The Mr Handy robots and pets can be obtained without throwing money at Bethesda, so again you can enjoy the game without constant wallet-nagging.

In summary, because this game was used as a sort of advertisement for Fallout 4, it doesn't have to squeeze, beg and bully cash out of you like your average browser/mobile game does. It makes its money back by keeping Fallout games on your mind in a non-threatening kind of way."
13601,Didn't like it that much
13602,Never have incest been a so important feature.
13603,Soooo addicting! Great game.
13604,a nice simple game.
13605,"why cant you use it on a 32 bit platform, wtf man"
13606,Great free to play game. If you enjoy the tiny tower style and fallout games then you'll enjoy this.
13607,It's fun... Until it's impossible to play without forking out money. Micro-payment are for idiots; pass!
13608,better than fallout 4
13609,I like it the way it is
13610,I think this game recommended for you.
13611,"It's not a bad free-to-play game. Also doubles as a great time killer. However, word of warning, don't spend money on the game, the lootboxes are a terrible system, plus there's plenty of save editors out there to where you can get back to where you were if your save ever gets corrupted, which isn't uncommon. But, other than that, this game isn't complete pay to win, which makes it definitely passable in my eyes, given that most free to play games nowadays are pay-to-win garbage."
13612,Loved it...Until my vault deleted itself somehow and I lost everthing. I wish I would I have read the reviews about this possibly happening before investing so much time into my vault.
13613,It's a great game that introduces an apocaliptic enviorment.
13614,"Very addictive intially, plenty to keep you busy whilst building your vault. End game is poor, little or nothing to do, and only keep nipping on to try and complete the last achievement, 20 legendary dwellers, which I have just about given up on.
Summed up, great to pass some time, but probably better to build another vault than keep an established one going, as there is nothing to do once vauly full/complete."
13615,good but since it got on computers now I think mods and a sandbox mode would be great and make th game feel new again but it is good for most of its solid gameplay
13616,"A good game to pass the time, but probably not best to play it on anything other than a phone"
13617,GOOD GAME TO FILL THE TIME
13618,Acceptable
13619,free and calming
13620,"This game is great, I really enjoy the fact that in-game purchases are not heavily advertised in the gameplay. This is a great game if you love games where you develope a society, like Cities: Skyines, or Planet Coaster. It can be quite funny and has it's moments, and once you figure out the game, it's a blast!"
13621,"Cool time wasting thingy. Starts easy, get harder soon. Nice !"
13622,"Awesome ""Mini Game"" for in between, fun animations and dynamics, combat system a little tedious but great game. No pay to win necessary, fair system and good time dynamics if you want to give tasks in the morning and check in from time to time.
Highly recommended!"
13623,you have to pay money to win the game. i am dissapointed in bethesda i though they could do better...
13624, This is a good game to play off and on and check on periodically. It requires a bit of strategy and run through.
13625,"It's free and it's fun, what more can one ask for?

I'd suggest avoiding the microtransactions in this game since lunch boxes can be easily acquired via someone else's save file or a save editor, should you want to just fool around. I'd suggest not doing this though until you've acquired all the achievements honestly. Also, anything you buy for real money is bound to your save. If it gets lost, deleted, corrupted or if you lose the game, all those items you paid for will disappear into the void. They'd be permanently gone!

[b]There is no official warning from Steam or Bethesda regarding this. Buy at your own risk.[/b]"
13626,"""This is radio free wasteland and we're bringing you the TRUTH! No matter how bad it hurts!""- Three Dog. Despite originally starting its life as a mobile game, Falllout Shelter has carried over well as a competent PC 'minigame'. Seeing as it's free, you would expect it to be riddled with in-game purchases and ridiculous pay walls. However, this just isn't the case and unexpectedly it is very generous with giving the player the variety of currencies the game uses. It is also fairly addictive (I have already wasted 6 hrs of my life clicking at the screen), albeit overlooking some of the little annoying  management/planning mechanics (such as defending against raiders and moving vault dwellers between rooms). Overall, I can see myself wasting another solid 6-12 hrs playing this game which I have to say it good going for a game of this nature."
13627,"Well.. I don't dislike this game. It's very fun and good but..

1. It deleted all of my progress just after one day of playing.
2. I had decided to buy a Mr. Handy just to help out around the vault because it was getting a bit big and turns out I lost my handy too. Cool."
13628,Noice gaem looool xdddddd
13629,"Fantastic game, very addicting ^^"
13630,"If you like to pass the time relaxed this is your game.
If not then you can find the game boring or repeatitive."
13631,"An entire sims type game set in the fallout universe but based upon mobile micro-transaction mechanics. I heard that Bethesda made more from this POS than all its other games. I doubt if that's true, but when a game is designed so that everything occurs at a glacial pace unless you pay to make it actually playable, then the game is totally hamstrung. I look forwards to the day that games like this are outlawed, and the tide has already turned - yaay Belguium!

To achieve anything without paying for the privilege is excruciatingly slow. If you send your vault dwellers out on missions it can take a literal 18 hours or more IN REAL TIME simply TO REACH the mission, which itself will NEVER last longer than 15 minutes. Of course, you can get there immediately if you are just willing part with 50 cents for the privilege!

It's telling that a number of positive comments say that this is a great game to play whilst watching the TV. If it's a good game to play whilst you are distracted and only giving it a fraction of your attention, then it's not a good game to play.

The game is a despicable cash drain designed to get you addicted before milking you dry with constant insidious reminders about how much more playable it is if you buy their stuff. You'd be better off to buy three premium triple A games than this. You'll get more for your money and they'll be decent games. Shameless exploitation."
13632,123
13633,"Sadly, this game is more frustration than it is worth on desktop. 
I don't know how they managed to make it run worse on desktop than it does on mobile, but they did. I really enjoy playing this on mobile. However on desktop the mechanics for clicking dwellers, dragging them to locations, trying to use stimpacks or rad-away on quests,  etc is TERRIBLE. 
That on top of the fact it sucks up a LOT more power on my computer than it should, given it is a mobile turned desktop game. Overall, I am just at a loss how they could take something from mobile that is so fun, and just completely ruin the experience moving it to desktop."
13634,"I really love this game I may not have played it much on the PC version but mostly on mobile and it managed to keep me invested quite the amount of time. The ads and prompts to pay for anything are kept to a minimum but most times you'll hardly notice it, love the cheesy pick-up lines and the room designs. The pressure that they put you through in defending your vault is honestly awesome because it doesn't push you into using your actual money to avoid major damage, unlike other games out there.."

13636,Great Fallout themed casual gaming. Good clean fun
13637,"Fallout Shelter is a relatively simple vault management game. In it, you take the role of an Overseer and are in charge of building your own Vault, keeping its inhabitants happy, making them reproduce, and so on. You can also send them on missions to gather items, which you later use to craft stronger weapons and equipment. Overall, I'd say there's not a lot to say about this game; it's a mobile port, so you shouldn't go in expecting a more ""traditional"" Fallout experience, but rather a casual game with a Fallout theme.

The gameplay, like I mentioned, is like a management sim. You start out with an empty Vault, and you must start building rooms to accomodate incoming Vault Dwellers. There's also three resources you've to take into account: energy, water and food, each with their respective room. As more people arrive into your Vault, you unlock new rooms, including the Overseer office, from where you can send your dwellers into missions. You also have to train your dwellers, as your Vault will sometimes be attacked by bandits, or other Wasteland creatures, even Deathclaws, who can easily destroy an unprepared Vault.

Personally, I found this to be a pretty entertaining game, although by the late game, when you've maxed out several of your dwellers and finished all missions, it gets pretty boring. Also, it really feels like a mobile game with the long waiting times between missions, and the daily rewards, that give you a lunchbox (kind of a lootbox) every week. So, what do I think? It's nothing spectacular, but I can recommend it."
13638,"It is quite fun, and better then a mobile version. 

Still if you gonna spend time sitting by the pc, better play real Fallout :)"
13639,Can you guys make this game advailble for windows 10?
13640,cool
13641,"Bethesda coughed up this game to keep people busy until the Fallout 4 release, and made a big deal of it being free to play. I never actually played it as such, but gave it a shot now just because I was curious, and the game has gotten a pretty good amount of positive reviews on Steam.

To keep it short, the game both scratched an itch and annoyed the hell out of me at the same time.

Undoubtedly, the idea of managing a post-nuclear vault is an interesting prospect. The game has a nice style to it, and contains many familiar elements from the Fallout games. The big problem with the game, is that it's not a typical strategy/tycoon type of game that a seasoned gamer might wish for. Instead, it's a game about collecting resources by clicking, and waiting for real-time timers, just like certain mobile type games. It is a gameplay model I'm not very fond of at all, but I might even forgive it if you didn't have to wait a very long time for things to happen. The waiting times are too long - sometimes up to several hours, and I find myself just staring at the screen while occasionally clicking on things that doesn't feel anything close to rewarding. You can actually pay money to skip things, but I feel absolutely no desire to do so.

The game also is quite shallow. While I haven't yet unlocked all the possible rooms, I've gotten the gist of the basics. You assign dwellers to certain rooms, but they don't even appear to be doing anything useful. A looped animation is all you will see, and an occasional random comment if you are zoomed in enough. Sometimes, disasters occur, such as fires, infestations and raider attacks, but you don't really have to do a lot. The dwellers mostly automatically take matters into their own hands as well as they can, and that is usually enough. You might have to equip them and heal them now and then, and possibly order them around if rooms are unmanned. They stick to the room you picked, unless there's a disaster in progress. They have no life, but work in that room 24/7. You can order them to go to the residental area to make babies. They level up occasionally, but what that is good for I do not know. You can train them in certain rooms to improve their attributes.

Building the vault is limited to a certain area, and a certain amount of room types which unlock as your shelter gets more dwellers. Rooms can be combined to form bigger rooms, and rooms can be upgraded a few times. Each room typically focus on one of the special attributes of the dwellers, giving what I assume are bonuses based on those. All you have to do is keep the rooms manned and connected. It is a rather bland experience.

Eventually, you will be able to send dwellers out on quests. Actually, you can send them out to explore earlier, but they just end up dead eventually, apparently not having enough brains to figure out when to return. You have to do that manually. You can track them by watching a log, which hints at a deeper simulation, but I fear it's a lie. Quests are a bit more interesting, since you get to order them around when they reach their destination. You tell them which rooms to enter and you can also pick enemy targets. However, in my experience, it's best to just stick to automatic combat. The combat itself feels like some kind of semi-turnbased kind of thing, but it's not very responsive and trying to affect it in any meaningful matter seems like a waste of energy. You'll also get to grab loot by clicking containers and dead bodies.

I want to like this game, and I like the idea of a management game based on the Fallout setting. However, playing it is mostly a frustrating and unsatisfying experience. I just find it hard to recommend it."
13642,"My new drug,very addictive to this game on both platform and of course a good game to kill the time."
13643,It........just.........works
13644,"Fun little game but this is pay to win, some quests you can be waiting days for you men to get to the location or ofcourse you can buy some things from the store and get their instantly! Same with leveling, you can either wait days or pay through the teath for crap. Fun little game ruined by pay to play mechanics. Easy fix found here for free though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naPwj3k50dA"
13645,"It's very fun if you know what you're doing. I accidently didn't bring anything to heal my best dwellers when they went on a quest and they all died, which made me quit. It is fun for someone who has experience with it though."
13646,Fun game to have on pc. Good game to play when you want to pass time.
13647,"Boring, these game is for mobile
for PC ? not this one 
Monster keep attack and can collect only 3 main
Power, Food, Water....

If you want to build or unlock faster
you must buy or wait longer loop zzz"
13648,"I didn't know it was built for smartphones untill I had to look up how the dwellers stats (SPECIAL) work. If you wonder, there is no ingame tooltip and almost no button/menu. Very confusing when you expect a PC game. 

If you intend to play this on PC, you have few options : 
- run it a few minutes, then quit and come back later
- do something else at the same time
- put a lot of money into it 
Full time focus on the game will get you bored very quickly. 

I don't know if it's only me, but the drag and drop - only way to move and give orders to Dwellers - is very unreliable. Having a pause button would help work around that problem when an incident or attack occurs. 

I would give this a positive recommandation if the User Interface was adapted for PC gamers. 
Free game, so go ahead and try it yourself !"
13649,like a mobile game but on pc
13650,"pros: spent a lot of time just playing this to pass time since i missed the fallout series

cons: just lost my vault which has 33 hours of progress and max dwellers, it was the only vault i had and i even spent some money on it; upon looking it up theres no way to get your vaults back nor to get back money you spent so fucking thanks guys

I sent people out on a quest and my game just straight up crashed my laptop and now its all gone :') 

good game guys"
13651,Y E S
13652,"I really enjoy this game.  It's not too deep, but it is nice when I just want to chill and relax."
13653,"Cute little game to pass the time.  You keep the fallout shelter going, keep your people happy and multiplying, and continue building and upgrading rooms as you can build up the needed CAPS.   Not much work involved but since I got this on sale it was a good deal. There is no intense gameplay unless you rush a room to put out a fire or repel raiders which is somewhere rare.  
It is a completely free game but you have the opportunity to buy items to get ahead but not needed.
The game could be a bit addicting but just play for awile and then take a break for the game continues where you left off without no losses.

The HUGE HUGE downside of this game (maybe 80 hours or so)  is that when you hit a certain level you are done. There is absolutely no endgame and at that point the game is worthless. This may be a reason to stay away from it as well."
13654,Fun game for passing Idle time.
13655,"It was a fun timepass for a while, but the glitchy click/drag registration ultimately made me quit. It's worth a try tho."
13656,its very fun but after a while it will get boring so i suggest playing once a day for an hour or so
13657,cool game
13658,Petty guud
13659,Anything is Better than playing Fallout 76.
13660,"It would crash my PC every other day, even though i can run PUBG at 60 fps on high. The game crashed today and deleted all my saved data. I will not recommend this game on steam to anyone."
13661,"Just port from smart phones? Realy? Thanks, lol"
13662,i play it on my phone when my pc doesnt feel so good
13663,"I'd give it a 9/10 below is a much more detailed review.

The game itself is overall fun and addicting I really like how they didn't make it p2w its basically 100% free to play. But some  people call it a cash grab but not really, I've been playing it for over a year now and haven't spent a penny. Sure the game has starter kits and loot boxes but those usually ruin the game and lootboxes can be easily obtained especially early on and late game. 

The base game is very slow progressing but rewarding. I had a vault on the pc version and the android version. I got several dwellers from a few lootboxes I got doing quests on the android version and before I knew it all heck broke loose. The vault constantly got attacked and ran out of power however it had sixteen people and food or power. The 2nd vault on pc had barely anyone at first but was really wealthy  food, water, and power was plentiful. Both vaults were created day 1 and roughly around the same time. This is just how random chance and time consuming fallout shelter is. 

I recommend playing this game along with something else or inbetween breaks, this game is kind of like farm vill or insertfbgamehere but without the begging. The game does get kind of boring late game. I actually had a max size vault containning all fully S.P.E.C.I.A.l dwellers. It got boring real fast, deathclaws were like kittens to this vault they'd usually get to the diner on the 2nd floor and just die without causing any real damage. This is with no money spent mind you just casually playing the game atleast once per day for a few minutes.

The questing is a lot of fun and a good way to get items fast more geared towards f2p players or late game players who want to get some cosmetics or completionists who want every item in the game for some reason. The quests have little to no story so not for story fans. However they usually have refrences to previous fallout titles. 

Well that is the review I recommend you try it for yourself!

13664,it dose not work on luenix mint
13665,Quite a fun game for daily log in and management :) already spent quite a few hours building base while passing some time.
13666,stupid fighting game mechanics in quest. very stupid
13667,Not enought context.
13668,just play it
13669,"Would not reccomend.
After playing for almost 10 hours, it's just a crappy fallout themed mobile game desperate to get you to buy microtranactions and spend more money on everything.
People only play it because it was made by The sacred Bethesda.

There's a lot of illogical nonsense and annoyances in this game, like rooms catching fire every 3 seconds, roaches and moles burrowing out of the ground.... through the ceiling.. Dwellers just stand still and get hit 5-6 times by enemies with a big dumb vault boy grin on their face.

Slow, tedious, non-gameplay.
The quests are an absolute joke. level 7 dweller requirement, and a 4 damage weapon, so I sent a level 41 dweller with a 7 damage weapon. second room has 3 feral ghouls that proceed to rip him apart, melting his health in a few seconds, while he just stands there with that blank stupid look on his face no shooting back. and then to add insult to injury, the game asks me If i want to use microtransaction points to retry the quest.

Terrible, poorly made, freemium trash with a Fallout skin.

13673,"Fallout shelter ‚Äì 10/8/2018 ‚Äì 7:27PM


It started out well enough, little men and women came into my vault. You go through the motions, give them names (Darius, Dmitri, Susan, etc), give them clothes, many mouths to feed. Ultimately this is a game about sacrifice, ‚Äúwho will I send on this dangerous mission?‚Äù I rustle my fingers through my overgrown beard, questioning ‚ÄúWill Dmitri survive this night? I hope the Ghouls do not get my Dmitri!‚Äù I choke up, butterflies form in my stomach as I click the little button, sending little Dmitri into the harsh wasteland. 
	
5 minutes later, Dmitri was dead, I looked up from my computer screen, stared harshly at my ceiling and started to cry, tears rolled down into my overgrown beard. I slammed my desk hard with an iron fist, Coke cans and Fanta bottles sprung to life and flew to the ground. I slumped down and sobbed into my hands, I shouted ‚ÄúI should have sent Susan, she had better Endurance stat!‚Äù, my roommate Bogdan Shouted from his room down the hall, ‚Äúyou should have sent Susan! what were you thinking man!?‚Äù The City Hunter OST blared from his bedroom, ‚ÄúGet wild and tough, hitori de wa tokenai ai no pazuru o daite‚Äù I clenched my palms against my ears ‚Äúmake this stop‚Äù. I shut the game off.

I come back to it 2 weeks later to find that I could have revived Dmitri at any time.

Frequently, you will find yourself running low on energy, it is important to keep your energy levels  higher than your other stats because power outages lower the efficiency of the workers. Speaking of power plants, the first line of defense for raider attacks should always be an energy room as the most efficient workers for power plants use the Strength attribute, making these vault-dwellers effective in a fight.



Pro
-Easy to play
-Looks ok
-Gun

Con
-Brought me great sorrow
-Fantastical horrors hide in the shadows

7/10, Thank goodness Dmitri is okay, I will never send him out again. 
"
13674,Nice
13675,"Great game overall. Its something you can check up on every now and again. I havnt found any bugs except a few graphical ones like a dweller on a bike in the Fitness Center doesnt exactly use it right though it was funny to see and the dweller's skill still levels up normally so its only a graphics (the way how it looks) bug which is whatever. Though I must say reading some reviews down below that people didnt like this game was mostly because how the game handles random events such as attacks like mole rats or death claws. The game isnt gonna roll over and let you kill it. You have to level up your dwellers, build training rooms to increase for example strength, gather/create cloths and weapons so your dwellers can defend themselves, and so much more. There is more to this game then simply collecting the power, water, and food room resources. You gotta send a dweller out by themselves (click, hold, and drag out into the waste land) but make sure to give them some stimpacks so they can stay out there longer and your dweller over time will gather items such as weapons and caps for you to use in your vault. Anyways this game has more to it and isnt a push over. If you want to have a taste of an unfair game go try or watch a game called Darkest Dungeon. I have over 100 hours into this game and Im loving every bit of it. If you wish for help you just gotta ask :D

p.s. Death Claws attack when your vault has 60+ dweller and Ghouls attack around 45+ dwellers."
13676,pay to win but without the winning part
13677,Good chill game!
13678,"I loved this game and enthusiastically recommended it to a lot of people...

Until I fell victim to a major issue that deleted my vault irreversibly. Lucky for me I only wasted 46 hours and ¬£20 on it before this happened. Bethesda support is an absolute joke and a waste of time too, you can't even submit a support ticket for a technical issue. 

Lots of other people have had the same problem and it's been going on for over a year, sucks to be me for not reading the forum before playing but I guess I expected better from Bethesda. Never again.

If you play this game, back up your save files every single time you play."
13679,This game is a really good game
13680,"I mean it can be boring, but it is fun at the same time so l ol"
13681,"Meh.  Buggy!  The ""Diplomatic Mission"" doesn't work.  Once my guys arrive at destination, game reloads back to shelter.  Now stuck without my best guys, giear and weapons."
13682,need creative mode were you dont need resorses i now i spell rong im not in midle school k and more stuff for creative that you think of

13685,"personally, i hate base building, point clicker games and all that, its not for me. but this game is REALLY good. its fun, passes the time, and you feel really accomplished for what you've created. its great, do it, no excuses, try it."
13686,"At the beginning, it's a lot of fun.  Fallout Shelter follows the typical ""free"" game formula.  But as you begin to make progress, level up characters, get some decent weapons and get a large number of ""dwellers"" in your shelter things really slow down.  I'm talking you will play 30 minutes, then have to wait another 24 hours for something in the game to happen; everything in the game runs on a timer system.  The timer counts down even when you are not playing the game.  Want to play a mission?  Wait another 18 hours.  Want to level up a character to max strength?  Wait another 17 hours. 

.... unless you buy loot boxes (with real money)!  But don't think you can make one purchase and enjoy the game at a normal pace.  Oh no my freind.  Even if you buy the largest ""bundle"" of Nuka Cola Quantum, that's only enough to fully level up about two or three characters.  However, a full shelter will have 200 characters!  I happily purchased $45 US dollars worth of loot when I started playing, because I am willing to support developers that make a fun game.   All in all, that money was wasted.  I have 90 hours into the game and I am still grinding....30 minutes per day.  It will never end...."
13687,Very addictive.
13688,More of a mobile game really.
13689,"Interesting, but much too slow to enjoy on PC."

13691,i love this game!
13692,"Very bad port to PC. Huge glitch / exploit can be done speeding up everything. (without 3rd party programs)

Do not buy items till they fix it."
13693,Fallout Shelter is a great game with an amazing amount of quests but the problem is that they have to add a time pause since the game contuines without you on it which means on pc if your on vacation and dont bring your computer it can ruin your supplies however no raiders or fire/infestations can occur while gone.
13694,"Everything was fine until I noticed how much of a pay to win barrier this game is. I had 51 dwellers and was doing pretty good, until I decided to rush a room. A single ratmole outbreak killed over half of all my dwellers and this ruined my anticipation to continue playing this game. This game has some unfair mechanisms to get money out of the player. Apart from hard incidences that can occure any time, you have to deal with one of the worst AI possible. I'm 100% confident that the AI in this game is bad on purpose so players pay for additional crap to make it easier to deal with certain situations.
Having several hours of progress ruined in just a single fucking outbreak is ridiculous. Not to mention how boring this game actually is. I'm just glad that these pricks didn't get a single cent out of me."
13695,play phone game on pc very good idea
13696,"I played the game for just 2 days and I was actually enjoying it up until my computer suddenly shutdown due to overheating (for a seemingly lightweight app this game really heats up my laptop!)

After restarting the game, I was stunned to find out that my vault save had simply disappeared!

After reading several forum entries, I found out that many people had their saves disappear in similar circumstances, and that the game's support had no solution to recover them.

Even though I didn't make that much progress in the game (or made any in game purchases), I consider this to be such a major issue that I just don't feel like playing it anymore...

13711,Has it merits! Not to money grabbing.
13712,"-Updated below-

This is so bad, and so boring, that i dont even feel like writing a proper review!  Its really THAt boring.. 

Its the base building of X-Com: Enemy Unknown. And thats about it....  

Quests... While they add something to the game, (and are indeed quite neat) trying to get dwellers to go,and  equip them is frustrating as heck!  It allows me 3, but it keeps sending only one, and none of my rad away, or stim packs get equiped!  So Ive repeatedly wsated caps, and Nuka Colas sending them out, ojnly to find they have no way to heal,a nd are alone.. Its my fault for accepting sending them alone, but its only allowing me to send one of my 22 dwellers! Its not telling me why I cant send more, or howe to equipe stim packs!

Raiders get through the door TOO easily, and are hitting every 10minutes!

I have no doubt, there are some minor events, but that doesnt change how mind-numbingly boring, the base game is.. And Im currently playing an Idle Clicker game, to bring some perspective...

Edit:  It actually does get better, but slower.. Severely slower.. As you progress. Im now over 40 Ddwellers, and about 19ish rooms.. The quests are good fun, and pretty neat.. Feels like playing a mobile fallout 3 or NV..

What I mean by slower, is timers slowly increase, you start training specific traits, and quests themselves.. Youre talking 4-8-even a full day in hours.. Now, initially, you will pick up quite a few Nuka Colas.. Especially on quests.. But they stop that quickly.. Itas a great marketing scheme.. give you plenty, and let you see how much fun the game is (most ppl will blow them, expecting them to continue to rain on you) then it begins to trickle, as wlel as progress.. Ive now spent 2 days, and only picked up 3 new dwellers.. 2 of wihch were of my own birthings..Since Im not getting new wdwellers, I cant advance rooms.. If I get too many, supplies get strained (and ive been generous with the 3 basics, keeping the little bar at about the middle of each meter, or lower)I dont understand the radio station, as its timer is sometimes very short, others very long, but only when theres actually a new dweller do I click it like other rooms that gain inventory.  majority of the time, nothing comes of it.. 

basically, it did get fun, but then slowed so much Im likely going ot end up being done wihtthegame, after only a few short days.   So to sum up.. Confusing in the beginning, fun in the middle, and then finally slow into a boring waiting game shortly thereafter.."

13714,"Game is fun and addictive. Makes you want to keep coming back everyday to make sure no one's dead yet. Which did happen to one of my vaults once, a sad day it was to remove all the dead."
13715,"   Fallout Shelter puts you in control of a [lazy mobile port of an] underground Vault from Vault-Tec. Build the [best] Vault [that you can manage with the horrible documentation], keep your Dwellers [alive], and protect them from the dangers of [constant Deathclaw attacks]!

13716,"Fallout Shelter is a cool game,"
13717,"Simple, yet very addictive and interesting game. If this game ever gets sequel, I wish it was a bit more complex and variable, more enemy types"
13718,"I'm positive that if you were a sociopath you'd get a ton more enjoyment out of this game, and I simply cannot decide whether or not that's a good thing.

The art style is fantastic, the mechanics work smoothly, the management systems feel unique, and the quests are fun and rewarding. No two people will have the same experience because of how much freedom you truly have over your vault as a whole, and each and every dweller individually. Though there are microtransactions, they are some of the most unobtrusive I've seen, and are by no means necessary to progress at a decent speed.

 Even though the game is just the PC version of the existing (and extremely successful) mobile management game, it doesn't feel like a mere app. It all just kind of, well, works. It all works, and that's really nice. 

Also, it's free, so you might as well give it a shot.

"
13719,"Many Dwellers. Such wasteland. Very addictive. 8/10 Stars

I do like this game a lot but i prefer the mobile version since this game needed time to progress. So i can close and open easier in the mobile. Go get it! its totally free and no advertisement in mobile version."

its way too hard to play everyday then it gets boring so i would recomend just getting it on mobile unless you can play every 2 hours"
13722,"+Cheapest Fallout game you'll ever get.
+When you have pets, you can spam the click button to make them talk
+It's Nuclear in Hard Mode
+PS4‚â§PC

Overall, I play this to preoccupy myself and I'm waiting for Fallout 76 reviews."
13723,A nice little game!
13724,a very good game well for the type of game it is 9.5 out of ten if not better
13725,"Great game. Love the way it controls and loot boxes, or as the game calls it lunch boxes, are not too hard to get rare items. Great for pass time, not for a game to play for hours and hours."
13726,Doing fine till one single molerat killed all of my dwellers.  Nothing would kill it. Game is ruined. There goes all that hard work  a stupid gitch.
13727,yosh
13728,Highly adictive. Aware!!
13729,Better than Fallout 4 :)
13730,Good for people who can't purchase the Fallout games. Sucks at everything else.
13731,"My friend reccommended this game and, after all the great things he said about it, I was expecting an awesome game, but I was very disappointed. First of all, it has in-game purchases (which, in my opinion, don't help a game). The gameplay is repetitive and boring. People rarely come, and rushing almost always fails. Rooms take FOREVER to make anything, so your power, food, and water runs out quickly and everybody just gets mad. It even takes 30-40 minutes just to make something that barely heals ONE person. And don't get me started on the EXTREMELY OP mole-rats and raiders. They pretty much kill the settlers becuase they won't even defend themselves. Also, you can't control your person while they are searching the wilderness. Because the text from your person is just pre-coded, it just repeats it over and over and over again. This game is very bad, and I would NOT reccommend playing the game. At least it is free..."
13732,"Addictive!!! its true free to play but has a pay to speed things up option, but anything you can get in the shop you can also get free in game, it will just take longer to do."
13733,fun and all but boring
13734,niceee!!!
13735,addictive little game.  enjoyed it
13736,"fun distracion, NEVER BUY ANYTHING YOU CAN GET IT FOR FREE ONLINE"
13737,"Characters look cool, someday they should make cartoon about it"
13738,I mainly play it on Xbox but its a bit better on PC I like the game a lot.
13739,old school
13740,"I liked the game but for 1 BIG ISSUE.   The game would not save.  When I saved the game and shut down, then start the game again, the clock kept going even though I shut down and saved."
13741,"IT'S FUCKING FREE, WHO CARES IF IT'S GOOD OR NOT!"
13742,is fun and cool
13743,omg this game is boring
13744,it is alright at first then is kinda grindy
13745,Good to kill the time.
13746,"oi when I try to launch Fallout Shelter, it doesn't work. It goes to the loading screen and then shuts down. Does anyone know what is going on? 

Oh btw when Fallout Shelter does work it's pretty good 8/10."
13747,well i gote levill 47 and i asdenty delit all my geer and i tickit it and thay wont give me my stuf back thar custer suport trits pleapil licke ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it tock licke 3 yers to gite all the gear i hade and i cood never gite it back so i wood note play this game if i was u . but it is vary fun bute thack to long to git niny thing.
13748,Computer crashed cause of an unrelated issue. Lost the save file as well as the cloud save due to corruption.
13749,"Its a good ""slow me down"" game that you can pick up and drop whenever you choose.
I played this alot in my phone a few years back and its just as good as I remember.

As for microtransaction, its fair, the shop just helps you progress smoothly but you can purely play f2p. (though I bought a few dozen Mr.Handy cuz Codsworth <3)"
13750,Nice and easy click adventure game. Useful to blow off steam after hardcore gaming sessions.
13751,"If you enjoy smashing your d**k in a door, go ahead and play this game. The latest update created an unplayable situation wherein the first quest eliminates the hub and prevents you from accessing anything. After having uninstalling / reinstalling 4 times, I am going to uninstall this P.O.S. 

Hey, Bethesda, when you fix your game, let me know."
13752,a great game If You Have Nothing Else to do :)
13753,Very good.
13754,"This game is great, because you have to maintain a vault made by Vault-Tec. You get to give Dwellers jobs and keep them happy and alive! For more reviews visit Ganunu Cult's curator page!"
13755,Was fun until i built the Nuka-Cola Bottler and it didnt give Nuka-Cola! How fun is it to just build YET ANOTHER room that gives food and water when i have a ton of them? BOOOOOO!
13756,"Very repetitive and an obvious cash grab.
Not to mention the bugs, expecially the one that randomly deletes the progress of all your quests."
13757,Very nice and creative game!
13758,"Got frustrated at lack of progress and eventually bought a few lunch boxes, got nothing but resources my vault made anyway.

Rip Off
"
13759,...it's free
13760,"I like this game 
One tip: Learn the lore of Fallout 4"
13761,Great game! Last achievemnt causes cancer though...
13762,Vault 420...The wokest vault in all of earth
13763,"Highly addictive! FOS grows on you like a bad rash that has time rushing by, as you mutter ""just one more thing, then I'll call it a night."" The game is as slick as a Vault Tech rep, with its Pip-Boy characters and X-Com Ant colony point-of-view, all combining to draw you - insidiously - into a  grindhog's heaven of personnel, resource, base-building and questing. You - as the all-powerful Overseer - hold the power of life and death over your people."
13764,"Great game, then after 27 hours it decides to lose my save file and I can't reclaim the backup file either. :/ Lesson learned. Need to backup my saves, but after reading about it online, it seems to be an ongoing issue with this game. So I have marked this game as not recommended because if you dont know about manually backing up your save, you are in danger of losing everything. Luckily I didn't spend any money on this game, and I'd be even more pissed off if I had. 
Play at your own risk. And backup your saves manually with FSSE (Which I only found out after losing my save) Doubt I'll replay this. I'd progressed quite far and it's a bummer to lose all my progress."
13765,1 Radroach killed an entire room of vault dwellers.
13766,ok
13767,"As the first ""Fallout"" game that I played, it soon pulled me into the world of the other Fallout games. I quite enjoyed building my Vault, placing rooms however I saw fit. Eventually, the game gets boring (not being able to get more than 200 Dwellers), but most of the time, it's great!"
13768,Fun and very addictive
13769,"Good game that gets boring over time.
Checking your vault to see how everybody's doing even though you can't win or lose anything.

13770,"Fantastic game. 
Excellent too play whilst watching tv shows."
13771,"PTW... how disapointing...

+ Fastest window close button ""X"" ever..."
13772,Had this game on Ios Android and pc and creating a little vault will never get old
13773,"DON'T BUY ANYTHING ON THIS GAME

Tried buying starter pack and one crate never pooped up it's been a while. 

Would not recommend"
13774,"After 50 dwelvers you have to buy Nuka Cola....not sure if you can buy enough after that... I think i will stop here, but anyway I give positive feedback as I played 40h for free :D"
13775,What a weird concept of a game.
13776,this is a very bad gambling game do not play it at all
13777,"Well it's fun for what it is, but hugely time consuming, while you mostly just stare at your screen waiting for things to happen, or quests to start. The latter of course is just a way to grab some money from the impatient players..."
13778,"After power outtage saves were corrupted.
Even if the cloud saves are enabled, i wasn't able to get my old vault running.
This is time for me to end this, eventually."
13779,Free-to-play fun game. Would totally reccommend to people that want to try it out!
13780,"After all this time still a nice little gem to play in some spare time.
Bigger vaults will take some time to manage, touch controls a bit finnicky at times."
13781,decent 7/10
13782,"After playing for only a few hours, it soon became apparent that this game is pure manure.  A great idea ruined.

The slow pace makes the game tedious, the cost of upgrades is insane and indicates this is another gouging game with one hand on your wallet and the other on your compulsive addictive ego.  Better than drugs, sure, but more expensive.

You know, games used to be JUST GAMES, to entertain or educate perhaps, historically games cost nothing, a stick, some dust, away you went.  A game did not dip into your pocket every 5 seconds, as this game, loadout and most others do,

Where do you usually go to be passively robbed?  A casino.  This modern genus of 'games' have only one objective; how to get as much money out of you while they still hold your attention, disgraceful.

Personally i can only suspect this game proves expensive and pointless, I will not waste more time on it, while friends say it isnt worth the effort and they managed to play far longer than i could.  

Dissapointing, no reset?  Removed after less than 24 hrs.  Higly recomended for dull people with no life and deep wallets.  
Me, I just wanted something light to play.  Foiled once again!!  Back to FREECELL and SOLITAIRE for me, at least until they make you pay for each card."
13783,100% suces rate more like 0% :\
13784,"Game starts out great. but its been out for years i still play once in a while but never too long as this game is riddled with horrible bugs. gota love it when u get three back to back rad scorpion attacks that drain ur power to nothering and you have ten training rooms full of people not training and as power finly comes back a 4th rad scorpion attack. Fix the game already I will never put money in this game again untill they fix it. I Hate creation club. we should all just play west world, they may have stole it but atleast it plays well. bethesta U SUCK SINCE CREATIVE CLUB."
13785,"Overall a good time killer, better to check in once a day kind of mobile game.
With that said I do not recomend this game due to microtransactions and to poor coding. Poor coding being loosing 2 save files via the mobile version, and 1 via steam edition. If this issue is fixed then the game is worth a download. Guess I can't complain too much though, the game is free."
13786,good game
13787,"Premise: name a Vault, get Dwellers and build rooms to thrive. Take quests and collect resources to success

Looks good, plays well, has good sound, free, it's fun, microtransactions are surprisingly optional (you can get lootboxes by simply completing simple objectives )and even has a little bit of story

HOWEVER

Can be slow at times, like when waiting to get a new Dweller, which is SUPER important to advance, the combat system is kinda dumb and, now the reason why I won't play it anymore, you need to regularly check back to collect resources and stuff, so only play it if you have free time"
13788,flatout shulker
13789,"Fallout Shelter is a really fun and addictive game and the fact that it's free makes it even better so if you think of installing it just do it it's not that ""big"" either and can be played on pretty much any device!"
13790,"You don't even have to play on survival mode for this godforsaken crap to undo EVERYTHING you've built up. I started a second game after getting a better understanding of the mechanics, got an absurdly powerful plasma rifle as my first reward, used training rooms to amp up the stats of my residents, and how was I done in? A single random group of burrowing mole rats made me burn through ALL of my stimpacks, and killed over half of ALL my characters (levels ranged from about 5 to 20 for an average of 15 or so). We're talking about the 2nd weakest enemies in the series besides RADROACHES HERE! I swear on my honor and sanity, during that same sequence that made me rage quit, I had 1 Vault Dweller armed with an enhanced sniper rifle that I believe had armor-piercing capabilities (I uninstalled the game the second I quit so I can't confirm) vs. the last molerat in the Vault, fired about 3 to 4 vollys of shots, and the the rat STILL KILLED HIM! This would seem to suggest that standard enemies can get stronger if you don't meet some arbitrary gameplay milestones. Not that you'd know given that the Help section says nothing to that effect, there's no level indicator for enemies, and you also can't get a numerical value for their health, or depending on the circumstances, even a health bar! I assume this because to get feral goul attacks in my previous run, but I decided to wait on making babies to power level stats this time. The final record for how long I lasted in the game before getting royally screwed was 3 goddamn days.

To clarify, after the basics have been introduced and your Vault population expands new training rooms that increase stats are unlocked. This is because the only thing that leveling does is increase your character's health, but said health increase is supposedly greater if the Endurance stat is increased. But just like everything else in this damn game, there's absolutely no way to know what the Hell impact it's having. Let me just go over the things the game will never let you know: The aforementioned extent to which Endurance impacts health increase, the numerical value of the character's health, the default likelihood of ANYTHING happening when using the radio to broadcast in the wasteland or having a deathclaw randomly show up at your Vault door, what stat (if any) governs melee weapons' effectiveness, how close/far a character is from building up to a critical attack, and with regards to rooms, almost everything. Want to know to what extent merging rooms helps BEFORE spending money? Too bad! Want to know precisely to what extent increasing training room speed helps before spending thousands of caps to upgrade it? Too bad! Want to know if the Help section (AKA Bethesda) is BSing you regarding training speed going faster with more people in the room? Well I sure as hell didn't notice any difference. Want to know whether you have the crafting resources/recipies necessary to make something in the later crafting menus BEFORE spending thousands of caps upgrading a weapon crafting room? Too bad!

Even the RADROACHES can be completely absurd! Get like one stuck in an individual room with the aforementioned plasma rifle and It'll be dead before the animation or sound of an attack can be heard, but have them spawn in a large room far from anyone and 5 to 6 can turn into 10 to 20 for no reason! And one of the rooms is literally incapable of housing residents despite being a location enemies can spawn in! And just to put the cherry on the garbage gameplay sundae, your little Vault minions could only be more incompetent if they shot themselves! If an enemy walks into another room, your poor helpless flamethrower-brandishing uber-guard suffers from crippling depression that prevents him/her from pursuing due to their profound sense of failure to stop them earlier and must be dragged by you every single damn time! But don't think that it ends there: melee enemies on the other end of the room can still hit your sniper-rifle weilding Vault-Dweller on the opposite side, and they most certainly WILL be on the opposite side because Bethesda naturally understands that if there's one thing that a time-sensitive, resource-draining, cluster f@(# of a combat sequence needs, it's for every single goddamn character to waltz over to completely arbitrary locations within a room before actually opening fire, or putting out a literal fire! And on top of THAT, human combatants will often stumble and stagger for what feels like an eon after loosing all their health dragging out the time that resources can't be produced for even LONGER. Thus putting you in the position of sitting there unable to do anything but wait as a bunch of drama-queen raiders drunkenly stumble about harmlessly with your Vault Dwellers being equally passive, even as the sirens blare and the resource bar flashes like it's actively being depleated. I knew Bethesda were hopelessly inept in most respects but I didn't think they'd find a way to screw up ""We're giving you this for free""!

Think that's the end of the BS? Nope. If you look through the Help section, it turns out that the radio that can be used to attract people to your Vault, as well as pretty much any instance in which the Vault door opens has the capacity to bring deathclaws charging into the vault.
...
DEATHCLAWS. And if my experience with the molerats and roaches is any indication I could only expect every character to drop dead the second they enter the room, never take any damage, and somehow fill my computer with malware, take money out of my account for microtransactions, and give me cancer. It's never happened to me, but again, I only ever got as far as feral gouls, so it's probably a late-game thing.

With the gameplay being a mindless grindfest, the only other possible asset is story which, as one would naturally expect from a free game is nigh non-existant in terms of being a source of sincere motiveation. You're a Vault, and there are people in it, The End. Oh, there are quests that you can send Vault Dwellers out on, assuming that you can spare any of them, your valuable equipment, AND you build an Overseer room. Even after all that you're rewarded with staring at a travel progress time for hours on end because it can take up to 30 HOURS (likely more since the travel times seem to increase as the quests progress and I think I recall one having a 36 hour time to start with) to get to/from a location for ONE mission. So good luck trying to stay invested in quests that have you sitting around doing nothing for hours waiting for one or two lines of dialogue to give you any more story before making you do it all over again.

And on a personal note, the game is an affront to biology and REALLY in favor of the Adam and Eve story because there's more incest than a Southern... probably should stop now before I violate Steam's guidelines regarding user posts before I finish that. But the point is, there's no amount of in-family screwing that can't occur in the game. The weirdest thing is that the game actually kind of encourages it with the mechanics... No I'm serious, character names can repeat so it's difficult to keep track of who's related to who, and it takes HOURS for radio calls to bring people to your vault... IF they bring people to your Vault. That was one of the reasons I had only like 30 to 40 characters for so long, I was trying not get parents and siblings to get down with one another. But with the way this game presents them you'd think humans were mice or something. Anyway, that was just a niggling aspect that bothered me, the more substantive issue is the gameplay.

I you need a Fallout fix then play New Vegas again. If you haven't played New Vegas before then my question is: What in the Hell are you doing looking at BETHESDA to make a good Fallout game?! Go play New Vegas instead! (I'd recommend Wastland 2 but I haven't played it yet, though it's in the same vein as Fallout so I guess it'd be worth a look)."
13791,human trafficking simulator
13792,"Oof. Game doesn't save automatically like the phone app does and it's bugged out on me twice. I had a mental itch to play this game for a 3rd time but it was a mistake to reinstall this. I'm so tired of pay2win games, they're not even games. They're slot machines that don't give you any money back.

The irony of pay2win games is that they prove capitalism is trash. How much a dollar cost?"
13793,"I love this game. My only issue is a non-intuitive mousing issue. The mouse picks up the sprite by the head, but the cursor click is at the sprite's feet, which makes point-and-click a very odd adjustment. Otherwise, game play is great."
13794,Like Fallout but it takes a lot longer and it's not very fun
13795,It's what you'd expect of a click and wait time waster game. Often feels unintuitive.
13796,I  love this game 10/10 !
13797,"This game has well documented issues with crashes causing corrupt saves, and thus deleting anything you may have paid for in game.
Bethesda's customer support page only loops around to a few premade responses that do nothing to address the issue, and then refer you to Steam if you ask about a refund. The only way to submit any details about the problem is through a bug report that then tells you after you submit it and what ever files or screen caps that no one will respond to you about the issue it is purely for the developer's information.  Steam will then give you a response that everything went through fine on their end and to contact Bethesda. Luckily Steam will provide you with Fallout Shelter's support email even if Bethesda does not want to give out that info.
I'm seriously considering looking into a class action suit, because from all appearances Bethesda just wants to take your money and not let you keep what you pay for."
13798,Good game and enjoying but when i restarted my computer my saved  game is lost and now i have to create a new vault.
13799,"It's all fun and games until a Radscorpion pops up in a training room and wrecks everything. Then moves to the next training room, and the next one, and after that I just alt-f4'd and uninstalled. 18+ dead, not enough caps to revive, was fun for about the 33 hours i played this time around (only had 11 hours last time before I gave up on it). I'll probably be back next summer, this game is one you only play in spurts when there is nothing else engaging going on. Heck, they might even decide to roll out an update if they ever finish attempting to sue the makers of the Westworld app."
13800,"Build your perfect human colony from ground under, just so you could tear it up again! 
Awesome!
Never even played any Fallout games before this one.
7/10
"
13801,Super fun and addicting!
13802,"Dozens of Crashes (unlike AAA games on this little dev platform), unfullfilled expectations, no fun most of the time, terrible game design choices, even beating tough enemies quickly feels like pointless torture. 
The larger it gets, the more terrible the drag and drop gets.
Continues to disappoint in every single regard. Remember it costs something : Time and joy."
13803,Gutes Gelegenheitspiel!
13804,"it sucks delete it now. NOW

13805,best game
13806,Deathclaw attac: ejoy 5 min of stupid watching the screen where NOTHING happens. You open the game - DEATHCLAW ATTACK. You try to start a quest - DEATHCLAW ATTACK. You open your inventory - DEATHCLAW ATTACK. You are building rooms - DEATHCLAW ATTACK. You collect resources - DEATHCLAW ATTACK. You are on the quest - DEATHCLAW ATTACK. You are drinking your tea - DEATHCLAW ATTACK Deathclaw attack - DEATHCLAW ATTACK. 10 interesting gameplays of 10. Really.
13807,nice game
13808,still a better fallout game than fallout 4
13809,fun
13810,"Well its free, unless you want to get the game really moving, you need to spend money to speed things up a bit. Overall its a time demanding job of maintaining your game Vault, you have to pick where each dweller will work. Missions take time, a lot of time to get where you need to go and return back to the vault, and to make the game move faster, you need to spend real money. I did like it, but in the end, i found myself thinking that i could be doing something else, like a action game, even an turn base game was faster to play."
13811,"After putting a decent amount of hours into fallout shelter I feel like it's about time I share my opinion on the game.

To start off: I get that this game is free to play and all, but that doesn't stop it from being a shameless cash grab.

Almost everything in this game requires you to pay up a sizeable amount of money, sure you can get somewhere without paying a single penny but this game was clearly designed around the pay to win route just like most mobile games.
A lot of you might disagree with me on this but if waiting 5+ hours to complete a single quest is the sort of thing you like then be my guest.

On top of that the game is hilariously unbalanced, Bethesda's idea of ""Difficulty"" in Fallout Shelter is to just spam a fuck ton of enemies at once.

The animations in this game are really unfinished as well, you could argue something like ""oh, but that's just the artistic style of the game!"" I don't think art style can be used as an excuse for not putting things on the right  L A Y E R S.

I would say more about this game but that's basically all there is to this game,
wait, click, repeat is all Fallout Shelter is when you look at it overall. Pay, click, repeat if you actually decide to spend money on this game for some reason.

Overall:
I can't recommend this game to anybody, I've seen worse but this game is still mobile gaming trash."
13812,I've actually played this nearly as much as Fallout 4. Highly addictive
13813,Waiting simulator (unless you pay lots of irl money)
13814,"At first this game was very fun and I enjoy it a lot. However I was playing it and my computer crash. When I return back my vault was deleted from the game and I lost all of my progress. It is so heart broken that I spent all of that time for nothing. For people who are just starting, make a back up save just incase this BS happens."
13815,"A fairly addictive slow building game, ported from mobile. While a lot of reviews mention a ton of bugs, I actually haven't found ANY. Overall (after 5 hours of playing), it's a solid 7/10."
13816,":))
"
13817,"I played it on mobile for a bit and gave up and did the same on PC. Neat little game, but I'm not the type of person to be patient (hint, hint).

[b]3/10 Would mess up room priority again.[/b]"
13818,Fun casual game to pick up from time to time.
13819,"You have to wait (and wait, and wait...) in realtime for anything to happen. Compare this to an *actually good* FTP game like Path of Exile."
13820,"This free to play game is good. Its also know as the most played fallout game. There is hardly any story, however theres quests you can do. The close the game comes to a story is the horsemen of the post-apocalypse. That quset reward you a lot, a legandary dweller, and 4 legandary armor (But you can only pick one, and the power armor one is War's power armor). The controls are easy too (You click were you want to go). I think this game is so addicting. Its a great game to start the fallout games. 8/10."
13821,"You know for a free game there is really nothing to hate other than some of the bugs a Bethesda game would have, and the exploits to be found within that could be fixed easily but are still there due to devs being lazy, Bethesda has a history of having funny bugs and some game breaking but suprisingly nothing is game breaking. which is strange due to it being free, I walked in ready for supercell style content on my phone but found it delightful because even with some events that take nuka cola quantam to complete faster, there is barely any of these events considering it started without any. It is a good free game but maybe if it was priced it wouldn't be as good due to lunchboxes kennel boxes and MR handy boxes. SO MANY BOXES."
13822,"It's funny.

Pros
- Nice graphics
- Cool features
- Very time expelling
- Known characters appear
- Detailled animations

Cons
- None for now

13838,A clicking and dragging game in which neither clicking nor dragging works well.

13840,"Some grinding, some fun dialogs. Time sink ocasionally. Nice"
13841,This is a fun and relaxing game. I played a ton on my tablet and it has been nice to have the ability to play on PC as well.
13842,"This game is free. This is the basis of my review. I am a huge fan of the Fallout series, this is apparent if you've read any of my other reviews. New Vegas and 3 are by far my favorite, with Fallout 4 not too far behind. Fallout Shelter does not come near any of these, but at the same time, it's not supposed to. New Vegas, 3 and 4 were all huge, full-price, open-world releases, while Fallout Shelter is a free to play vault overseer simulator originally designed as a mobile app. That being said, it does a fair enough job making the player feel like they're back in that same Fallout universe they love. It's got it's serious moments, like Raider attacks or Vault disasters, but retains that old goofy Fallout feel. As far as small, free games go, this game is probably worth it."
13843,"Great Game To Play, Played It On The IPad And There wasn't enough space to keep it and i lost my good stuff, But
Now I can Play it on Steam and I Just Adore Playing it, Despite the lack of time put into it it is Still Fun To Play!
Recommend You Try It Out!"
13844,"Basically you'll need to pay for one of the ""lunchboxes"" eventually or your vault will always fail"
13845,"Love it but stupid game mechanics mean i raeley ever have power.
"
13846,"What an addictive little game.... you can wait hours until something interessant happens, but you still have to play every day... Even several times in a day!
I recommand it!"
13847,I blew up my vault
13848,best game evah
13849,"What a fantastic surprise this game is!
As a Fallout fangirl I should have found out about this game sooner.
It's a very good management game, with lots of options, achievements and very good gameplay. It was really easy to learn my way around and start playing for hours. And the most important, you don't have to pay nothing to fully play it and have fun with it."
13850,"Exceptional game. The only problem i'm having is that i've sent my dwellers on a ""Diplomatic Mission"" quest and when i press the button to commence the quest it throws me back to my Vault and I don't know how to fix it.

13852,"Mobile phone timewaste game. Annoying points: 1- the Vault Dwellers needlessly run around instead of shooting or when you are trying to click on them. 2- I have no idea how to obtain the last achievement of finding 20 legendary dwellers, it seems impossible. 3- Bottle and Cappy's endless music. Otherwise enjoyable"
13853,"Wanna waste time???

Play this game."
13854,10/10 lit
13855,"There is no need for microtransactions.



When the cashgrabs rise, most users will obey and buy shit



Thankfully, those computer nerds have manufactured the most decent program to allow infinite shit like health and lunchboxes to protect our wallets and bank accounts (Which is still equally bad considering you'll basically be on a gamble eternally but hey, gotta get those weapons and finish those quests) 


Blah blah blah, more edited shit here, it's easy to screw with the files surprisingly so go on and browse dem local files and edit stuff or just go searching through teh web and download an editor. (For me, an app called infinity seems pretty convenient.)"
13856,"I had 2 shelters. One with over 40 population (standard mode) and second with 50 on hard, where things went very buggy wise bad.

If you got money to waste, go on, this game may be for you, with micro transitions. Or if you love to get frustrated. Or you got lots of time to waste. To the third (there is trick solution).

Otherwise, I rather put warning that game has many bugs, which quickly add up together and will make you frustrated, considering you spent quite some time on it. One attack you are fine. Then soon after fire, Oh struggle but manageable, with effort. Just run out of medic packs in time. And then third after, which kills many of yours colony. And this is specially irritating, when trying relocate your dwellers and unable to drag them, for no particular reason. Being mostly killed by infestation, invasion or fire.

Had no problem with disappearing saves. But game is auto saved. And every time you loose your dweller too. If you try reload game, just before dweller died, you will load ding dweller, resulting starting game in same moment. So is obvious, game try push you to spend on micro transactions. But with so many bugs, I do not recommend.

But 2 ways you can speed up things. Change back and forward your operation system clock. I.e. hour, or 10 min. Works charms. You can speed up character movements (useful in wastelands) using cheat ending, Specially you don't want to waste time on moving between rooms and lifts. Fights are long enough. And even using above, which don't affect other aspects of game, true dark nature of game becomes apparent.

13857,free & relaxing

13859,"Love this game, gets me hooked, just one thing I'd like is to be able to customize facial hair on males in the barber shop :c
Over all a good game"
13860,Nice game!
13861,"I'm giving this a positive, but not by much. It's a VERY lazy mobile port. So many improvements could have been made that were not even attempted. You move dwellers with the left mouse, and you also move around your vault with left mouse, meaning accidentally dragging and dropping a dweller in a crowded vault when all you're trying to do is scroll around is a guaranteed frustration. Would have been so simple to use the right mouse to move around instead. Selecting a dweller when they're leaping around a room is also tricky, since half the time it'll select the room (and zoom in on it). It auto-zooms to events, and locks there for a second, so if you're wanting to prepare for that event (yeah I KNOW deathclaws are coming, can I prep the first room please?) 

In-game documentation is adequate but not more.

On the plus side, it's free and the paid aspects are easier to live without than in normal F2P games. The premium currency Nuka Cola Quantum can be earned fairly easily in-game (especially if you rescue Bottle & Cappy)."

  Free Game
  Nice graphics and sounds
  Available on phone too
  
Cons:
  No actual control in quests, just rng
  Gameplay is superslow, its like a daily login facebook do your routine 10 mins and you are done.

Overall its free and enjoyable but only for a short time"
13865,"This is a great sim game and awesome addition to the fallout franchise.

13866,Very Addicting!
13867,"Excellent game, maybe a little too much addictive XD"
13868,Very nice clicker <3
13869,"Fallout Shelter is at its best early on when your fledgling vault is barely able to scrape by, and every raider attack has the potential to topple your fragile society. Once your vault is firmly established, all fear of losing, and thus the fun, fades away. Combine this with a lack of compelling longterm goals, and you have an experience that‚Äôs fun for a few days, but lacks long-term appeal."
13870,It's good.
13871,"Doesn't rely on the 'pay for energy' mechanism that so many of these free to play games have. You don't /have/ to buy the real-money Nuka Cola bottles that speed up gameplay (you don't lose out by not having them) and you're awarded them frequently on quests. It's a good game to pick up and put down again when you want to, particularly if you enjoy idling games whilst listening to a podcast in the background."

Quests, decent progressive rewards, exploring of course....it's one of my favorite time passers."

13883,"You can make babies, you can send vault dwellers to their death, you can shoot invaders and you can have puppies. What's not to like?"
13884,"I'd easily recommend this game to anyone who likes management games or Fallout. im so far enjoying it, but by far, my biggest gripe is how the game acts when you leave. you could leave the game with full Power, Food, and Water and come back the next day with NOTHING.
otherwise, its a fun FTP."
13885,i have 600 hours on phone i saved file to pc and managed to transfer my save to pc  im glad we can edit saves in as mine is very complete
13886,"I have started this game THREE TIMES, and each time I get around 90 dwellers to max stats and levels. I'm cranking out the best weapons, then my vault gets mysteriously deleted!!!  No recovery possible.

Forget it.  I will never start another one."

13888,"I've been playing this since its first come out in mobile. Been through lots of bugs, losing save data, etc. 
I hope this PC version is more stable. and it will be better if we can import the save data from mobile version. 
or at least give more feature. if its the same like mobile version then the old time players like me can get bored easily"
13889,"this game is good and FREE. lol
i enjoy it while download my new game, read some novels/comics and pet my cat."
13890,Really fun and highly addictive. 8/10
13891,Good game to keep you going!
13892,What you expect from free game? Just take it
13893,"loved this game but there's nothing more to do now with 200/200 dwellers and all quests done. Are they even going to invest time into DLC for this free game? I wouldn't think so, but, if so, that would make me happy!"
13894,"its a great game, its very addicting and absorbing. and its a steal for the low low price of 0 dollars. you can afford that can't you?"

13900,"its a very good addicting game. managing your dwellers and thinking of the layout for your vault is where half of the fun is and the exploration is also good. handling deathclaws is easy if you have a good layout for your vault. this is my 2nd time installing the game because its just that good. i uninstalled it the first time because it was dangerously eating the little social life i once had. For people thinking about getting the game, try it the first 30 mins and if its boring from then on then you probably wont like it because thats all the game has to offer. its a pretty nice game for people who already played the fallout series"
13901,"Game crashed my computer during Wasteland quest, reopened it to find that my vault had been erased. I'm probably in the minority in this, but play it if you're not afraid to suddenly lose everything."
13902,Fun game but has fundamental problem with corrupted save files.
13903,"this game will keep makeing bad shit happen all the time as soon as you try to get off so so you can watch your shelter fall apart and keep you on so you can maybe buy into thier mirco transactions
four dwellers with weapons CANT take on one rad scorpion REALLY
even though my eletric was almost fill one lousy attack with that one scorpion it almost killed all my power
they loose to much health with one mole rat 
when im being attacked by whatever and i try to move the dwelleres to that location they either refuse go somewhere else or go to the location and stay there after the incident has happen.
when ever i find the mysterious stranger it wont let me click on him or the game makes me click something else so i cant click on him till its to late. how convenient
was fun at first not anymore
would recommend if you love games with micro transactions to help you move fast throught the game"

13909,Great game
13910,I have a pretty major graphical glitch that wont go away. It happened within 20 minutes of making a vault and it ruined the game for me. It's a fun time waster though if you dont get game breaking visual glitches. I barely recommend it
13911,So very addictive. I dont like the fact that if you log out the next day all your stats and people are really low and you spend ages trying to get everything back up to a decent level. Love doing the quests
13912,"It's A Pretty Well Made Game And Very Fun, But Whenever I Send Out A Dweller For Around 12 Hours They Die And The Game Wants Me To Pay 900 Caps To Get Them Back."
13913,"Fallout shelter is a fun game that takes an intersting spin at the classic Fallout formula.It has nice graphics and a lot of content,the controls are sometimes clungy but this game wasnt first ment for PC so its ok.This is an overall great game for fallout fans and a game that could introduce newcomers to the series"

13927,"Pretty great for a free game, but it does get boring after a few hours. I feel it has a lot of potential that isn't being explored. Maybe a multiplayer element would make the game fun for longer."
13928,A really enjoyble game you should make a sandbox mode :)
13929,It's fun and i enjoy it a lot
13930,"This game should really be renamed Lootbox Shelter, because that's what it is, a lootbox ""game"". 
""Game"" is basically an online casino, when you buy the in game items they're only for that particular playthrough when you lose they're gone, so it's gambling but without not even winning anything. 

It's amazing this consumer hostile game is so popular to have a Very Positive rating on Steam, I thought people on Steam had a lick more sense than Console Peasants, apparently not so. Hopefully new laws come out against these type of online casinos that lure people to buy these lootboxes. 

Further more it's a laggy and generally poorly programmed, guess they didn't manage to port it very well, but then again it's BugiestEA that released this cash grab."

13939,"I have this on steam, my phone and on my win 10 all-in-one pc and i love this game to death. On a side note, westworld is not a copy of fallout shelter, it may have some features that are similar, but come on, what game doesn't borrow something from another game? These video game wars are stupid. Fallout shelter is a way better game than westweorld. I played westworld and didnt like it, not because it had a single similarity to fallout shelter, but because it was boring after 30 minutes. Fallout shelter is a game you don't need to play and check up on all day long, westworld is. I can go 5 days without playing fallout shelter and still remember what i was doing, complete a quest or 2 and go back to my normal day. STOP THE VIDEO GAME WARS!!!"
13940,"Super fun game at first, but when you save and exit, then  leave the game awhile, come back....everything has bee going, no way to control that.  Also, fun at first, but then rats suddenly get super powerful and kill everyone, not cool."
13941,"It is with true sadness that I say goodbye to Fallout Shelter.
One simple power outage rendered my vault's save file corrupted. 

Backup your saves. They are located:

13942,yuh
13943,"This game is a slow-paced game that takes patience and daily checks (Unless you have a special upgrade) I find it quite enjoyable. With the real-time aspect to it, it adds on to your patience but it also gives you time to play other games then come back :) A few tweaks could be made to the game to help improve it, for an example, the fire extinguisher going through some character's legs/thighs, but it's overall pleasant and nice on the eyes."
13944,Fun and easy. Can play for free but spend 10-20 bucks and give yourself a leg up.

However, i must advice you to not install this game, as my vault which i had been building for such a long time simply ceased to exist when my computer crashed, you should not suffer such loss, so dont install this game, its very good, but has some huge problems, that one which i have described is the biggest for sure, but there are many more.
its a good game but since it decided to crash and corrupt my data (i suppose) i will have to give this game a thumbs down
specially because this isnt the first time my vault was lost like this.

go play Act raiser instead"

13950,i wish thay wud add sandbox is thar allready sandbox plz tell me
13951,"The game is pretty grind-y, meaning it takes FOREVER to actually get anywhere. Some mechanics seem to be designed solely to get players to buy premium currency. Otherwise very visually appealing game, and quite enjoyable to play. Especially the customization and unlockable clothing options set this game apart."
13952,What else is there to say about this game other than it's super addictive and fun. Highly recommend it.
13953,idk its ok i guess?
13954,"While the game gets exciting at first, it is also very confusing when you start. This game looks like a World War II simulation game. I think they could've done better with the storyline, and I feel like they could've made the storyline completely seperat from the instructions. I feel I got more of the storyline from the instuctions than the actual thing. I guess I enjoyed it alittle but ater awhile it just becomes you doing the same thing over and over again... its your choice if you want to download it, but I wouldnt recommend it unless you really like games sort of like Clash of Clans."
13955,"fallout shelter is a construction / survival game in which your are in charge of an underground bunker, or vault, and you must counstruct resource stations and assign people to them. this is a good game if you have a lot of time because you have to constantly check in. all in all i enjoy this game and i hope you do to."

13961,"Yay for random pain in the butt raider raids. Why even bother upgrading you vault door, right?"
13962,I like!
13963,"Aight, so usually don't review games on Steam. I review news and indies over at GameLuster.com. Exception for this game (well, ""game""; well, game, really, but we'll get into that) since I don't have an excuse to talk about it on there and I still want to organise some thoughts.

The game started out as it did when I first began playing it on my mobile phone. I knew full well then what kind of game it was and I knew it two weeks ago, too, when I picked it up again. You get your very standard sim/micromanagement game. All is well in Paradise. Yeah yeah, microtransactions and wait times. I knew all that going into it.

The game started to show promise about one week in. The questing feature was new to me; I don't recall the early phone version having it. Oh, I thought, how neat. I can actually go do que--oh, it's timers and microtransactions. How neat. The game drip feeds you just enough Nuka Cola Quantum (to skip timers) for you to almost forget it wants you to spend 100$ for 1,000 bottles (srs), so you ransom them out and try to have some semblance of fun. Weirdly, doing the quests, i.e. killing monsters in locations, is actually fun. Shallow beyond belief, but a break from monotony if anything. This alone refilled my patience during all the downtime at home base and I was willing to see where it would go.

I kept amassing dwellers at a snail's pace. I began by mating the dwellers tirelessly, but grew really really bored by the finnicky concept, so I quit. They haven't had sex in over a week now, I think. It hardly matters since most only exist to max out the SPECIALs they'll never use. You can only send 3 parties out on quests and I only bother with 2: A team and B team. Now, A team has what are probably the best weapons in the game: flamers and junk jets. One even has a set of 45f power armour I got out of a free lunchbox at random. And all of it is very very neat.

I quit today and uninstalled immediately after for one single reason. I had been slowly anticipating the 75 dweller mark to upgrade the weapon workshop to its third and final level. Then I noticed I needed 60,000 caps, not really that much at this stage of the game, but enough to keep me waiting for a day. Today I finally upgraded the sodding room and unlocked some of the legendary weapon recipes I had picked up 5 days ago. Turns out the game was rigged from the start. Legendary type weaponry is only marginally better than the best rare type weapons, but cost a lot of your legendary materials and, read carefully, 14 days to make compared to the, read again, 8 hours it would take for a rare weapon. Unless, aha, if you spend 100 Nuka Cola Quantum, of course.

Now, I haven't checked the Quantum cost for speeding up the process, but made a simple guess based on the idea that 1 Quantum is used to skip time from 1 minute to 1 hour 59 minutes. You do the maths. I just quit after I found out I had to wait

four

teen

days

to make one measley weapon that is only 2 damage points superior to the best rare type weaponry currently available in the workshop. And these weapons aren't even the best ones in game, just a regular fat man. Imagine waiting another two weeks for another minor upgrade. Unless, you know, you could always spend

one

hundred

dollars

to speed up the pointless process. Afterwards, all you do, really, is go on quests with your stupidly OP weapon that kills low level enemies in one hit, but for what? Materials? Money? Lunchboxes? Getting to end game gear is arguably the only point of the game. Skipping it to do what? Start over? Are you forking insa--

Mobile games really aren't new concepts. No one is surprised or shocked by the blatant player abuse anymore. But I did want to make one simple statement. If we do need some kind of criterium to distinguish between games and schemes it would be this: video games get easier over time as players get used to challenge, mobile games get harder over time as players get used to spending money. The only way to overcome the challenge in this ""game"" is to simply not play. In other words, the game will try to game you out of your money, and you'll have to game it right back by uninstalling. Consciously, fortunately, deliberately, I walked away without ever spending one cent on this heroin scheme.

For the game oozes superficiality. Combat is as complex as waiting for your characters to not die. There are no explosives, headshots, dice rolled critical strikes, VATS capabilities, chems, weapon switchouts, or even fleeing options. There's no tactics involved; just wait for your opponent to die because you have 25 stimpaks and they do not. The game often forgets your rooms are producing resources and just tanks your reserves if you log in every once in a while, all to keep you looking at a screen of nothing happening. It'll throw enemy raids at you at the most inopprtune moments just to pee upon your countenance, when they're all easily avoided by, again, having too many stimpaks regardless. It throws Mr. Handys and pets your way that are so inconsequential they might as well be giant ""frick you; pay us"" signs that take up 80% of the screen. Mr. Handys are slow, cannot be repaired, and don't even seem to work when you're logged out. Questing really was its one slightly redeeming quality since you get to talk to NPCs, even if it's just for show, and you get to hold onto hope for a shovel or a microscope to craft a bullcrickets weapon to beat a bullsnail challenge to win a lunchbox that'll give you 50 water, 100 caps, a baseball glove, and a dragon penile member so you can shove it up your--head. You can always go fork yourself, though, and the game takes no effort to remind you of that option.

Do not install this game."
13964,"Fun game to pass the time, as with all the really good tycoon-style games. Game mechanics actually have an effect on your vault, which is really nice. Thoroughly recommend!"
13965,Great Game!! Enjoyed the hole thing. Still play have 140 hrs loged. Love the quest lines! Great Stuff!!
13966,Very fun game but you have to wait some but besides that it is a fun.
13967,"A fun game to check throughout the day. Build a vault, populate it, and get the vault dwellers to become happy and productive. I put a lot of time into this game on the mobile version and recently started it again on steam. It's still lots of fun, and it's totally free."
13968,"The game is fun, no doubt about that. If you want to avoid long wait times, it`ll probably be more practical to play it on mobile phones as it involes lots of waiting, especially if you want to avoid the urge of spending money on microtransactions."
13969,Absolutely addicted but super fun!

13972,"Hey Vault-Tec Can You Add More Rooms? if you have +100 dwellers in the vault game is become very boring add more rooms or More Themes,Upgrades,Legendary Weapons-Dwellers,Missions And Quests and an idea: types of lunchboxes,; for example: Bully Lunchbox[%60 More Change For Item Or Dweller] Rich Lunchbox[%89 more change for Legendary Item] this Lunchboxes can come from vault missions,[And Buyable From The Shop] Please Read My Idea."
13973,"great game all around :]
"
13974,"This game is great, I love that Bethesda released it for cp. Only downside: I spent 6 hours on the game, only one save. I worked really hard, had fun, and got way farther than I ever did on mobile. Then after I save and turn off cp, turn it back on to find all my progress was gone. I don't know how to get it back. Where it once said ""Enter Vault 408,"" it now says ""New Vault."" I don't know if the game automatically backs up (probably not), but as far as I know I'm too lazy to grind back up to where I was, without completely resenting the new vault. Otherwise, I really like this game and recommend it for any who are considering getting it. I just wanted to share my experience, so that none will have to go through the inconvenience."
13975,Another pay to win mobile game that shouldn't be on Steam.
13976,Very Nice
13977,"Built a vault for like 2 weeks, gets razed to the ground by deathclaws, no way to restore the vault to the same level without getting bored. It's frustrating how I felt a sense of progression with the quests and what i expect to build next but then boom, major delay to the progression and i have to grind back to where i was to keep going with the storyline of quests."
13978,10/10 Would recommend again
13979,"Better on moble
"
13980,Fallout Shelter is an amazing idle game. I love to have it up on a second screen while working on a project. There is enough to do to make it entertaining with enough breaks that I actually get work done.
13981,Addicting game indeed.
13982,"Amazing for an Idle Fallout Game, Playable on almost anything. 10/10"
13983,"I have reviewed this game on my youtube channel, thanks for looking.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4B7Rv95XM"
13984,This bad
13985,"This game is trash.

i used to love this game and played it everyday and overall thought it was good.

that was until it deleted my vault, then i had to make a new one which was REALLY big AND i had some great loot in it.

then it got deleted once again. thanks bethesda, thanks for making such a brilliant dumpster fire."
13986,"Good on mobile, terrible on pc."
13987,good game  try it out
13988,"Ok, I got the game on steam, and to be honest, even though I started playing the game on Android, I got it on PC because why not. The game, is highly consumer friendly which is a good thing these days for a free-to-play game. Most FTP games you see now have some sort of Pay-to-win elements which don‚Äôt make good competition.  Another good thing I find is that this game runs PERFECTLY on intel graphics, another thing you don‚Äôt see common anymore with PC games. This is a really good game and you should get it!"
13989,"still better , than 76 btw"
13990,"It's quite fun, for once a change of pace for Bethesda!"
13991,"I really enjoy the look and feel of this game, it really honours the Fallout universe in its style. Much like most free to play games though, it is designed to only hold your attention for five minutes before slowing down to encourage the paid for extensions. If you're happy checking back once or twice a day though, it is great fun.

Simple game calls for simple review. Fun way to pass a little time, I use this as a break between more intense games."
13992,"This game requires a lot of time from your day, but it is fun to see how your vault grows.
It's fun at first, but gets a tad bit boring after a bit. Check your vault every day."
13993,Amazing game!
13994,Amazing But hard when rats eat all your food
13995,"I play this on switch,ps4,and pc This game is fantastic. GG"
13996,"There's some good to be had, but there's a bunch of problems that stack up.

I like the grinding in this game; grinding tends to be seen as a negative, but in Shelter, everything you do has an ultimate purpose, so nothing comes out as a waste of time (having more than enough resources is good, you can grind for better stats, etc.).  So yeah, I liked that.

What I don't like is the interface; I try to move the camera, it moves a guy to a lower floor by accident, or I would try to put a guy to take care of Radroaches, it doesn't do anything.  This is where it gets more grueling than fun, as it happens constantly.

There's also a few nitpicks; a screen where you can see whatever stuff the Dwellers are wearing would've gone a long way, it'd be nice if gaining more resources than you can hold gives you money in return (it kind of does, but at random), and while I did say the grinding is good, because of it you also can't play the game when you're ""in the mood"", you need to wait for hours for stuff to happen.

But, the one thing that made me decide this game is not worth a damn is this; there's no cooldown on the Radscorpions.  They are easily the worst enemy, as they deal huge damage, can do radiation damage, they go everywhere on the map, and they drain your electricity.  I got three of these buggers in a row, I can't ever recover from those.

Another thing that happened is that, when I sent out a dweller in the wasteland, I gave him RadAways, but he never used them, so he died once because of radiation sickness and I had to pay 1000 Caps because the game is stupid.

Only for those who have a lot of free time and can overlook these issues, but as for me, NO."
13997,great game
13998,"I've spent LOTS of time playing this, mostly on mobile - when updates with new features made it crash due to low ram, I came on PC just to play it a bit more. First by Bethesda installer, now on Steam. Recommended, calm nice fallout-themed game."
13999,boi
14000,Fallout Shelter a mobile game on PC
14001,great game but would be better if they had god mode
14002,"Fallout shelter is a great timewaster and actually fun. You get ot expand resably fast witout paying atleast for a while. But the game experience is allot about luck. If you are lucky, you get a great start and will well.

However, the game on Steam lacks Touchsupport among others, its laggy and is a perormance hog. This game exist on Andorid and iOS, but just on Windows (Steam) there is a obvious lack of optimization and support."
14003,"is ok i guess

4.7/10"
14004,"Kinda short, but good gameplay."
14005,"Lacks end game. 
It is a mobile phone style click and wait game."
14006,"This Game just keep crashing on me i don't Know why but by the way the game is awsame but i hope you guys fix that thank u
"
14007,"its prity good
"
14008,"Fallout Shelter is a neat spin-off to the Fallout series that has you play as the overseer of a new vault being developed. You acquire new dwellers overtime that have different stats that each do different things.

As the overseer it is your job to assign your dwellers to certain rooms to create resources for you. The three main resources are food, water, and power which each require different S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats to increase efficiency of production.

You also have the power to send dwellers out to explore the wasteland to find items for you but beware, because they can die while out exploring.

This game is great to kill time, but you need to check on it every so often because the game runs while you are offline."
14009,noice game
14010,"Another stereotypical ""fee to play"" game designed to be nothing more than a hook to try and make you pay for something you don't need.

A lot of the game has intended annoyances to piss you off in order to push you to buying lunchboxes for extra loot, such as random events interrupting resource management, the rng on the ""rush"" attempts causing some random events, raider invasions and the need to constantly send people out to collect items so you can keep your residents protected and increase their stats to improve the overall perfomance of resource management.

The game starts off fine, build your first few rooms, assign people to their best suited areas, get some preggos going so you can boost your population as early as possible to unlock more rooms and complete the little quests for caps and early game lunchboxes.

Once your population is in the 20s resource management becomes more of a juggle game to the point you will find yourself thinking, do I risk rushing to get that early collection of resources or do I not incase it causes a fire/infestation stopping any resource collection in that room and also rolling back the timer then adding extra time to it as well as -10% on the next rush attempt. I normally opted to not rush because I either have really bad luck or the % shown is not the actual chance it will succeed (potentially another attempt to frustrate you into buying lunchboxes). 

Quests when they are available are also weirdly done, you find yourself chasing level and item requirements quite a lot, and even then when you meet them there is no gaurentee that you will be able to do it. I had one that was a level 5 quest with 2+ weapon requirements only for my entire team to get 2hit by a boss with a knife, tried again with more stimpacks, same result.

All this is passable until you start getting big, the larger my vault got the more the performance issues started to happen. there was at least one crash every day. Now I'm at the point where I get in my vault, do one thing then it crashes. What caused this? adding an elevator. Well time to uninstall.

Don't expect much of this game it's one of the worst perfoming game of the ""fee to play"" stuff on here I've ever played, and I've played a lot of shit."
14011,"Undoubtedly one of the best free-to-play on Steam. Serious time killer, but enjoyable if you play on a sporadic schedule."
14012,"Played for a bit, its ok"
14013,damn so cool
14014,is fun until I build the overseer's office and the game gets stuck zoomed in on the tutorial icon about sending your people out on quest and becomes completely unplayable. Menu's will not popup nothing just able to move around the screen and that's it.
14015,"Very enjoyable simulation game with enough progession and characterisation features to keep it entertaining, instead of becoming monotonous within the first few hours."
14016,"Absolutely abysmal excuse for a port. Crazy low resolution, no graphics options. They didn't even try. This is coming from somone who likes the game aswell, but I just can't recommend on pc unless you like playing fuzzy games. 

Get on mobile."
14017,"I HATE AND LOVE THIS GAME. FREAKING ADDICTIVE. HERE, TAKE ALL MY TIME AWAY, I DON'T NEED IT!

I AM GOING TO UNINSTALL THIS GAME NOW BUT I JUST WANNA SAY IT IS A GOOD GAME IF YOU HAVE TIME TO KILL. OTHERWISE, DONT, DONT EVEN TRY TO PLAY IT!
"
14018,this was a wast of time and storage
14019,"addicting game, super fun"
14020,buy me new vegas
14021,"10/10 - Once you get a part of the Vault called ""The Overseer's Office"" the games gets a whooooolleee lot more interesting! ! ! You get to go on quests to kill certain bosses, explore vaults, and find new characters! The game just keeps on gettin better."
14022,gud :100:/:100:
14023,"Its a dumb mobile game, you probably know what your getting into.

You run it in the background while you do other stuff or check in on it a few times a day to collect things.

Its alright."
14024,i named my character god and sent him to the wasteland. forgot about game for two days. bring him back and now i am invincible
14025,i recomend thi game because its a good graphical game in 2D!!!! it run on most pc's with 0% problem
14026,this game is not that bad
14027,A game thats only fun for about a week
14028,Yes v good 10/10 would play again.
14029,LOST VAULT AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN... FIX THIS PLS
14030,nice
14031,"DO NOT PLAY THIS. It is a game that is INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED to be addictive. Now I'm a guy with pretty strong impulse control, and yet even I found myself playing the game for an hour when I said I would only play for 10 minutes. Do not play this game! Do not support game developers who intentionally design products with addictive designs."
14032,fun at first but to get anywheres you have to play and then radscropions just keep showing up and is extremely maddening
14033,Fun game but it does it a little overwhelming when you start expanding.
14034,"This could have been a good game if they had made it a regular game that you buy and 100% own.  However, the free-to-play freemium model of pay-to-win really destroys this game by making it insanely grindy, and making almost everything in the game that you have to wait for such as dweller upgrades, quest travel time etc. all take insanely excessive amounts of real world time - just so they can turn around and sell you loot crates and Nuka Cola Quantum to speed up the ridiculously slow time delays in the game.  For example, doing a quest may require real world travel time of anywhere from 30 minutes to 12 hours of wall clock time or more, with your characters not actually doing anything during that time except being unavailable.

This game is merely the 2015 version of an in-home quarter guzzling grinder arcade game, with a cool game idea implemented in a way to just maximize profitability while destroying the fun things that could have made it a good game.  I hope some 3rd party takes the general idea of this game and makes a better standalone alternative to it called something else which isn't just grinding and waiting over and over then getting destroyed and starting over.  I'd much rather have an indie game like that either completely for free, or even for a reasonable flat price rather than this freemium stuff that destroys the gameplay."
14035,super easy game basically oxygen not included for special people cough jake
14036,This game is fun and if you like fallout games this is great.
14037,"this game is very much like the phone one

but the phone one sucks so this sucks"
14038,"This game is a port from mobile platform. As such it's inherently designed to funnel players toward in-app purchases (microtransactions, lootboxes). In game this means you will spend around half the playing time waiting for timers to cool down so you can advance (actually play the game).

The game mechanics are too simple and shallow to give the player any sense of satisfaction when completing tasks. The gameplay mostly consists of clicking on flashing squares every 3 minutes and waiting for your in game currency to slowly tick up to the amount you need to upgrade the next room of the vault. 

Personally I find this type of game design where the developers intentionally cripple the game enough to motivate players to pay repeatedly for essentially worthless services in order for the game to approach a good experience. Unfortunately instead it feels like stuttering if you manually wait for the cooldown timers, and like cutting past the queue if paying to skip the timers. A few dollars only last a minute before it's spent and you are right back to waiting again to keep playing. I personally find this businessmodel to be, quite frankly, evil. 

I detest everyone involved with this game."

Dont let your kid playing this game or they can take your walet for bethesda...."
14040,"you can stop women¬¥s pregnancy, because there is no more room in vault. 11/10 GOTY"
14041,"Wow, this really only has a few hours of fun content in it before it just becomes an annoying grind.

There's nothing hard about Fallout Shelter, it isn't a challenging or particularly fun game. The controls are clunky and occasionally unresponsive, the graphics are interesting from afar and bare bones close up. Everything about the game is compromised from being a mobile port.

However, if you like Fallout the content is interesting for a bit, until the resource management system starts to chafe. Once you start running out of caps and having to resort to the time grind of the game, it's boring. There are some interesting gameplay segments, such as the fact that on top of accepting random wasteland recruits you can breed your vault dwellers together and end up with similar looking children with random stat gains. There's enough Evil Genius mixed into the game to keep it interesting for a few hours until you get tired of dragging and dropping dwellers on top of each other to make them fuck or generate electricity or treat water."
14042,Only for people with big carrots and radishes!
14043,"Is exactly the same as the mobile edition, but is still a good game!

There is microtransation which is bad, but at least we can complete missions/acheivements to earn some."
14044,"Its a Non-Canon Fallout title, although I'm sure somebody can find scraps of canonical elements. That aside, its a pleasant time-waster/cool-off game. I wouldn't suggest paying into the micro-transactions, however I would suggest playing it between other game sessions if you need something slow paced."
14045,its a cool good alaround game
14046,"In itself a nice game, but the continuous P2P system spoils every little bit of fun. Although I bought nothing, but after initial ""profit distribution"" in the form of lunchboxes one expects naturally that it stays that way. But it only does that when you're ready to spend money on the little mini game again and again. I am not ready for this!"
14047,definitely very fun for a F2P game! the mtx aren't necessary and it's very fun if you like incremental time sinks.
14048,It's good.
14049,Fallout Shelter > Fallout 4
14050,noice
14051,"Well.  It's an ok game considering its free 
And its quite fun 
"
14052,"Fun game to just throw in a couple of minutes a day on, nothing more nothing less.

A solid 8/10, keeps you entertained for a good 20 or so minutes which you cant ask for more out of this game but it is highly recommended."
14053,"everything is fine until you have a deathclaw attack :)
"
14054,"Its not easy to master, but it sure is fun."
14055,"Free to play and provides a FULL experience. There are in-game purchases, but it's not intrusive or even remotely close to necessary to enjoy this game. FYI....  IT WILL EAT UP HOURS OF YOUR LIFE."
14056,It scams you soo friggin much
14057,"Cool for your Fallout fix.

Also lagging my web browser pretty hard."
14058,awesome.
14059,"This is an ok builder game with a few extras . I spent 20 bucks to get a jump - dont do it . If i tried to play this game on a phone - no way . game has no puase button . Game plays itself when you shut it down . I dont even know why they put a save button in this game - no way to load a saved game . takes a while to build up dwellers - dont evict anyone you will regret it . send your handys to collect caps - dont do it 6hrs later 42 caps , they do better collecting in your vault . there are no mods i can find for this game - mod it yourself if you can . leave your game and save - no piont . the game will attack when you are not playing ie; next day i came to play half of my dwellers where radiated some were dead { takes caps to revive them } at one piont ALL of my dwellers were radiated half were dead  - this happened when i wasnt playing the game . you cannot buy caps - only way to get caps through the store is to buy lunch boxes - dont do it . repair your handys you say ?  cant until they are completely dead  - makes no sense { other than buying new ones from the store} . FOR A FREE GAME IT IS FUN AND FRUSTRATING AT THE SAME TIME { since i spent 20 bucks it wasnt free really } if you like a builder with a twist then this may be your game . I am not sure wether to give this a thumbs up or a thumbs down - i am completely on the fence here . since i am still playing that must say something . Enjoy - if you can !  P.S.  THE NUKA COLA BOTTLER DOES NOT GIVE YOU NUKA COLAS"

14063,i love this game!!!!!!!!!
14064,well...
14065,Love it! I enjoyed it on my tablet but now it's on the big screen it's fantastic.
14066,he Controls Are Chopy
14067,Is this a nuked city?
14068,"I'll give you a brief summary of the first 12 hours of gameplay:

1) I starting building my own Vault and opened its doors to my first group of Vault Dwellers. 

2) I nearly starved my vault dwellers to death within the first 5 minutes of gameplay because I built too much crap.

3) The game offered me my first free lunchbox (which are usually only obtainable through microtransactions). I managed to luck out and get Jericho from Fallout 3, who happened to have amazing S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats. After I used him to fix the famine issue in my Vault, I made him impregnate every woman in my vault, hoping his special stats transfer to his children via genetics. Spoiler alert: they do.

4) Eventually, all of the regular folks from my vault died off and I had nothing but Jericho-babies staffing the vault and patrolling the Wasteland.

Fast forward to where I am currently writing this review: I have a vault full of inbred badasses that can withstand anything from Raiders to Deathclaws, and pretty much run the gambit on anything out in the Wastes. Microtransactions help, but aren't necessary to gameplay. Everything to managing your vault to doing quests is super fun even if you don't pipe money into the game."
14069,pls tell me if i uninstall ill get my account back. bassiclly i had to uninstall this becAUSE IT DELETED MY account
14070,"This is a nice simple game where you can build your own vault and train the dwellers within it to help defend it from disasters such as fires, raids, and attacks from the wasteland creatures. Arm your dwellers with guns you earn or find in the wasteland, and heal them with syringes you make in the science lab room. Rooms are easy to unlock by gaining more dwellers, which you can get more dwellers by either mating two dwellers together or building a radio room to attract more. When you're bored and want a good past time where you can manage your own vault, this is the game for you.

The only thing I dislike so far about this game is it's impossible to simply move a room after you already placed it down. You have to destroy the room and replace it back down. Also, if the room is in the middle of two other rooms, you have to destroy those rooms first before you can destroy that room. So make sure you want to place that room in a spot before you place it down."
14071,"It's just a another pay to play mobile type game these guys are trying to bring to another platform that I already can't stand, and do not support.  I just want to pay for the game and play it.  Not be nickel and dimed to death.  I do not recommend."
14072,"Really awesome game. People who don't play Fallout would understand and enjoy this, too. Just don't forget which dwellers are siblings or anything like that and then put them together to make a baby. They don't do anything, it's just... It's awkward."
14073,It pretends to be free but in reality they want you to pay.
14074,I like the phone version better but this is still great
14075,"i used to be able to play this game, but now it has started saying that i have an invalid platform. nothing has changed with my laptop, so i don't know what is wrong. please help!"
14076,I love this game.
14077,"It's been a while since I've played this, and today for some reason I remembered about this game and wanted to play again.
The constant background ambient noise is unbearable. And one of the things I really like about this game is the sounds it makes when you click on things and stuff. So turning the volume to 0 would be loosing that part for me and I don't want to do that. I'll just not play. It's a waste of time anyways. Any clicker game is."
14078,i love this game
14079,...
14080,good
14081,love it simple as that.
14082,OOOOOOOOF
14083,"Requires real world money to play more than a few hours. Once you achieve a few goals, and level a few minions, the ""battles"" begin, and become too frequent to sustain the vault without real money invested. That is unfortunate. But, it is fun, for a few hours.

I would be more willing to spend real money if I could play for more than a few hours without having to restart from the beginning. I can only recommend this game if you are willing to spend real money to achieve more than a few hours of play.

The graphics are nice, the concept is also inviting. The battles are too frequent, and make mundane grinding impossible."
14084,"mobile game ported to pc, not interesting"
14085,Time waster.  Not as tedious as on my phone.
14086,good
14087,I love this game
14088,"This game was very fun! Very hard at first, but you get used to it. You cant rush your guys to much, or rely on more people to come. YOU have to play every thing!"
14089,"this is a waste of time, don't bother. just another stupid pay to win phone app port."
14090,To Speed things up change you computer time :)
14091,"Great game to kill time!

Also, one of those games that you can go to sleep and wake up in the morning to see your progress ;)"
14092,"Surpisingly this game has aged well, though it still needs more content for replayablity and more hours of gaming but hey its free"
14093,"One of the few F2P games that can really be played without major issues, unlike the tons of others (especially mobile games). 

It has some depth to it, without being too complicated and got, maybe still get's, updated with new content."
14094,"[h1]Awesome![/h1]
This game is pretty fun.  Unlike most games, you have full control over making things 'easy' by how quickly you build and how you spend your caps.  There's always an element of RNG but overall if you play legitly (without cheats) then you'll have a wonderful time.

[h1]Fire in the Hole![/h1]
The main issue I have is the finicky control that seems a bit too sensitive.
A secondary issue is that there's no easy buttons for 'remove all outfits' or 'remove all weapons' from Vault Dwellers.  There's no way to easily tell who is armed/equipped and having to shuffle stuff around constantly for random events like raider attacks gets a bit tedious.
I wouldn't bother with trusting the leaderboards since there is no real check against cheating.  They're useless in any case.

[h1]Monetization[/h1]
Monetization is minimal and you can even turn off the Tutorial Tips if they annoy you too often.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
Play the game.  Try it out for an hour.  If you dislike it?  Uninstall and no harm no foul.  I'm still a bit peeved that there's currently an ongoing 'Free Lunchboxes' E3 event along with a 'Free Pet' event and I've gotten neither of those things :(
I don't believe people want to use save editors but if Bethesda drops the ball and doesn't provide the promised items then this may further mess up the already-shaky community."
14095,"Sometimes several accidents take place simultaneously in different rooms. If you don't have enough guns, some dwellers may get killed, which will ask more caps to revive. This can't be more ridiculous. 
Now this game becomes more absurd. roaches and moles are extremely shameless that a full room of dwellers with good weapons get killed easily! It eats up caps quickly to revive every dweller. Radscorpions also eat up the electricity in store, which is extremely absurd! 
If you rush a room when the risk of accident is around 30%, the accident often takes place at 100% and brings numerous bugs and moles! If you leave the game the storage of power, food and water will continue to decrease... 
The longer you play with this game, the more absurd you'll find it. Greedy developers just try every effort to force you to make purchases. Ridiculous and shameless. Worst game I've ever played. But since it's free-to-play, what can we say?"

14097,its cool
14098,"This game is quite hard to play, resources are always low, and I find it quite hard to make my dwellers happy and not low on hp. With other words, a challenge. I enjoy that there are quests and the art style. I will recommend this game to other people but I don't recommend this game if you want to continuesly have something to do. You have to wait a view minutes for energy, food and water. Kinda like most of the phone games today. (Yes you can play this on phone)"
14099,very fun game with the new updates that add more to do! It can be a bit of a farming game to get started but once you do you should do pretty well and its addictive which keeps me coming back

It is hard once you get to level 15-20 because you have more disasters happen, your people have cirtain abilities and can rank/level up! i'd say that it is 10+ because of the deaths. if you want to then download this and have a great time on it. i really enjoyed it!"

Only thing that is annoying about this game is the microtransactions (although very tempting) are forsure not worth your $$$$ considering if you just play through the quests you unlock most legendary weapons/outfits. What is the especially triggering part is the rarity of legendary Dwellers, so rare that it is safe to say that anyone who has that final ""Collect 20 legendary Dwellers"" achievement, definitely forked up some cash.

So if you want to open it again later say an hour or three when the quest would reach its destination you have to, at minimum, force close steam and restart it. Same result no matter if you save and click X, save and exit, or go main menu then click X."

I closed the game like always, loaded it up tonight and JUST THE ONE FILE is missing now.. thank game developers for making this a possibility. 200 pop vault 90% of the way done with hundreds of hours put into dwellers. Thanks a TON. This isn't this first time this had happened, the first time I spent money on purchases and you guys made that file vcanish with no recover options. This went from a decent game to being worthless when I know my save files arent safe from vanishing into thin air."
14136,Fun game.
14137,"This wont take care of itself wile in the back when your doing other things, this isnt that kind of game (it is still a fallout game, youll need to spend a lot of time into this game for it to run itself). To be good/have fun you need to check up on this game like every hr or 2 (at least in the start). I recommend pinning this to your task bar. or play on your phone/switch (yea bethesda did it again at e3, that is why my first born child is the big B's). 10/10 ign thats still a meme right? wow didnt think think this would be a long review."

Definitely give it a try if you haven't already."
14142,"I would recommend this as a side-game, not something that you're going to focus on entirely. Have it up on a different monitor and check back here or there while you play something else. You can tell this was meant for mobile because of the time concept, as well as how the microtransactions are presented. 

Still fun, but only as something to do while your actual game goes through loading screens or transitions."
14143,"Very cute game. 
Brings back a lot of memories of fallout, in a cute game that looks like you're playing on your phone from the computer. 
You can spend money on the game and it gives you big rewards, or just play it normal and hope that lady luck is in your favor. 
Overall I would rate it 7/10"

6.5/10"

i spent 2 hours enjoying some building simulator

this is fun actually, you can explore and kill some raiders

is it good?
Yes

Is it worth?
well, it depends, this is actually worth for me, dodging some payment

is it annoying?
no

is it small?
yes, just 200mb i think"
14147,Grreat game until it decides to delete your save game data. This is apparently not an uncommon problem and is ridiculous that it hasn't been fixed.
14148,"Very good game but...


[spoiler] Fallout 76 is all multiplayer? oh no [/spoiler]"
14149,"If you can, get this for mobile. This is a mobile game. That being said, this game takes the best parts of base building games, while removing the Play-2-Win aspect that games like Clash of Clans or Magic Kingdoms has. You can get to end game with no money spent. I have not played much of the Steam version at the time of this review, but I can 100% recommend the mobile version."
14150,"Very good game,a bit fustrating at times, but good, if your offline or just very bored i recommend this game."
14151,"I played this on my phone before I played it on Steam and it was pretty fun. Now with the addition of quests, it is even more addicting, but harder to play very often on my laptop compared to my phone. Dwellers that you send out to the Wasteland for quests may die if you do not check on them in a timely matter, which is harder to do on my computer without the Push Notifications I got on my phone, but that seems to be the only difference I have experienced between the two versions. 

All in all, it's free so I highly recommend it, especially if you like base building games."

14153,When it works it is good.
14154,"I don't know why, but I just can't stop playing this game. The vaultboy-like artstyle is just so nice and I love doing the quests, collecting stuff and making my vault even bigger."

14160,".

[b]Summary[/b]: ""Fallout Shelter"" offers a surprising variety of game-play. At its heart, it is primarily about base-building. It also has a whole lot more, and can be [almost?] addictive.

If you enjoy ""base building"" even a little, then you are very likely to enjoy ""Fallout Shelter."" If not, then it may not be your ""cup of tea."" If you have no idea whether you enjoy ""base building"" or not, then ""Fallout Shelter"" is a free opportunity to explore possibilities. ;-)

If you enjoy the Fallout games, particularly the base-building parts of ""Fallout 4,"" then you may enjoy ""Fallout Shelter."" It is an intriguing blend of simplified 3D environment with 2D ""Vault Dwellers"" (which I think of as ""Vault-lings"" because they are so very small when one zooms out to get a better look at the overall vault or quest building). It is very much ""Fallout""-verse, and will even quiz you about various trivia from ""Fallout 3"" and ""Fallout 4.""

If you enjoy casual game play, ""standard mode"" Vaults should suit you. If you enjoy being challenged, there is a ""survival mode.""

.

[b]Cons[/b]: your vault [i]will[/i] get attacked, or else have some internal catastrophe (such as fire breaking out and spreading quickly if not extinguished), with frustrating frequency and regularity. These incidents can be lethal to younger Vaultlings.

.

[b]Pros[/b], in no particular sequence: 

It can be played a few minutes each day, updating your vault, rotating Vaultlings in training, and doing a quest or three, and then save and close. After that, you can play any other game you wish to focus upon. Or else you can stay with it for longer, watching your Vaultlings grow and production levels rise, and upgrade or expand your vault.

In addition to base-building, and fighting off attackers, ""Fallout Shelter"" also has quests that you can send your Vaultlings out to do. Quests help your vault to earn resources more quickly than sending Valtlings out exploring. Quests also break up the monotony of waiting for caps (in-game version of cash) to be earned by Vaultling level-ups, or production completion, or else from trying to ""rush"" rooms (which will trigger disasters or attacks if they fail).

The ""Mysterious Stranger"" appears briefly in a random location, somewhat regularly. He will give you caps (money) if you find and click on him before he disappears. He has a musical theme, a few specific notes, which plays when he appears... and a different chord when he vanishes. You will hear the music more loudly if your camera view is near to where he is, or more softly if you are looking at a room farther from him. This can be helpful in finding him. ;-)

The Vaultlings are surprisingly varied with skin tones, hairstyles, and so forth. They can be customized, after you build a barber shop. Prior to building that barber shop / salon, you can change their attire to improve their effective ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L."" stats. There are also training rooms that can be built. Between training and attire, it is possible to exceed 10 in a few stats per Vaultling. Each Vaultling can also be individually re-named, simply by clicking on the Vaultling and then over-writing their name in the stats box that pops up.

Vaultlings can be sent out to explore the Wasteland, and find resources. They can be left out exploring when you turn off the game. They will continue exploring until they either reach maximum capacity of items they can carry, or else until they die (standard mode allows you to resurrect them, but survival mode does not). When a Vaultling reaches their max carrying capacity, they automatically begin returning to the Vault.

Vaultlings are not inherently monogamous, but they will refuse to procreate with anyone near of kin (siblings, parents, etc.). So it is helpful to make use of the renaming option to indicate who is related to whom. This prevents difficulties when one wishes to encourage the Vaultlings to increase their number. If one knows that John Thompson is the son of Jane Thompson, then one knows to find someone else to pair him with for reproductive purposes.

The game gives tips during loading screens. While many of those tips are thoroughly intuitive, such as ""use the weight room to train your Vault Dwellers in Strength,"" other tips will make you less inclined to think ""blinding flash of the obvious"" when you read them.  So you'll likely wish to at least glance at those tips as they go by.

""Fallout Shelter"" is thoroughly ""Fallout""-verse, and very consistent with the lore. It will quiz you, during quests, about trivia from both ""Fallout 3"" and ""Fallout 4."" If you don't know the answers, you can learn from trial and error. The quizzes are in some of the weekly quests, so you will have opportunities to try again until you learn the correct answers to the questions. Alternatively, you can deliberately use the incorrect answers, so the quizzers will attack your questing Vaultlings, and those Vaultlings gain experience from fighting. You get the overall reward, if you click the correct sparkling container, regardless of whether you answered the questions correctly or incorrectly.

Variety! It contains mini-games within the game.
There's the base-building core of the game, 
and the quest mini-games, 
and the trivia quizzes in some of the weekly quests,
and the Mysterious Stranger playing hide-and-seek, 
and trying to keep track of ""Bottle"" and ""Cappy"" when they visit (prioritize the quest line which rescues them, when you initially build the Overseer's office and unlock questing),
and the customization of Vaultlings
plus special seasonal quests
(and I may have missed something or another else, which is also included...)

... all for free.

Micro-transactions are available. However, over time, one can earn everything available for real-world cash simply by playing the game. So those purchases are entirely optional.

No game is ever entirely perfect. On the whole, these guys do a good job though.

Check it out! It's free, so the only cost is your time.

Happy gaming! :)"

Edit2: Playing a different game, will stream at https://twitch.tv/riael tomorrow, 10th of July 2018, around 3PM GMT+3 if I wake up at that time.

Going to write down everything that drops, edit the list in here after the deed is done.

THIS IS AWFUL. At least I get to listen to a podcast. Shoutout to Commanderroot and his wife Helen, as well as Electricallongboard for spending two hours and 12 minutes with me. (only commander did 2 hours, but electrical has been here as well)

They don't want to talk, but that's alright, I still love them.

575 boxes to go!

Update 500: Ohmygodthishurts... my head hurts... at least I have the podcast.

Gonna try edit this onto steam... I'm still live and going to be for like 2 more hours. Feel free to join me and talk to make the pain go away!

14165,Its a Fun game to pass time with. :)
14166,Nice game
14167,"Why is this so addictive?
Love Fallout, and this game is awesome."

14169,not elder scolls 1 star
14170,"There's A time Skip glitch thats abusable, still not patched since launch of game, makes boredom come quick and Unlocks come easy."
14171,"POS game relies on some prehistoric saving code that's super prone to corruption. Incredibly, they even overwrite your ""backup"" save at the same time, so if there's any error at all, you even lose that too, and there's no way to recover.

Absolutely ridiculous for a game based on building up over time. Completely unreliable, and it's been this way since launch.

Don't waste your time with this crappy cashgrab. Bethesda is on borrowed time."
14172,Overall fun and relaxing it's like controlling your own Vault where you couldn't in the main series plus the art style is perfect
14173,Awesome game! All the girls are pregnant.
14174,fun but gets dumb
14175,Android version better
14176,This game is truly addictive and is limitless for what you can do. 10/10 would send useless dwellers out into the wasteland to die again
14177,"8/10, u can pay and u can play for free, it pretty much wont change anything, bethesda made some wonderful job here"
14178,"I wish there was a mixed option.

I like the game, but I'd rather pay and play that the mobile freemium model.

But since it IS technically free, and I enjoyed it until I just got too tired of waiting, I recommend it."
14179,good visuals but extremelly boring gameplay
14180,"For a free to play, it is worth it. The game is no longer updated sadly as i would love to see vault experiments introduced.

Who would turn down something free? there is nothing to lose here"
14181,addicted to this game
14182,terriable AI.
14183,WHERE THE FUCK IS MY SAVE FILE
14184,"i love it soo much
"
14185,nah
14186,"I mostly play it from time to time when i just want to waste time.

If i'm waiting for a game to download or i'm just bored of my other games and need to play something else i usually just move to these time wasting games, now this explains my really f*cking short playtime since i mostly just play it for a bit then stop then eventually coming back.

So if you are looking for a time wasting game, then this might be for you.
If you are looking for something like Fallout 4, 3 or New Vegas then you have come to the wrong place."
14187,Really like it 9/10
14188,"CANT BUY FALLOUT . Play THIS
"
14189,"It's a pleasant game to hop on every once in a few hours to check how things are running while you've been away, though things like Radscorpions and Deathclaw attacks can get quite irritating. Regardless, still a fun game to try, plus it's free."
14190,Get's boring after less then an hour
14191,Fun time killer based off a good series
14192,"3/10
do not recommend due to a death claw bug.
i tend to only play 10-20 minutes at a time 

[olist]
[*]to boost people in vault i was using the pregnancy system to make children.
made it to 70 people and had a sustaining vault
[*]open game - automatic death claw attack - survive it check explorers and log off to go to work.
[*]get home log in - automatic death claw attack - survive it but resources low now. check on explorers and do quests. cant collect resources during quests. get done with quests and prepare to log off - death claw attack. dont have time to boost resources or collect more stimpacks after barely surviving - log off
[*] log on before bed - automatic death claw attack - all vault people are nearly dead as they just finished fighting off death claws literally 30 seconds of game play earlier - apparently they dont heal while you are logged off - all resources are completely empty - out of stim packs because i have been hit by 3 death claw attacks in ~5 minutes of gameplay actually looking at my vault and not quests, 4 of those 5 minutes spent fighting off the death claws.
[*] rage quit and uninstall game. cant play game the way i thought it was meant to be played. if i dont want to get wiped out by death claw attacks i have to sit and stare at ""nothing happening game"" while i collect resources for ~60 minutes
[/olist]"
14193,"good game 
"
14194,Best game in the series. The only complaint I have is the scaling on radroaches om the late-game and the 1 month waittime for the legendary weapons.
14195,"Who loves base building games it's perfect for you.
You can create your vault in Fallout's wasteland."
14196,This would be a better game but I agree with most it is very slow progression game and there is no time control so you literally have to wait for everything and it get really boring that is the main reason I would not recommend this game but if your patient and love the fallout series than this is the game for you since it is free but it is to slow and boring for me. 3/10
14197,"Really solid game. Free to play so worth every penny, not that I haven't spent money on it anyway!"
14198,its ok
14199,"I'm not sure what to say about this game. I love it, but it's nothing special. Again though, I do love it, so it must have some sort of charm to it, or maybe I just love wasting my time. I played 35 hours in 4 - 5 days, that says it all. I also did a few microtransactions to get characters from FO3 and FO4 just for the extra satisfaction. Out of all the time I played, my vault is still only half built and I have 80 out of 200 dwellers, it's a fun little game to pass the time and I enjoy it thoroughly for some unknown reason."
14200,very nice and addicting
14201,Fun time waster!
14202,"The Good : Love having to build own shelter? Being the Vault's Supreme Dictator - Overseer? This is your game. You also able to equip all Vault Dweller with various weapons and armors / costumes.
The Bad : You will be always under management because how fast all problem occurs. The raiders, the fire, the mole rat, etc. Luckily it only happens on the early game.
The Ugly : You have to buy the Mister Handy if you want some help in collecting electricity, food, and water. Without buying Mister Handy, all your vault will collapse because you won't be able to collect all of those things alone.
Rating : 6 / 10"
14203,Fun little game!
14204,Stupidest fucking game ive ever played
14205,It's full of micro transactions and loot boxes.
14206,"Even if this is a free to play game you really don't have to spend any money at it at all, (unless you wanna finish the game in one sitting :P). It's really good if you just wanna get what you can do day from day :) [spoiler] And when you can eventually do quest's with overseers office it get's alott more fun :D [/spoiler]"
14207,very decent game. I lost my account tho. Everything got erased.
14208,"This game is challenging and is fun to play, I enjoyed this very much."
14209,enjoyed it
14210,"A very good game but needs more work like: in the quests maybe you coud get like turrets and a turret station to defend rooms and the outside or maybe get militarized versions of robots like mister gutsys securatrons asault trons and sentry bots , maybe have skill checks for like opening a safe in a ruine or deactivating turrets (if they are implemented) also you coud have skill checks for extra items or exp or not figthing (like what you already do exept it whodnt be luck the deciding factor if you get it or not(whith no ghide)), another idea is that sometimes people (or something else whod come to your doorand ask for help raider demanding tribute or traders trading caps for (rare) items,speaking of it armor shod have a defence bonusdepending on the armor type for example power armor shod be a pain in the ass for the enemys but have draw backs like maybe it whod need enegy like fusion cores maybe we coud use the nuclear reactor in the game and upgrade it somehow to make fusion cores orget them off a vendor (if it is implemented) speaking off upgrades maybe we coud upgrade the rooms (more than upgrading efeciency) maybe in the cantina we coud get cosumable itemsthat coud gives buffsin the water treatment maybe we coud make get purifyd water that we coud give for fame (another thing that coud come with setlements or wathever)
or maybe for items or a a rare resurce for trade"
14211,"Fun and simple. I would recommend checking out the mobile version, bc it's really the same game."
14212,"Like most Free to Play games this one wastes your time to encourage you to pay for shit.

The problem is that when you pay for stuff (or mod the savegames to give you things for free) the whole balance of the game is ruined.

Great concept, ruined by F2P."
14213,vrey nice game!
14214,"A Fallout mobile game avaiable for PC? Sure why not, its free!"
14215,"Shitty repititive mechanics and a bad design. ""Chance"" encounters only happen in ways harmful to you, and stupid AI never plays out properly.

Keep this on mobile platforms with other p2w and micro transaction crap."
14216,its pretty good
14217,"I honestly do not know why I love this game so much......its very basic in essence but yet you can play it for hours.

Fallout the games are just brilliant and I have played for days and days, but this little addition is just perfect.

There is really not much else to say about it except buy it, try it, love it."
14218,Dis game is SO addicting! Go play it!
14219,"DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THE STORE.

If you buy anything from the store you will NOT receive your item and you will NOT get a refund. I bought a Mr. Handy on the store and I never received the item and Steam will not give me a refund because it said that the item was consumed, even though I never received it.

Store functionality should be removed as it does not work or the game should be removed from Steam"
14220,It is good
14221,"It's a fun game to start with, you will find yourself playing for a long time trying to get the better let's say Guns, Outfits, Pets,  etc. It's super easy to play beautifully polished and has ALOT of easter eggs mainly from the other Fallout games. So Just take your time when starting it and enjoy the classic retro Fallout to it's fullest."
14222,"hay it's free to play thats good
"
14223,"Fun game. As others stated, not ""the best port"" (I'm being kind here), but I found it very playable/enjoyable.
Some clicks per day, and let stress go away (or cheat if you want - shame on you, lol!)
Well, it's free, after all..."
14224,"This videogame goes to spoil your life time so many.
its not too fun but little fun like a junky chips.
if you want to play like lazy, this is the best choise."
14225,"So, I played four hours and now I'll tell you about the pros and cons of the game and give an evaluation on a five-point scale.

Pros:
The game is very clear, it will not take long to understand.
Graphic arts.

Minuses:
Quickly bored.
Expensive prices for in-game items. [Although this Donate is not needed for this game.]

So, that's it. Forgive that very few pros and cons. Outcome: [4|5]"
14226,"This game will complete ruin your understanding of what percentage means... the shown 30%-55% incident chance is about 95% ingame. After 7day of frustration, deleted this $h!t."
14227,gud
14228,"another review that will go down in history without anyone 'finding it helpful' 


nice game tho

EDIT: Guess I was wrong."
14229,"i like the game it easy and good to follow along to, i enjoy this game (side note if you don't like games that take a while to complete this is not for you)"
14230," Game is fun but does random scrolling, Doesn't always display infomation when I click on a person and sometimes a menu pops up at random times for no reason which is bad when dealing with an emergency. If they can fix hese bugs the game would be awesome. But with these bugs I'm certainly not going to shed my wallet of any funds for bonuses just to lose them when one of these bugs rears its ugly head."
14231,oh boy great game but not as good as despacito
14232,"To be brutally honest, this game is just like what you expect from a free mobile game. It is a game of micro managing every detail with a fallout skin on it. Well i like it bcz i cant get enough of fallout 4 even after playing it for 400+hrs on ps4. And 
yes  you can have two Preston Garvey at the same time but with no settlement rescue missions"
14233,"While I'd whish I could write a positive review, as the developers really created a small innovative potentially enjoyable game, the ""free to play""-prices just make it impossible.

The producers have obviously gone berserk, rendering the prices for the stuff you can buy about 25 (seriously:twentyfive) times too high to be anything even close to fair. Though one could argue, as often done, you don't have to buy any of the stuff, that would just ignore dynamics of psychology, which are so offensively exploited here.
High tier crafting is rendered nearly useless without buying the booster, as crafting one single high tier weapon takes between 1-2 weeks. With booster, producing 4-5 of those weapons instantly can cost about 90‚Ç¨... Seriously Bethesda Software? As there's up to 200 dwellers to get equipped?

Apart from the definitly missing ""Pause"" function and the continually being ripped away from whatever you were just doing by ""disaster"" and ""birth""- Autozoom (especially in survival mode pretty annoying) the developers should be cuddled, while the producers should be hunted out of their offices with wet towels.

A shame, really, I would so like to give it a thumbs up. But the producer just spoils the lovely ideas, the developers obviously put into it."
14234,Spent 28.5 hours straight playing.
14235,Pretty good for a free game
14236,"Its a decent simulator. They do shove things that can be bought with a premium currency in your face sometimes, but you get plenty of chances to get the premium currency and the things you buy with it for free. Enough so that you can have fun and make progress without spending money, but you can still choose too if your schedule doesn't allow for constant monitering of your vault. Give it a go, can't hurt."
14237,fun game for the chill days where you can go on youtube etc while playing this in the corner of the screen/ great time waster
14238,"Fun time passer.
Nothing special though.
Better on mobile."
14239,–ø—Ä–∏–∫–æ–ª
14240,"-You can create your own colony of survivors to maintain a vault. 
-Merge rooms and upgrade them to increase how many survivors you can keep.
-Send out survivors into the wasteland to explore. However, depending on how long you keep survivors in the wasteland, that's how long it takes for them to get back.
-Do quests and obtain items you could use for your vault. Quests require rt hours to get to the quest area.
-This game does have microtransactions where you can purchase items to help you improve your vault/survivors/etc. However, you do not need to purchase them to continue playing. 
-This is a free game. Bonus. 

-I recommend this game because it is fun and relaxing.. unless you get raided and lose all your resources. J.K. you can easily recover from raids :)

Happy Gaming everyone!
"
14241,10/10 great fun! plus its FREE! amazing :D thank you to the devs for this masterpiece of a game
14242,I love this game....  simple with progression.......
14243,...
14244,"Somehow I have played more than I thought I would.
The game is really simple you just have to built a vault and as the time goes make it bigger so more people can fit in.
There are crates for real money cause why tf there wouldnt be any.
Its not like you have to buy them to progress through the game right EA?!

This game is solid 6/10

Its still better than fallout 76."
14245,"This game is pure evil and must taken in caution. It sucks all your free time waiting to collect resources every minute or two for hours and hours, which then is spent on next enemy raid."
14246,Great game! Unlike most game with this type of mechanic like clash of clans upgrades and actions are must quicker and a lot more interactive
14247,Micromanaging a nuclear shelter full of adults that were born yesterday turns out to be kinda fun.
14248,"Good Graphics. Check
Good Gameplay. Check Again
Un-Crappy Lore. Also Check
Challenging. Check
Not To Hard. CHECK

okay....mesuring....carry the four.....YEP I LOVE IT! THE SQUARE ROOT OF THIS GAME=MEANING OF LIFE"
14249,"A poor mans fallout if you can't afford 3, New Vegas or 4."
14250,"Love this game! It's like the real Fallout game, with quests and item crafting. It never gets old!"
14251,This is one of the best fallout games i have ever played :D
14252,Fun
14253,no bad
14254,"As a Fallout franchise enthusiast, this game was instantly something I wanted to play. Sadly, I soon discovered how disappointedly shallow it is. 

Since the resources you gather are consumed even when you're not playing the game, you have 2 options: spend a lot of time doing nothing more than staring at the screen and clicking on different resources or buy some packs containing Mr. Handy to do this automatically. 

Anyway, investing some money in a game that you enjoy is not such a big deal, but, from what I understand, if you start a new game, those Mr. Handy(s) will not be transferred.  

In conclusion, this is just another freemium game, design to grind your time with meaningless tasks."
14255,"it is an ongoing games wth missions, crafting and exploration. you just need to keep dwellers satisfy and work on to the stragetic of the vault on the survival of it, especially when you start playing!"
14256,pretty good game overall. but i wish it went a little faster
14257,"Fun to play, passes the time and easy to follow. I just have it running it the background while I play other games that need more attention."
14258,"this game is very interesting and it is perfect time killer if u dont have internet in ur laptop


i have 8 hours in thin game and i enjoyed every single seond 
i fully recomend trying it :) 
hope u enjoy"
14259,Really Really great game for free! It is just a mobile port but at time of writhing this I have had 11.7 hours of gameplay so yes it is brilliant. I am a really great fan of Fallout 4 I have around 250 hours of gameplay on my account so really worth it for every Fallout fan!
14260,"Wife died and son is dead, he now fucks 5 women each week populating the shelter."
14261,yep
14262,"This is not an idle game - it's casual, sure as progress trickles in while you're away - but you're required to be pretty active to prevent dwellers dieing and complete quest objectives.

Realistically, the final achievements (collect 20 different legendary followers etc) can only be done if you spend a large amount of money on the micro-transactions.

Additionally sorting vault dwellers by stats doesn't work and and if the game, steam or your pc crashes for any reason you lose your save completely so expect to have to back-up your save regularly.

Some of the achievements lacking necessary detail, such as the Overseer achievement which should say level a dweller from childhood to 50, really detract from the experience as well.

3/10"
14263,realy good game
14264,its a screensaver
14265,OK
14266,best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!
14267,"From an 100%'er

F-*% this game. Lost everything 3 times, and had to start from scratch.

3 times I have tried to play it. To try and get all the achievements. Nope. I have spent how much time into this game. And it is all thrown away. It could happen to you.

3 goddamn times. Once on my phone, once on my tablet with sync on, once on steam (connected to both). Wow! You guys give no care for us, besides as a cash-cow. Not Like I have ever seen this updated.

These game styles are made to get us a little addicted each day, to make us come back. And hopefully spend more real money. A lot of research has gone into this.

But, not fixing bugs is a thing I know Bethesda does not do well. Just fix most of it, ""those rare bug will not effect everyone"".... unless it is a game with achievements, then one better back up their saves often.

Funny thing is: Skyrim was my first 100% game, One can do it all in one play-through. It took 3 times as long because of bugs. Immersion is lost because of that poop.

As someone with over 70 games 100%'ed, F___ this game in its A__."
14268,"Free-to-Pay

Just set a firm price and let me decide if it's worth it.  Making a free game unnecessarily grindy with open ended offers of expedience as a result of nonstop payments is an obnoxious money grab, imo.  Not my thing."
14269,"Pros :
*Free Game
*Many dwellers
*Good Concept for fallout
*Easy to play

Cons :
*Lunch box and another box is horrible for f2p player

My Score :
8/10 (THUMB UP)"
14270,"This motherfucking game deleted my save file! I had 45 mtrfkn dwellers!
"
14271,Really good game i would recommend it to anyone who played rpg version of fallout and wanted to have a vault of his own!
14272,Fun game
14273,ok
14274,Super
14275,best game
14276,"So this is the PC port of a game meant to build hype for the long anticipated Fallout 4 back in 2015. This game is really fun, addicting and rewarding to level up your dwellers and expand your vault. The gameplay was originally meant for mobile but still fun on PC. The game is one of those games where you have to use a currency to speed up process, so if you are fine with games that do that(such as Clash of Clans or any other popular mobile game), then you are welcomed to play. System requirements are not high so you can play this on a generic work computer. Highly recommend this game to anyone who likes base building, Fallout series, role-play, mobile. It's also F2P too so all the F2P gamers who like Fallout series can have this game."
14277,good
14278,aweosme game
14279,"This is an incrediable game, for real. What I mostly like is that you can personalize your dwellers and your vault, which is cool, and I like these type of games. The bad thing is that this game is a bit outdated... Unfortunatly there are no more major updates, only other bethesda game news or something like that. I highly recomend playing this for those who are fans of the Fallout series, it's a hell of a fun!"
14280,It's just something to pass the time.
14281,"I love this game.  Simple to play yet addictive.  I know a fair bit about the Fallout universe, yet even people with no experience can enjoy building and maintaining a Vault!"
14282,No bloatflies
14283,MOre vaults! Ol good and shiny vaults!
14284,good i guess
14285,incest
14286,good game for killing time. :Hthumbsup:
14287,Nice Game!
14288,Only Played a bit but from what ive played i can say this game is extremely addictive and very satisfying to play :-)
14289,"This game is so fun and addicting, I don't know why this game is for free. I'd still play it if it wasn't for free.

I changed my mind about saying that Papers, Please was the only game that deserves a 10/10 but I think this game has made me change my mind about that.

10/10"
14290,lovely
14291,"I love the bethesda come up with this game becouse is a litle more of there world in our houses like the elders scrolls series.
is a fast game without stress to be all day in and is all time working for you :)"
14292,cool game !
14293,old game but i still love to replay it
14294,Bom passatempo
14295,"It is a fun game to kill time with. I like being able to develop the shelter and the individual Dwellers, especially once you get things to the point where you can use the various training rooms to up their SPECIAL stats. It is fun kicking out the older starter Dwellers with high levels and poor stats and replacing them with stronger, better armed Dwellers to make your Vault run more efficently. It is fun doing the daily/weekly quests. The dialog choices on some of them are absolutely hilarious. I enjoy sending Dwellers out to explore and bring back stuff I can craft with, then making better weapons to go kill stuff with.

The only thing that drives me nuts is when Bottle and Cappy come to your Vault and visit. Many times I can't get the caps bonus from Cappy because you have to hit his feet marker just right and he's dancing all over the place causing you to zoom in on the room instead. Oh and also, when they both leave the Vault within a minute of one another, which causes the Vault door to have to be opened twice and usually results in a Deathclaw or Feral Ghoul attack on the Vault. They really should leave at the same time since that is how they arrive.

Overall, a good game to enjoy while relaxing :D"
14296,Berry nais.
14297,"I used to bored with this game. However.
It was much much better than before after update introduce many more contents like quest system!
As a sim/strategy game with fallout 4 tint. It's not bad, worth everyone a try!"
14298,.
14299,"Cool and good, just like everything else"
14300,"Simple, easy, and fun what else you need to know about this game, its just a good and different ""Spin-off "" (if we could call it like that) in the fallout franchise."
14301,"Spent over 5 hours on a save file, but sudnely my computer crashed and I lost it all. Cloud saves would be a lot better than local. Other than that, the gameplay is adictive and fun."
14302,"IT'S POINT AND CLICK, BASE SURVIVAL, AND FALLOUT.

Graphics: Simple, beautiful, and appealing. Not much to be said here, game looks good and can run on a toaster.

Sound: Very little music but a large amount of sounds that occur with actions that are both amusing, comical, and simplistic.

Overall: It's free and has a very cool gameplay with addition to the fallout theme you can't beat it."
14303,"Highly enjoyable until: 
1. You pass 60 dwellers in normal mode and get wrecked by Deathclaws
2. You start crafting and it takes DAYS.

A few rules of thumb for more enjoyable gameplay:
1. Unlock overseer's office ASAP for daily and (holiday) event missions
2. Don't level up dwellers working in production since it'll increase your average level and thus the strength of your enemies
3. Don't go nuts with 3-length rooms in the beginning before you have good gear
4. Endurance training is CRUCIAL since the E stat is what gives you more HP (the only stat that matters when fighting) when you level up
5. Send out dwellers into the wasteland early so you can get (hopefully) better loot sooner"
14304,its real gud
14305,I played this game for 42 h and when my computer crashed  my save file somehow was deleted its a fun game but it has some gamebraking bugs
14306,I would like to specialize on one character.
14307,"Very fun game to kill time. I would recommend downloading.
"
14308,Awesome game.Gets boring when you are super strong though...
14309,"This game would be a good pastime, if it weren‚Äôt so unforgiving for the dumbest reasons! The concept of being an overseer is cool, and it‚Äôs executed well, it‚Äôs just the one part of it I hate that keeps me from playing it. Here‚Äôs the idea. At first you think, ‚ÄúOh shit I‚Äôm an overseer!‚Äù. You quite enjoy the game from then on. You‚Äôre about a half hour in, and you wanna take a five minute break. You do that for a while, and you open up Fallout Shelter later. Your vault is low on supplies, and you haven‚Äôt produced enough. You keep rushing for supplies, and then you fail a lot, causing fires, radroach infestations, all that, until you run out of supplies, as well as half your dwellers dying, and your vault hits the fucking gutter. Remember, this is because of a FIVE MINUTE BREAK. FIVE MINUTES CAN FUCK YOU OVER.

And that‚Äôs why I mostly avoid this game all together. It‚Äôs so unforgiving that you‚Äôll quit after half an hour."
14310,Very entertaining when you have little to do
14311,"Yes I do Recommend the game in all especially for mobile since there is no Fallout 4 and etc on there but I do recommend this game its a free fun copy of fallout but more of an overseers Point of view its jsut the Problem everyoen keeps issueing that the Stats goes down to quickly and I personally agree Wait like 3-10 minutes your food bar or water bar your stats would go down very quickly and making your dwellers would be unsatisfied we would allpretty much get pissy and stuff so Personnaly to me to Bethasda Please Enhance the time for the Stats, Thank you for Reading."
14312,The perfect tool to unleash your inner autism
14313,This game is very fun and boring at the same time once you sart you have to wait then once you save up enough caps and you buy things you have to wait agian to get more caps.The real fun starts once you have thovsears offiec. Another annoying thing about this game is its so easy for your dwellers to get grumpy once that happens your valt just dies. Other than that its a good game.
14314,love this game
14315," its fun at the start but progressively gets boring but its still a decent game if your bored and want to pass time still I have this game on all of my devices and now have it on PC but if you want to get far in the game and not have to check on your vault every 5 miniutes you have to buy lunchboxes which serve as loot crates which is kind of annoying. if you just want to see more of the fallout world this is a good game for you, but if you want a game you can play for hours it might not be for you. (but hey. its free!)"

14320,I love it but it sometimes boring because i have to wait pregnat dweller to get born
14321,thast some gay shit <3
14322,Still has more depth than Fallout 3 despite being just a mobile game
14323,.
14324,"Nice relaxing, easy to learn and play, click-and-tap, fallout-themed mini-game that does not require a thick wallet to play  (unless you want to speed up the process, which is totally optional).

Nice touches for including easter eggs from the fallout series too."
14325,"Fallout Shelter is a very casual management game relying on various time (and pay walls) to extend the duration of a overly simple game. The primary game loop involves staring at your vault, occasionally clicking to collect resources and sometimes moving a dweller around.

It also seems this game is entirely clientside, which besides having huge security risks, means any data in the game is highly susceptable to being lost. Spent money on the game only to get your save corrupted? Too bad. There goes your money."
14326,This is the worse game ever made.
14327,"A great idle time burner if you enjoy idle time burners. And Fallout. The beginning of the game is a slog but once you get to being self sufficient and can make a ton of stimpaks and radaways you can send people out into the wasteland to collect more junk you never wanted! Also for those who prefer to keep games truly Free to Play, there's tons of ways to get Pet Crates, Lunchboxes, and Nuka Cola Quantum so unless you're a massive completionist or play a ton you'll probably get enough of the premium stuff from Quests, Challlenges, and Random Chance. The contorls are kinda janked for scrolling across lists since it was made for mobile devices but otherwise it's solid and has no bugs that I've noticed (except rad roaches....and rad scorps...have fun with those)."
14328,"Well i think its a good game here is why

One the graphics Are outstanding i did'nt realise fallout could have some good graphics

Secondly i loved it one the phone Really did and i played and played

Thats why i think that"
14329,i think this game is good (for all ages) and it has a really simple goal and it also has some simple art take a loot at everything in the game it's all really cute and cartoon like it's just a really cute game i mean look at the Deathclaws even they look cute in this game
14330,"DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!!!!!! If there was a font BIGGER then all caps that I could use I WOULD, I'M LIVID. I installed fallout shelter a couple weeks ago, and quickly became obsessed. I had 46+ hours played and a bunch of legendary weapons/pets/high level dwellers. My game always claimed it ""saved to the cloud"" - but today my computer crashed to due a power outage and my vault was GONE. I've been trying to troubleshoot for hours, to no avail. Apparently this is a common problem, and yet there is no fix. I 100% do NOT recommend this game, there is no way to recover your save data if you haven't actively been saving it to a backup folder. But who the heck knows they're supposed to be saving to a backup folder when there's not a warning before installing the game?! Anyways, now I have to mourn my 140+ dead dwellers while trying to find a game ""like fallout shelter, but better"" (my most recent google search). DO. NOT. INSTALL. IT WILL RIP YOUR HEART OUT"
14331,gr8 game. but does anyone know about the time exploit hehehe
14332,Good Free Game!
14333,Fuck this game and fuck Bethesda. :)
14334,"[h1][b]3.5/5[/b][/h1]
Fallout Shelter is a simple world/vault builder where you get to play as the Overseer, who's task it is, is to keep your vault and it's dwellers safe.

Will you send your dwellers into the wastes to find much needed resources for crafting armour and weapons or do you send them on quests to help or hinder your neighbours....or just go out to 'play' with the local wildlife... All tough choices in your roll as the all seeing Overseer.
                           
Overall Fallout Shelter is a fun decent port of a IOS/Android game,,,..with a few +'s and -'s. 

[h1][b]Pros[/b][/h1]
[list]
    [*]It's 100% free to play.
    [*]Simple yet addictive gameplay.
    [*]More Fallout the better (imo).....roll on Fallout 5 :D
    [*]Graphics are aesthetically pleasing (imo).
    [*]It works (mostly...see cons), most mobile phone ports are broken messes.
[/list]

[h1][b]Cons[/b][/h1]
[list]
    [*]Save files WILL disappear if the game/your pc crashes etc, back up your save files!!
    [*]Microtransactions included, but you can get everything they give ingame for free also!!
    [*]Microtransaction purchases are per save/vault only and can be lost due to losing saves....so again....run backups!!
    [*]UI ingame is quite clunky to use, can eaily tell it's a mobile game originally.
 [/list]"
14335,"As ports go, this isn't too bad. Just a few visual bugs, shitty controls and the fact it's clearly meant for a phone. Even then, it's still funner than other mobile ports such as Adventure Capitalist."
14336,Yes.
14337,Good game that can get quite addictive =D
14338,"Great game with some flaws. I believe this game is fun but it seems too much of a cash grab. I think this game would do better without the whole ""play to win"" type view. But other than that, it works decently well in lore and can greatly have its awesome moments."
14339,"Its great until late game,
thats where it feels like the ussr.

14351,"It started very interesting. I've played almost 2 whole days but it's over and over the same thing. Classic addictive game, most people would like it. But not my taste.

Also, about the groups coming for a raid. It started easy and went on like that for a loong while. I just wanted to send a few people to the quest, thinking I could cover with the rest of my people, I've sent the biggest guns. Guess what, the moment they left, a group of attackers which are a type of creatures I haven't seen even 1 in this full 2 days which crashed down everything ahah So cheap. Soooo cheap.

I could close, load, and play where I left, so this I'm not saying this because I've lost all my people etc: in a nutshell, it's a waste of time. You have fun for a while, but this is a sim game so you're supposed to continue building and developing, but you just don't feel like it. It gets boring quickly."
14352,"If you're into a bit stressful games where you have to closely analyze things and if you're good at multi-tasking, then I'd recommend this game. Personally, I don't enjoy these types of games but nontheless, it was a decently good game."

Although I recommend you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician as you seem to be incapable of carrying out even the most trivial of tasks, you greasy garbage child."
14358,"Not a bad game, little better than Fallout 4 actually.

I am not really a fan of this game. Its not bad but its not good. Its a simple time waster and honestly was more enjoyable on a phone during those times when youre waiting for something and there is literally nothing to do.

You can build, you can ""explore"", and you can get your entire vault emptied because you have no good weapons and theres like 5 deathclaws attacking your vault. Even smaller summary, i recommend for those who enjoy tycoon games with light adventure elements.


EXPANDED GAME REVIEW
The concept of the game is great, especially to someone like me who is a fan of fallout. If there was a game that almost perfectly represents being a vault overseer, this would be it. The graphics are good, being a primarily 2d game. The only thing I primarily dislike is the slow start, and at how much mercy you are at when it comes to the vault attacks. I have had some first hand experience getting some bad lunchbox loot, resulting in my vault being mostly if not entirely killed off by raiders, which really sucks considering how sluggish the start of the game feels. The adventure aspects of the game are pretty interesting since they do have ""story lines"" tied to them, but the travel times are horrible. It does make some sense in the sense that people have to travel in a vast, desolate wasteland, but its bothersome and even infuriating sending out vault dwellers with my best weapons for 5 hours just to proceed a quest or end up having my vault raided while their gone and losing dwellers I have trained. I, personally, do enjoy the game but the wait times drove me to play mostly on mobile (still free) since it was a general waste of space and time to play on my laptop. All in all, if your into tycoon games and waiting, you would enjoy this game."
14370,A decent little F2P time dump that lacks in originality but is still worth checking out if you're into the Fallout universe.
14371,Nice casual free game to pass the time. No need for in-game purchase unless you want to go for all achievements .
14372,"If you like playing a game once a day 

Then this is the game for you

I personaly enjoyed the game"

14387,"AI are really bad but other than that, goddamn it's a phenomenal game"
14388,"I originally played this on my mobile device, and I got very far. I found out it was on my computer, and I immediately jumped to download it. It's a wonderful translation from mobile to PC, and vice versa if you played PC first. The control of it is just as smooth as the mobile version, if not nicer. Overall, great experience."
14389,"1) It may be free, but the developers really want you to purchase from the store. There is no need to purchase anything if you like waiting for a very long time later on in your vault. If you actually want your store to entice purchases, remove the ways to speed up the time by changing the computers clock. It would make me hate your game more than now.

2) Some of the achievements (though not many care about them), shoehorn you into purchasing Lunch Boxes to have a CHANCE to receive a legendary character. Because achievements are part of the game, I chose to rate it.

3) Quests are the worst part of this game. They have extremely long wait times until you can actually do them, the locations are very repeatable, and the enemies seem so stacked as to prolong your time in the boring quest. 99% of speech options don't change the outcome when in dialogue with an NPC making them seem unimportant. Only upside of these is the fact that they are partly non-linear. You can make it to the end quickly or accidentally go the wrong way (but your characters will hint that anyways)

4) The balancing for radiation needs to be looked at. It's very easy to run your resources on a quest or in a vault because of radiation. Even with a full vault of maxed out characters (and level 17 endurance) and rooms, best weapons and armor, Deathclaws and Radscorpions seem extremely unfair. Deathclaws seem to rip through any health your dwellers have, while Radscorpions will rip through health and irradiate them, making you waste double the resources and waste time micromanaging the vault."
14390,It's a simple Shelter builder game with a large base or contents..... AND IT'S FREE!
14391,"I love the game, but it gets very repetitive after a while. Maybe add an ability to change your starting location and that can determine the danger and amount of dwellers you get"

14397,Fucking dumb ass game doesnt have a proper backup system. Game crashes and you lose your data. Unbeliavable.
14398,"A casual game to play in free time. Quite addictive at first, managing resources and expanding your own base. Lately, it becomes tedious when you have maxed out everything. 

The collect 20 legendary dwellers achievement is impossible to get without spending your money and purchasing lunchboxes. Only 1.7% people in the globe have achieved this achievement. Such a scam, I have opened more than 50 lunch boxes obtained from quests, never have I got one legendary dweller from any lunch box. Therefore I quit playing this game after getting all achievements except that one.

All in all, if you dont care about achievement, this is surely a fun game to play."

14402,yes
14403,"Fun, Addictive.   9/10"
14404,"LOVE THIS GAME

Very fun to whittle away time with. This game involves a fair amount of micromanaging, as you have to assign people individually, and when you get upwards of 50 or so, it gets a tad tedious. But overall, really awesome game!"
14405,"The short version? 50 million people downloaded the game on Android, before it even got to PC. So get it already. It's free.

The longer version. A serious warning up front. This game seems like a walk in the park - until it suddenly isn't. You can lose an entire vault, the fruits of months of realtime work, within minutes. So, let's avoid this, or more precisely, let's talk about how to avoid the possibility until you feel able to face the challenge.

Resources (energy, water, and food) are produced in production rooms. Rooms need energy, dwellers need water and food. The value of the production room does not give you its actual output. So, 20 dwellers do not need production rooms showing 20 food and water. Instead, every dwellers has skills (in Fallout normally called attributes, ""special""), and the skill of the dweller in a production defines its output. More skill means more production, even if the room is not upgraded. In consequence, get a feel for what your vault needs by keeping an eye on your resource storage. If it fills up, however slowly, you're peachy.

This game has clearly defined progressive danger steps. Every tenth dweller adds a new threat (most notable until the 60th). So when you work on getting the feeling for production, I suggest doing so with nine dwellers.

Now that you know how to handle resources, let's go back to the core of the game, rooms need energy. If the energy storage of your vault even once falls below the line on the storage meter, you are in the process of losing your vault. Don't say you weren't warned. The reason why energy is more important than food and water is simply that there is no food and water without energy.

Getting a feeling for resource storage is not rocket science, so the real problem are the dangers. First, on the uppermost level of your vault build your first power room. The dwellers in it need strength for production, which also gives them resilience in a fight. Until you become really good, this is your best line of defense against intruders.

However, the true danger is random fires and infestations. With one exception, both fires and infestations do NOT spread diagonally. I am aware that 50 million people ignore this and every ""best vault build"" on the net tells you otherwise, but develop your vault keeping this in mind, and you cannot lose your vault...

... until you willingly and purposefully choose to have your 50th dweller !!!

The second your vault has fifty dwellers, infestations include radscorpions. They teleport. They not only rot out every dweller they find, they drain your energy storage even while in an empty room. So as long as you are not an expert in the game's mechanics and as long as you do not have the proper equipment, one of two things will happen. The merciful version kills all but three of your 50 dwellers and you may have a chance to start from scratch. Accent on ""may"". The cruel version kills only fifteen, but leaves you with an empty energy storage.

Well then, now that you are spared the nasty surprise, let's talk about the fun factor.  FOS is a blast. Could there be more contents? Sure.  Could some things be done better? You betcha. But FOS has that elusive ingredient, which once upon a time made Sid Meier's Civilization legendary. You start the game to do nothing more than the half hour of maintenance - and then your tummy rumbles, because, hey, you didn't even sip some water in the last eight hours.

Oh, one more technical tip. Unlike what the FOS wiki states, a higher Luck skill outside the wault does not give you better items, but more caps. Perception rules item quality in loot.

At the end, a word about shop items. If you don't buy items on principle, you can stop reading here.

The starter pack and the lunch boxes contain resources. The game sometimes asks you to collect a certain amount of resources. The ones from the pack and the boxes do not count towards this goal. So, the only obvious use of purchased resources is emergency fill-up after a botched radscorpion infestation. Throwing money at this problem would most certainly help, but given the hit dweller corpses cause to happiness, don't presume it will solve the pronlem all on its own.

The early value of the pack and the boxes is twofold, skilled dwellers and the chance for a rare or better weapon. A single rare or better weapon in your energy production room guarding the vault entrance makes a huge difference early on. Skilled dwellers before having the rooms to train them yourself are sheer gravy. There is a catch with both, though. 

Part of the game's fun is to figure out, which items are worth keeping and which aren't. When you buy boxes, make sure you have the item storage space - and remember, a dweller, who loots the wasteland, may come back with 40 items. 

The catch of skilled dwellers is a little tricky. You want your highest level dweller to roam outside for loot. The starter pack gives you a brutal advantage to this end. However, when you just started, your average vault level will rise significantly with the starter pack. So don't forget to give one of the weapons coming with the pack to your guard room. Raiders are not much of a trouble throughout the game, except this early.

I hope that this short review gives you a fighting chance without the frustration of a vault wipe-out."

14407,"Fallout Shelter is one of the best free to play games out there combining the sims with survival games where you have to have food, power and water to survive. It also has some cool fallout references and can be played by everyone.

It's also very addicting, despite it being very simple, and repetitive. If you're bored and don't feel like playing anything competitive or intense, this is definitely a good game where you can just chill. I wish it had more locations where you could place your vault, and also, some of the quests are a bit exaggerated.

Expect to die a few times and restart your vault! The game has in app purchases but can be played and fully enjoyed without spending a dime on it.

You are an Overseer of your very own vault, unlike the cannon series here you allow people into your vault to strengthen it and to help make life easier as they all work together to stay alive.

The game has RPG elements with each dweller leveling up and having their own stats.
There is a lot of management and strategy involved as well, proper planning makes for a better vault, numerous quests, daily tasks and exploring that can be done to keep you busy in game for many hours.

All in all a very fun Free to Play game."

PC I'd give 6.5/10"
14436,"So much waiting, so little gameplay. Poor game UI: difficult to select dwellers, find specific items dwellers are carrying, auto remove green but not blue level items at higher levels and many more things that just grind my fun to a dead stop.

14437,Great game for fallout fans.
14438,"Although I recommend this, I can understand why some people don't like it.  It's pretty much just a mobile port.

BUT..... It was a terrific mobile game when it first came out alongside Fallout 4.  It has ""loot boxes"" but it is pretty easy to regularly earn them throughout without paying real money, and they almost always give you something very useful.  Plus the game isn't asking for money up front.

If you like management sims, give it a try."
14439,"me like it

14440,Suck my cock :)
14441,"Game really is a pile of shit. 
Touch screen controls on a tablet/pc are spotty at best. 
No real control and AI is about the worst I have seen."
14442,"I'm not an expert on this type of game, but can say that Tiny Tower (Nimblebit) circa 2014 was way less infuriating and way more engaging.

I've played both on mobile and on PC. The game is much more suited for mobile, but it was too difficult on a small screen. Attackers at the door, then a stray touch (easy to do on ""bezel-less"" and curved screen phones) would zoom way in on a random spot on the screen...zoom back out, try to grab a 3mm tall guy on the screen, but can't do that until the resources are collected...collect the resources, misclick trying to tap-hold the guy 3 more times, zoom back in, grab him, slowly drag him to the vault door at max zoom, have the screen not register your finger for a moment while dragging him, scroll back down to that room, grab him again, and finally.........stick him in the front room. 

Now check his weapon, try sorting the weapon list, but still have to go through a list of 15 weak weapons to find your one rare/legendary that you stuck on someone after a failed rush.......now you have 1 defender! Of course, the fight's halfway over now, people are dead.

Now, watch slow, mostly passive combat with quirky, seemingly redundant controls. Are we having fun yet? TERRIBLE experience, boring as hell. And now you've wasted 8 hours of travel time because you wanted to save a few medpacks for incident emergencies.

Later, once you finally get a little resource security and medpack capacity, even if you don't have a radio station, watch deathclaws rip through your entire vault while you try to stop them with hunting rifle equivalents. Rage quit. Come back a bit later, get hit with deathclaws again before you've even been able to heal up from the first attack. Live in constant fear of the next deathclaw attack--or even the next scorpion attack, now that you're out of medpacks and rushing them is too risky--the next attack could wipe out your entire vault. Extremely mismatched risk for a game that's mostly planning and hands-off waiting. The best way to avoid losing your vault is to keep the game closed as much as possible. Lol?

Next day, your phone screen turns on once in the middle of the night...wake up to a pile of bodies and no way to roll back to the last save. Give up on that vault. There's so much waiting that you'll probably have the same result after falling asleep during all the excitement.

Tried switching to PC to deal with pain of moving defenders around to incidents, but it was almost as much a PITA as on Android. Also, the tap zooming is ridiculous. I just want to turn it off completely and only have it respond to mousewheel zoom. 

--

Positives: 
- Appropriately priced base game.
- The humor is legitimately great, especially for Fallout fans.
- Cloud save doesn't work between Steam and Android, but you can manually transfer unaltered savefiles between the two platforms. 
- You can also back up these files, but it's kind of a pain.
- Possible to edit your saves if you can resist doing things that will ruin progression.
- Critical hit meter is cool.
- Epically soporific excitement. Waiting 7 minutes for your medpacks to finish, 3 hours for your baby dweller, 3 more for them to grow up, 7 hours for your special point training, 6 hours for your team to get to a diner to fight a radroach, 8 hours for your scavenger to return, and 4 days for your weapon, all intermixed with deathclaw panic.

--

Negatives:
Freemium or not, I expect a LOT more from a major studio in terms of design. The basic interface interactions have NONE of the refinement/friendliness of your average knock-off clash game, and there's a lot to be desired in terms of quality of life. Also, deathclaws are ridiculously unbalanced at early levels.

Started on Android, but loads of problems. CONSTANT CRASHING. Had to reload game twice each time after it had been fully shut down. Quests would take like 10+ seconds of loading screen, usually followed by a crash. This is on probably the most popular flagship phone running Oreo. (Coudn't get it past the savefile screen on MEmu either.)  Hey Bethesda, maybe hire some mobile devs...on day 1, my phone actually warned me the app had crashed 10 times and that it was slowing down my phone. 


--

If you could turn deathclaws off in normal mode OR if the controls didn't so often get in the way of reacting quickly (eg preset loadouts, or pausing game while using equipment/garrison interfaces) I'd be way more excited about this game. 

-- 

Edit: Oh yeah, and the rush %sages are absolute garbage.  40%=90%. This mechanic isn't clever or challenging, it's just dumb. Given their obnoxious interface, the number should 1. accurately reflect the base rate, obviously, AND 2. visibly change based on the luck modifiers present so you don't have to tediously check every dweller's setup.

Whoever designed this mechanic should see if McD's is hiring."
14443,Good game
14444,fun to play and good for passing time hightly recommend ^^
14445,"I would say it's pay to win, but it's more like pay so your vault doesn't get depressed, starved, or have no water. any way, i guess it's ok, but i did waste a bit of money on this game. Do your self a favor and buy a real fallout game, like 3 or new vagas."
14446,"This game is great whenever you are getting burnt out of grinding other bigger games.
Its free and fun, cant ask for anything else.
Base is loaded with gun wielding vault dwellers, its like Texas but underground really..

Overall I give this game an 8/10"

14448,"Fallout Shelter review
Advantages of the game:
you can play this game just to chill
it's easy, so even if you are not a pro player, you can play that game with no problem
it's rather easy once you understand the game mechanics to gather many caps, which means it's easy to develop your vault
it's addictive, which means it's good pretty much
it's a game which you can max out, which means it is possible to complete all achievements
it's free and although it has microtransactions, they are not necesary to do in order to complete or to develop, make progress in game
Disadvantages of the game:
waiting, which is a part of the game, is incredibly annoyin' (at least for me)
gathering LEGENDARIES is time-consuming and extremely arduous
random incidents can really mess up!
once you reach some lvl and capacity of your vault, random dwellers stops to occur nearby your vault, which basically means you need first to estabilish vault necesary productions to make babies! That's right, you will make kids in that game.
Summary.
This game is fun as long as you are not impatient as I am. Then it will start to annoy you from time to time, frequently and consequently. Anyway it's a good option for people who don't have any games to play or simply are bored with currently owned titles. The game developers are frequently adding new content with new heists, weapons, outfits and many many more! Have fun, daddyo'.

14454,"Takes a long time to get to a good position, but overall pretty fun."
14455,"
Even though there's no more MAJOR updates, it's still a pretty fun game to have in the background once you have Mr. Handy's roaming the Vault. Can definitely play your own way, whether you want to grind it hardcore or take your time."
14456,excessive micro transactions
14457,"Why the hell was this game made.

This was a complete waste of my time.

2/10

Who the fuck thought this was a good idea."
14458,"I like its references as well as the way it works in how its strategy and resources are played out. Very original explaination i know so let me cut to the point. If you want a good, simple strategy and resource game that can connect to another great game series on a spiritual level, and it gives you something to do in your possibly barren or overstuffed library, get this game. AND ITS FREE so trying it out won't hurt!"
14459,"Polished graphics, story nuggets and decent game mechanics are enough to overlook a klunky element or two in interface."
14460,I personally don't see a reason to play it after you've opened all rooms....it was fun at first though.
14461,"fun and addictive i recommend ths game SO MUCH FUN
its a managment kind of game as well as a tower defence. kinda. but its alot of fun"

14463,Fallout Shelter is an amazing game! The minimum specs required are totally wrong. I can play the game super smooth on a  dual core 1.6 ghz with intergrated graphics and still manage to do other tasks. It's an amazing game and I totally recommend it.
14464,"Fan of the Fallout universe? You'll love this game.

Fun, adictive gameplay, fairly lighthearted, not overly challenging, but a relaxing experience in this world.

The only knocks I have against the game:
- this is not how Vaults work in the Fallout universe...I mean, it's a great way to exploit a theme, but these are hardly how the vaults were used in the real game.
- restrictive dimensions of the shelter...out in the world, vaults are often wider than the default size you are given to build your vault, it would be nice if maybe the vault size restrictions could be varied (some wider and shallower, some narrower and deeper...it wouldn't effect gameplay or memory, but would at least vary up the look of individual vaults. This is more of a ""wish they did this"" than a fault of the game though.
- since when did molerats become the terror of the wasteland? One pack of molerats can utterly destroy or disrupt your entire vault the way they spring up, spread and cause havok...seriously, it should not take six vault dwellers weilding rocket launchers, sniper rifles, machine guns and advanced laser cannons to kill a critter I can kill in Fallout New Vegas with a single blast of a shotgun. They are one of the weakest creatures in the entire universe, and yet it takes FOREVER for dwellers to kill them. What up with that?
- I ony wish they would have included super mutants...
- Wouldn't it be great to have an eyebot pet? Who wouldn't want an Ed-E of their own? (again, just wishful thinking)

LOVE this game, but no game is perfect and every game has room to improve! Can't wait for a sequel!
"
14465,This game is deceptively addictive.  One minute you tell yourself you are logging in to grab your resources then the the next 3 hours just fly by.
14466,"I think this game isn't something like a time killer, because after something like 30 minutes everythimg becomes really slow and nothing really happens. It really pushs you to buy items to speed up time, witchs is ofcourse really not worth it. But, because the game is free to play all may be forgiven. So yes, I do recommend this game, it's still pretty fun."
14467,can you add it to Mac please???
14468,"Fallout Shelter on the PC is a lightweight strategy game that takes its time to gain momentum but generates reasonable amounts of fun. On one hand it has some issues, on the other the ""just one more click!"" syndrome is present and finally the game looks the way it should have from the beginning. Fallout Shelter needs some polishing and isn't perfectly suited for this platform but it definitely deserves your attention."
14469,"It is kind of boring at the start but as you play on it gets more intense with more enimies.

On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate this game a 6.5"

14473,nice
14474,"Great for when you have a lot of time to kill (like days or weeks), but it's not the kind of game you can just save, quit, and come back to in a few days without severe consequences for your vault dwellers."
14475,"Great game if your looking for a nice ""quick"" game to play. And best of all its free, so what are you waiting for."
14476,"Hooooly crap, if this is the standard for a ""good mobile game"" then the ecosystem is doomed."
14477,Interest game which can waste your time but it's not for regular playing. Maybe good one to play on smartphone and PC(have synchronization between a lot platforms) when you're in some trip or chilling somewhere.
14478,"The game itself want's you to constantly pump money in to it. 
I don't recommend it."
14479,"Don't play this game,it sucks"
14480,"I like this game for his simple purpose and it is very cool to be the director of a place where you can help people (i know it doesn't work like that in Fallout 4 but anyway). We can also find some personnalities who appear in the real game. It's is simple to play too. So, I recommand this game :)"
14481,"Reconsidering review. I like it a lot, but some of the game mechanics are just frustrating. Play at your own risk, its addictive"
14482,Pretty cool
14483,"The game was great until it randomly decided to uninstall itself and delete my vault. I don't care if it's free-to-play or not. I am sick of this company not fixing common issues and releasing broken games and never updating them. Bethesda has turned into EA, I'm completely done with their products.

Yea im mad bro, so tfw!"
14484,"easy for beginners, fun, addictive.

14497,Super fun and addicting to play.
14498,"Really fun, immersive, Fallout game!"
14499,"A great game to kill time. Usually play when im offline or busy with other things. Not very demanding but stays fun long enough to not get boring. If you're an achievment hunter like me you can keep yourself quite busy, though be warned you might find yourself spending some money to get the legendaries."
14500,"Awesome Fallout themed progressive stratergy/micro manage game. Its FREE, Fallout themed & can get challenging at times. 8/10."
14501,"Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play game which revolves around a few things:

- You build rooms in your vault and manage the dwellers, positioning them in the right rooms - so they are useful and happy.

- You send dwellers into the wasteland to explore and find junk, armour & weapons. If they have been outside the vault 2 hours before you recall them, they need 2 hours to get back to you.

- You send dwellers on quests, also into the wasteland. There's a wait time involved in getting to and from the quest objective. Once they arrive at the structure where the quest takes place, you direct the dwellers yourself in fighting enemies and exploring the place.

- You complete game objectives. You get 3 at a time and you can skip one per day for free. Skipping more requires you spend a Nuka Cola. They can be stuff like: Complete 3 quests. Gather 175 electricity in a minute. Survive 30 deathclaw attacks. etc. 

------

A lot of the stuff that happens in the game requires you to wait. Skipping the wait time requires you to spend Nuka Colas which are acquired in small quantities in-game, but which can also be bought using micro-transactions. (if you feel pressured to either buy Nuka Colas or Starter Packs, know that there is such a thing as a Fallout Shelter Save Game Editor where you can edit your save to give yourself those items (available here: https://rakion99.github.io/shelter-editor/ ). 

Fortunately, wait times are mostly reasonable, especially involving vault rooms. Resources (water, electricity, food) are produced quite fast. Rooms are built instantly. The longest wait times are the more advanced rooms where you build guns, armour, room themes and when you send dwellers on quests. 

In my experience, the gameplay progresses fairly smoothly and new rooms do not take very long to unlock. Most achievements are naturally acquired during gameplay as well, with a few exceptions.

These exceptions are probably the one place where you might seriously feel pressured into spending money. The problematic ones are:

-  Legend of the Wastes: Complete 100 quests - includes a lot of wait time TO and FROM quest location.

-  Interior Designer: Craft 1 of every room theme - can also take a long time and luck, though I achieved this fairly naturally without spending. 

-  Fashion Statement: Collect 20 legendary items - luck is involved, but if you enjoy the game you‚Äôll eventually get enough of them.

-  Armed and Dangerous: Collect 20 Legendary weapons - same as above.

-  Blast From the Past: Collect 20 Legendary dwellers - biggest problem. They appear rarely from Lunchboxes and VERY rarely in-game. Your best bet are starter pack which have 100% chance to include one each. This one is the biggest hurdle of them all. 

-----

For me the problems were: Legend of the Wastes and Blast from the Past. Since I enjoyed the game, I completed most of the other achievements naturally. However, if nothing else, Blast from the Past will certainly be a problem for anyone that cares about the achievement. 

If you find yourself no-longer enjoying the game, but still wishing to complete the last few achievements, I recommend using the Fallout Shelter Save Game Editor to get yourself a bunch of Starter Packs (for Legendary Dwellers) and Nuka Colas (for skipping wait times for other things).

Just two more notes regarding this: Lunchboxes are useless for Legendary Dwellers. You'd have to waste a ton of time opening hundreds of them to get even a few Legendary Dwellers. They are your standard lootboxes that usually contain trash. So, Starter Packs are the way to go.

Second: Achievements only get ticked while playing your first vault. I speak from experience, unfortunately.

------

I encountered no technical difficulties with the game."
14502,fun
14503,very good game if you are bored

14506,"I recommend it as a way to spend time between daily jobs and chores. If you are truly passionate about it, feel free to buy stuff, but if you only see it as a filler, then stay on the free course."
14507,ye it is a ok game just don't buy stuff
14508,"I really enjoy playing this game.  I would recommend buying the starter pack when you first start to get things going, otherwise it can take a painstakingly long time to get the resources to get things on a roll.  Once you have started a number of rooms, there is no lack of things to pursue in the game.  It has some humor to it and the graphics are good.  I am hang a great time so far!"
14509,"Nice game for casuals. Nice graphics, easy but hard to master gameplay. Lots of stuff to do, but in the lategame it turns into a grind for achievs. 10/10 would recommend (Works in the android platform too!)"
14510,Could be a great game if some of the mechanics were better such as the stupid camera being pulled in with every disaster that happens......most annoying!
14511,"Great resource managment game.  Don't need to spend ¬£ to get very far but a few pound here and there on new pets makes it more interesting! Addictive and multifaceted (different things to do e.g. quests, exploring the wasteland, building up your shelter or upgrading your  dwellers.  I now have c.150 dwellers so the game has become a bit less challenging, but the quests never end so it can be played ongoingly (and is!)"
14512,"I really want to like this game.  I absolutely loved it on my Android Tablet, but one key change is absolutely ruining it on PC...it doesn't sleep.  What I mean by that is if I am distracted  on my tablet, the tablet eventually goes to sleep and the game behaves as if I am away, but on the PC it just keeps on running until I come back to find everything basically dead nd then get to spend a couple hours having to slog back to normalcy.  Eventually, I get fed up and just delete and after a month or so, I try again only to be reminded why I walked away in the first place."
14513,"yes, i like"
14514,I'm pretty bad a** at TINY TOWERS so this game is pretty easy 5 stars
14515,"It's free, it's ok. I liked it. It COULD be better but its not, its overall an ok game. Try it, you might like it. :)"
14516,Its just a waste of time dont get this game ok?
14517,"I think Fallout Shelter is a fun time-killer and in most aspects a pretty decent game, save for a few hiccups in the port from mobile to PC. It offers a bit of a challenge to newbies and draws in the player with intriguing unlockables, a log of all of the equipment you've found from quests and in the wasteland, and a pretty nice progression system. For those reasons, I'd say the game is pretty safe to recommend.

For those of you who enjoy achievement-hunting like I do, however, I cannot recommend this game. If you're looking for a free game that seems like an easy 100% to add to your achievement profile, I'd suggest that you spend your time elsewhere. There is one achievement in particular that is locked behind a massive pay wall and will force you to fork over either hundreds of dollars or hundreds of hours to earn. Unfortunately, I figured this out after about 65-70 hours. The pay wall is a microtransaction bundle that costs $20. During in-game sales, which are infrequent, this bundle will usually drop down to $10. But even then, the achievement will still be a matter of luck, and the drop rates for what you're looking for are absurdly low."
14518,"29% FAILED , 36% FAILED , 45% FAILED , 72 SUCCESS fcking kys who ever likes this game

"
14519,"Fun to play, addicting as hell and a very nice game :)"
14520,Yeah it's a pretty fun game if you don't have anything to do or play like me. So i really recommend the game :D

14522,"it is not good easy mindless fun.
But it is a lot of fun."
14523,Realy fun to play untill you run out of food or resorces.
14524,"This game definitely is not free. The initial fee is at least 3$, and there is much more you will have to pay to continue playing.
The in-game help is very scarce and clears our very little. Thus, you will have to waist your first vault to just learn the things + plus something like 10$ more dollars... just to learn. What you buy in one vault is not transferred to another.
So, I am not sure this game is worth so much effort - and some money - for what is very little content and fun."
14525,It's just like a mobile one before. You can play for free and have a good time. Micro transactions doesn't ruin your game! That is rare nowadays.
14526,"Fun for a while, but gets repetitive in the end. If you want to play different scenarios with additional self-imposed limitations it might stay fresh for a longer time.

There are some things that could be done to improve the user experience. Such as ""sell all items"" -button when collecting explorer items. Really stupid that you have to manually click all non-common level and junk items to sell them. Duplicate schematics also have to be sold one by one, even after you already have every single one of them. You can't queue crafting. Automated inventory would also be nice (ie. set a max limit for each item to keep in stock and sell rest when collecting items)... and probably other things too, which I can't remember right now...

I only played this for this long to get all the achievements, the last one is a grind (without spending money). You'll know what it is.

Still, thumbs up from me. It's Fallout, it's free, it's addictive."
14527,Great but Grindy as F.U.K.
14528,quite jolly but challenging.
14529,"Gives a whole new meaning to survive. Created a Vault 649 and tend to the dwellers, and got attacked by raiders multiple times. Managed to balance the three needs and having little dwellers running around with five women. Assigned two dwellers to explore the wasteland and gather materials for weapon crafting. Apparently roach infestations can occurs in one or more rooms. The Siamese cat actually lessens with the radiation poisoning of my dwellers until they are happy. Of course, there's that barracks where the magic happens. I started off with full resource, left it running all night, and now they are all 10% happy but surviving without electricity. 10/10 recommended."
14530,Bad game with so many problems.
14531,Amazing!
14532,simple but addictive
14533,"Great game, first time playing it was on mobile, but it is better on pc because it takes less time to load. The start is hard and it becomes easier when you get a mr handy
"
14534,Slow paced at first for a f2p but it gets easier as you progress with more dwellers and you get more actions after that. I would consider getting as it gets very addicting when you have more dwellers and you get to do more :D
14535,"Annoying, fidgetty, cute simulator game on the larger screen, and also available one phone (no cloud syncing of saves so wtf) mildly addictive then... gaw...darn... massively addictive as you race to create some beacon of a humanity and a baron wasteland of mutants and for less than a price of cola its proberly worth recommending."
14536,"[h1]Fallout Shelter review[/h1]
[olist]
[*] [b]Advantages of the game:[/b]
[list]
[*] you can play this game just to chill
[*] it's easy, so even if you are not a pro player, you can play that game with no problem
[*] it's rather easy once you understand the game mechanics to gather many caps, which means it's easy to develop your vault
[*] it's addictive, which means it's good pretty much
[*] it's a game which you can max out, which means it is possible to complete all achievements
[*] it's free and although it has microtransactions, they are not necesary to do in order to complete or to develop, make progress in game
[/list]
[*] [b]Disadvantages of the game:[/b]
[list]
[*] waiting, which is a part of the game, is incredibly annoyin' (at least for me)
[*] gathering LEGENDARIES is time-consuming and extremely arduous
[*] random incidents can really mess up!
[*] once you reach some lvl and capacity of your vault, random dwellers stops to occur nearby your vault, which basically means you need first to estabilish vault necesary productions to make babies! That's right, you will make kids in that game.
[/list]
[*] [b]Summary.[/b]
This game is fun as long as you are not impatient as I am. Then it will start to annoy you from time to time, frequently and consequently. Anyway it's a good option for people who don't have any games to play or simply are bored with currently owned titles. The game developers are frequently adding new content with new heists, weapons, outfits and many many more! Have fun, daddyo'."
14537,"Fallout Shelter is a fun diversion from regular gaming with no real end game or ending in mind. Building your vault, unlocking rooms, and sending dwellers on quests are the highlights in a game that is mostly a grinding game and I love grinding games.

Explore the wasteland for legendary gear, craft legendary gear, repeat.

Once you've unlocked and built all of the rooms, removed the inferior rooms, completed all quests, fully leveled all your dwellers from level 1 to 50 while wearing E+17 gear, and everyone has a Dragon's Maw for a weapon, you are pretty much done. I've had a lot of fun with the game and have accomplished everything I can in it without having to spend a single dollar which is great for a f2p game.

[b]The good:[/b]
[list][*]You can do everything without having to spend money
[*]The quests
[*]Crafting outfits and weapons
[*]The vault rooms [i](even though I wish there were more to choose from)[/i]
[*]Customizing your dwellers[/list]

[b]The needs improvement:[/b]
[list][*]Ability to automate a response team to vault events
[*]Ability to see a vault family tree so you know who was born from which dwellers
[*]Improvement when selecting and dragging dwellers from room to room
[*]Needs to back up saves [i](saves can become corrupted. I created a batch file I run that backs up my vault when I finish a session just in case a save file becomes corrupted)[/i]
[*]When your vault has a population over 100, it become difficult to manage them all. Having the ability to change a dwellers weapon, outfit, and pet without clicking on the dweller. A dweller management screen.[/list]

In conclusion, my vault is fully functional with 100 dwellers, 25 dwellers exploring, everyone properly leveled and trained, and everyone with Dragon's Maw weapons and Legendary outfits as well. At this point there's nothing left to accomplish other than opening enough lunchboxes to get all legendary dwellers."
14538,"Glad it's on PC, now my 142 dweller vault doesn't make my phone a nuclear bomb."
14539,"Pros: 

1. It was FREE. Whats not to love?
2. Get to expand, get more peeps, upgrade shelter, customize peeps, go on quests! So many different quests!
3. Better weapons, skins for rooms, leveling my peeps, ooo pets!
4. Always seems to have things to do. 
5. Pleasant music, stuffed with humor (if you played Fallout4 even funnier), definitely entertained.
6. IF you want too - you can purchase small packages to move things along. Not a requirement, ever, to move ahead.
7. Has special quests and other stuffs for Holidays! So awesome I love this!

Cons:

1. Really can't think of any atm. Lol"
14540,I've only been eaten by radioactive monsters like twice...  *THUMBS UP*
14541,"A fun game that helps me kill some time,can't complain about anything so far."

14543,"Self-destructive dwellers, constant attacks (after 100+ dweller count), challenging to save up caps when you need to revive your best dwellers after the 5th Deathclaw attack in 2 hours, and repetative quests. 

Would recommend to anyone. 10/10 this game is awesome and days worth of fun."

14545,i like this game and i feel the tutorial was just enough to get you able to play the game long term. not many secrets though. i do like you can get everything without paying
14546,this game is amazing nothing more
14547,"very good game
"
14548,Started out fun but about halfway through my experience I felt like I was continuing to just repeat steps over and over again. Once you've done the same things more times than you can count in a period of 30 mins you know it's time to move on. But hey it's free. Give it a try. You got nothing to lose...except time. For me time is better spent doing what I like doing. Cheers!
14549,"the game starts out fun. but once the later game encounters start it starts to feel like you can't play the game anymore. when a bunch of death claws hit your vault you don't get anything from killing them. at most you can get some xp for the six dwellers that kill the last one. there's probably strategies for building up your vault early on to maybe minimize this mid/late game balance issue.... but i'm pretty sure that balance issue is there to push you to spend money. and freemium games that have this balance are pretty miserable.

i really liked it when i felt like i could watch my vault and that the rad roach and mole rat infestations were delt with without the risk of losing a dweller. and i actually looked forward to raiders because i was getting caps and gear from them.... but now that the rad scorpions and death claws are a thing i feel like i'm risking all of my resources getting sunk into the red and having to spend all my caps reviving dwellers because i ran out of stim packs because death claws ran through the entire vault or rad scorpions ended up hitting multiple rooms....

and so the fun feels like it's being held hostage by the freemium economy of the game. and i just wish there was a version of this game that kept all it's charms that make it worth playing without the freemium economy taking away the rewards for dealing with events like death claws, ghouls, rad scorpions and even mole rats. because freemium means all the perks of playing the game are locked behind loot boxes.... lunch boxes.... hell.... if i just got caps and maybe some junk from the late game encounters they would feel more engaging and not just a punishment for playing the game.

i want to recommend this game.... but the freemium balancing poisons the game. i'd feel less shitty for recommending lead as an artifitial sweetner. yeah led will sweeten your wine but it'll make you sick in the end.

also i somehow feel like they managed to capture the fat finger frustration of moving dwellers around that existed on the phone version of this game.... moving people around is tedious and utterly unbearable when trying to do so during an incident in the vault.

the quest system is pretty cool.... but again.... after a while it feels like playing this game is going to result in a punishment of a death claw invasion of rad scorpions.... and then everybody is just always sad... and i never feel like i can deal with individual dwellers because doing anything in the game means i could get hit with death claws and lose half the dwellers because i'm out of stim packs from the last event...... and it's so frustrating fighting with the shitty controls to move the dwellers out of the way and i'm never gonna have the caps to upgrade anything because i have to keep reviving all my dwellers.... and it feels like i have all this sunk investment in this vault that's just not able to keep up with what's getting thrown at it. so it feels like a failed vault.... and that's just a misserable cycle.... and i don't have access to money to spend on this game and with this shitty end game cycle that feels like it's just a money sink isn't the sort of thing i think anybody should be spending money on......"
14550,Fun lil game.
14551,"Used to play this a lot on mobile, now I just do that on Steam. Pretty good time killer if you don't have much to do or you're bored."
14552,"Fallout Shelter is a terrble mobile port. Characters are a pain to control, dealing with threats to your vaults or more of a chore than a challenge, and like most bethesda game, there are bugs that are more annoying than funny."
14553,Nice little game to chill out to. A little slow starting at first but speeds up once you get in to it.
14554,this game is fucking lit
14555,Pretty boring game filled with microtransactions.
14556,Fun game.  Very addicting.
14557,The best Fallout game by far.
14558,"So I went into this game trying to play for free as much as possible, with the exception of buying the Starter pack. 
There is one effectively paid achievement in the Title but everything else is easily doable. My personal goal was to have 200 Dwellers with every S.P.E.C.I.A.L Stat at 10, with Legendary weapons and outfits, this is how long it took. 
If you're not willing to buy lunchboxes and speed up tasks with Nuka-Cola you will have to sit and wait, a lot, for things to happen. 
The way I got around this was just leaving it on while watching videos and playing other games, only paying the minimal amount of attention to this while my Dwellers got on with whatever busy work they were assigned, in that regard it ended up quite theraputic and become a little windowed companion in the corner of my life for quite a while. 
There are so many niggles with this game, it is definitely a mobile port that was probably never designed to be played for 350 hours, the UI needs so much work to make it user friendly, accessible and logical. However, you'll likely only be on this for a couple of hours so don't worry about it. 
So, to recommend, don't 'play' it, just have it running in the tertiary of your life for a while and let your little virtual ant farm grow.
Now, after 350 hours, I found I had achieved my goals except even with questing constantly and logging in every day as well as having 12 Dwellers exploring the Wasteland constantly I had a grand total of 7 Legendary Dwellers, found via lunchboxes. 
This is the one and only aspect of the Title that you essentially have to pay to progress, in my anecdotal experience, it might take me another thousand plus hours to farm the rest of the Dwellers, your mileage may vary, I'm not especially lucky."
14559,"Good management game, the loot box thing could be better by implimenting it into the missions but other than that, its not bad."
14560,"The game is great for what it is, in fact, I've played much more than my ""time on record"" shows, but it's not without flaws of course.
Firstly, game crashes almost every time while doing nothing special: exiting the game, upgrading rooms, finishing a quest and going back to vault, you name it;
Secondly, rush mode is completely useless, 80% of the time it fails so you might as well just avoid it;
Sometimes weak enemies (like rad roaches) take ridiculously long time to kill and that's especially annoying when you have limited amount of healing during quests.
Aside from that, game is pretty good."
14561,"Annoying radscorpion!


overall  7.9/10"
14562,"There is no Fisto to ask you to ""assume the position"" 8/11. But I'm sure sure 69/11 would assume the position again."
14563,"Not much content at all. Played for an hour, got a good vault, everyone had weapons and had a mr.handy.
Deathclaw invasion, no one did anything and all died.
This game has nothing to offer and you are better off editing your save.
Its also a cash cow, nothing to give, but you give money for lunchboxes and stuff.
My opinion though, i just wouldnt reccomend getting this game, even if it is free."
14564,"I Love You Bethesda, I really do! Anything you guys touch, Is magic!"
14565,even better than mama
14566,"Yeah i like it, it¬¥s fallout and i love it, it¬¥s enterteined and challenging. The micro transctions break my balls anyway, that¬¥s the bad of it."
14567,"quite the well-made game, the fallout shelter is about surviving and making a successful shelter. 
of course with a lot of emphasis on the rarity of items. dwellers. outfits and items etc ...

enjoyable without any stress.

the only downside -its more of a personal issue with me- the game keeps running in real time , meaning that you need to check quite often on your shelter, which a thing I can't keep doing it daily, but if you have a lot of free time unlike me that wouldn't be an issue.

recommended"
14568,spent 12 hours on this game then got my entire vault wiped out by 2 invincible roaches than they went threw every room then left. so i revived 2 dwellers but no guess what... another flipping roach attach killed all my dwellers again and i cant even revive 1 of them now. and no thats not even the best part. i desided to look up this bull and turns out its been a glitch in the game for 2 years!!! went from the 2nd best free to play game i have ever played to the worst cause the developers decided no to patch a game braking glitch for a wapping 2 years!!! are you kidding me. dont wast your time unless your only looking to get not even a quarter of the way threw the game to get destroyed. wouldnt recoment to anyone!
14569,"Hmm... didn't get far into this game myself .
Graphically uninteresting  to me ."
14570,Great game. I have been playing on my phone for a long time. I just recently moved to the steam version. Enjoyable concept. Not hard to learn. I have enjoyed playing for a long time without spending money. I only just recently spent money because I received a google play gift card for christmas. It's a mobile game. It's not meant to be played continuously. It's meant to be played for like 15 minutes and then forgotten while stuff is being made and people are going on quests. But overall it's fun.
14571,Thiz game Good!
14572,"The concept of this game is great but the microtransactions and the grind without them, ruin it. Waiting patiently for Mr. Prepper, hoping it avoids all of Fallout Shelters failures

Pros: 
Fallout Vault Management Concept is Enjoyable
Free to Play

Cons: 
Mobile port
Microtransactions
Only Partial 21:9 Support (2560 x 1080)
No AMD Crossfire Support
Mouse Bug makes the vault fly off the screen, way beyond game borders
Gameplay is a huge grind when not paying for Microtransactions [ I avoided MT‚Äôs :) ]
Mission travel time takes anywhere between 2-20+ real time hours
Crafting Weapons, Armor, or Themes will take days to complete
Room Rushes fail more than succeed
Quantum Cola is almost nonexistent unless you use in-game transactions
High Level Dwellers (35+) with Level 17+ weapons seem to be at a constant disadvantage 
Daily Deathclaw attacks within minutes of game startup
High Level Rooms are extremely expensive to build and upgrade to Level 3
Raider, Deathclaw, RadScorpion, MoleRat, or Radroach attacks constantly drain your Stimpack inventory
‚Ä¶..etc"
14573,"A bit boring

Gets annoying more than anything els this game is almost fun.

money milking game without the online or multiplayer aspect so that sucks  ... allot...!   

RIP ...    Fallout shelter"
14577,Great game i really enjoy it :D
14578,"I want this game to develop, I like this game very much and trader to exchange some item or buy item.  I would like to have more chance of the monsters invade. And I want to add a turret to optimize for Vault."
14579,"I am having an unreasonably good time with this. It's relaxing, has great art, and suffers from non of the performance issues of the Android version that I ran into prior to Fallout 4's release. I wouldn't suggest spending any real money on this, but it definitely scratches the post-apocalyptic ""Sim City-lite"" itch and then some."
14580,Funny little Game with more adiccticion risk than thought
14581,"Its a fun game premise for when you need time to pass. Pretty laid back (So I tend to forget I have it on.) Even so itd be nicer if the meters didn't tank downwards when the game was offline. Would I reccomend it sure, A good edition away from the 1st person perspective."
14582,"Game is awesome
"
14583,"Vualt magicly disapeared, pathetic. Don't play this game you will waste your time, just going to lose your saved file."
14584,"If you think you can stand the grind, this game will test how far you are willing to go.
Despite my time (i played it on my phone also), not worth it.

But it is free so what do you care?"
14585,"This is a fun game for when you want to waste time from other things that are much more important in your life. In fact I could see myself sitting infront of my computer playing this while a nuclear war was actually happening, I feel that this might be poetic somehow. In fact maybe this game itself is poetic in the sense we are all playing it in our own basement ""Vaults"". Who knows, its just fun."
14586,‚†Ä
14587,Great game you can have a full experiance of the game without payiing a peny !!!!
14588,"==INTRO==

I've played more than it looks. My hours on the bethesda.net version didn't carry over. Fallout shelter is a game where you build your own fallout vault, populate it, and send your dwellers out on missions.

==GAMEPLAY==

Disturbingly microtransaction based, but not enough to make it unplayable. You collect resources from generators and water plants and missions and expand and improve your vault. Missions mean you have to arm your dwellers with guns you can get from raids on your base and ones you crafted or scavenged. You send them out with weapons, clothes, rad-away, and stimpaks into factories, houses, stores, etc which are jam packed with enemies and loot to bring back.

==MULTIPLAYER==

None.

==LENGTH==

Basically unlimited, it's really just one big grind though.

==DLC==

Nope

==MODS==

Double nope.

==PROS AND CONS==

Pros: Free, fallout based, so fans would like it.

Cons: Microtransactions, very grindy with not much actual content.

==RECOMMENDATIONS==

Who I would recommend this game to: People who are fallout fans, who don't have much money, who need to kill time.

Who I wouldn't recommend this game to: Actual strategy fans who want an in-depth game with no grind or transactions.

==FINAL SCORE==
7.2/10: It's alright, but I wouldn't get it unless you're broke from buying Skyrim on all platforms including your pez dispenser."
14589,"I think it's a fun and cool game.

14590,"My morning doesn't start until I get my daily Deathclaw raid breakfast within 10 seconds of turning on the game. Got totalled 4 times already with this junk. 

Something is wrong with the click and drag placing of dwellers. As well as just clicking on them period."
14591,"It's fun and strangely addictive. It's like Fallout 4 but simplified, maintaining it's SPECIAL quirks. Plus it allows you to feel like an all mighty god, controlling dwellers at the mere click of a mouse. :)"
14592,Another time sink mobile game. Nothing special. If you're bored at work this might distract you for a few minutes occassionally. Literally a waste of time.
14593,"Overall, a fun time consuming game. Not p2w at all (but tempting to buy stuff anyway) 7/10"
14594,"fallout quiz! best!
-play fallout 3 and 4, still dunno any answer of the quiz
requiescat in pace"
14595,Fuck. yes. It. Is. Amazing.
14596,Easy to Play.
14597,Fun little game. Good time killer.
14598,GREAT GAME!
14599,"challenge- fun- cool design- free: i really like it

the game play is intersting and fun. I am a fan of Fallout so i appreciate the grafic design a lot with the ""pip boy"" characters. all in all a good game for plaiyng it from time to time. and looking at the for free part: I find it really well made and a cool thing for fallout fans same as for people who just enjoy a bit construction/ strategy and post apokalyptic vault simulators. ;P"
14600,If you DARE to fall asleep and check on your vault the next day  you will be so behind its not even funny.
14601,"Pretty good game. It just has not much replay value for me though, since I just maxed out everything in the game, obtain all weapons and quit for good.

However, even before that milestone it's very interesting to play."
14602,Really great game to chill and enjoy for a while
14603,"A good filler game when you're doing something else. Though when you get further into the game with all the neat stuff like character customization and such you have to pay individually and wait per each dweller which was a deal breaker for me. At this stage in the game everything has a long wait period and is designed to entice you to get those Fizzy Bubbly Nuka Cola packs but you must resist! I would advise not spending money on this game. Not really a fan of these type of microtransaction games I'd stay clear of this game if you're impulsive. D:

**Games that Time-gate gameplay content behind paybarriers aren't worth spending money on. I don't disagree it's not a fun game I haven't played it for a few months now but I was enjoying it from a Mobile Game perspective because it was a good time killer inbetween activities and such. I've just a strong dislike for microtransaction based games that serve no purpose other than to complete a task that would have taken like several hours if not days to complete. It's become pretty much the common structure of mobile games and it just kinda made me upset to see it in Fallout format. Hope that clears stuff up. :]"
14604,Cool
14605,Awesome tycoon oh yeah
14606,"nice game !
i have had this game before on  my cellphone.
so funny!"
14607,"Got OCD?  Fuel it with this game, great fun!"
14608,GOOD GAME
14609,Mod it so theres no stupid cap on your shelter and have fun!
14610,GREAT GAME ! AND MODS !
14611,I expect more from Bethesda.
14612,"it would crash my fricken steam and its self so a 0/10 don't play this.

14613,Best time killer game i ever played
14614,"Yea I recommend it. The further in you are the more rewarding it gets. Till you max everything out I guess.. but then you could just start a new vault.

Added: ok nvm the game crashed and nothing saved sooo i'm pretty upset. I still reccomend it, just don't get too attached i guess."
14615,great game maybe not so much for pc but for your phone it's great 4/5
14616,"Fun game if you want a little taste of the Fallout franshise. This game is fun, i highly recomed if you just staarting to play Fallout. Then try and get you hand on Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 4, ( those are my top 2 favorite Fallout games.)


~Qu4ck"
14617,"It's a great title, I don't buy anything from the store. I don't play with it open, but when I do play it I just  check every 10 minutes or so and close it. Minimizes the dangers of leaving it open to random chance. I keep my vault small on purpose, we get it done with quests without all the noise of a massive vault."
14618,Love This Game!
14619,"An absolute gem of a game. For those that like a challenge, are a completionist or simply like an interesting game to melt a few hours away whilst maintaining enjoyment this game is a must to try."
14620,"It was pretty good, until I lost my saves as a friend logged into his steam on my laptop. Protip: their save will overwrite yours EVEN IF they are logged into a different account. I went onto my computer which he didn't log into, and his saves are still there. Game breaking (literally) bug, and now my awesome vault is gone. Otherwise it's a great game, but I can't recommend it if you have friends."
14621,"one issue with the game i found, if u use real cash to buy something in one of ur vaults, if ur save is corrupted or your game uninstalls all that money is gone and everything you bought forever."
14622,"After a number of hours in game, it randomly deleted my save file without any fix seeming to be in sight.
apparently is just an issue this game can have; don't invest any time, or especially money into this game."
14623,i got attacked twice in 2 minutes by raiders before i had a weapon in my vault
14624,"You will not know you became addictive when you check every six hour for collect point from training room. And yes, very good than another same type game that need purchase (Never buy it when every of them was negative review). 

Cons,
 no incest, 
feel pity to evict dweller, 
legendary weapon and clothes have low stats somehow,
You will get disaster like Judgement days when you at middle gameplay. ([spoiler] Radscorpion [/spoiler]).
Mr. Robot lifetime can't cover, need to wait some explosion to repair.

Why pay same type game when this free to play was pretty good than pay to win game? 101/100."
14625,"Good relaxing game, but not when something trying to kill u. :)"
14626,Percentages means nothing
14627,"I recommend this to Fallout fans. Game play is very simple, mostly tacticial. I enjoyed the story but it gets a little repetative because of the length of the game. Very cool mindless Fallout fun!"
14628,"Too bad we can't make our own little experiment like the Vaults in the other Fallout games. But maybe this is an experiment since we're sending the Vault Dwellers out on crazy quests. Personally? I would have added a stress/sanity system for each and every Vault Dweller but, sadly, I am not a modder, nor can I add mods without crashing the game."
14629,Had this on my phone and its exactly the same on PC
14630,Oke game but no fun on the long run
14631,Liked
14632,What am I doing with my life?
14633,If you're willing to check up on this game around 2 times a day then this is a pretty decent game to pass time if another game might be taking a while to load or if you just want to play a mobile game on your computer. Whatever floats your boat.
14634,it is a good game i like it a lot
14635,Nice
14636,Aboslutely brilliant
14637,"Its a fun game to play when you just want to sti back, relax and browse the intrnet."
14638,uninstalled itself grr
14639,"Review and Suggestions:
Not a fast game, building up a room at a time and hoping not to be eaten. Only 2 crashes in 605 hours where a vault is lost, so a very stable game. When you get by a certain point (unlocking all rooms and having high SPECIAL characteristics for your dwellers) all you will be doing is a High School game organising 50 or so unneeded dwellers between training rooms to increase their SPECIALs. Quests will become routine once you get a couple of high stat people on them, so become simple moving from room to room in far away vaults. So...

...Set your own House  Rules...
To keep the game fresh I just start again with a new history and set some self-imposed limits. I was born 1960 so some of my imaginary shelters may be around that period. Here are some home rules to freshen / complicate your game or just be horrified at:

- Must scrap all rusty weapons. Yes even that rusty minigun from your first Lunchbox.
- No sci-fi. Only use weapons from the 1950's or 1960's.
- Girls only get to use pistols. Only Men may use the big guns. Jim Kirk says so. Sexist reality means girls may not train stats over 5, except Charm. Men do not get kittens as pets.
- Segregation - keep different colours in different rooms. Always. Is there a room management problem here? No simply murdering allowed.  I suppose Apartheid would be 3 colours, and religious separation by clothing. Try to keep the Bishop out of rooms with naughty nightware in them.
- Don't get  Bottle and Cappy - they give out too much easy free caps and Nuka Cola Q.
- Logans Run... kill anyone aged (level) over 21.

...And so on. I'm sure it's got another 600 hours in it.

Chessboard it. Enjoy!"
14640,"I've been playing this game for quite some time and mostly because I really like to waste my time. And f-shellter is really just a big waste of time, it can be enjoyable from time to time but imho it sucks. Since it's f2p and it killed 80 hours of my life I was 50/50 about recommending it.

The game is absolutely boring. You build resource buildings, then training buildings, then better resource buildings and that's it. You train your dwellers, really the only thing that matters is just better more dmg guns, even legendary armor doesn't make a big difference (I found some power armor early in the game and it changed totally nothing). You send your dwellers to explore, they find some legendary loot, you craft a legendary weapon (9 days) and send them to explore to bring you more loot for another weapon. Truly the game is super pointless.

There are quests, where you find yet more loot and guns. The quests are a disgrace to any fallout spirit whatsoever, fallout series is a masterpiece in the post-nuclear genre, being dark and hopeless, the wasteland is a harsh place, there are ideologies (enclave, brotherhood of steal etc), fight for survival degrades any morale there is left after the nukes fell down. The quests in shelter are so terribly dumbed down that even a class of retarded low-iq irradiated ghouls would find them offensive. You go looking for food recipes or santa clauss, for some baseball nonsense, I mean srsly, is it really that hard just to write a few lines of quality fallout story? If anybody reads that quest BS, why can't it be at least a little bit fallout-like. And this feels throughout all the game, it looks like it was created cheaply with the idea of ""hey, it has fallout tag people will play it"". Well and I did, stupid me.

There are so many annoying things it's hard to comprehend Bethesda left it at that. There is no search function, if you have 180 dwellers you scroll down looking for the one you need, the same goes with weapons and armor. When dwellers come back from exploration there is an option to sell common items, yet it doesn't sell all common items so you need to sell it manually anyway. You will be raided by deathclaws and attacked by mole rats for no reason at all all of the time you play, where you just have to wait 2 minutes for this irritation to end. And then we come to the point where I decided not to recommend this dumbed-down insult.

There is no end-game, so I was like yeah cool, I will just waste some time, gather the achievements and be done with it. And there is one achievement where you need to get 20 legendary dwellers. First I thought (and read about it) that breeding a legendary baby, which is rare, but happens from time to time, counts. It doesn't, you can get few legendary dwellers from quests, the others come from lunchboxes, which you gotta pay for, and you gotta pay a lot if you want to get this achievement. It would take long enough to get it with legendary babies, but now it's impossible. And here I thought, you sick bastards, you really want people to pay for a product half-done, not even remotely close to anything fallout like, with no endgame. 

I wouldn't play it if I knew all this before I started. I mean it's f2p so go and build your vault, but there will be lots of frustrating things you will encounter, and if you're a fallout fan then dissapointments too. I think even soda dugeon is more fun than this."
14641,Just play the game jesus
14642,ayy...its pretty good
14643,"Fallout shelter is a fun timekiller where you have been assighned the role of the overseer of a vault.  A vault is a well defended shelter that protects dwellers from the dangers of the wasteland. It is located underground. To be succesfull, you need to breed dwellers and collect resources. Also, you need to send armed dwellers to the wasteland to collect weapons and caps (the fallout currency). I highly reccomend this game. Good luck!"
14644,Had to uninstall. Was too addicting.
14645,it ok
14646,"If you just want to zone out and lose yourself in another world than this is the game for you!! Play it for hours upon no end! Because if you're doing well in a video game, you're doing well in life!"
14647,Og√≥lnie to dobra gra jest:)
14648,I think that this game is really good it has some good guns and has alot of stuff you can do!
14649,"It's free to play, but it's FUN and easy to play without spending money."
14650,Good
14651,"Cute, addicting, and has more depth than might meet the eye at first. A lovely, enjoyable time-waster.

Edit: Seems to have an on-again-off-again glitch where you'll close the game but time won't pass when it's closed, i.e., for quest travel times and the like. Not the biggest pain in the butt but a little annoying. Not sure what triggers it if anything. Still a good game despite it."
14652,It's ok. A mobile game on PC but a decent time waster.
14653,"The game has some charm and it can be a little fun building up your vault... but in the end it is really just wasting your time.  The ""game"" is quite easy once you know the basics and you will only likely feel challenged for a brief period of time.  After that, it is basically the same stuff over and over.  Constantly clicking on your production sites to collect food, water, etc, occassionally dealing with an attack of some sort, building new buildings and sending your dweller out on quests / exploring.  The quests should be fun but boil down to moving to each room and killing what is there, or on occassion hitting an empty room.  That's it really.  There is some cosmetic stuff like themes and haircuts but that is stuff I don't care about.  If you want something to occupy your time and nothing more, maybe it is for you.  It wasn't for me."
14654,good cos free.. hahahaha.. dlm bhsa mlayu nye game ni best.. simple tp ada story mission.. try dulu baru tau steam k x.. huhuhuhu..
14655,kinda annoying but not terrible
14656,"this game is fun and extremely addictive, but honestly it operate based on Murphy's law,  if things would go wrong it WILL GO WRONG. I don't have any dweller max on all stats yet and maybe that's why, but rushing a room for a resrouce i need badly end up failing 90% of the time. and the incidents happens to destory the resources that you need most.
advice, play it slow, don't make tons of babys all at once!


"
14657,"[h1] Let‚Äôs review : Fallout Shelter  [/h1]

Create your own vault, where you tend to your dwellers. Give them jobs, give them food, or throw them out in the world to scavenge for treasure and other delights! Put some of them in rooms and watch the miracle of light happen right before your eyes, and have lil‚Äôdwellers running around.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

+ Above all else, it‚Äôs free, and it doesn‚Äôt push micro transactions or paid subscriptions down your throat 24/7.
+ It‚Äôs set in the Fallout franchise of course, so you can expect a serious connection to the universe of the game!
+ Balance water, food, power and much more, while trying to maintain your dwellers alive and happy, which counts allot when you are trying to expand!
+ Quests ‚Äì Send your strongest dwellers on quests, to further peak your interest on what you may find out there in the ravaged world!
+ A multitude of collectibles, from weapons, special outfits, to pets and special dwellers!
+ It‚Äôs a game for the long run, think personal Ant-Farm! You‚Äôll watch them multiply and grow.
+ Create rooms for them to work in or play. Balance the power needs it each addition, and train your dwellers to become more efficient in the tasks you assign them to!
+ Get ready to be invaded and attacked from all directions. Be them Rad roaches, to bandits and the famous DeathClaws!

 [h1] Cons: [/h1]

- It‚Äôs a free game, so you can hardly find a negative in this game, it‚Äôs a time killer and a good one at it!

[h1] Final Review [/h1]

Fallout Shelter focuses on the building of a world for your dwellers, train them, and improve them with a huge selection of weapons and clothes. Manage everything from basic needs to outdoor adversities. And the best of it, its set in a great universe filled with lore, and it‚Äôs a great add-on to the big game! And it‚Äôs free!! So I have to give this game a solid 8 out of 10 for just being what it is.

Enjoy Guys and Girls, and if this review helped you in any way please leave me a Thumbs up, i would appreciate it immensely. And please consider joining me on Curate This ‚Äì A Honest Review at:

"
14658,"The best Fallout game Bethesda ever made.
...which still sucks as a Fallout game, but as a SimTower clone is quite good...
...if and only if you don't mind microtransactions."
14659,very nice game
14660,"*Is out of food and water*
*Tries to rush 10 times in a row*
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
*Everything, so it seems.*"
14661,Had this game on mobile and couldn't really get into it. However I think it's a great addition to PC. Having a much bigger screen I think makes the game playable and actually fun.
14662,"Noice gaem mon,Make a v2 please!Tanks!"
14663,it really fun to play when your on the go and you want to play fallout it is just a really fun game to play if you love fallout
14664,Pretty good for a free game.  Alot of adicting micro-transactions.
14665,Ran weird the first time I opened the game but after I reopened the game it worked just fine. I have played this game on my phone in the past and think it's actually pretty fun.
14666,This is an awesome strategy game witvh i recommend for everyone who likes games where you have to manage a thriving community.
14667,"So I started playing this game knowing there would be MT's which is fine. A few minutes into the game and I built a power room and placed dwellers inside it (Doesn't explain the SPECIAL stats very well) it then tells me to click the ""rush"" button to do something so I did and then I seen the time below and it would only take 2 minutes to complete. I said to myself ""I can wait 2 mins"" once the 2 minutes were done the room glowed with green squares pulsing around it. I clicked ""Close"" to close the screen that the game wanted me to activate the rush for but it wouldn't let me close so I thought it was a glitch or something so I closed the game and opened it. My save was no longer there once I opened it and since I can't make my own choice at the beginning of the game (to wait 2 minutes or activate the ""rush"") I uninstalled it. If you can't let me make my own choice at the beginning of the game then I do not wish to know what else you have planned for me as I proceed through the game."
14668,the game is so good. bout gets harder as it goes for resorces.
14669,This game is awesome! Super fun and a great way to pass the time on car rides and such. And you know how most of the vaults in Fallout were actually social experiments? My vaults experiment was to see how the dwellers would perform when being commanded by a complete idiot.
14670,"Ever since this came out in 2015, I've been playing it. From my iPod to my phone now and even on my computer. This game is incredibly addictive and fun to micromanage. Sure the game keeps reminding you of lunch boxes and makes you want to buy them but that's just smart game design. Bethesda really hit gold here"
14671,I thought this was fallout 4 .i already have 43 hrs into it i want refand.
14672,"My favorite mobile/management game. It take some understanding and it does start a little slowly but after about 3 days, it really picks up. I was surprised by how deep this game was. It may seem like it is only a vault creator game but once you unlock and build an overseerer's office, the game opens up. You go on quests and can explore some of the game's most fun moments. The radio tower also boosted how fast I got dwellers which made vault management much easier. I've already played 25 hours of the game, and I still have lots of fun things to look forward to (I haven't even gotten to the deathclaws or power armor yet). Also, major bonus: The game does offer microtransactions but is built in such a way that I was never tempted to buy them or felt like it was the only way to progress."
14673,Awsome!!!
14674,"basically what's expected of an indie game, but survival mode is better in terms of ""action"" oof otherwise it's pretty mellow :)9oio"
14675,10/10
14676,"nice fallout style strategic game! set in fallout universe 
Vault Boy rates 100/100"
14677,"One of my favorite games to play. If yoy enjoy fallout you will enjoy this game. Everything runs in real time so quests, leveling, work orders etc can be done even when logged off. Its great for killing a few minutes here and there and can get pretty tough further in"
14678,"This is a typical time sink.
Controls are a mess.
Bad experience playing this.
This game is designed to make you pay real money for what you can easily get editing your save files."
14679,Game Good!
14680,Great free little game for a pase time that you can work at and build down farther and get more people to join you and help defend your vault.
14681,Fallout is the best game ever. Any fallout game is worthy of anyones presence
14682,"I was having a ball until I realised you cant save !
You come back the next day and they are all kaputt.
Shame it was fun,. small detail to fix I hope they do, i would invest in this gaME"
14683,"[h1] The Best Version of Fallout Shelter? [/h1]

[b] This is the best port of Fallout Shelter by far! [/b] The Xbox One version is locked at 30 FPS with NO vertical syncronisation. This version allows 60 FPS with VSync on, so if you're wondering which is the best version of the game. Also, don't bother with the mobile version (unless you want Fallout Shelter on the go).

8/10."
14684,"I love all things fallout, and this is no exception. However, this is honestly more the time killer resource management game you play when you have nothing better to do. It is free, which means it's worth at least checking out, but I will recommend that people avoid the microtransactions. You can't really ""win"" the game, you just get to a point where you run out of space and things to do really, so there's no real ""pay to win"" tactics in it, the microtransactions just bring you to that ""nothing left"" end of the game where you lose interest, slightly faster. Even then they may not even do that as it isnt uncommon for your game to crash, or glitch, or otherwise lose your vault so there isnt a lot of reason to pay for bonus stuff that doesnt actually do much and may disappear with no notice and no way to recover those items. Just play and enjoy the game as is, dont waste money on it unless you truly have a strong urge to support an already massive developer"
14685,Pretty nice game if you like a colony/strategy game recommend it
14686,Good fun
14687,"Mobile game on PC, neat to have on a larger screen. A low stress game (aside from the occasional siren and wonky mouse click). It's a nice casual game to have going while you might have other things going on in your life. The game is free so I don't really mind paying at least for a starter pack to get set up in the game nicely. By no means should you pay-to-win, it sort of defeats the purpose of playing. If you'd like to play a game that's more relaxed and not INTENSE EVERY SECOND I would recommend trying out Fallout Shelter. Out of all the ""mobile games"" Bethesda has designed one of the best."
14688,"This game is good, its free.. keep it that way, dont pay. i baught some things. in hindsight a large mistake. the game doesnt feel completed. no end game, and not enough buildings or events to keep it interesting. so dont rush it. keep your money in your pocket. It was fun, but game over."
14689,It's free you are losing nothing if you buy it and it can be fun as a game to play between other games for a few minutes!
14690,"I already played it (and liked it) when it first came out on mobile devices. I appreciated it even more when I learned that the game was now available for computers as well (both through Steam and Bethesda's own launcher).

I won't spend a lot of time on reviewing this: it's a pretty neat game to pass time. You don't need prior knowledge of the Fallout series to enjoy Shelter: just download it and fire it up whenever you fancy. It's also free to play (with optional micro-transactions), so trying it out won't cost you a dime!

Recommended. I really have no reasons not to."
14691,"10/10
"
14692,"the only thing this has to offer is incredibly slow grind
the gameplay mechnics are simple and not fun
grind in order to grind better game filled with constant reminders that you should pay some money to grind faster"
14693,its a good game.
14694,very well made
14695,happy game
14696,"Addictive and Free = Dangerous 

Therefore I recommend"
14697,"This game is great to pass the time. There are many small features that allow each play to constantly change the overall outcome of your vault, making it extremely interesting."
14698,it good

14701,"That game is good , for for people who love to take care of other creatures."
14702,"This is a shameless cash grab. I can't believe Bethesda let one of their IP's connected to this game. Every inch of this game is designed to just get you to pay for ""lunchboxes"" because fi the raiders don't attack you 3 times in a row in less that 20 minutes to wipe out your base, THE DAMN DEATHCLAW'S WILL. Purely designed not to challenge you, but kill all your inhabitabts and get you to pay more. 

Shame on you Bethesda. Shame. On. You."
14703,"good casual game, open rarely just to check my people at gym
but collect Legendary Dwellers acievment just to hard for people who not cheating"
14704,"One of my favorite mobile games, and certainly worth a play if you're a fan of the Fallout series or if you can't play one of the main games. I've probably put in something like 120 hours including my mobile playthroughs."
14705,"It is a nice game, too slow though."
14706,Nice
14707,"Fallout Shelter is really fun, but can be quite difficult at first. After you can keep your food, water, and power up it gets way easier. I really don't have a strong computer but I get excellent frames, ping, ect. and it never freezes on me. Once you have completed mutiple quests and have 200 people, it gets a little boring but is still fun. I would recomend this game to anybody who likes games that have adventure. I have not played very long but I am really far into the game. Try this game, hope you enjoy."
14708,Never understood the buzz of these games. Everything is behind a wall of time or money and there is no gameplay. I can appreciate the art and lore but other then that it's a cell phone game. Don't even get me started on that subject.
14709,Really interesting game. Addicted right now :D
14710,"Pretty good game wouldnt really find it ""fun"" or ""Amazing"" but i just downloaded it for the vault building cause ye cant do that in fallout 4 :/"
14711,This game is fun and amazing. I haven't played much but it's amazing so far. If you like games like this then get it. You won't regret it
14712,"Advantage is that its free to play and its not that bad..... I actually like this game, cuz you need to use your head need to make strategys."
14713,"This is a simple game with not much to it and can be a little slow to get going. You build different rooms, train, clothe, arm your shelter dwellers and travel to different shelters doing various quests. Your shelter can be attacked, you can send dwellers to search for supplies and must have enough food, water and power to survive. Dwellers can be customized later which is a fun aspect and a mystery man randomly appears which can give you money when he's clicked. You can also have pets and have your dwellers breed new children. This is a game you play and then need to come back to in order to progress. Once you've done checking in with your shelter there can not be much to do until you go back in and play hours later. Yet you can waste a ton of hours playing this game. 6.5/10"
14714,i have nothing to say
14715,"At first I was like meh, it's slow and boring. BUT! Can confirm this game gets better and better the more times you return to it, I'm starting to love it. Just make sure to manually backup your save as it seems it will eventually crash and delete all your progress. Cheers.

%appdata%/local/FalloutShelter"
14716,its fine i guess
14717,"It's a free game where you can purchase some in game currency and lunchboxes that give you different items/resourches. Both can also be collected while exploring the world or doing quests. I never had the urgency to use and real money on the game. It's played in real-time, meaning things can take hours to happen. Collecting resources is usually faster, while doing quests or exploring can take a whole day. You can't play this game non-stop without using any real money to rush. 

I had issues with the fact that the dwellers cannot level up after level 50 and that they don't level up while training. Really annoyed  me, and also the fighting mechanism is repetitive and can bore you out really quickly. Nevertheless, its fun to collect all the items in the quests. You also have to make sure exploring dwellers have enough resources to survive outside the vault and that they return in time. It happened often to me that I had to revive the dwellers because they died on me. The vault keeps getting attacked by raiders or different creatures, but they are usually not too hard to deal with if you keep an eye on the dwellers and keep healing them, and also equip them all with weapons. 

Overall it's a fun game, that can quickly become addictive."
14718,worth every penny spent
14719,Microtransactions all over the place!
14720,keep up the great work
14721,Game was great up until hour 39 when it crashed. Now i don't have access to the vault I spent money setting up. Emailed Fallout Shelter support and got some stupid automated response saying go to our support website. NO ACTIVE Human customer support to assist with game issues when your own money is on the line.. Case in point don't spend real world money on this game unless your ok with it dissapearing when  the game client crashes and doesn't allow you to access your Vaults.
14722,I like it.
14723,It's hard starting out and geting used to how fast things lose controll but once you upgrade alot and i mean alot! the game becomes more fun ^^
14724,"This game is great for those who want to get into fallout. Though this game is not a 3rd person shooter RPG like fallout, it allows you to picture the struggles that the vault dwellers would face underground. You don't need to play any other fallout titles beforehand to understand the game. 

GAMEPLAY: The game is more inclined to the casual player, but die hard players like myself are also fans of the game due to its optional diffuculty change and mechanics. Unfortunately this game has, you guessed it ""MICROTRANSACTIONS"" everyounes favorate cancerous feture. you can buy ""nuka cola quant"" to speed up the game, but the game gives you a small taste where you can earn them during quests. you can also buy ""lunchboxes"" which are your lootboxes (yes even this game unashamefully inclines the purchases of lootboxes) which can provide a range of resources including dwellers, armor, pets, and junk. I do have to say that the game is solid, but from my personal experiance the game starts to slow down at around 60 dwellers, and becomes a chore to play later in the game."
14725,"While this game can be very fun to play, please take care not to advance to quickly if you are not upgraded enough with your dwellers. Harder mobs will approach your vaults the moe dwellers you have, not based on level. If you have a lot of dwellers, but not enough higher quality items, you could be in for a very dangerous and possibly vault breaking time. Becareful and make sure to uprgade gear as best as you can. I still recommend this game though. It is a lot of fun. Enjoy. :-)"
14726,Played on both Steam and Android. It's pay to win. Don't waste your time on this.
14727,At start its not very fun but when you get the hang off it and when you start building interesting rooms.....oohh then the fun starts...
14728,Playing offline and lost my data like all these app games like fuck im going to start from scratch a shame because its a highly addictive game
14729,"This game is fun and cute, a good time filler.

However! I saved it last night and come back this morning to find all my explorers dead. Why bother having a save function if you can't ever log out without risking the lives of your residents? 

I don't think I'll play it again, but it was good for a few hours."
14730,"i dont have a lot of time in the game but i love this game! it combines money(caps), essentials(food,water,happyness), and exploring for items. it manages all of these REALLY well! you can equip weapons for defence or exlporing, oufits for bonuses, and a pet for...i dont really know what its for yet XD. but still its a game i would highly reccomend for people who want a game to play for youtube or just for fun."
14731,"found still game totally adictive, reminds me in the 90s when command and concer came out great game"
14732,veri nais much fun
14733,"Clumsy controls, unplayable. Dragging a person, which is a main mechanic of the game, often drags the map instead."
14734,"I was more than happy to recommend this game before as a time consumer with goofy glitches that made it fun. But today's glitch wiped out my entire vault. So fuck you Bethesda, this type of shit is what makes people uninstall these shit games."
14735,"This game is a good amount of fun, but depending on the person it might get old fast.

Game is free with microtransactions and you can play this game comfortably even without spending any money on it.

Until a certain point the game is hard and you might lose your dwellers/inhabitants easily. You need to be somewhat tactical on how you approach your Vault as you will need to think ahead a lot. Quests are fun and seasonal things are frankly pretty well made for they don't really break the atmosphere of the game. They're pretty much the only way to tell that time does fly even inside this game (sort of).

I would say that it's a nice, chill way to spend a few minutes. Like watching a garden or an ant farm. Getting 100% on achievements will require some time and most likely some investment money wise to pull through, but if you're not too worried about doing 100% or you love grinding, then this should work out perfectly.

I'd recommend to check it out if you like Fallout world in general and want to play around a little bit with the idea of your own Vault."
14736,Not that interesting.
14737,"A fun little time waster between games when bored, dont get suckered into paying for anythiing though, Bethesda has enough money."
14738,"i love falllout and this game is pretty cool i give it 10/10
"
14739,Fun game just relaxing to play in the background :D
14740,"This game cheats. It is pay to win through and through. You have no chance to actually get far enough without spending real money to keep this terribly developed Unity trainwreck running. No matter how well you manage your resources, the Deathclaw attacks and radscorpions will ruin your Vault within moments (yes, these attacks happen alot more frequent without any reason).

Stay away from this pay2win disaster. It's literally fun for only a few hours before the gamebreaking mechanics kick in."
14741,"I love it , well done bethesda on making one of the best games ever. i thourghly enjoy the many quest and finally i love how the game never end but one thing i request is that you add some sort of shop where the player can buy antother vault and have something like the supply lines in fallout 4 . But all in all 10/10 for the game"
14742,"Pretty good in my opinion, just the time required to arrive at quests and arrive back when exploring wasteland and from quest takes a considerable time. Its overall good, just you have to wait for some time to get progress when you have many dwellers. I also think that some daily missions are too hard."
14743,"Fun little diversion, but save your money."
14744,"to the town of agua fria rode a stranger one fine day. Hardly spoke to folks around him didnt have too much to say, no one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip, the stranger there among them had a big iron his hip big iron on his hiiiiipppppp"
14745,"My biggest (and first) shelter died due to a fire. I'm never playing this game again.






Still reccomend tho."
14746,good game.
14747,"i bought 30 pet things for 20$ and 15 lunchboxes for 10 $ dollars and still didnt get anything i bought them 2 days ago 
I SPENT 30$ AND GOT NOIN'
SERIUOSLY COME ON MAN
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
I WANT MY STUFF"
14748,"Gameplay, Humor and Aesthetics of this game are just fantastic. If you're a Fallout fan just go for it. You won't regret it.
And btw, remember that the mobile version of this game is annoyingly buggy. So, if you want to experience it without being occasionally pissed off, use the PC version"
14749,"Bethesda did a really good job with Fallout Shelter, it's maintained it's roots in the Fallout universe yet has also formed it's own unique personality."
14750,good game)
14751,cool game... addictive. makes me want to plat fallout again.
14752,it sucks
14753,Absolutely love it. A little strategic with a lot of fun. Expanding is the main goal of this game and all the tasks it gives you to keep you busy definitely makes you come back and check it over and over. Really love the relations to the Fallout series also. Great job Bethesda!
14754,"great game, recommend to anyone who likes fallout!"
14755,"I've played this before on my phone, but I perfer on the computer."

14760,"slow at the beginning, couple of crashes, small chances of lags that can lead to crashes, missions need a bit more work but overall they are at least fun and decent, objectives need work.. you know those that you need 2 to 3 nukas to skip just to have a chance of that same mission that you skipped appearing right after you completed one before the skip, the loot box system is cool, and the gameplay can get boring and unactive but after reaching like 20 or more dwellers the pace starts to kinda kick up. liked the game (ive played it before on mobile from when it came out to now) and had a overall good/boring experience. Dont know why it crashes here more than on mobile but at least it picks up right before it crashed. Decent for a mobile game.

I really like all the new stuff theyve added to the game which makes this.. more of a game. its bethesda good."
14761,"Better than Fallout 4 that's for sure.
For more than two days of straight gameplay? NO. 
after building ultimate vault game gets boring as hell.
sure it's fun to forget about abomination that is F4 but sooner or later even shelter gets boring."
14762,Take a rest and drink a Nuka-Cola. You won't regret
14763,A great introduction game to get you into the fallout games.
14764,What you see is what you get kinda game. And plus its kinda addicting.
14765,kill gays
14766,Really fun game But not something you can play for hours on end. I reccomend getting this on your mobile phone instead as you can play it in your free time.
14767,"Is this a fun nod to all the Fallout games? Yes. If you're just looking for a time-guzzling fix for your Fallout addiction, this will do that for a little bit.

Unfortunately I can't recommend it because it sort of just peters off into nothing. No real end game content, very little replayability value. You'll end up wondering why you still have it downloaded and only play it to remind yourself of how cool you wish it had been if it had been developed further."
14768,"Fun, dumb.
Can play for free if have the patience to do so.
I've played game for months without paying penny.
Pretty great."
14769,"It's a simple free-to-play game. It's a pretty addicting time waster, just don't spend any money on the games."
14770,2nd best fallout spin off I every played
14771,A extremely easy casual game on which I have absurdly wasted more than 300 hours. I will not recommend it to anyone because it is dangerously addictive and time consuming.
14772,great game
14773,Good thing to do if you are bored.
14774,9/10 i think it is amazing but one thing is when ever i save and exit it does not save and i have to start over
14775,"It's a very good game, You can build, Get dwellers and make da brighter future,I recommend this game because its free and fun! But alot of work."
14776,"Addicting little game.  Phone game ported to PC.  Has microtransactions but can easily beat the game without buying.  Just a bit time consuming.  Wait and click, wash and repeat.  Perfect while watching something.  Well made time waster.   oh...and it's free.  10/10 

"
14777,"A barebones free-to-play mobile game shamelessly ported to Steam. While retaining the iconic look of the Fallout series it lacks all depth and is solely a grindstone to rake in the micropayments. Not worth the time of even the most diehard Fallout fan. Frankly, Fallout Shelter stains Bethesda‚Äôs reputation for ever having produced it.

Not recommended."
14778,nice game
14779,"This is a amazing game which therfore the creators like to show their game to everyone to the community which i can say they have made a possible outcome  where they have succeeded their goals which everyone can enjoy for those Fallout Lovers! The game itself is really fun and tactical if you want to become the best vaultg of all time (behind me srry).There is alot of choices which can be changing for your vault if you decide for that option.There is a bunch of stuff to do in the game and you are too busy keeping your vault in the best proper form it can be.Quests are Usefull to get like Bottle and Cappy which are amazing which increases your deweller's happyness!

Overall the concept of the game is greats in it's detail tho the slow progress annoys me but this game is AMAZING. 9/10 Rating. :D
"
14780,"it's very cool but the physics are.....................a little less than real personally,i mean i know it's a cartoon-ish-game but.......the fatman only kills enemy's? and the door is made of a titanium and yet SWORDS can get through it i mean.....wow,but other than that it's a very good game a very.....G O O D  G A M E..............and if you ever make it N O T a good game heh i'll post a not-recommending review ok? -not meant as a threat,but as a promise-"
14781,"Last time I played this game was on my phone.... when I found this game on steam, without a doubt I clicked install....
"
14782,<3
14783,"Great potential.Could add more(weapons,outfits,monsters).Without a mod every action needs a lot of time and lunchboxes,pet holders,mr handy are very difficult to find and from them to find something useful."
14784,"if you want others to think you're gay, you should definitely play it"
14785,this game kind of make me get fallout 4 lol odd word it fun i wish it mulitplayer
14786,its so addicting
14787,"Game can and will eventually crash and delete your entire save with no ability to recover unless you constantly manually back it up. For a game with a P2W store, this is quite interesting."
14788,"you'd have to grind a lot, but except for that its pretty fun, compared to a tycoon."
14789,It's ok but there is no real endgame and there is one achievement that you can't get unless 'pay to achieve'.
14790,so funny game and never get bored in this game i like it :-)
14791,Really fun game to spend some time!
14792,"A Good Game...but it takes a long time to wait..might as well afk, cause it takes hours to do something...but overall it's a fun game, not really pay to win, but requires a lot of time, dedication and strategy on how you would plan to build, maintain and survive from your vault and on how you would defend your vault from incidents such as the op mobs which sometimes makes you feel annoyed when they appear in a sudden like deathclaws,radscorpions, and molerats..."
14793,Post apocalyptic fun!
14794,"The Idea is great, problem is the amount of wait times.
I would love a fallout game kinda like a mix of this & Fallout 1/2

It's a good game to play on the phone, not on the PC."
14795,"Put in a lot of game play. Really enjoyed it. Not great for computer play, prob better for mobile use. But played this when watching TV so not too bad!"
14796,eh i think they should add a feature where you can choose where your adventure people go and what they do
14797,cool time killer
14798,Preston Garvey nous de wae
14799,"Don't play this game. I spent almost seventy hours building what I was hoping to be an incredible vault and then one day out of nowhere when my PC crashed my saved game gets deleted. FOR NO APPARENT REASON! After researching this there seem to be dozens of people who have experienced the same problem ACROSS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS! I saved my game every time I used it and did everything that I was supposed to, so to have 70 plus hours invested in a game and then to have it just disappear for no reason is completely unforgivable. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"
14800,"Good. Add more updates, please."
14801,"After 65 hours, 75 dwellers, and an efficient cap-earning system coupled with nigh-impenetrable deathclaw-proof defenses, lvl 50 max. SPECIAL dwellers, I went in tonight to check on Vault 666 and found it had been completely erased. It was soul-crushing, and I'm probably not going to restart for quite some time. I was very attached to the successful haven I had made.

BUT

This game is excellent, especially when you have downtime. If you check on it and make minor adjustments once a day, your vault will be self-sustaining and easy to manage going forward. Missions outside of the vault are a great way to get more unique items, and sending dwellers that have been hard at work maxing-out their SPECIAL skills both levels them exceptionally well, while simultaneously pulling in large amounts of junk items, weapons and armor; which, if you have in abundance, can be sold for extra caps. I spent the last two quarters of my time playing with a constant 999,999 caps, dwellers in pristine condition, incoming threats usually never made it past three rooms at the most, and my ability to manage my resources patiently more than paid off. A lot of patience, proper reservation, and a lot of trial and error can turn this game from a major sensory overload into a casual tycoon-esque experience that demands little. It was pure fun.

I cannot stress enough, however, that you absolutely MUST back up your saves. I wish I didn't have to learn this the hard way, but that's what I get for being arrogant enough to think it couldn't happen to me."
14802,"If you're looking for a fun game to play on your own, or a good Bethesda game, or one simply related to the popular Fallout series, the I recommend this game. Very simple and fun. This is a very time consuming game and does require a bit of paitience but I think it is worth the wait."
14803,"Played this game on my phone when it first came out, Really enjoyed it then.

playing it again now is so much fun, great way to take a break from the hardcore fallout world and relax."

14811,"Boring game, wouldn't recommend to people with a life"
14812,"pyro:  MmmmmMmMMmmmMMmMmMmMH...

heavy: its good

medic: were is the medicine\

"
14813,"Fantastic game to have on in the background. Really well designed and, as always, the lore is great.

"
14814,addictive game
14815,"Honestly, I was actually hooked to the game once I figured it out. When I saved and quit the game and went back to my vault, my resources were all depleted. I remember seeing my resources maxed out before exiting. I couldn`t do anything to fix the problem."
14816,"This is a free game and therefor it has the option for micro-transactions in the game. Normally I am immume to MT's and ignore it, but in this game I am really tempted to buy ingame items! This shows that they have been pretty smart with how they have created this game. Even though you can play the game without any extra MT's you are lured into buying stuff and constantly reminded that it is an option. 
 
The game itself is really fun and actually pretty tactical if you want to max out a vault with 100 dwellers. You need to think ahead and plan the layout of the vault wisely or you will shooting yourself in the foot later on in the game. There is lots of stuff to do in the game and you are constantly busy with keeping your vault running in proper order. You can also send your dwellers on quests that will take place on different maps where you can get loot and key items and of course you can send them into the wasteland and let them explore. 
 
The concept of the game is brilliant so in a way it is a bit of a shame that the game has been designed around MT's. I would love to see a full single player game of Fallout Shelter without the MT's and the slow progress, but for now I will just enjoy the game as it is. And I might even turn weak and buy some ingame goodies aswell :)
 
Thumbs up!



Side note:
There are people that mentions corrupt save files and losing their vault (+ their MT's), but I haven't experienced it so I can only review it from my own perspective. If it happens to me I will change this into a rant review :)"
14817,"Smile Like You Mean It!

14818,Why no incest?!
14819,"Started playing this game without realizing that it's a cellphone/Facebook game.  It is very slow-paced, with it taking hours for your Dwellers to accomplish certain things.  The pace wouldn't be a problem by itself, but once you get past a certain level enemies get exponentially more difficult, making it impossible to continue to advance without microtransactions and/or some actual strategy.  Considering that this game's pace at best relegates it to the play-during-commercial-breaks category, the idea of spending more than a couple dollars or putting more than couple hours of effort into it is absurd."
14820,"+Addictive
+Free
+Lots of characters from other Fallout games
+Did I mention addictive?

-Very little end-game content
-Weak enemy variety(Raiders, Ghouls, Radroaches, Molerats, Radscorpions, Deathclaws, and that's it)

Overall: 8/10, one of the best F2P games on Steam"
14821,Great way to waste time but be careful that you don't get too caught up in the upkeep of the place. Jumping on real quick can turn into hours soo easy.
14822,I recomand this game to other players because if you like to do quest and get them achievements then I recomand you to get this game
14823,Great game to play while doing something else ...
14824,"Awesome little game!

Beware the deathclaws! Build smart!"
14825,"I had more fun on ios, a nice game to load up now and then but cant play for long times as you run out of stuff"
14826,"[h1]  Fallout Shelter [/h1]
Fallout Shelter is a pretty nice managing game. You got a vault set in the dystopian world of Fallout and you manage it. 

[b] Simple, right? [/b]

However, you have to manage food supplies, electricity, clean water, the population and demand of the vault, and be aware of the few deathclaw and raider attacks that are sprinkled about. 
It's an addictive and fun game, for sure, and quite easy really, to manage in general. Except it's easy for things to go downhill if you don't know what you're doing properly. I almost lost a vault to bad power management, but salvaged it eventually. There are also quests, which I like, as instead of just clicking the ""Go on Quest"" button like in most games, after your dwellers arrive, you decide which part of the area they explore (roomwise, as it's still in the 2D style of the vault), which is a nice feature. The graphics are simple, and look nice, and I like how they mix the paper looking 2D characters with 3D backgrounds. It's a relatively easy game, I wouldn't say it's been too stressful in my experience of it so far, and the attacks on your vault can surprise you, but it's still not that bad. Pretty good game, and would recommend taking a look at."
14827,You know that moment when you play minecraft and its your first night and you just hide under dirt and try to build a base ? yea same game
14828,"took 361 hours to get every achievement just Cause i wanted to see if i could without spending any money , i need to find better things to spend my time on , i would say get the game cause hell it is free so why not"
14829,Do not make purchases on this game. There is no support for when your game crashes and your vault deletes.
14830,amongst best game i ever played. but somehow getting bored. maybe its me...hmmm
14831,"A really nice game, a constant urge of collecting all the weapons, attire and collecting all the legendary dwellers is the selling point of the game along with stratigically levelling up dwellers. 

But after a good amount of time spent collecting and levelling up the dwellers there's nothing much left to do the game becomes repetitive.
But all in all it's a good game considering it is free

PS: I tranfered the game from my phone to steam so ignore the time spent playing the game 
      displayed above"
14832,very nice and calming mostly but it takes time to get far
14833,"Very good!
"
14834,well at least its fun. not the type of game you see everyday
14835,Better than Fallout 4.
14836,"Vary fun, Things feel like forever to get started but hay it is free"
14837,Fun little mobile game. Not sure why they added a computer version but whatever.
14838,"You have to be really fast to react for some actions so I wouldn't recommend this for mobile phones, I play it on my computer. It's a really good game, a combination of Sims and Fallout, it isn't too immersive because a lot of the things You have to do You have to wait some time for them to be finished. I'd say that that is the only flaw of the game, then again it is meant to be played as a mobile game, not as seriously as I play it, I give it a 9/10."
14839,Best game m8 9.01/10
14840,"It's a really fun and addictive game. I have it on PC,XB1 and my mobile devices :)"
14841,Boring game...It just haven't catched my attention and will to play
14842,Pretty good and like the tablet version. I would like more places to explore thou. I would recommed this game to my friends and it's good gameplay for a free game.
14843,good game if you have no life (like me) and your phone is too full to fully run it.
14844,"Nice game, if you like the Fallout series. Also, it's free!"
14845,Honestly after playing this and then going to play FO3 and FNV my heart races in excitement whenever I found a lunchbox and then I got sad because it's not the same.
14846,after a hour of gameplay im still not bored nothing beats this games enjoyeble content like the fealing of being in control of something
14847,"This game is awesome and fun and I would recommend it. 

***HOWEVER, BE WARNED***

If the game crashes during gameplay, you will lose all of your data and your purchases. Steam and Bethesda will not refund your money or your product even though it is a game glitch. I purchased the in game starter pack, the game crashed within 24 hours and I was out $5 because apparently they will not refund or replace the product. DO NOT MAKE IN GAME PURCHASES. Luckily, the game is still enjoyable without them."
14848,:)
14849,"Had it on mobile and now i have it on pc, its a fun game to play if you dont have alot of time to delve into a larger game."
14850,"its super good game i love this game
"
14851,"This game loses its innitial appealing novelty and replayability after, oh, say around 50+ hours, or even less.  The fightings are boring, mundane, and repetitive after you've mastered locking down the enemy attacks on your vault. WARNINGS:
(spoilers here on for combating Deathclaws and Radscorpions) Initially, you can't do much against Deathclaws attacks because they're too fierce in speed attacks, but at least they ONLY comes from way of breaking down your vault door. After putting 2 guards on vault door with either or both vengeance and dragon maw weaps, and 6 sentry guard on the next room to the right of it, which I used living quarter, or barrack, using same weaps, no more problem with Deathclaws.  Radscorpions are much more of a nuisance if you don't equip your guys and gals with potent weaps, as well.  That's it. That's the final challenge of this game, which to me is lacklusters.  But I understood this game would lose a lot of player interests after they've come to same conclusion of meeting most of the challenges of the game.  
I can't see myself playing anymore (post appocalyptic) games like these because it's a real downer to the hopeful spirits of those who get fed up with blasting NPC's/players' characters into exploding guts and gores.  Way depressing after awhile, which is why I tried this dumbed down graphic version of ""Fallout Shelter"".  Thought I just play a cartoon version of this grim imagery of what Bethsheda is known for in Fallout 1-4.   Not real keen on the atmosphere of these ghouls and zombies type games due to its mostly non-eye candy scenes.  The initial fun of this game is exploring and experimenting of the different type of unlocked rooms and what it does to help and train the vault dwellers, but after that and gathering enough gold junks to make and developed all the high end weaps for most of your dwellers, it becomes mundane and boring without any challenge left. That's the conclusiong of the appeals to this game because the fighting is boring and less than 2 dimentional appeals.  You finally log on and wonder why the hell you're still playing this heap.  Think I'll just go  get a fern plant and water it instead..."
14852,Great for getting a quick Fallout fix.
14853,Excellent game. Simple and entertaining.
14854,"Nice FreeToPlay Game! Good as a ""TimeKiller"""
14855,"Really fun game. Not difficult at all, but still provides some challenges from time to time"
14856,niCe
14857,Deathclaws
14858,"Great time killer up until 50 population then becomes unplayable due to Radscorpions being massively, outrageously,  unarguably overpowered. Probably won't play again."
14859,It's a fun time-waster... Don't fall into the rabbit hole of spending WAY TOO MUCH money on it!
14860,"Pretty good game, even if you don't spend any money on it.

Pros and cons based on my own opinion.

Pros:
- Fun cartoon graphics
- Funny dialogue when there is any
- easy to manage once you get the hang of the game
- good music
- Fallout 3 and 4 references 
- good time killer
- lots of weapons to use
- seasonal themes
- also themes for each room
- seasonal quests to do

Cons:
- Can be VERY repeptative
- need more variations of armor
- can be very confusing if you don't know what you are doing
- No original Fallout music
- no bar letting you know when your ""vats"" is ready so you kinda just have to wait for it
- weird/bugged baby making... seems to always give me people who have a higher Charisma, even if i mix up the people with different stats

Overall: 9/10

Would and will keep playing for a long time and recommend for anyone who can only do something for an hour before they have to work or go to school, or just needs to kill a little bit of time."
14861,F****** slot machine
14862,I love this game but I have had my vault disappear and I worked so hard on it :(
14863,My character died with his tounge out and I cried for a fucking hour.

14871,"I Really Like This Game For Just A Tiny Bit Of Reasons

1.The Graphics
You Wouldn't Think About This Game's Graphics Being That Good . But If You Look Closely You Can See Alot Of Detail Put Into This Game . The Animatios Are Amazing Too !

2.How Fun The Game Is
You Might Not Know How Fun This Game Is ! The Missions Are intense , Food , Water , And Food Can Run Low And Can Stop Production In Your Vault . Also , Its Just Satisfying Coming Back From A Mission And Seeing All The Loot You Earned

3.Last But Not Least : All The Weapons And Coustomization Options
This Game Has Tons Of Weapons And Outfits , They Also Increase Your Dwellers Stats , And WIth The ""Barbershop"" Building , You Can Coustomize Your Own Dwellers The Way You Want To , You Can Turn Them Into Normal People To Ghouls!


"
14872,Very nice game! :)
14873,"This looks like it should be great... yet there's literally nothing to do except very rare bits of micromanaging busy-work. I feel bad saying this, since a lot of effort was clearly put into the game and the reviews are quite positive,  but I'm not even sure this thing qualifies as a game.  In almost two hours of ""gameplay"",  I have yet to encounter anything close to an interesting choice. It's like a Fallout-themed CityVille or something.  

It's free, so give it a try. The style is true to the Fallout series and, at the very least, you should be able to play it for 30 minutes and get a few laughs.  

"
14874,Crashed once and I lost all progress because it deleted my vault.
14875,"I love this game. I used to play it on mobile, but I just got a laptop for x-mas, and when I found out that Fallout Shelter was on Steam I got so excited :D"
14876,Legitimately better than fallout 4

14878,tHis is a cool game. i got this game for my fone and comptur. itz a good game

14880,good game
14881,Game values that are incorrect (Rush chance) andoverpowered  Radscorpions that dont die ruin an otherwise decent game
14882,aa
14883,this is the second vault that suddenly dissapear!!When i tried to log to my vault i got a message that i have to download agai!!!!! the game and start again from the beginning.I will never play this game again although it is good.What is the poinnt to play a game and when your vault goes well your vault dissapear and you loose all your rewards(pets rare weapons rare outfits) and you have to start fom the bigin again!!???
14884,"Fallout Shelter is one of the best click and play games I have played so far.  It really captures the humour of Fallout the actuall pc game and gives alot of extra easter eggs along the way which is appreciated.  Also it keeps things interesting throughout the game even though it is a time based game.  A few things I would Add however is family tree of your dwellers also making it interresting to see the generations of your dwellers also if there is a possibilty to provide the time or years that your fault has survived.  Adding additional resourcesor, hidden lunch boxes in rocks or adding hidden caverns where you have to fight enemies to claim the cave would make clearing rocks not just spending caps for space but adding realism and action.  Also adding extra achievements on how you buildyour fault and train your dwellers would be appreciated.  There is so much more you can add to this time twisting game however there is not alot to improve on since well its pretty awesome already."
14885,"Time wasting game that for some reason runs even when it is switched off... I save the game one day and the next day discover that the gameplay did not froze on save, but continued being played in the background, so next day I have to revive all the people that died in the meantime or... sit whole day and watch it"
14886,"Game is based on surviving in the vault, but be prepared for a long haul if you don't spend any real world money to help even the odds somewhat by buying lunchboxes and opening them up. If your an acheivement hunter, the get 20 legendary vault dwellers, will take you alot of lunchboxes .... a lot! worth a few hours of play at leaqst."
14887,"Great game, fun and interesting, for the first 20 hours, after that, you will find yourself repeating all you do and waiting for things to happen (things take actual time, say 1h, close the game and 1 hour later it's done), over and over. Veeeery repetitive in the end, BUT, since it's free and it grants a descent amount of fun time, I'd recomend it"
14888,"11/10,9 IGN"
14889,"Ah yes, simple, easy and dont requires anyhting, just sit back and enjoy - move the clock on the computer forward and you're teams have arrived, so dont bother to buy any Nuka cola's :)

14892,"This Game is Fun to play, addictive which i enjoyed a lot until i had a bluescreen while my dwellers are on quest, bang, my fault was gone, i had it twice because at first i feel okay but duck it! not the second time, i cant play my vault now (its 75% my pc fault)."
14893,VERY FUN GAME WAS RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND LOVE IT M8'S !! .....sike
14894,"Neat little side game but gets boring real fast if you don't want to pay real money for ingame boosts. 
Still better than Fallout 4 though."
14895,"Spent money on game, then game crashed and my vault disappeared.  Very frustrating."
14896,You cant run fallout so you play this.
14897,This is a fun game to play when you want to waste time. Prefect game to zone out in.
14898,"Not great, not terrible. Point and click grinder/ time waster. Follows the same old grindy routine, level up, build more, everything gets dearer, monsters get harder...waiting times can get ridiculous for quests and levelling.  I wouldn't put money into it as you can get it all for free with time and there just wasn't enough in the game to warrant laying out hard earned. It's a free game..i can't give it a thumbs down but it isn't a game i would bring up as a 'Hey try this' sort of deal. 

Too grindy..5/10 max."
14899,"It's a fun little game, easy to spend time on it, even that if you are not a paying user, there are minutes when nothing is happening. But again, you can play it for free, and you can keep it free. So if you don't have any games to play, this thing is ideal for you"
14900,"I completely enjoyed my experience of fallout shelter. It absorbed every waking thought when I had it installed on my computer. I was estastic that they ported it to pc because my phone was incompatable with it. After over 60 hours of gameplay (some offline some online) my longest running vault vanished and there were no backups on my pc or cloud for the game. 

Prior to this already well tracked problem I would have given the game a solid 8/10. maybe higher because it's free. But unfortunately, time is the most valuable asset spent in games nowadays; and fallout shelter took away hours of work I invested myself in."
14901,"As far as free to play games go, this one's pretty good. There are no time-walls that make you wait for things to finish. Admittedly there are micro-transactions, but you can go about your way not using them entirely and not notice a single difference to your experience, as far as I can see.

It's a good way to sink some hours when you can think of literally nothing else to do."
14902,"Love it, really do. Best civilization game there is. Just hate when my data disappears :/ Really depressing."
14903,Game is throttled and forces you to pay to progress and a resonable pace. Othewise you are forced to wait in most cases a day between short play sessions.
14904,"Like it, but for a single player game it is continous even when you close the game (not so great for a single player on this type of game, but do not get me wrong I do still like it).

Its a pitty that there are no mods for this game in the steam workshop."
14905,"After 31 hours of playing I lost my save. The game froze, and my laptop with it. After relaunching, I was greeted with no vault, only the possibility to create a new one. I read that this is common amongst players long ago, so I don't understand why doesn't the team do something with the problem... Disappointed..."
14906,I Bought the starter pack for $5 then the next day my vault was gone.
14907,"Game was good. Too bad my vault with 115 dwellers (a lot of them with maxed stats), 12 floors, rich and full of weapons disappeared without a trace, just to be replaced with a random vault with 14 dwellers...If you like it, remember not to spend money on it, cause it could just vanish. Not starting it all again, shame on you Bethesda!"
14908,"This is actually the most addicting game ever NOT to mention the most difficult as well! Honestly, it's totally worth it!"
14909,just bad
14910,Mobile game on the computer
14911,"good
"
14912,"Fun.
Dont spend any money,just use cheats for crates.
"
14913,Cool and I love Bethseda Softworks and Bethseda Game Studio
14914,"fun very fun
"
14915,"So. After 5 hours of playing, I became a bit addicted to it. Still a good game tho.
Anyway, after some hours, I started noticing the game forcing some random events. More and more fires, less and less dwellers, more radscorpions... Hell, even when I sent 3 people to wasteland, they come to some radroaches, shoot 4-5 bullets, then stop, take tons of demage and then again 4-5 bullets. I just guess this game tries too hard with these events. Also, nerf the freaking raiders. Raiders are the worst thing to happen, since, even when all my dwellers are fully armed they still go from room to room and noone gives a heck that there are 4-5 raiders running everywhere. Anyway, this game gets 4.2/5. Its great, but could be a bit, only a little bit easier and slower with these damm events.
P.S: Dont forget the part with wasteland."
14916,"Well, I was having a lot of fun until I reached about 47 dwellers and there was a mole rat attack. Not just a normal one though, the last two mole rats in two seperate rooms were enough to kill off MY ENTIRE VAULT?!? BETHESDA FIX THAT, CAUSE THERE IS NO WAY A DAMN RAT CAN KILL AN ENTIRE VAULT AND SEEMINGLY NOT TAKE ANY DAMAGE!"
14917,"ok, to kill some time. not much to do in general"

14919,"If I were you, I would download it for your smartphone, because if you get addicted, phone version will be always with you. You cannot merge accounts, you can however move saves between devices, which would get way too annoying everytime.

Well, this game is basically inbread simulator, a single-player pay-to-win hearthstone with quests and RNG. Naming your dwellers really weird names and reviving a 30 days dead guy, after you forget about him. Recomnened to play when you have nothing to do between other things, as you just basically wait between outputs, which brings no fun and minimal progress to the table.

14920,boring shit
14921,"[i] Fallout Shelter [/i] is a management game where the player, as an overseer, manage their underground vault where they can customise the vault's layout, its dwellers and collect/ build items such as weapons and outfits, as well as send vault dwellers exploreing, whether that be in the wastelands or on a quest. Players would also defend their vaults from intruders from oversized bugs to massive Deathclaws.

As someone whose never played a Fallout game beyond hearing bits and pieces of the setting, this game really got me hooked in and I literally spent a night just playing this. While this game might be repetitive and perhaps eventually boring, for those who like simple management games this might get one hooked in.

[h1] Concepts (out of 10): [/h1]

[b] Graphics = 9; [/b] While not as HD as the main fallout games, the cartoonish graphics that's also used is the main art style present in this game..

[b] Music = 3; [/b] Outside of quests, this game really doesn't have any music to go along with the game beyond hearing machinery being used in the vault.

[b] Cinematics = 3; [/b] Beyond introducing players to the game, there really isn't any cinematics for this game.

[b] Story = 3; [/b] Beyond quests that feature a mini story, story us practically non-existent in this game.

[b] Content = 8; [/b] With a large amount of ways one can customise their vault, the attributes of vault dwellers both physically and statistically, large variety of weapons and outfits players can collect, and the quest which feature a story of their own, this game will only be a turn-off once one gets a general idea of how the game works.

[b] Controls = 10; [/b] WASD or mouse for looking around and left clicking to interact. Really straight forward.

[b] Gameplay = 7; [/b] The main attraction to this game. As previously mentioned, players manage their vault, its dwellers and what they do. However this might get pretty boring quickly.

[h1][b] Overall = 6.1; [/b][/h1] Obviously, this game will eventually get boring as there's little action to this game. If one likes management game, however, then this game might be worth a play around for a while."
14922,"its good game but my vaults always goes low on every resource and everyone dies, the only solution to this is buying the starter pack or lunch boxes"

14926,"I regularly launch this when I have that ""I don't know what to play"" moment, like the 30th time of the day.

Been playing since it's inception on mobile devices, specifically my Nexus 7 2012 model tablet. The more my tablet updated, the less smooth it ran so when this finally came to PC I transferred the save to my computer and can now play with my 2 year old vault and it's huge. Love it.

SO GLAD they put quests and stuff. I can literally open this game, do a quest, collect my things, close it, come back to it 4 hours later, and repeat until it becomes really damn boring (which is never).

I suck at Fallout 4 so this is kind of my redemption."

14930,"I've spent months playing it on my phone, but it was pain in the butt on a small screen. Really glad I can play on laptop!"
14931,"An excellent little management game that is genuinely free. There are booster packs to purchase, but the only reasons you might want to spend money on them are :
- you're trying to raise your chances at finding legendary dwellers for the legendary dwellers achievement (good luck with that !)
- You messed up how you started your vault, and you don't want to start over, but would rather need a little help to straighten things a little bit faster
- you're starting a third or fourth vault and you want to accelerate the first phases of development which are no longer enjoyable now that you master the core concepts
- you want to have it super easy
- you're just curious to see all the different bonuses and cool items there is

To sum it up, there's nothing you can purchase that you cannot get by just playing the game. Paying for items will just increase your chances at getting interesting stuffs earlier.

The game isn't hard; it is actually rather relaxing most of the time, and rather satisfying, as long as you're not too impatient, especially in the early stages of your vault development during which there isn't so much to do.

The game looks great, it's pure retro-futuristic fallout advertisments porn. I always loved the concept of the vault boy since the first fallout: it fully embodies the falsely innocent and reassuring propaganda in a world of insane gritty violence expressed as casual and normal.

The game suffers from a couple of ui issues I think, mainly because it was built for touch screens and no effort has been made to make it more mouse friendly: you spend quite some time dragging stuffs around as you would on a touch screen, but sometimes, the game will have you drag this or that guy, when all you wanted was to slide the screen down. Nothing too annoying, although it will usually happen at the worst moment.

A couple of tips : 
- Go for the Cappy and Bottle missions as soon as they're available to you: once you've acquired Cappy and Bottle, they will provide a nice boost to your vaults
- In the beginning of the game, it's usually a better investment to augment the level of a room before expanding it, except maybe for the medbay and science lab (level increase doesn't improve storage capacity for these two). Later, when you have a lot of caps, it's less expensive to do the opposite.
- Train your dwellers' endurance as early as possible, it will make them more and more durable in combat as they level up
- Train luck second, ilt will enable you to perform more successful rushes which will increase your vaults hapiness and therefore productivity, and will raise the change of getting caps while collecting resources
- Clothes stats bonuses will add up to your dweller's stats even above 10, though the game displays stats at 10 max.
- Prioritize low level, low happiness dwellers for pregnancies. Pregnancy boosts happiness of both parents to 100%. Low level dwellers aren't very efficient when dealing with hazards and calamities. A pregnant dweller will run away, so it's no loss.
- I used to create whole rows dedicated to one activity, and found out, that althought it looks nice, it isn't a convenient design. A whole row of storage rooms looks tidy, but when a problem arises there, dwellers take more time to get to it which might lead to having said problem spreading around before they do. So it's better to have a passive type of room next to a productive one, as you will have stronger dwellers in the latter, that you can send in the neighboring rooms to deal with any problem switfly."
14932,"So been playing this for a couple of days and it's not bad.  If you have Nuka-Cola it actually feels like a game.  The difficulty can ramp up pretty fast, but that should be expected by now with Bethesda's love for lulling the players into complacency before slamming them over the head with a super sledge.  I originally thought it'd just be an idle game with the Fallout name slapped on, but it can be pretty interactive in everything you end up doing.  The worst part about it, other than the very annoying radscorpion attacks (not so bad if your vault is small) is the wait times.  You have to be very cautious with your caps while waiting on your explorer(s) to bring you more.  It can be tedious at first, as I've found out so far, but it seems like the longer you go the easier the finances become.  There will be a lot of incidents that occur, though, which can be really frustrating if you're trying to get off the game to do other things.  You can't save and exit until the crisis is over, and you can't permanently assign dwellers to rooms or exploring until things settle back down.  A nice touch, however, is that after the battle or fire or whatever ends they'll go back to their original room.

Pay attention to the occupancy limit for each room, and never, ever build your office on the top floor.  You need that space for defenders!"
14933,Glitchy asf
14934,"Is a very good and fun game

Pros-
as a fallout fan i like the idea and concept
is fun for the first few hours(i play it on PC and IOS)

Cons-
GRINDY"

Very good game but legendary dwellers are ruining fun if you are a completionist."
14938,68 vault dwellers killed in 1 fire after 23 hours game play :/
14939,Best free game out there !
14940,"It's fallout, nuff said"
14941,"Fallout Shelter is a fairly simple strategy game. The process of building up your vault and getting better gear is fun to do. After a while, the game can become a grind. Nevertheless, when i started, it really pulled me in and had me coming back every few hours to do my clicking.

One of the drawbacks is that it can be very tedious on a small screen, a smartphone for instance. Sometimes you are required to react quickly to a situation, with a small screen, it can be very frustrating when you cannot get that unit you want to move to another room selected. When I switched to playing on the PC, that problem was solved.

Its a free game with the option to buy things ingame. I never needed to buy anything, so that is nice.
Growing that perfect vault is a simply a matter of time.

The good:
+ Pulls you in
+ funny dialogue
+ Replayability

The Bad:
- Hard on devices with small screen"
14942,"SO MANY BUGS.

I have played only 4 hours and here is list of bugs i found:

1. When raiders come and two dwellers are in bed they dissapear(dwellers).
2. When i sent out one dweller to explore and then hit return while raiders come this dweller dissapear.
3. 2 dwellers with two diffrent sexes are in living quarters and dont even talk to each other ( they dont even look at each other).
4. 2 dwellers are about to make baby, suddenly they switch partners and start flirting over.


I have not played so bugged game in looong time.

14949,"This game is an amazing example of sub-games that are not part of the game plot itself, but a game that is a part of the Fallout Universe, like Fallout Brotherhood of Steel (not saying BOS is a good game, but you know what I mean). The game can sometime give you a major challenge (such ss a deathclaw invasion), and will reward you with amazing weapons and equipment (well, most of the time). This game makes you feel acomplished and proud of yourself, such as having a 100% happiness rate in your vault. 

What an amazing game!

Also lots of people are saying it's impossible to get 20 legendary dwellers for the achievement, it pretty much is, it took me around 650/700 lunchboxes to get 20 legendary dwellers (My ""Endgame"" was to get this achievement so I downloaded an autoclicker at the end of my playthrough and went through a ton to get it)"
15005,"This is the kind of game you play only for a bit every few hours, but if you want to play al ittle longer that is possible too. Some people say they force you to do microtransactions, but this is untrue. It will help you speed up things, but the game is meant to be taken slow. You need to be strategical about it or you will the price for it later on in the game. Sometimes the missions do take long to get too, but if you play every once in a bit and you organized it properly it won't affect you as much. 

If you are a fallout player who loved the game/loves the games then you will love this too. Give it a shot and decide for yourself."
15006,Great game for wasting time.
15007,"good game 10/10 gg

15008,Good time killer
15009,"Good game for wasting time. 
Edited this just to waste some more time."
15010,for a f2p this game is an absolute gem
15011,"A cool time killer. I used to log in for 5 - 10 mins when I played on Android. It starts slowly, but it's still good."
15012,Simple. fun. easy to play.
15013,this A very good game
15014,"Amazing game. This game is a classic in my book, and is a fun, strategically based game ported from mobile. You can't be a gamer if you havn't played this."
15015,it's bullshit
15016,Really god darn slow and boring. EVEN as a background game while playing other things.
15017,"like rpg's? enjoy builders? crave quests? then this little game is made for you. great on computer, but imo, shines on a mobile device, like a cell phone or tablet. great to kill a little time here and there. its Fallout... whats not to love"
15018,"Eh. I play this on my other monitor while playing Darkest Dungeon on my main monitor. I mostly consider this an 'app' rather than a game due to its gameplay which is mostly just grinding and chores.

I like its art. Derives its charm from the Fallout series. 

Perfect game to play while on awfully long loading screens. On queue for a Dota, Overwatch and other dumb MOBAs.

This 'game' is not good but you're not supposed to have high expectations for it anyways.

Solid 5/10 (if there was a button between recommend and not recommend, it would've been perfect for this)


"
15019,Very addictive game. :)
15020,"this game is really fun and to top it off its free
"
15021,jtgggj
15022,This game is boring as FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
15023,"I really enjoyed the game...for the first few hours. After that, it gets pretty repetitive, and I couldn't get back into it after my first few sittings. This game is free, so I'd only recommend it if you're really bored and have never played it."
15024,good
15025,"I'm a few days into this game and I'm really regretting spending $15 on it. After a point I felt like the only reason to make my vault bigger or get better equipment was to beat the enemies that invade your vault. On paper that sounds like something I'd enjoy but the fights aren't fun, the quests are tedious, and I really dislike waiting hours to finish those quests. If you like games like clash of clans this might be worth a look but I can't wholeheartedly reccomend it."
15026,"Can't see what people found great about this game.  In reality, it's poorly put together and a P2W tragedy.  After starting numerous games and playing each for hours, I've learned the 1 thing anyone interested in this game needs to know.  Your success in this game is solely based on the luck of the draw.  Really, what keeps you thriving is the luck you get when opening their lunch box thingies.  I've started the game (they give you 3 of these lunch boxes pretty much near the beginning after doing just a few quests) and have gotten rare vault dwellers, good armor, and nice weapons...and other times I've opened all of them and not gotten jack.  I tried a play through where I got absolutely nothing and it wasn't just bad--it was horrible.  I sent the one character out that had a weapon and after about an hour they finally found something in the wasteland (and this is me an hour at the keyboard, waiting while doing pretty much not much in the vault.  When you aren't waiting around for the cooldown of your resources or a vault dweller to either find a weapon or return, you're putting out some random ridiculous vault encounter, such as radroaches mysteriously cropping up out of the ground from burrows.  I don't know who thought this concept up, but it was pretty bad.  I love the Fallout series too, but all I give this is a thumbs down, down, down.
In short...
PROS - decent system of building, easy game play, decent tutorial.
CONS - (everything)  This game is 99.9% P2W.  You could spend all your money on lunchboxes and get beefy enough not to have to worry about anything.  Other than that, you're waiting hours for your vault dwellers to find stuff in the wasteland, praying you get lucky to get a sub-par gun (you only find the good stuff from lunchboxes).  The controls are clunky and will often times get you angry at their poor design.  One time I was trying to click on a mysterious man, only to realize that the resources of that room were up and I had to click that first and then the mysterious man.  he had vanished by then.  There is just so much bad about this game.  Don't buy if you are easily frustrated!"
15027,"Not a good game. It works, but that's no excuse. Good for when you need to pass time waiting for a real game to download. Like Fallout: New Vegas."
15028,good shit
15029,"Great game!  Can be played on many platforms.  Great time burner, addictive and easy to understand.  Doesn't require interenet to play on phone which I LOVE!  Makes it a fun game to play while traveling."
15030,"Let's Start with the things i like about this game:
- good management system
- nice customisability
- kind of addicting

What i don't like:
- bugged gameplay elements everywhere
- Bad object interaction (picking up a dweller from the background area of a room for example)
- VERY slow progression (mostly so you buy their overpriced Nuka-Cola or Lunchboxes)
- Save files can dissapear and all your real money is gone, so just don't bother to put any money in this game if you don't backup every day."
15031,This game is the game to play if you have nothing to do all day. Its easy to waste hours
15032,pretty fun game.
15033,"Fun and addicting, good for when I just want something to relax and play."
15034,it is asome love the fat man wepon so good.
15035,the people are retarded when it comes to battle but still fun
15036,This game is addicting and I love it.

15038,"Guide for a Successful Run:

1. Make a Vault 666 [x]
2. Set the game on survival [x]
3. Play for over an hour on survival [x]
4. Rush the rooms, even if the success rate has lower % than you ever got on your exam [x]
5. Die, not because of too many raider attacks/ radroaches/ molerats/ deathclaws infestations,
but because of a god damn starvation [x]
6. From all that has happened, you decide you had enough for one day [x]

If you followed these 6 simple steps,
then my friend, you pretty much went through Hell.

Good Job!"
15039,"Nice relaxing and complex game, a must have for any Fallout fans :)"
15040,"This is a very fun and interesting game!
It's really cool how you can build your own ""vault"" and see how it expands over time,
and how you and your people deal with the trouble/challenges that you get throughout the play!
I especially like their achievement, because they are not too hard and not too easy to unlock!

This game has a very nice art-style,
the graphics and models/object are just so perfect made.
Even if It's a ""free to play"" game I still would suggest you to play it and give it a shot!"
15041,its FUN

15045,"Got right around 60 hours in it on Steam. I've been playing it on mobile since it's beginnings. I love this game.  
Pop in, micro manage dweller's activities, check on dweller(s) in the wasteland, do quest missions, pop off and continue your day/end your night without having to ensure you have a large chunk of time free to game with.

If you want a game you can play anywhere from 5-30 minutes at a time (depending on level and dweller amount) or sitting and waiting on someone/somrthing, this is it. 

It cost nothing and the 200 dweller cap and success in game is very possible without spending a dime."
15046,it is a really fun game
15047,Excellent free to play game that is easy to learn and a great time killer.
15048,"fun, and better played on a your pc than on your phone. Very chill and mellow game."
15049,"Have you ever wanted to raise a toddler through the worst aspects of parenting? These can include things such as the child crying, having self destructive tendancies, inability to think for itself as well as having to clean up its messes, dress it, feed it, and make sure it is happy while sacrificing your personal time with friends, family and sleep just to keep up with it, and that is not to mention all the things to buy to make the experience a bit more tollerable. 

However, usually with a child, you bond with it both physically and emotionally, and eventually it becomes self sustainable, able to feed and dress itself as well as clean up its own messes. This game is the above listed worst aspects of raising a child without the benefit of emotional or physical bonding nor the prospect of ever becoming self sustainable.

I played this game quite close to its release date on my mobile device. I played for about a week or so, growing my vault until I had a good population size and everything was going fine. Then a routine fire broke out and killed everyone. There were 6 people in the area where the fire started, the maximum amount of people for a room, none were pregnant, and none of them survived despite the use of stimpacks. The fire spread and killed my entire vault. So I uninstalled it. 

I played this game for about a week, took my time with it, got all of my vault dwellers good gear and good levels, and molerat broodmothers invaded a room with 6 people in it, no pregos, and killed them all. They then infested my entire vault and they all died. This happened in the span of 3 minutes I was AFK to grab a drink. All it took was 3 minutes to destroy a weeks worth of work. 

If you enjoy that kind of challenge, one that runs on a real time clock and never relents, then yes, play this game, it does not get easier the farther you go. If you are like my and can't stand Dark Souls level games, don't bother with this one, the mechanics are oriented around pay to win and from what I have read in other reviews, paying makes no difference in ease of gameplay. 

Don't get me wrong, I do like the concept of the game and the sim quality it has, I just wish it was redesigned for steam to be more playable."
15050,"Nice game, you'll have to grind the first few levels up to 50 dwellers.
Dont upgrade and grow your vault right away before getting better equipment and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. s for your dwellers or you're gonna get raided a lot by monsters and your vault might collapse into game over.
The difficultty scales as vault dwellers increase.
Dont hesitate to kick bad dwellers from your vault.
Level up ENDURANCE and get your dweller some equipment that gives endurance before leveling him/her. that'll give more HP points to the dweller.
Recommended."
15051,very very fun game
15052,"It's an ok game. The early game is really good but it kinda goes downhill from there. it gets to where its difficult to even select the right person to drag and drop them to a new room to put out fires and such. As you go on it starts to feel more pay2win with lootboxes or else face a long grind to get the ""legendary"" rated things, unless you just cheat and give yourself items and dwellers and things - and at that point why play if you are gonna do that right?

So I'm giving this a yes because I *did* have 12hrs+ of fun with it, but now I am bored with it."
15053,NICE GAME
15054,Good pass time game.
15055,"I played this game for a while on moblie,it is very fun.I just started on steam it is real good,ypu know real good."
15056,"I spend almost 80 hours on this game.
It's pretty much the old tamagotchi in a new format.
You need to spend at least 1h or so per day (3 vaults) to make sure everything goes well, your dwellers stats are being trained, people are sent out to explore etc.
It starts out fun, but after a while it becomes tedious and repeditive, and I felt forced to log in and do my chores.

After a while you learn how to arrange rooms correctly, but then it's to late and you can't change it anymore, which sucks.

But the biggest annoyance is that after some progress, every time you open a vault it gets raided by Deathclaws and you can't do anything other then just heal your people. You have to wait until it's over to go on and do the rest of the stuff. You can never watch a youtube video/twitch or walk away while a vault is open, or you run into the risk that your vault is getting raided and everybody killed.

Not sure whether or not to recomend it, since i did have some fun at first, but i feel like the time is spend better on another game."
15057,<3
15058,"a good time waster, fun if you enjoy the bustle of whoring out the majority of your female dwellers to increase vault pop."
15059,"It is not a bad game. It is good for transition period to real life after the latest Fallout game has left a hole in your soul and you need to fill it with something. The visual and audio part of the game is perfect and, as it was already said, it is not a bad game. It‚Äôs just not for everyone. 

Why would not I recommend it? 

It is a time-stealer. As much as the game is beautiful there‚Äôs no ‚Äúhigher purpose‚Äù ‚Äì no engaging story or anything like it. You just do routine tasks: build>collect resources>random small/daily quests>defend the shelter from attacks>repeat the cycle. The game just becomes boring after some time and you are left with the dreadful feeling of guilt over all that time that was wasted on nothing. Meanwhile the game keeps sending you reminders to collect collect collect. As stated ‚Äì this kind of ""cycle-like"" experience is not for everyone. 

Another con ‚Äì it does not sync with mobile and there are plenty of better ""fallout-nostalgia"" options for PC gaming (like older fallout games)."
15060,"Get Oxygen Not Included instead !

Fallout shelter is just a game where ressources are generated constantly (even when the game is not running) and you got to collect them to keep your vault alive.
There is absolutly no challenge in this game. Combats are boring. Infinite ressources so no stress at all
The only thing you can do is to send your dwellers outside to perform quest so they bring craft ressources back. with these ressources you can craft ""better"" weapons but it is useless because fights will remain as boring as before."
15061,Trash
15062,"yeah, just get the mobile version"
15063,One of the greatest games created from the Fallout franchise. Keep it up Bethesda.
15064,love this game. i love it so much it has me wishing for a full scale game from bethsda using the fallout 4 settlement building style. the steam version has controller support witch it nice and i really love that its there even though i dont always use it. its nice to have. the only thing is if you played this on your phone your data isnt going to sync to the steam version
15065,"This game is a time stealer.  If you have like 2 minutes to check the game since it runs constantly. As soon as you get on it starts bogging you down with maintenance.  Then there's an immediate attack, followed by tons more maintenance then not enough money to fix everything that broke while you were gone.  There's tons of unhappiness that has to be raised.  Fifteen or twenty minutes later you've finally got everything under control but you only had 2 minutes and now you have to rush off to take care of business other than the game.  When you finally get an hour to log in you spend another twenty minutes of maintenence before you can do anything with the quests and it gets tedious after a while.   There isn't enough adventure.  Too much waiting.  Too much of the game trying to beg you to spend your hard earned money on ridiculous perks in the game that you lose in a few minutes.  I've played and quit and played and quit this game 5 times now and this time I'm not going to play it again.  Bye Bye!"
15066,Only slightly less addicting than crack.
15067,"fallout shelter is a free, post apocalyptic, strategy game. if your one of those gamers who do not game often but still game, this is perfect. graphics r beautiful. the stories r consistent. i love the call backs to the other fallout games. highly recommend it!"
15068,Its definitely the game ive ever played. 10/10 smecks
15069,Money Grab.Not reccomended at all.
15070,"If you can only have 200 people in your place, the women should stop getting prego too after 200 are in the house/bunker."
15071,I hate that I like this game.
15072,"As a F2P game it's a very fun experience as while it does have in game purchases it they aren't anything you need to do well in the game and can be earned without spending money. Overall an enjoyable experience... That would be the end of the review if it weren't for one HUGE problem. I had to start over, FROM SCRATCH, not once but TWICE! This because when ever the game was closed via a method other than hitting the exit button in game wether it be your computer losing power or just reseting for some unexplained reason the game will delete your vault. As you can imagine this can be very disheartening when it happens for the second time after 75 hours of in game playtime. The first time it had happened I had spent 3-4 days IRL building up my vault and the second time I had just spent a little over a week. This is an issue that I hope the eventually fix as it is otherwise a perfectly fine F2P game. So if your looking for a fun way to kill some time than yeah this should keep you busy for a while. As for me it'll be a while before I'm willing to take another whack at it with what will be my third vault..."
15073,gud gaem yes
15074,"Radscorpions make the game not enjoyable and I don't want to play it because of them. A radscorpion spawning in a level 3 3 length room seems to have hundreds of hitpoints while sucking 2,000 power. Three deathclaws die faster than one radscorpion, don't make dwellers need radaway and don't drain resources: they're ridiculously unbalanced."
15075,nerf radroaches plz
15076,"To survive the wasteland, you need money, real life money.
Or grind like you have never grinded before"
15077,Very fun and exciting Game to pass time by
15078,"Awesome game. Getting this game as a F2P game is blessing. Good graphics, funny and enjoyable gameplay. Highly recommended this game."
15079,If you like to manage things and keep things going good this a game for you. it has alot to offer in game play.
15080,I find this game to be stupidly addicting.   I love the Fallout universe and this game is a nice way to get my fix when I am not at home.
15081,Great fun game! Can play this all day!
15082,The game is good and does not require money to progress but if you really want to get the most out of it just put 5 bucks into some lunch boxes when you have some extra money and you will definitly get the most out of it.
15083,"I enjoy this game, but it's not for everyone. For me, it's a game you open a few times a day for 10/15 mins to play. The game runs while closed, so I go in and set everything up and come back a few times throughout the day. It takes a while before you have much to play with, but like I said, I set it up and let it run."
15084,"i love this game so much its soooooo fun to play
i recommend this game

"
15085,A good game to pass some times when bored
15086,"It's free to play. People who down vote, thumbs down or rate free to play games poorly are the worst kind of people. Get over yourself. 

It's fun. It's free. Go fly a kite."
15087,"Somehow this game makes me feel like I am wasting my time doing.. what exactly?

If you start out with a good setup there's not much of a challenge. I have read about dying dwellers or lack of caps in other reviews, but I haven't had those problems and did not pay for anything. 

It doesn't feel satisfactory to keep doing the same things over and over again. Get more dwellers, they need more water and food hence you expand or upgrade, which asks for more energy hence you expand or upgrade.. explore the wasteland, bring back some loot, explore again. Craft better weapons, level up, kill some rad scorpions and put out some fires. And again. And again.

To unlock rooms or certain upgrades you have to have a minimum of X dwellers. To me, it would be more challenging to see how you could cope with as few dwellers as possible (seems way more efficient than having lots of dwellers). You would have to think more, plan ahead, train certain dwellers a certain way. 
Now, it feels like I'm mostly  just clicking and dragging. Need more dwellers? Just get the women pregnant. (Their childern will be pretty stupid, no matter how skilled their parents are, but even that doesn't really make a difference when your vault is running well.) 

The 'fights' are too simplistic for my taste: when on a quest you run into a room and just wait until you have won. Sometimes restore the health of a dweller during the fight. You click on some boxes to get loot, go into the next room, same thing until the quest is completed. I do like that sometimes you can have a conversion with your enemies where it seems your answer matters (you either get to fight or allowed passage depending on your answer) and the enemies do get stronger, but you get stronger as well so again, not much of a challenge.

I guess it's just really not my kind of game. I tried to like it and I get the addictive part of the game, but after playing it I feel like I could have done something better with my time. Anything really."
15088,"Inexplicably still features a bug where if your PC freezes or loses power mid-game, you lose ALL your saved progress."
15089,"This game is okay. 8/10 from me. I think it can be better.

When i download this game and start playing, molerat attacks on level 3 rooms make me angry very often. In 1 attack i lost 11 of 39 dwellers. Feral ghoul attacks can be bad news too. But i think i solve that problem. [spoiler] Maybe im rookie, i dont know, but this problem is easy to solve. First, when i armed all dwellers they rarily get killed. Second, uniforms helps too. And third, i constantly train my dwellers. [/spoiler] . I hope this will help other players"
15090,provides more player choice and better dialogue than fallout 4 ever could l m a o
15091,at first the game was awesome but the roach problem needs to fixed ffs
15092,it is a good game wen you go up to a serint poiant is sucks like bolls
15093,"Good game overall, nothing special to it but definitely a great time killer for those days where you don't have WiFi.
You have to be on top of it though otherwise your shelter will fall behind"
15094,"More fun on mobile, still a solid port on PC."
15095,i love dis game total dweller count of 101
15096,"I'm a fallout junkie and I love this little game to take a break from playing fallout 4,as well as all the other games I play regularly. Loads of fun for a few minutes of gameplay."
15097,"Thou i am only 4+ hours in the game, i did play it a while back when it came out for Android. I was surprised with some new features implemented, which i did not manage to see in my first try (I deleted it given the poor performance of my cellphone by that time). I have to say, the quest are a nice addition to a already good and casual game. Problem with this being in PC, is that you have to wait a lot (i guess given the model of those ""wait-or-pay"" games for mobile phones). So don't expect anything thrill and fast-paced like the main Fallout games. But i would recommend it if you are fan of these amazing games. It is a time-burner, and i bet further deep in the game things will become more enjoyable.

ADVICE: Don't underestimate the QUEST level requirements, casue these little interactive scavanger/exploring quest are though, and your best bet is numbers (Dwellers and Stimpacks/Radaways)."
15098,Too addictive.

15107,"Boy let me tell you the story of how I banged your mother, sister, grandma and all the hoes in the vault with one simple trick.

Pretty much The Sims but with some survival in it."
15108,"I remember downloading the mobile version of the game back when it came out in 2015 (or maybe 2016, I don't remember) and after 1 day all my dwellers were dying. I uninstalled it soon after. Fast forward to today, and I now understand how the game works. It's a fun game, kind of silly at times, but it's free, and offers a good sense of accomplishment when you complete quests or objectives."
15109,"Are you like me and like to play a game in a quick spurt now and then?
Do you like coming back to something you built that grinded a bunch of resources and levels?

Do you like Fallout?

If you answered 2/3 to these...download this game now. It's free. Just don't pay-to-play scrub.

Enjoy growing the shelter"
15113,A guy in a Clergy Outfit bangs all the girls in the shelter. 10/10
15114,Alright to play casually.
15115,"IMPORTANT - I'd recommend it if I didn't lose my damn vault. There's some weird stupid problem where you randomly lose your vault meaning.... everything you just did is lost your vault won't be there it just don't exist... They need to fix it and reupdate so it don't happen to others. Keep in mind i had 93 Dwellers and now it's gone, about a week ago my brother lost his 43 dweller vault. The reason I'm complaining is to warn others and let Bethseda Games know about this issue."
15116,"A bit of simple fun. A good time waster if you like collecting stuff, expanding your vault and going on occasional quests. 

It's free but I felt it worth getting the one-time starter pack since I'd played for a number of hours and was enjoying it.

A few tips:
- When you can send people out to the wasteland leave them out for a while, it seems to take time before you start getting items.
- Make sure you have nuka cola quantum if possible to avoid long waits for getting to quest areas and coming back from them. That said, once your vault has enough people in it to keep going while people are away questing it can be good to send people off to pick up weapons, schematics and other gear.
- Try to send people who are higher level then what the quest needs and ideally send a party of 3 with as much stim packs and rad away as possible (click the max button for each as due to a bug the items won't be available in the quest if you add the items one by one). Rad away is sometimes useful, but you'll usually need one or more stim packs."
15117,"A moddable, PC, 3-dimensional, more fully fleshed out version of this game would be nice, but for now we just have a port of a mobile game that works on pc. Everything is so hard to get, and you spend 2 weeks of the beginning of the game just trying to have not all your dwellers die. I have played this a lot on mobile and it is also infuriating how I cannot ""selectively breed"" my dwellers. When I breed 2 amazing dwellers with pretty nice stats, I don't expect a crappy kid. 

Amazing idea, good execution, mundane gameplay. After a month on my phone I rarely play it because the novelty kind of wore off. I'm not saying don't get it, it's free, why wouldn't you? But could be better."
15118,this game is good i can spent a lot of life to play this game
15119,Fun game for when you want to just chill and make a dope shelter
15120,Love this!  I share this account with my brothers and we all love it!  Our dad  says he has been a fan ouf the series since he first played Fallout 2 and he likes this game too!  Fun for all ages.
15121,"Its super hard. I barely have any food or water so my 18 dwellers are doomed.
Recommend using save editors. No download or anything really. Just find one and edit it, find a tutorial or something if you dont know how to use it.

No this account is not a bot that tries to make people destory there PC's. I am a human being from the UK."

15123,"I've played this on both mobile and desktop. It's fun at first, but after a while it becomes a chore. The novelty lasted significantly longer on mobile."
15124,"it's a great game to play during free time because you just sit there waiting for something to happen, overall a great game to have"
15125,"This game took up so much of my life, running the vault, doing quests, fighting off mole rats, arranging love triangles, fighting off more mole rats, building weapons, and fighting off rad scorpions. Avoid the in-game purchases and it's well worth it"
15126,"Like the game ... fun little side game while I am working on other things. However, played for a little while, closed it down and now it will not come back up. Stating that it cannot ""could not switch resolution"". This is a poor showing from a company I truly like, as they have consistantly produced super high level and entertaining games.
After researching this, it appears that it is very wide spread, and no one really knows any answer to it.
I will recommend the game only because I have faith in Bethesda to fix this issue ... as it is a fun side game."
15127,"Maybe the developers of [b]Fallout Shelter[/b] became so much intense playing the Fallout Franchise with the recently released [b]Fallout 4.[/b] Well, this game is a very good option when taking a break with other serious games.

Why is it fun?

[*]You get to manage your own vault! Considering the placement of rooms.
[*]You can customize your dwellers with weapons and clothes, name them, and make babies by joining them in one room!
[*]Unlike other simulations, you can go to the wasteland and have an adveture!

I highly recommend this game as it will become addicting the more you play!

15128,"really really fun game allot of content. there are a few downsides thou. caps are so hard to get i have a dweller going out for about 2 days now and its only got 2000 caps and its luck is maxed 

but i recommend this game to anyone"
15129,Great game to play while im doing homework!
15130,"One of the best mobile games that I played so far. I recommend it to everyone, especially if you're familair with Falllout series. I like the fact that no one bothers you with in game purchases and advertisements, that I used to see in free to play games. The game somewhat rewards you for not playing it all the time, which is also a good thing, as you don't need to spend too much time on it. As well, I played this game on a PC and it is just as wonderful."
15131,"Simple, yet addictive fun. No need to spend a dime. Extremely entertaining casual game."
15132,really enjoyable game for wasting your time
15133,"Good casual fun, yet also appealing to the hardcore Fallout fan"
15134,THIS GAME IS GOOD ALL IN ALL BUT I WANT TO OPEN MY VAULT!!!!! I WAS JUST OPENING MY LUNCH BOXES WHEN MY PC LAGGED AND FORCED IT TO RESTART. I OPEN THE GAME AFTER AND MY VAULT IS MISSING AND CANT OPEN IT. I DONT USE ANY CHEATS OR ANYTHING SO I SHOULD NOT GET BANNED RIGHT? PLEASE GIMME BACK MY VAULT
15135,nice gan
15136,Idk why ppl dont like this game
15137,"It can be good. The controls are worse than clunky, especially at the exact wrong times. Where is the increased hit points per level up, which leads to survivability? I've spent alot of money on this classic RPG franchise over 2 decades. Not leaning toward spending any money on this one. The game devs and code monkeys of this are fiends. They should be beaten with dirty keyboards and forced everyday to stare at naked pictures of Don Rickles! No offense to Mr. Rickles."

15139,what a great game. to bad the shit company that runs this always allows the saves to never save & you have to start again. 4th save now.log in & no vault.restart. piece of shit
15140,"Made a vault and instantly got fucked up by rats, then raiders and due to the lack of dwellers because they either died or I accidentally made them all brothers and sisters and cant make more babies cos of inbreeding, my vault perished.

RIP Vault 16 

10/10 game would get raided again"
15141,"Clever concept and cutesie graphics to draw you in.  Unfortunately very high frustration factor due to horrific programming issues and poorly thought out game elements.   Game is very enjoyable at first but quickly becomes tedious and repetative but worst of it is the constant, repetative and utterly pointless mouse clicking.   If you don't have carpal tunnel you will after playing Fallout Shelter for any length of time and for no other reason than nobody at Bethesda likely played the game for any lenght of time and saw the glaring problems."
15142,meh too hard
15143,no
15144,"this game is very fun and has alot of content for being free, when i started i couldent stop its very addicting."
15145,"1. GAMEPLAY
Quite enjoyable gameplay (6/10) - especially at the beginning, when you need to discover the game potential. I like to manage my base, relocate dwellers, train them or send on quests, read about their abilities and item descriptions, looking at the room gear animations, planning further rooms and their usage, cloth my people in manner that indicates my strategy (e.g. everyone are suited as soldiers or warriors, the most experienced units got Officers Uniforms) or that complies with room specification/outfit.

CONS: Game start to be monotonous very quickly, because of lack of rooms and its customization. Gameplay is based on real (I mean: REAL REAL TIME) time events, so you need to spend a lot of time waiting for finishing training, traveling to the quest destination or completing current task. If you don't want to cheat (e.g. by looking for Fallout Shelter Editor or manipulate on preferences of your local system time), and you don't like the idea of micropayments suited in the game, you must be prepared to play regularly for a couple of minutes once a day for weeks, to gain measurable results of your progress, and not to waste your life on observing how the clock pointer is ticking. :)

CONS: Base rushes: from outside or inside can be painful, especially when you have unexperienced dwellers or when you are attacked by radscorpions! :) But they variance are countable, and the level of opponents are not challenging after a couple of days you have played and after boosting your dwellers on training rooms.

CONS: armors and outfits do nothing (or this is not visible) except changing dwellers looks. When you boost a dwellers ability to 10 (maximum), wearing an outfit that increases that ability to 15 or 17 does nothing. Moreover, suits do not protect you from enemy damages, radiation or environment dangers (e.g. during a fire).

2. GRAPHIC
Warm and sympathetically graphics (6/10), which reminds me of Pip-Boy icons from Fallout 1 / Fallout 2. But it is not very... time-consuming, precise and well made. I mean: it's ok, but for Casual Games quality flash technology standards. :)

3. MUSIC
Music is almost unnoticeable, not impressing and average (4/10).

4. OTHER
Very smart move with implementing lunchboxes, pet boxes and starter boxes, from where you get randomized items. This is, probably, the most enjoyable element of the gameplay: clicking on cards and waiting for what will be dropped from the box this time. But this is not recompensating the game monotonous - just a little pros for the game retention. ;)"
15146,AWESOME GAME!
15147,A quest where someone is hunting red head and calling them ginger with no soul. Just one of the many serious quests you investigate!
15148,Love the game it feeds the need!  Cons: The way it doles out some parts of the game just dosent work....Legendary Dwellers for instance.  I have opened a million Lunchboxes it seems and only received two..seems random-ish...but broken....who knows..  Oh didnt regester all my recipes and weapons so i have gaps i cant fill in those lists as well...4 OUT OF 5
15149,Great as a time killer if you enjoyed the fallout games.
15150,"First got it from Win store but decided to delete and catalog it with my steam games. So. Here I am starting over.... All while addicted... Yet again lmao.

1] Needs a family tree chart.

2] There should be more advancement in the dealing with a vault crisis department.
like being able to set characters to swap out of a room at a certain health level with anyone who isn't at or below the level set that's hopefully also armed. or whatever you set it to.

3] There's no indicator on when fault crisis will get real af. Springing deathclaw and seemingly undying moles or mutants without warning is just a kick in the crown jewels. 9 times out of 10 if you are a new player you will get PWNED, at least for the first 5 visits from these life changing visits or until you google what the fck just happened and how to not to let it happen again.

4]In the beginning of starting tell folks about the god send detective dude that gives you caps.

5]I know this is a mobile game but it has so much potential to be a legit game. One I'd love to see made. Like fallout sims except far less boring than sims.

This game 15/10"
15151,"Very fun, It's a pretty basic tycoon. I do recommend it!!"
15152,"*music starts playing*

Me: DAIIIISSYYYYY *NUTS*"
15153,"This game is great and everyone should definantly try it out lol. 

P.S. if their is one thing I would recomend to the devs is maybe add a more in depth combat system and maybe a world map."
15154,uhhh idk
15155,This game has a single purpose: to teach the player whether they really have impulse control or not.
15156,Before few weeks i buy Fallout New Vegas and game is great. This is alsow great game.
15157,good at the start but gets boring after you get all the rooms
15158,"I enjoy Fallout Shelter a lot. Being a Fallout fan in general, I love the art style, the activities and game itself has become a lot better since the addition of the quests. Recommend as a good time waster."
15159,"F2P and Fallout.





Very nice!"
15160,good graphics good game too but one problem we need more stuff
15161,"Highly addictive,  though it's so difficult to recover once your water goes in the red XD"
15162,"This game is boring as fuck.  It seems to be primarily composed of watching timers countdown.  Shit, I could be watching paint dry."
15163,"Amazing Game! Good Port! However, I am able to play the game on much lower specs than the minimum requirements, So i think you should lower the requirements! Thanks!"
15164,"I do NOT reccommend the game. It was okay once I had finally figured out that I expanded to soon but the majority of my dwellers had died. Was able to run it for a short time but no new dwellers showed up due to the fact I didnt have enough dwellers to build a radio room. Figured now that I know where I went wrong I would just start a new vault. WRONG. Tried to delete/uninstall the game and re-install it. Got the same vault I had failed in. No reason now to keep playing. So I dont reccomend the game.

Aug 2020 now, In all fairness I do need to revise this review. I initially gave it a thumbs down because I could not find how to start a new vault. That really is very simple now if you just use the settings gear on screen. After starting a new game I would have to say that this is really a pretty decent game. Beings that it was free to boot. This game is well worth the time to try it out."
15165,Bad
15166,"my fallout shelter game has dissappeared!  everytime i try to play it i get a blank, black screen.  i was just getting ready to perfect my shelter!!"
15167,It's a cute little time killer.
15168,its a very fun and detailed game i reccomend it.
15169,"Such a great game, I've had it for two days and I'm already addicted :)"
15170,"Its fun.
"
15171,"Fun game, it runs on perfect on a laptop."
15172,"Normal mode: you are powerful and it's super boring
Survival mode 1st time:  Fully equiped but a raider attack and kill all of my vault (18 dwellers). Seriously?
Survival mode 2nd time: Fully equiped again, resource nearly full, 20 stimpack but a room fire kill all of my dwellers, wth :V
One mode is ridiculous super easy and the other on is ridiculous super hard, really Bethesda, you are making me dissapoint again! 
"
15173,its pretty fuckin good
15174,"If you are bug lovers, then grab this game. You'll be amazed. Promise."
15175,"I can go on 9gag or youtube or whatever while playing this game (game in windowed mode) :D

3/12/2019, this is apparently better than the dumpster fire known as fallout 76, also, use a savefile editor on this for the lols, because

IT. JUST. WORKS."
15176,"Cool game, funny art aswell, 2D, will make you play it for days if you like this type of games.

Recommended."
15177,Simple and addictive
15178,This dweller who porked 100 times. F$#king legend.
15179,Good
15180,I save my fallout shelter and it got deleted the Vault number was 138. why does this happen almost every thre moths to me
15181,good game
15182,"I was unprepared the first time and died by mole rats because I didn't equip my weak dwellers >,>
I was mad and upset and deleted the game immediately haha.

But then I missed it, and I went back to it and for some reason, my 2nd try was brilliant. So at the end of the day, it's an awesome game.

Good enough to motivate me to get up ^^"""
15183,Why??
15184,"Fallout shelter this game I do recommend it is fun and always brings me back and if you see I haven't played a whole lot that's because I play it on my phone. By the way it's a whole lot better on the PC. I loved this game, recommend it cause it's free"
15185,very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good game
15186,"It should probably just stay mobile,

2/10"

Very fun and addicting game."
15188,stava
15189,good
15190,"So much entertained!!
I really like this game.. is a must for everyone who love Fallaout serie's!
(nuka colas are a bit expensive, look's like kind of a gold bath bottles)
GOOD GAME to spend some time between round's in many games."
15191,"I will only recommend this game if you are not going for Perfect Games Achievements, as it is impossible to complete the achievements even you pumped lots of money. 

Nothing much you can ask for, for a f2p game with hours of entertainment."
15192,"It's a fun game really, You can get really into it just by playing it for an hour, and instantly... BOOM! You're adicted. Although, there are times when your whole shelter will just go through a massive shutdown (which sucks) but it gives an opportunity to come back! 5 stars!"
15193,"Has 3 fully merged and upgraded Diners to produce food, where the hell did this shortage come from"
15194,good but not good as the mobile game as
15195,nice game and addictive one
15196,"I BOUGHT THE STARTER PACK BUT IT DIDNT GIVE ME ANYTHING
"
15197,Fun but repeative
15198,It's a good free game but becomes very boring and frustrating after a week or so. The enemies become too hard and you're continously attacked to the point where you can't defend yourself and end up losing alot of dwellers.
15199,amazing indoubetebly
15200,lots of fun to play
15201,"Simple, Fun"
15202,nice game
15203,"It's a fairly standard free-to-play tycooning game, but it's the Fallout universe. It's like a themed Monopoly: pretty well the same game with some modified rules. That doesn't make it any less fun.

I logged countless hours on the iOS version, but had to uninstall to make room on my phone. I missed it, but was a bit skeptical about the PC version. Plays quite nicely and I don't miss the touch controls at all.

If you're a fan of Fallout, this is a nice game to have running in the background."
15204,Good game could update more and add more but other wise a realy good game and could run on any compter
15205,"As a fan of the Fallout series, I find this is a fun and addictive addition.  Catchy graphics, period sound effects and easy-to-learn gameplay."
15206,Nice!!!
15207,"First time open the cool box, or whatever it says, i got some good Legendary clothes for my people"
15208,"Freemium is not Premium!


10/10 would unistall again"
15209,"Surprisingly addictive considering how little there is to it. It is a mobile game, complete with timers and micro-transactions but they are not as annoying here. You do some micro-managing then leave and check back in an hour. I found myself getting into it, especially exploring the wasteland and scavaging for junk i needed to build weapons and outfits and i loved maxing out my dwellers' stats and watching my vault get bigger and bigger.

I got bored with it eventually, but it was fun while it lasted. I guess if you like Fallout and are looking for a 'good' mobile game try it out. 



"
15210,"I enjoy this game, but it's not for everyone. For me, it's a game you open a few times a day for 10/15 mins to play. The game runs while closed, so I go in and set everything up and come back a few times throughout the day. It takes a while before you have much to play with, but like I said, I set it up and let it run."
15211,"suddenly your vault disappear ! yay ! if you spent money on this game,it mean you are fucked.such a poorly build game"
15212,the game is pretty fun & simple :)
15213,Too addictive
15214,"Two words are all I need say in order to justify giving this a negative review.

Molerat invasions.

Yes, I understand the ""avoid dirt"" and ""upgraded/bigger rooms spawn upgraded/more enemies"".

However, the game encourages you to build and upgrade and expand, then punishes you for it. I should not have to play the game in unintuitive ways to avoid game breaking bugs. I should not be forced to revive 75% of my shelter due to ONE molerat overcoming the remaining defenses in the room he spawned in. I should not have 12 bodies in the same room, with one single molerat laughing over their corpses as it initiates waves of spawns in neighboring rooms and  promptly vanishes after dispatching everyone that SHOULD have stood a chance.

I shouldn't have to talk about ""standing a chance"" in battles against molerats. There is no reason for this sort of player punishment. Every other enemy/encounter is manageable, molerats require you to CHANGE THE ENTIRE WAY YOU PLAY THIS GAME just to avoid their BS.

Strategies that work for avoiding molerat pwnage.

Build a jumbled mess of single, unupgraded rooms.

Surround your vault with elevators to avoid any spawning rooms touching dirt.

When a mole rat invasion occurs, do not fight, instead, run away and then run through said invasion to the safety of previously invaded rooms, let molerat death waves wash over vault.

NEVER USE RUSH.

Seriously, *STRONG EXPLETIVE* WHOEVER ""BALANCED"" THESE RATS!!!"
15215,"This game is fun to play. But..... It get dull from time to time. Having to wait for new people to come in or having to wait for your peps to search out the waste land for gear then come back.
The one REALLY BAD thing is. If you buy stuff for your game it doesn't carry over to a new game. Meaning, you make a vault play for a lil while. Then you deside to buy extra game stuff with REAL money. Well, If you deside to say, :I don't like the way this vault is goin. So I am going to start over."" The stuff you bought with your hard earned money, doesn't carry over to the new vault. So what I am tring to say is, DON""T spen real money on the game."
15216,vault gaming
15217,"After 85 hours and $60 worth of card purchases I had a windows crash and when I came back my vault was totally wiped out from memory and the game wants me to start from scratch???? I will not play another game with microtransactions and i think this is the last Bethesda game for me. This was the worst. No reason for this stupidity, 85 hours of gameplay wiped. Ridiculous. Do not waste your time and money on this!"
15218,fun addictive game!!!! good job
15219,"I get bored fast, but I like the game"
15220,So much fun! Not tedious like some other games. ::sims::
15221,Its a good time waster....well.... until you need to wait the next day in order to do something fun (its ok)
15222,Great way to burn the time. Fun for a resource management game.
15223,"ITS FUCKING

(sorry bad english)"
15224,"What a Joke. Leave it to Bethesda to completely Screw something up so bad, you cannot progress. 

When you attempt to report a problem, the moment you hit submit, it comes back with a 404 Error. Screw this company. Do not buy anything from them. They are so simple minded, and incapable of any original thought after they forced the original creators of Fallout out of the company, that all they can do is Regurgitate the same titles over and over again, stealing new concepts from the Modding Community, and then labeling them as their own. 

I have only a small amount of programming ability, and I could do 10 times better in my spare time."
15225,"It is actually fucked how many hours this game sapped from me, like in a good way. But this game could also be so much more than a crappy mobile game."
15226,"Absoloutely awesome,addictive easy for low gaming pc to run.This game is very fun and i could easily play 100+ hours on this.If you like fallout You will definetly enjoy this free game"

15234,I cheated so much on this game
15235,"Everywhere you go , everything you see right here is a haunting shadow of the Fallout universe ‚Ñ¢  ...

Ahhh , evil Vault-Tek ! how dare you treating this game as if Institue using their synths , so much great potential waiting to 

be fullfill and interesting quests would be such a great pr tool for you ,  but instead plots are so casually written like 

Uptopland heroes ‚Ñ¢  , room models are being cloned like Gary ; all we do is "" treasure , quest & repeat "" . 

Yet it's so addictive , the feeling when you save up a bunch of hard earned lunchboxes and open them up at once ... 

EHHHHHH , so satisficing to watch , its even better when you use some Nuka - coka ‚Ñ¢  , every penny you spent will be 

useful for our next Fallout ‚Ñ¢  game ! (Oh wait I guess I am brainwashed already -_- ) 

Anyway this game is the poor man's Fallout‚Ñ¢ and it is perfect to play when you need to : 

- pretending to work on your seminar papers 

- pretending that you have something to do during overtime while waiting your boss to leave 

- Or just want to waste up your time in the wasteland 

Try it out now and please DON'T save bottle and cappy 

"
15236,Great game
15237,"Nice little time-waster for what it was.

I'm glad it's on PC but it's difficult to keep playing the game. There's challenges and things that can be done daily, but like any mobile game, everything is locked to real-time. The game does give you premium currency while playing and you can use that to fast travel to and from missions as well as speed up any other processes. Farily simple game with the common mobile micro-transactions. 

The game scales in difficulty as you keep playing causing your vault to get raided more often and by bigger and stronger enemies. It's annoying and commanding your characters around is really basic. It has a little more control than other mobile games but it still feels a little too stiff and at times hopeless having to micro-manage every single person around so they don't die. 

It's a fun game for sure! It just gets to a point where it gets more and more repetitive and boring. Waiting 8 hours for your team to reach the new mission and then another 8 hours for them to come back while dealing with fires, rad roach infestations and more. The challenge kind of gets dull after a while but if you play this game a little at a time, and don't burn yourself out of it, you may get more fun out of it. I just lost interest after a while."
15238,"Me gusta el juego, es entretenido lo que no me gusta es que haya que pagar cajas tan caras para avanzar en el juego."

In all of the spare time I've had between the odds and ends of my real life, I've been dedicating a fair fraction of my digital life to vault 285, where Three Dog works at the Radio station and I have a Mr. Handy on every floor that serves to power the whole facility. If that wasn't enough, I've rescued Bottle and Cappy and defeated all four Horsemen of the Post-Apocalypse.

In hindsight, it was totally worth it. The more time you put into it, the more fun it's going to get."

15260,"Pretty fun time-killing in between Heroes and Generals matches ;)

**Upon much further play, I feel compelled to add the following:
  -  There's a LOT of sloppy game engine functionality.  Which leaves the player to logically deduce that the only reason not to have polished the code a little longer before releasing it is that they just didn't care.
  -  The scale of enemy superiority/inferiority is so small that difficulty is negligible.  If you're paying attention, then you must noddin' off that Fentanyl to lose any dwellers.
  -  For such a limited and extremely short game, there sure are a lot of ""Premium Content Purchase Packes"" available..and in such high quantities?


***I still say it's fun, but...they used to make some game demos larger than this.  I might even go so far as to suggest this is likely an indicator of darker times ahead for Bethesda...considering with the Fallout franchise/universe being rather immense, they're running Interplay's masterpiece into the coals at a rate equivalent to Disney's seeming incapability to produce a good Star Wars movie."

I even enjoy the fact that I have seen myself grow slowly more evil the more dwellers I get, caring less about them individually and caring more about the bottom line. Is there enough power? Is there enough food and water? Are my dwellers meeting their mandatory happiness quotient of 75% or more? In that sense, the game is very fun.

Here are my issues with it, and why I can't recommend it in good conscience.

1) Kids suck. I completely understood my kid dwellers having garbage stats when ALL my dwellers were garbage. However, when I pair Lucas Simms and Star Paladin Cross together, goddammit I expect their child to have some decent stats. If they're NOT going to give me the ability to breed a stronger vault population, then I need to be able to stick those little good-for-nothings in one of my many training facilities so that by the time they grow up, they have a BIT of a stat boost. There's more, but I'll move on.

2) If you're going to throw deathclaws and radscorpions at me when I hit 60 dwellers, I need to have the capability to provide my dwellers with better weapons. Frankly, it pisses me off that the ONLY good weapons I've gotten in this game are lucky drops from lunchboxes. Weapons cost too much to make, and the upgraded weapons crafting station is too expensive. I've dropped REAL money on this game. More than a game like this should be worth, and I STILL can't afford it, since my vault dwellers are constantly being ripped apart. Four dwellers with sawed-off shotguns SHOULD be enough to kill 5 molerats, or one radscorpion.

3) Speaking of disasters, when a fire breaks out, or a radroach infestation occurs, or when molerats attack, or when deathclaws break through my front line, all the vault dwellers on that FLOOR should be responding, not just the ones in the room. I gave my door guards a gatling laser and a fat man, and they need to damn well use them to their maximum effectiveness, not just sit idly by while any number of menaces wreak havoc on the rest of my vault dwellers who only have sawed-off shotguns and hunting rifles.

4) I regularly have full stocks of stimpaks and radaway. FREAKING USE THEM VAULT DWELLERS. EXHIBIT SOME AUTONOMY. 

I can feel the tendrils of microtransaction greed gripping every aspect of this game. I don't really mind microtransactions. Obviously if I did I wouldn't have spent a dime on this game. What I do mind, is microtransactions that don't REALLY give you anything. This game is designed to feed off of you like a vampire, constantly biting at your neck to get you to buy MORE lunchboxes, MORE quantum, MORE Mr. Handy's to collect your resources. And that's what I hate about this game.

If you're like me, and easily sucked in by resource management games, do not expect a SIMS-like experience."
15268,Its simple fun.
15269,This game is a game you can go away from and pick back up at any time. It's a lot of fun and super chill. I enjoy fallout and this is a fun little side game!
15270,We need some traders is this game. I need too i love this
15271,This game is so addicting. Would recommend if you like strategy games.
15272,"It's a small game,
but lots of fun!

Deathclaws are my worst nightmare now."
15273,It's that game I have open while I play other games.
15274,cool game
15275,"Simple and fun, just don't try and get greedy and rush them to much. Pretty well done, it's free, and on mobile if you want to that as well, and tons of ways to customize your Vault,"
15276,feri gud gayme
15277,"5/10

repetitive, glitchy, achievements demand you to spend hundreds of dollars to finish the game, many lose their paid for vaults and items, support seems not to care at all, otherwise would be a fun game"
15278,Its a very good game
15279,"At the First thing,it's maybe Fun to play for Guys who want to kill their time But at first look you will get Bored and try not to play But After Worming up you won't go away, So be careful(IT'S TOO ADDICTING), You better don't waste your time by installing this Sh*t."
15280,Really good game!
15281,"I can't stop playing, it's been several years and I am having so much fun reinventing new ways to make my ant farm of people even more efficient"
15282,Do you have a life? Not anymore with our wonderful product Fallout Shelter.
15283,GG
15284,"Not the best of the Fallout series of games but it is the only one that allows you to take charge of your vault. Game play is basic with minimum input from the player and resource gathering and combat is a bit down to chance; the luck of the die rolls. The early game is the most satisfying part when there is a chance of all your dwellers being wiped out but once you get your dwellers to level 10 and higher the game gets easier. Late game you will be logging on for about 20-30 minutes, 2-3 times a day to get the achievements. All in all a nice basic resource gathering and dweller management type of game, if you have spare time to waste, more for Fallout genre game fans."

15286,Can't help but spend money to get more crafting mats to make my vault better
15287,An awesome F2P game. wish it had multiplayer though...
15288,great game. Eyes can relax and watch with pleasure. Maximum grade 100% and free to play
15289,it is cool i like it. though it sucks when i always get raided every so often. ohh well it is fun stil
15290,A little bit too addictive tbh
15291,I am fan of Fallout and decided to try Fallout Shelter. I was pleasently suprised by how much fun it was. I am now hooked and have to check it every hour or so just to see what my little dwellers are up to. The only negative is that to speed things along you need Nuka-Colas. (and you can need quite a lot for some things)
15292,Time waster.
15293,"I can't recommend this game in good conscience, even though it is a free-to-play.

I played it a lot on Android - about 100 days length. It's a lot of fun, especially in the beginning as you keep unlocking new stuff.

After a while, though, it will become tedious and even frustrating, as you feel the need to micromanage every single dweller to min/max and expand your vault, all while keeping out all the threats and exploring the outside.

There is no endgame. After a certain point, you just keep expanding, exploring and dealing with threats in an endless, meaningless cycle, grinding away for better gear and weapons, all to explore for longer and kill monsters faster, which gets you nowhere fast.

Another negative point is the fact that it's an Android port to PC, of a game that depends on time passing to replenish your gauges and completing tasks. When I played it on Android, I could take out my phone/ tablet a couple of times during the day and play for 10-20 minutes, which I feel is the way the game is meant to be played. When I sit at the PC to play, I expect to be engaged for (possibly) hours at a time, which this game will not provide, especially at the beginning.


All in all, you can expect a few entertaining days/ hours of play, better experienced on Android, but with a rapidly declining amount of fun after unlocking most of the game's content. Don't expect an end."
15294,"Not a bad game,you get new vault dwellers, you do this, you do that. you collect stuff. you build stuff, until your vault is filled with little demi-god's that can kill never ending waves of deathclaw attacks."
15295,Frustratingly addictive
15296,"Fun time consumer, good for when just want something to fill time and not be pulled into something lengthy."
15297,"Don't install this game!

You won't be able to resist checking on your Vault Dwellers day after day to see how they are getting along."
15298,"Maybe this game should be for Android only, but you know, now i can progress with my autism not only with phone but with laptop as well. Checkmate common sense!"
15299,MOAR CAPS!
15300,Okilly-dokilly! Greatiddlygame!
15301,Simple and addictive.
15302,"No need to spend money to play this game - its very addictive but nice and straight forward and best of all - you can put it down!!

Can't believe I've spent 80 hours playing it."
15303,Addictive as hell!
15304,"It's not aweful, really, but I can't say I really reccomend it, especially on a PC. The gameplay is simplistic and doesn't take a lot of time. Good qualities for a mobile game, but on a computer it just feels like there isn't enough to do. On top of that the writing is campy at best and the controls are... frustrating on PC. 

Overall, not worth the time on a PC, and on a phone there are better games available."
15305,This game makes me violently suicidal.
15306,Pretty good time killer.
15307,"Surprisingly addictive. Not a fan of microtransactions in general, but the base game is free and it is still playable without plopping any money down. Worth a look."
15308,A real fun game if you don't mind the addiction. I just wish they would make it so you can specialize in fields and get even more cool weapons/armor/rooms.
15309,"pros:
Nice graphics.
Its fallout :-)

cons:
Game is like little baby. Consantly needing your time and attention.
Stupid and buggy controls.
Dwelers are just bunch of retards.
Milking cow. (Buying in game stuff is just throwing money away. There is wery little back in return for it.)
After while it gets boring and repeative.

After 32 hours of struggling with it Im scratching it out of disk."
15310,"Good on mobile, better on PC, and it's free"
15311,.
15312,It's just satisfying and a nice addition to the whole Fallout universe. I'm really enjoying it a lot as a game that I can run in a background or just fortget about it for a while.
15313,good game I approve of dis love it
15314,good game.lots of my time is wasted on this gem.
15315,A top of the line role-playing game.
15316,Good Game !
15317,AMAZING
15318,Entertaining and challenging. A fun game to play.
15319,"Very nice game, good to play while waiting for download to finish."
15320,"I had a life but then I bought Fallout shelter, now lost my home and my job, still wating for my duelers to come back home from the wasteland!!! Worth every penny I didnt pay for it!"
15321,"I don't care, man. I like it."
15322,"i liked howe the game lets you do lots of stuff
"
15323,"There is definitely a lot more content than I expected in Fallout Shelter. I thought it would be a short little time waster that I'd spend maybe 8 hours on and then leave forever. However, the game is complex enough to keep me coming back. I'd definitely recommend it if you are looking for something to play every now and then that isn't too intense or complicated."
15324,"Quite a gift for fans of Bethesda's post-apocalyptic universe; this is Fallout Shelter, unexpected free-to-play that arrives to satisfy the cravings of those who want to re-visit the wilderness of the previous installments."
15325,Have you ever wanted to be the Overseer of your very own vault? Have you ever wanted to participate in the (sadistic) experements of Vault-Tec? Have you ever wanted to put 5 of the same room in a row and make a bigger room? Than this game is for you! Fallout Shelter: Still a better love story than Twilight.
15326,"an incoming transmission from my dewller, 
found 2 deathclaws and 1 alpha deathclaws 
9/10 Would Revive Again"
15327,Good time killer. Seems there is no depth first and then you realize indeed there is no depth when playing for few months :).
15328,"This game has really surprised me. I've been playing Fallout games since the release of the very first one all those years ago and all that history and lore can be found in this little gem. It is entirely free to play. You can do everything possible in this game without paying a cent. You can use real money in game to get some bonus packs or to speed up some timers, but you really don't need to unless you totally lack patience. If you enjoy building/management games you'll like this and, when you start doing quests, the game becomes even more interesting."
15329,God complex fuel.
15330,This game broke my Clicker Heroes addiction. Now to break my Fallout Shelter addiction...
15331,"Played it on iOS
Had many many vaults
Playing it again on my PC
Why am I doing this to myself .."
15332,Cool game
15333,Easy to become addicted!
15334,Noice
15335,"It's a good game, but it could be better. If it had
1. Multiple selecting when selling/scrapping. If you have tons of same items and you want to keep half and sell other half, then it will take a goddamn too much time. If we could select how many items we want to sell (5/10/15/20/etc.), it would be great.
2. Viewing dweller inventories in vault menu. When your vault is already full (or at least 150) with dwellers, then you know what i'm talking about. When numbers get bigger, enemies appear more often, so the dwellers have to protect themselves. Its hard to give weapons 1 by 1 to 200 dwellers. If we could see their inventories on the vault menu (vault at the top left) and change their items it would've made things much easier"
15336,Somewhat interesting for a while but you'll have to grind a lot.
15337,Really good game :) I reccommend :)
15338,not bad for free game
15339,"I really find this game fun and exciting. If you are bored, this is a good game to play. You can chek on your workers and upgrade things and buy new palces and hire new workers each time. Very fun game. Worth a download?

YES

9.5/10"
15340,Nice and relaxing. Really good for chilling and watching YouTube at the same time
15341,kontlo
15342,A funny game to play :)
15343,Best game to play when you have nothing else to play.
15344,Thumbs up!
15345,"HEY guys I recently did the Gobbler thanksgiving Mission, You can find it on my Youtube channel:
Channel ChinkyCatPlays:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvJs_pYG2Yrso2oX6mxWQ8g

Youll see what the rewars are, BUT heres the thing, After my team made it back to the VAULT the mission rewards DID NOT!
Contacted them 3 times and through email, website, they dont have help contact thru steam.
They only sent me back a couple of different auto Replies..They arent offering help and that Awesome reward is now lost forever...Not cool Bruv. Thought id let everyone know what i load of shit this is."
15346,i like this game
15347,great game but you could make getting lunchboxes and legendary stuffies from them a little bit easier and you could also fix the bug with screen freezing but game really working because its very annoying.otherwise great job.
15348,"Fun F2P game. It would be nice, if you didn't have to worry about the savety of the dwellers you send to explore the wasteland, but the developers want you to come and check back as often as possible."
15349,"It's simple, it's silly, and also very enjoyable as a casual game. I actually have more fun tending to my dwellers than I did playing Fallout 4."
15350,"The ""Tell your friends"" Award -_^"
15351,the fun begins with survival mode
15352,Great game would like a difficulty option though
15353,"Well thought-out, and creative. Keeps the atmosphere and style of the Fallout series."
15354,Great way to waste time without having to spend money. Would be nice to have more than 3 save slots however.
15355,Fun little game where you can put yourself into the shoes of the overseer and control the life of a vault and even better it is free to play. :)
15356,"Great game to kill some time. Appreciate the idea to manage underground shelter. However this game is too indie one. I definetly recomend it since it is fun, full of easter eggs and relates to Fallout niverse. :) But still there are things to improve:
1) Missions outside shelter are identical. First 10-20 one are entertaining. Later those are too boring and not intresting at all.
2) I do not like games which are linked to real time. I prefer to play as much as I want when I have time and do not eait for another day.
3) Crafting system is too weird. How that you get toy car after dismantle a weapon?:) 
4) Population cap and limit on size of shelter is annoying.:("
15357,"Really good, only cons are that virtual life seems to go on after you leave the game."
15358,Poop/
15359,"7/10
It's fine to spend a few hours per day playing it, but becomes boring quickly due to limited gameplay. Suits more for mobile devices rather then PC."
15360,rep nice game
15361,still mindelessly good fun
15362,"Such an addictive game, highly reccomended to spend some time.
More reccomended for mobile."
15363,Free and fun. Makes me want to play Fallout 4.
15364,"Need update improvements, such; minimize the crash possibility (i'm often got freeze or even crashed when playing), adding co-op quest with friend, boss fight, wasteland camp (make a camp at the wasteland), etc."
15365,Good game for playing casualy
15366,"Mobile game on the PC, it's addicting for awhile. Great game to play if you just want to run it in the background while you do other stuff, but its a mobile game so things are time based ""come back to this task in 5hrs"""
15367,I don't recommend
15368,"Much better than I thought it would be.  I tried this on my phone when it came out, and I just couldn't get into it.  It is far better (to me) on the PC"
15369,"a really cute game in my view :v na who am i kidding im just review this for the badge, but i love the game , no lie"
15370,dIS GEIM
15371,"As far as free-to-play mobile-esque type games go, this one's pretty good. Being a fan of the Fallout series also helps with the aesthetic of the game as well. 
Two things to point out though, one, if you don't mind paying for the lunchbox/microtransactions, NEVER buy them at full price. They are on sale ALL the time, and usually for 50% off. Second thing to mention is the achievements. If you're an achievement whore like myself, they will be a massive pain to earn them. Now realistically the achievements are not that bad overall and are very do-able, but there is one... that will take years of RNG unless you're willing to pay real money for it and that is collecting 20 legendary vault dwellers. I cannot stress how BS that acheevo is. This would be a negative review if I was petty enough to judge an entire game off of a single optional achievement. The fact that more than half of this ""review"" is just about that one achievement, is a little sad, but cannot be helped because perhaps this will help the few who also are slaves to the achievements."
15372,nice time-killer
15373,Fallout Shelter is a good base-building game.  Much more put together than many other games in its genre.  Would recommend if you like a passive type game to play.
15374,Overall great game! Computer crashed deleting my save :(
15375,best game to play when you're totally bored after playing those intense games that you could enhance your brain and make yourselves calm and teaches you how to plan propperly
15376,Great Wo/Man Management game
15377,great game very addictive and deeper than it looks on the surface......
15378,This game is far far too addictive.
15379,"IT is a great little side scrolling 2D game. I have been a fallout fan for years and have found myself coming back to the vault on a nearly daily routine. If you like Fallout and perhaps FTL, this is a great combination for you."
15380,Definitely addictive and click-worthy.
15381,Free time killer with Fallout series game content. Fun to play.
15382,Surprisingly deep for a F2P.  Ideal for just dipping in for a few minutes at a time
15383,"Mindless game, great for killing time."
15384,so much time wasted
15385,kewl i guess
15386,"As a free game, it is still the game I play the longest time among my games. Only at the beginning, you need to pay much attention to the game, to go through the diasters. After all the things are built and you money reaches 999,999, then you just enjoy collecting things"
15387,"Immerse yourself in a retro post-apocalyptic world while experiencing state of the art modern advertising. This is a beautiful game with ugly psychology.

This game is beautiful artistically and has great immersion even on PC. For someone familiar with Fallout its great to see an entire game designed in the style of Vault Boy. End positive discussion here.

""Reward in rushing"" is the message that is routinely reinforced as you play. ""Rushing"" a room is a core game mechanic and something of a miniature gamble that you engage in to make progress. You rush to get resources. Rush rush rush. Rushing brings rewards. That is what the game tells you. Rush, reward. Rush, reward. You must rush to get rewards. 

That is what makes Fallout Shelter's Pay-or-Delay scheme so lucrative. The game conditions you to rush then frustrates you with delays. The way to move forward is to pay for Nuka-cola speed-ups. 

Remember, please, that according to fallout lore Vaults were social experiments done on stupid people. For this game remove ""Vault Tech"" and replace it with ""Bethesda"". This is a game that plays you. 

I'm a patient player. I haven't spent a cent. I know the game behind the game, so I laugh at the things mentioned above. I also enjoy the sim-city-like challenge of balancing the little economy. I send my guy out on a 24 hour mission and come back later. 

But this game does indeed treat you like a rat in a Skinner box. Its missions could be played by a foraging rat, no joke. I downvote this exceptional game because the over-aggressive and psychologically exploitive system is not something I will encourage. 

Yes, I will continue to play the game. I find the real challenge is beating the game company itself in the pay-to-play game.

When you play this game remember Vault 114 interview #87...

Interviewer: This is Vault-Tech interview #87 for the position of Overseer for Vault 114. The candidate has refused to give his real name and has only provided the name ""Soup Can Harry.""

Soup Can Harry: That's right, I ain't telling you nothing. My name is the name I call myself not the rank and number the government brands on me, no sir.

Interviewer: Fascinating. Mister, um, Soupcan, would you mind telling me why you're distrustful of Bethesda?

Soup Can Harry: I've seen what they do. Gum up the works with red tape and bureaucracy, take every hard earned cent and use it to fund their Illuminati free mason sex parties. I'm a free man! I should be able to live as I see fit! My taxes pay for them streets and alleys and dumpsters. I'll sleep where I want!

Interviewer: Sir, according to this you haven't paid taxes in many years...

Soup Can Harry: I seen the back of them Abraxo boxes! ""Not for consumption?"" Don't you tell me what to do, I'll eat what I want!

Interviewer: Sir, you may just be the perfect candidate. How would you like to be the new Overseer for Vault 114?

Soup Can Harry: I ain't wearing no damn tie. Or pants.

15388,This game needs an update.
15389,this game is a special gift for fallout fans
15390,"I haven't played this game since it was first published at the mobile app store. The game has changed since then and dare I say it became better. A well balanced time killer between free to play or pay to get. Great  and simple visuals , easy and engaging mechanics will keep you entertained if played for a small periods of time. Which is the key if you want to enjoy being the overseer. Do it the tamagotchi way and you won't be disappointed or bored. Try it out, it's free, what do you gotta lose?"
15391,My fav Fallout time passer
15392,"Its nearly the best game i have ever played :D

15393,Simple and fun fallout!
15394,A perfect timekiller
15395,good game
15396,"Game nya bagus bro, type game santai yang sama kayak versi iOS / Android tapi kalo maen di PC jadi ga menuh menuhin memory hape kan yak. Thx Bathesda"
15397,"I have grown a liking to this game, and have spent some money on it, too. I play it on two different devices, so I have spent quite a lot of hours too. I suppose it means I enjoy it greatly, though there are some things that annoy me greatly: Like the fact that people need to wohoo to be 100% happy. It's ridiculous. I know it probably makes nerds 100% happy, or men - who obviously made the game - happy. I'm sure it makes women happy too, but I should like to think that having a nice dance with a same-sex friend could make someone happy. And what about LBG relationships? Why not wohoo with a same-sex friend? They are all missing from the game. It's the year 2288 after all! I like to keep my dwellers happy, but I don't want to make babies for them to be happy and then kick the grown children out to make some space, or have everyone working in many radio stations in one vault... Quests are starting to get boring now, but other than that, I like it, and recommend it."
15398,fun
15399,"This is not a game you will sit down and just play 2 hours at once. This is like a mobile game, you check it every once and a while and manage your fallout shelter. (It is similar to 'Oxygen not Included', but easier.) It is not only on steam, it can be found in the App Store or you can download it from Google Play on mobile devices. I reccomend this little game, although you most likely won't have as many hours on it as you do on your other games. Unless, that is, you play it obsessively."
15400,"water is low, food is low, money, low, and free"
15401,"Lololol this game is good! Addicting and amazing, the DLC makes it a lot more entertaining! Definiteley for the general audience!"
15402,"Sometimes you just want to play Oprah - you get a resurrection, you get a resurrection ..."
15403,"I usually tend not to enjoy F2P games. Either the content is lacking or the microtransactions cripple it. Surprisingly, this game has a large amount of content and you can play without putting a single dollar on it.

It's a colorful and light game which won't let you go. It's very addictive. There's always something to do - something to click on, something to manage. You get potential access to everything the game offers, so there are no unlockables that require you to spend real money on it. If you are patient, all the rare items  ( Mr. Handy, pets, etc. ) will eventually start coming. Investing money only lets you get those things faster... But I'd recommend not to spend too much money on it, otherwise the fun you'll have collecting stuff will fade away much quicker. Then again, I think this game deserves a few bucks just for how it was designed.

Although we have bright visuals, the game retains the Fallout atmosphere. You'll hear sounds you're used to and encounter creatures or characters you know.

Managing your shelter isn't that hard but it still requires some thoughts. You can almost run out of stuff at first because you have to learn how things work, but as soon as you have enough electricity, food and water-producing rooms, you'll get the hang of it. Doesn't take much time.

The addictive part comes when your shelter begins to get bigger and you have more inhabitants to take care of. You assign jobs, breed them together, level them up and (later) can modify their appearance. At some point, you'll be able to venture in the wastelands much like you do in the regular Fallout series and they'll collect rare items, caps and encounter mini quests. A few hours of gameplay later you'll unlock real missions which involve travelling long distances which lead you to buildings where you usually fight enemies and collect items as well.

There are a handful of events which happen in your shelter, but I wish there would've been a little more. At some point, it's just the missions that are truly fun and interesting. Lots of stuff becomes routine and you realize the game has its limits when it comes down to replay value.

If there's one thing truly missing from the game, it's multiplayer. Man, this game would've been a blast with multiplayer. Invading or defending other shelters, trading items or characters, going on missions together, all this and more could've been done. What a wasted opportunity. I would've gladly paid for this."
15404,Great game
15405,I Do Bad On This Game But Im Posting A Good Review Because The Characters Are Good Any Like A Lot Of Things Are Good

"
15407,Better than I expected on the PC.
15408,"This is an old game, but one I still continue to go back to in short bursts.  When it has you hooked it can steal a lot of time from you, but you eventually come to a point where progression grinds to a halt and you stop playing... only to find yourself setting up a new vault later and going through the whole process again.  It's free, it's fun, and it's a good way to pass the time.  Well worth the ¬£0 price tag!"
15409,mirco transactions and pay to win games need to be done away with and its time let the devs of these games know.

15417,A very fun F2P game! The quest system is really cool.
15418,Way better than Fallout 4
15419,"This is not a game. 
It's a ""let's-wait-for-some-stuff-to-generate-mobile-piece-of-trash""

No, I will not activate my steam overlay for any kind of shop. I will not wait minutes for something to happen. 
Why is this even on steam? I would understand to have it in the android/apple shop with all the other trash. 
If you enjoy it fine, but again: This is not a game. It's a ""ok, I will look at this every half an hour do to something""-mobile-desaster. 
"
15420,"Better/easier than the phone version & seem to have better luck than the phone version. I'd recommend this game as its a good source of entertainment for 20 minutes or so every 2-3 hours & It's free. It's the kind of game you set all your tasks in motions such as quests, wasteland exploration, crafting, baby making and resource making. Then leave and play an hour or two of a different game, come back and most of it should be done so you set it all again & the more you do it, the longer you can do it for. I've managed to be completely active on this game for over an hour before I could leave and wait for everything to finish. The more time you put into it at intervals. The longer than intervals will be. Or you can just pay to play by buying Cola's/Lunchboxes and you can play as long as you want till those run out. Overall for a free game convertered from a phone game, i'd give it a 9/10"
15421,Addictive
15422,"nice game,"

15426,Too easy to just let this game run in the background while you do everything else.
15427,Nothing could be better than controling the lives of all your minons 24/7.
15428,"this is a game. i have no doubt in my mind that this is a game. this game exists. i can not say that this game does not exist, because well, ofcourse it does. i mean come on, its a video game, and it was made, a video game was made at some point and they decided this would be that game, now who is they? well ofcourse its the people who made this game! but why did they make this game? i mean, why because a game was at one point bound to be made, thats right thus this game was made. this game has it all, a name, gameplay, music, and i heard and saw all of that while playing this game. now my opinion on those things is that they were put in the game, and thus they are a part of a game, and thus they are the game, and thus they are indeed, a game. would i reccomend this game, i mean a game is a game after all, and thus i must say that this game is a game, which is why this game is most definetly a game for me, thank you for this game."
15429,Good time waster if you are bored and waiting for your friends.
15430,It is good!
15431,Good game kills time

15439,This is such a nice time killer! Easy to play and very funny.

15441,So much fun! Hours to play...
15442,So many hours of entertainment and joy :D
15443,I really enjoy this game and it has a cool gameplay
15444,"you can make a shelter under ground and force people to have sex with one another

"
15445,"a verry fun game, i recommand it."
15446,"I've enjoyed playing this game both on pc and on android. It certainly won't be winning any awards for story or realism, but it has it's own place in the gaming community entirely independant from that. It is addictive without being intrusive, and I find I keep coming back to it every few weeks, playing it religiously for a few days until I get distracted by something else, but it's easy to pick up again. 

It's a fairly relaxing game, and I use it as a bit of a break from more intese games or even from studying."
15447,"Perhaps the most pointless time-waster in my library. After your vault has grown to a good size, the game becomes a monotonous clickfest. But I can't stop clicking..."
15448,"This game is a good pastime,can get hard at times,but it can also be very rewarding as a game goes"
15449,"Gameplay      9/10
Music             11/10

15450,love this game good for wasting time
15451,"great
"
15452,"Fallout Shelter is simple with a lot of collectibles. However, a lot of patience is required as it will take a few months to fully develop the vault."
15453,good game
15454,It's free and it's like the app!
15455,I only wanted to play for a few minutes a day.  Things did not go according to plan!
15456,"This is my go to game when I want to play something but nothing time consuming. Something I can easily get in, do a little something, get out, move on with my day. Vault simulator 101. Pretty simplistic tablet/phone port to PC. I don't know of anything horrible about it. Solid free game that you COULD pay money for to make your life easier, but you don't need to."
15457,"*raps fingertips on the table.*


Where that gallon of freaking bleach.. Why the hell did I download this POS ever 5 minutes I am getting attacked by Muraders or freaking Rad Rats and them freaking Moles. 


Recommended??? If you want to like drink a gallon of bleach.. Go for it!"
15458,"i cant get this game out of my mind now, just try it ^o^"
15459,really excellent time vampire and way too much Nuka Cola in my man cave  :-)
15460,Like The Sims but more apocaliptic. <3
15461,Easy to play and kill time.
15462,Nice game.
15463,This Game is really fun
15464,Nice
15465,Filled to the brim with microtransactions. Avoid.
15466,"Simple and Addictive.  One of the better For I've played. 
"
15467,Doesnt need much to run this game.
15468,Good stuff.
15469,"I'm not usually into free-to-play games, but I really like that you don't have to pay to win in this one."
15470,Decent fun for free. Recommended.
15471,"After running into some videos about the game on youtube I got curious and decided to look it up in the steam store. I was skeptical at first because it is f2p so I was thinking it must be filled with MTX. But they aren't and the aren't needed for playing the game.

I'm currently still developing my first real attempt at vault after learning the controls and the game mechanics.
Altough it's gotten a lot easier and I'm mostly just upgrading stuff it's still a fun and easy game to quickly play a bit when I've got some time left"
15472,"This game is so hard 
And tilt me so much.
Fun when you bored."
15473,"this game easy to play, recommended!"
15474,I build a vault. 60 hours later it was huge
15475,It's ok for a mobile game.
15476,Didn't expect a port from a mobile game was gonna consume my life
15477,"Love it. It's easy to play, time waster, and fun. When I'm waiting for a game to download or eating dinner, I love playing this!"
15478,Addicting game.
15479,Fast and easy f2p game.
15480,It's okay I guess.
15481,"Its simple, its small, its great to kill time, AND its free! I would recommend it on a portable device though as its best used as a time killer on the bus, or train, or riding in a car with annoying people."
15482,"This game kept me interested for a good while. For many people they spend a long damn time on it, constantly checking it, upgrading their vault etc. There's no need for me to explain it to you as every other review will and you for sure will have seen gameplay of this somewhere. But yeah, learning more and more about the game is fun too.
If you ever get tired and sort of want to progrress quicker, then you can download a game save file with 9999 of the lunchbox things that are rare / you pay for them. So that's quite nice.
Graphics good, gameplay good, story is ok, and it mixes things up enough for you to not get bored too quick.
I'd keep playing but I have other things to do."
15483,A nice easy fun game to play anytime.
15484,"Very fun game if you only have a few minutes here and there to play.  If you have patience and enjoy the game, you don't have to pay to win."
15485,Like The Sims in post apocalyptic world mostly in 2D.
15486,Best free game there is.
15487,"Good, free addictive game. I've played a lot of hours on iOS, thought i'd check out the PC version. Controls are okay.
MTX are in no way needed for progression, but I guess that's why its F2P."
15488,"Addiction game !!!!!! After spending more than 350 hours in the game, it become my daily duty :)"
15489,Not bad
15490,"Sencillo y rapido de jugar, empezar cuesta un poco, pero es de esos juegos que puedes jugar por pocos y avanzar. Entretenido y aunque puede aburrir a algunos a otros le gustar√°."
15491,Addicting but all of the achievements are not working.
15492,Gucci
15493,"No matter you played Fallout before or not, this game is so sweet.  I just cannot stop collecting in it."
15494,Fallout shelter is a good resouce manigment game.
15495,"Highly recommended.

"
15496,Funny
15497,Good game for a small pasttime or just some relaxing gaming
15498,nice game
15499,this game is a master peace
15500,Good time spender
15501,Fun game you can jump in and out of
15502,FUCKING SHIT I LOST MY SAVE
15503,Great game for time killing
15504,"fallout shelter is fun and exciting, all you have to do is to maintain power, water, food, and sex in the vault."
15505,"I love this game, its simple plat-former that is very addicting an play with your favorite charaters from the fallout francise, its a literal blast from the past,I highly recomend this game and also thery got a moblie version as well!!!"
15506,"you want the best, here it is, simple fun and exciting all in one game.,"
15507,"Very adorable little casual game that makes a nice daily quick check-in game at the beginning and end to the day.

Patience, Grasshopper. You can build up a lovely vault without investing millions on in-game purchases. It's actually way more challenging that way."
15508,ez game
15509,I am playing this game. I am killing my free time. I am killing my dwellers. I am building rooms. I am destroying them... And I like Fallout
15510,"It looks like a childish game but if you look closer...
It somekind a mix of essence of xcom and survival games :) And all of that in Fallout universum.
P2W is not that strong so, not bad. I like it."
15511,I really should stop playing this.... weirdly addictive but there is nothing left to do now. One achievement remaining and it seems an impossibility I'll get it any time soon.
15512,"fun and entertaning, you cannot ask for more once you play it. just use manual saving to avoid game crashes."
15513,I love this game the only complaint is the speed of the game is incredibility slow and expects you to just sit and wait
15514,This game take a lot of time from me. What amazing game. Very very love this
15515,A nice and calm game for those times when you wanna get off the noise in your ears from playing FO4 for like a day and a half...
15516,Its aight. <3
15517,"simple but addictive, you cannot stop playing until you reach population 200 or you will definitely quit if you play the survival mode."
15518,This is solid free to play game.
15519,"Finally a more stable version of this addictive Shelter Menagement game.
After the mobile experience been able to play it on Steam was a huge improvement."
15520,"Very funny and keeps your attention trying to improve your dwellers and vault event through months, and still you'll find new things to do."
15521,relax game
15522,Good game time killer :)
15523,Waste your time doing other things with this game.
15524,Great time waster
15525,Good game
15526,Fun.
15527,Good time waster.
15528,Awesome game good for passing time for waiting for others to download.
15529,"such a good game ! so much interesting thing to play and the built-in payment system is acceptable.
i have a question about the training of dwellers,the weight room and the athletics room allow not to the child,i can accept it 
but why can't the children go to school,that's not make sense!"
15530,Impregnation Harem Clicker: The Motion Game.
15531,cool little time killer game much better on PC
15532,Amazingly fun and addictive!
15533,Good game
15534,"Takes time, But it is worth the wait"
15535,"ez to play and keeps the spirit of the original fallout games , as the overseer of your own vault you feel like taking over the wasteland. very fun game to play if you don't have that much time"
15536,it's fun till you open all of the rooms
15537,"Wee little men getting ate by monsters. Need a evil version, ala Dungeons or similar."
15538,"I sank so many hours into this game. I have finally broken free! But I still hear its call: ""just five more minutes ..."""
15539,"Nah, this 1 is interesting to kill ur time lol"
15540,:)
15541,9/10
15542,"I played this on Android in the beginning. Now since it's on steam, I had to get the achievements. They have added a lot more content since it first released. It is still fun to check in every now and then. The mouse controls makes it tougher to move people than it was by touch, but certain actions are much easier now with a mouse."
15543,Enjoyable romp through the vault.
15544,"I have sunk way too many hours into this game. A great freebie that doesn't force micro transactions down your throat, in fact, I've not have to spend anything, so I highly recommend it."
15545,"I'm addicted to this game , I find it very relaxing. It seemingly never ends ! I am trying to collect all the pets and all the Legendaries at this point."
15546,If you want to build your own awesome bunker with Black Jack and whores then you are here.
15547,This game is so addicting! never really played the regular fallout games but this is very fun to mess around with and explore the limits on this game!
15548,I love this game far far more than I should. I actually prefer it on PC because it used to crash my phone as soon as the vault became a reasonable size.
15549,This game is great!
15550,Slightly very addicting.
15551,Fun to pass time. Sadly addicitng
15552,"Grandioso juego, con m√∫ltiples opciones y una dificultad m√°s que adecuada.
Entretenimiento por d√≠as y d√≠as."
15553,"been playing on my phone forever, nice that it came to pc"
15554,"Zombies, monster, great weapon, Popular character, comedy, prank, adventure romance and sex all in one game."
15555,Don't ver use auto save if you want to get waste your time. Always use manual saving and everything else works as intended.
15556,Sometimes getting under keeps you safe and sometimes your worst nightmare awaits you beneath. thats how this game works
15557,Getting laid in this game gives  you an idea why it is so important for everybody else. You cannot defend your vault properly if they are sad.
15558,Great little game to do if you like something that takes 10min in the morning and at night quick. also not the hardest to acheive 100% in steam acheivments.
15559,better than playing it on my iPhone
15560,Best Mobile Game!
15561,"One of the better F2P games out there. Game is fun, controls are little wonky on PC ( clearly ment for touch controls) and the MTX are in no way needed."
15562,"I've put many hours into this game over the years. Usually on other platforms (like Android, or the Bethesda launcher). It's an addictive strategy game. There are no rules. You're in charge, and you vault dwellers just have to put up with how you decide to run things.

I'm a monster."
15563,This game is quite good. Cant equal to This War of Mine but its still good enough to spend time
15564,Same as the Phone version. exactly
15565,"It's the mobile game brought to the PC. As somone who generally dislikes playing games on my phone (this one has fine detail enough that it makes me crazy having to zoom and manipulate the screen to click on an individual Vault resident)--this was already a no-brainer. 

It's simple, fairly direct, and enjoyable. I can't ask for much more out of a mobile platform game which added the ease-of-use of coming to my PC."
15566,muy entretenido
15567,fun but i would recommend the mobile version rather than this
15568,nice free game
15569,"Im still playing it.. but i have run out of things to do :(
and that last achievement?.. sheesh way to hard~!
great little time killer with fallout novelty lore.
retro at its best."
15570,Very addictive game
15571,it's okay
15572,A fun time waster game.
15573,"Are you boared with pressure giving games....??
Try this..!!
A total relax..!
Vault under attack!!"
15574,I made Mr. T and gave him a mayor outfit. I call him Mayor T. I've been playing this for months now. I should probably send Mayor T out to pasture but I won't. It's fun.
15575,"I wouldn't normally give games like this much credibility. The gameplay is the sort of low skill, repetitive type that is easier to stomach by pumping money into the game. 

What makes Fallout Shelter different is that the gameplay also provides a basic foundation for some really fun mechanics, if you apply a bit of immagination. 

My shelter became a eugenics nightmare after I discovered a case of incest. I turfed all but the best dweller into the wasteland started anew. I tracked lineages, planned for diversity, and ended up with a golden generation of sibling dwellers whose heritage was equally shared from 8 families. The outliers and mistakes during this process became slaves to roam the wasteland, returning with goods for the sheltered, pure class.

Fun game."
15576,Is actually really good and is cool how you get to control everything :D
15577,such a fun game
15578,poor person comes for shelter gets a jumpsuit and after a day (or less) gets gun and sent out for loot.
15579,10/10 for past time
15580,A very good time spender
15581,a free game in wich you can have unlimited fun with the typical fallout humour
15582,amazing
15583,"Fun ""mobile"" game with timers, no need to pay for things to progress. Jump in for a few minutes daily and just have fun."
15584,"Great little mini base building to come back to every now and then, a little dose of Fallout without the time commitment.

Nominated for the Haunts My Dreams award because I have actually dreamt about it. A few times."
15585,Funny Game and also important that it has ending like completing all achievements  :)
15586,20 legendary dwellers :)))
15587,i need new update
15588,"game for one hand, when you are trying to sleep my son"
15589,Nice Free Adictive game....... Once you start you just can't stop !! Excellent stuff
15590,It's a fun timekiller for a free game. Gets boring toward the end game but 200 hours for a game is still good
15591,Great time killer.
15592,Good game for background and idling. I like playing this when watching something or I have couple of minutes to relax.
15593,updated missions  keeps the fallout storyline
15594,"This it's a great game to fill the free boring time... until the game itself become boring! Anyhow it's super addictive, until you get bored again and again and still come back for more... damn it!"
15595,Good for a mobile game.
15596,10/10 still waiting for my legendary baby
15597,Great offline game for mobile when you're in the middle of absolutely no where +rep
15598,"Way too addicitve,"
15599,nice game to play if you or bored
15600,"For a free game this is one of the better games I have played in a long time. That said it is a bit of a time sink, so if you are going to play it be prepared to wait for things to complete."
15601,"Nice graphics, 6/10 action, a lot of guns and outfits, few enemies and locations, 153 hours played."
15602,"Fun at first, after that playable if you are a fallout fan."
15603,"A very simple vault management game that makes me return for it, day after day. Lot's of jokes for fans of the series but I'm sure others could enjoy it too. Of course as this is a F2P game it has micropayments, but I've never even thought of buing anything because you can't get anything with real money that you couldn't get by just playing."
15604,Making those vault dwellers happy!
15605,"Fun game, perfect to mess with here and there when you only have a few mins."
15606,Bethesda s2
15607,fallout 4's base building mini game in a nutshell xd
15608,A good game. Just don't fall for the ingame purchases
15609,"Better than the mobile experience. Other than that, its the same game."
15610,"Damn this game it's so freaking addicted :))
Save people
Banish people
Put people to work 
Send people to war
Try not to let them die
Try not to let them be killed 
Try to steal from others
So many things to do into a shelter
Fall in love with the game of survival"
15611,;)
15612,Vaulted right over Fallout 4 to play this.  GG
15613,One of them come back to games to pass some time in between other games or when you only have 10 - 15 mins spare
15614,"10/10
"
15615,At least there's no creation club(yet)
15616,"Nice game to kill some time, and free"
15617,yes
15618,"Good game!I thought that the control of the game will be terrible,but it is not! Absolutely enjoyable,even on PC! :D"
15619,"Nice game, very fun and addictive! Reccomend it!"
15620,Issa good game!
15621,"Nothing much to say about this game..
this game is a base building game, some what similar to clash of clans when it comes to the base gameplay.
its a good game at start, but it just gets repetitive after some time.."
15622,love how the player build his own vault
15623,It's good.
15624,i LOVE  THIS GAME!!!!!!
15625,This game is a fun game to open for a few minutes at a time and has a lot of custimizable options for your vault. It's has a nostagic look and feel of fallout. I made it to 110 dewllers and collected most of the themes after that there is not much left to do. Overall the game is fun and I would recommend.
15626,"As a free version of the Fallout games, it contains many memes to interest Fallout fans. I'm a new Fallout fan from Fallout 3 to Fallout 4 entering wasteland for garbage collection, with ease and comfortable in playing (they had even made an Android mobile APP with a Chinese game company). However, the lack of Chinese version destroyed the whole gaming experience, with more playing time, the deathclaw and radiation scorpion attacked my vault as soon as I started playing, which makes me so confused and upset. I also hope there will be more outdoor map to discover."
15627,"This is a great port from mobile. The game is fun as long as you keep in mind that it is engineered to be annoying enough to make you consider spending real money. Many things take several real world hours to complete. You will have to babysit your vault during this time as your dwellers do not collect resources themselves nor do they heal themselves so your vault will die if you leave it run without a few ""Mr. Handy"" robots. Even then enemies and raiders will eventually kill your dwellers and destroy your robots so don't leave it too long! For a free to play game it is a lot of fun. I just don't think it's worth spending much money on since you get no game asset (as in not DLC you get items for your one valt). I haven't experienced the glitch where it deletes your game but I can see how that would completely kill the game."
15628,"Casual game, very enjoyable. I don't know for how long though."
15629,"HORRIBLE WASTE OF TIME, TRUE INSULT TO US FALLOUT FANS!"
15630,super addicting and fun. Great for people who have some time on there hands
15631,I love the game.
15632,"[h1]Mobile games shouldn't be on Steam.[/h1]



[b]0/10[/b]"
15633,d
15634,"If you're looking for fast paced action look somewhere else. 
If you're looking for somthing to do in the background while reading or just casual then this may be the game for you.

It is at its heart a mobile game but translates well enough to PC but if you want to get anything done in a decent time scale be prepared to shell out real world money for ""Nuka Quantum"" some missions take over 24 hours of real world time waiting in order to actually start and then half that again to get the stuff you got on the mission back home all of which you can make instant with the quantum purchase.

Still its a fun game and worth getting for free to play"
15635,"This game is one of the best RPG's IMHO.
Best graphics, lightning and shadow  quality is on top. it's engine gives you a freedom to play game as however you want, best combat system 10/10!! storytelling is amazing, you can build your own vault and have some people in here, let them work and upgrade their skills, upgrade your vault.
This game is so emotional, once family had a baby and I called him bin laden and he died to save the vault 666 (That's my vault.), I cried a lot even when my cat came and I told him why I was crying he started too.. r.I.p. BL ‚ô• babe."
15636,Best game ever!  It's a ton of fun once you dump endless amounts of real cash in to it.  I highly recommend it as a way to get rid of your extra cash while enjoying a fun time.
15637,"It's somewhat addicting but it gets really repetitive after a while. If you are looking for something to fill time up occasionally this may before you. If you want to do something in longer bits I wouldn't recommend. My biggest compaint is that the percentage of failure on rush tasks are way off. If you have a 20% rate of failure then in my mind you should have a 2 in 10 chance of failure. In reality the rates are much higher. I read similar complaints online from other people. This becomes incredibly frustrating. Somewhat said that the luck and other traits factor in, but if they are going to run an algorithm to tell me a failure rate, I think they should factor in the dweller stats if their hypothesis was correct. The enemies get really repetitive also of which there are 6 main enemies. It is easy enough to get the premium paid content for free so that is a plus. The pets are cute. I wish that some outfits weren't gender specific. I'd like to have a female ninja or night or a male movie goer for example.  If I was going to give this a rating I'd give it a 3 out of 5 stars and the only reason I said 'no' for recommending is a friend was asking me about it and I couldn't recommend because I could see a much higher chance of being disappointed. I feel like after playing a while there is no satisfaction from leveling up your dwellers. It is the same content but harder. After a while I'm not sure what I'm working toward anymore so it's like level 1 but less exciting. I was really on the fence though for the review whether to recommend or not otherwise. It is free so it really doesn't hurt to download it and try if you don't mind a somewhat repetitive click orientated game that is good for filling in time between stuff."
15638,"My main vault of more than 150 hours got deleted (the secondary is still there) out of the blue.

Legendary dwellers are rarer than CS:GO's rare special items, as after 76 lunchboxes opened, I got only ONE legendary dweller;

Total waste of time."
15639,I like this game on xbox and on here it is fun and relaxing and great to play and you do have to think about things for it to work out right planning is essential.
15640,Just dull
15641,Great.
15642,"Not a bad game, but we can't transfer save to other platform, So....not recomended."
15643,"I played Fallout Shelter both on PC and mobile and enjoyed both a lot. Its entertaining enough to keep it interesting for a while but lacks depth and there isnt really an endgame. 

The quests are a nice feature I had not seen on mobile which adds some extra incentive to play for a while longer.

Once you unlocked all vault rooms and upgraded them, the game becomes easy and repetitive. Still I had many hours of fun for free (and there are absolutely no payments required to play this) which is why I recommend this."
15644,"This is fun and cool, little game that is a great time-waster; I may not have many hours on record here on Steam but I have played this on IOS for a much longer period of time. The game is relaxing and enjoyable, it is cool to manage your own vault, oversee all the dwellers: name them, customise them etc... The game's microtransactions aren't really bad, unfortunately they are there but luckliy Bethesda never forces them upon you. Honeslty, the game is better suited for a mobile audience, presented as a time waster but it can also provide hours of fun here on PCs, built up over time. If you have a mobile phone that you can get this on, I'd recomment that you do. It is one of the few mobile games out there that is actually good. 

Pros
* Addicting, fun gameplay
* Quests and missions
* Vault building
* Dweller customisation
Cons
* Microtransactions
"
15645,this is a FALLOUT
15646,"It is a fun and addicting game to play. It is simple, looks good and is time consuming! The missions are pretty cool too in the wasteland."
15647,"Fallout Shelter is just another experiment made by Bethesda where more genres are tested on Fallout franchise. Instead of FPS open world sacavange hunt (Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas and later Fallout 4), Bethesda tested mobile device platform and made a scavange hunt simulation. The game is very simple and limited: basically you're doing vault managment, signing tasks to dwellers, sending dwellers on missions, building rooms, etc. Controls are somewhat clumsy, it's bit awkward to pick and move dwellers. Combat is very simple, visuals look nice, there is large variety of weapons and armor, but those are the only good points.
The game suffers from constant critical situations, there are fires in the vault and creatures (such as raiders, ghouls, radscorpions, deathclaws...) attack all the time and there isn't much time to build rooms, send dwellers on missions or assign them to a room. I remember having at least four waves of attack before I got a chance to send my dwellers to explore the wasteland. The game becomes nothing but a nuisance that you start looking around where will radscorpions crawl out next or where fire will start. 
The concept of vault managment sounds interesting, but project execution is poorly made. Players get only a feeling that they just click at stuff and don't get any feeling they accomplished something because the moment they finish something, a fire starts or deathclaws attack, which just keeps them busy. The game would look interesting if there were more difficult missions (with more slots for dwellers) such as attack on a supermutant camp, to get more Fallout experience, not doing silly missions which barely have any relation to the franchise at all. 
In the end, the game was made for smartphones, so it's basically just a way to kill boredom. it's allright to play the game from time to time, but playing more often will start to become annoying since the game doesn't have anything to offer but constant fires and deathclaws attacks."
15648,Fun for just kill time while waiting download to finish.
15649,"So.. its a mobile style game thats ment to be played on the go or ""afk game"". But if you forget to recall your people from exploring they just die. Cant really hammer the game to badly cause its free. But its deffinately not my cup of tea. I downloaded it because i thjought it might be similar to the old SimTower game back from the 90s. And it is very much like it. Except for it taking forever to gain anything and your upkeep is far to steep for the minimum amount of time you spend actually playing the game."
15650,"Its alright.
7.9/10
Pros:
Its fun, addictive, and nice to watch your colony grow.
It lasts a while.
Cons:
It can be boring after a while.
Its mainly P2W, with some aspects locked completely."
15651,"When I first started, it was fun, but then i got a ton of caps and built a huge base. Sadly, i was still new, so be unsuprised that i ran out of electricity, then water, then food. not very new player freindly"
15652,I think this game is great! Keep making good updates!
15653,"I think i have finished the whole game now, i spent prob little bit too much time on it but it was so fun!
Such a amazing game to be fair!
Awsome atmosphere too,  i have bought a few things to support the devs whitch i knew i could get for free but for a awsome game like this such a chil enviroment and fun hours they deserve every penny.
I would highly recommend this game if you're tired of skill based, or just fast paced games and want to chill for a bit."
15654,We need Chinese
15655,a really good building game
15656,"This game is very fun to play. I would recommend this to both Fallout and non-Fallout players, as it's fairly easy to get the hang of and it's free! I really enjoy it."
15657,"I've only played it on PC for a bit but on my phone i've played a lot more. It's a really fun simulation game that kepps you involved. I like that the game is free and they have good deals on the im-game stuff. The one flaw about it is that I wish that for all of the loot box things (lunchboxes) when you get them at the start I got 2 legendaries (I probably spelt that wrong but there's no spell check on steam so...) and the 2 legendaries I get were both legendary junk. (No literally they were like military ducktape and a watch but somehow they were legendary). I think that they should kinda re-work the luchbox system. It is random so It was probably just my luck. Overall, love the game and if u like simulation-type games or you just want to be like donald trump and rule some people then this game is for u. :D"
15658,Fun to play if you want something simple and straight forward. Never super difficult or harrowing. Can play on airplane mode (if your school has limited wifi).
15659,This game is just as fun as the mobile versions. It is a great time killer. It does not have that many mictransactions in it and the ones that are there you really don't need to use.
15660,"Fun, low commitment game, unless you use Survival mode ;).  IF only Bethesda would make an Elder Scrolls Homestead version..."
15661,"Which seems really fun at first and feels different then the generic mobile game tropes, like waiting on a timer to do this and that and have to log on every couple hours to play, but then quickly falls back in line with generic mobile games. 

Missions begin to take longer at higher level, creatures that you‚Äôve killed in the past are now stronger seemingly based on MobStength x DwellerCount. This takes the game into an endless grind of artificial difficulty that you will fall out of love with as fast as you fell in.

The user interface problems begin to really take a toll on your psyche after awhile. They use box colliders instead of polygon collider on irregular shaped objects such as dwellers. If that were all then no problem but none of these colliders are aligned correctly either. The game becomes increasingly frustrating with every faulty click.

Could have been a great game if the interface wasn‚Äôt broken and they didn‚Äôt get so lazy with progression. What were left with is a room filled with garbage. You won‚Äôt notice it at first and look past its flaws but as time goes on the facade will fade and you will realize the pile of trash you are sifting through."
15662,Vault 69
15663,good for seniors to play
15664,:)
15665,"Started playing on Android, like it a lot so I looked it up here. Can't get past the tutorial, game crashes. :("
15666,"simple game, good for a weekend. played this with my brothers.
seeing who could make a better vault. good game."
15667,Very Funny
15668,"[h1]PROS[/h1]
* Quite entertaining, nice design.
* Totally worth playing, giving me fun.
[h1]CONS[/h1]
* Stupid achievement for 20 legendary survivors collected thats huge money wasting or months/years consuming thing to reach.
* Auto-focus (auto-scroll) on events (ex. raids, fire etc.) and when child is born auto scroll to top floor -_- can't change it in options
* Scroll on edges also can't turn it off.
* Objectives mostly ridiculous dumb and not worth any attention.
[h1]Final Rate: 6/10[/h1]
Can't expect too much from f2p game mobile ported, fine choise to kill some free time giving a taste of wasteland adventuring."
15669,decent
15670,"TL;DR - Fallout Shelter is fun for what it is - a quick diversion while you drop the kids off at the pool, or when things are slow at work, etc. 

I played the game on my phone for a couple weeks and maxed out my dwellers and rooms, and so forth. 

Opinions and things of note from my playthrough:

It's a pseudo-strategy upgrade'em up, vault-building farmville-like game that is also reminiscent of Sim Tower. 

The comic art-style is well executed with cutesy and fun animations and effects which the dwellers exhibit while carrying out their lives.

Bonerkill Alert: Grabbing and dragging dwellers is awkward and inaccurate, even on PC, especially when zoomed out -> grabbing them accurately requires zooming in, but moving them to where they need to go often requires zooming out again.

DOUBLE BONERKILL ALERT: The emphasis on microtransactions in Fallout Shelter are disappointing, although not unexpected considering the original platform and target audience.

Entitled gamer conclusion: It's unfortunate that Bethesda used their time and effort, and this great IP to make a weak mark on it's legacy. I think I speak for many fans when I say we would have been happier to pay outright for a more serious entry for mobile platforms, perhaps something along the lines of Fallout/II/Tactics."
15671,"It's very nice game. For few hours. After that you will soon discover, that it actualy quite boring.
It's a game 'few clicks-waiting-few clicks'. So forget about ""I'm go play a while just now"". You could also manipulate time of your machine and savegames for squeeze from it more.
It's free, so you can check it out. There is payed content, but honest (you can still ejoed it without paying). Unless you wish to get achivment with legendary heroes."
15672,"Fun way to pass time if you're bored af, and work in an office."
15673,"Very fun to play. Wonderful art work. A lot and i mean a lot of loot. 
but waiting times are a bit harsh, overall great game."
15674,love it
15675,dont play this game! its the digital embodyment of cancer. will delete all ur progress as soon every time your getting somewhere in the game. stupid creators should have fixed this years ago when it came out.
15676,Piece of shit doesnt work
15677,Good game
15678,"Nice, little game for now and then!"
15679,"A wonderful free game in the Fallout world! Did I say it's FREE? What's not to like, it's FREE! and it's Fallout!"
15680,noob game
15681,"Amazing, I still Don't Understand Why people Hate the Creation Club, ReCreates The Experience Of Vault 81,Vault 101, And Vault 13."
15682,"Great game, fun way to pass the time when you don't have the time to commit to the full fallout rpg experience. Personally, I've wasted away 25 hours of my time on this game enjoying every second of it, the fires, the raids, and the deathclaws (deathclaws especially). The only reason I'm not recommending this game is because most of what you do will be for nothing. This morning I've logged on only to see that my vault was deleted. I've lost all reason to play now that my hard work is gone. I would start again, but I've read many forums online dating back to a year ago with people having the same problem. The reason I don't recommend this game is because this bug which deletes vaults hasn't been fixed after all this time.

It's a great game though"
15683,very nice
15684,"In my opinion, it's not a very enjoyable game. I spent about an hour on it and made very little progress whatsoever. The worst part is the items don't auto-collect while you're playing it, so you need to sit there and manually collect the food water and electricity otherwise chaos will ensue. 
I suppose if you have nothing better to do and enjoy doing nothing but staring at the screen waiting to click a few times every 4 minutes or so, then this would be the game for you. Myself on the other hand, I prefer games that are a bit more engaging. If you're not willing to spend money on caps and such, then you might as well accept that your game will take forever to progress."
15685,Nice game.
15686,"This game is fun, and needs good stradegy. its good i recommend this game."
15687,"Nice, build your vaults, run as overseer, Collect Weapons, Characters, Armors and more.
Great game, 9/10.
Note : If you lose your save file due to some issues, please remember to backup your data / 
          enable cloud save, you don't have to restart over. :D"
15688,"Honestly I think people are too hard on this game. It's just a fun little distraction, for FREE. I enjoy playing it and checking on my dwellers everyday, going on quests, maintaining the rooms of MY vault. It was my introduction to the FALLOUT series. It atracted me with it's cutesie graphics and appeal, so I gave it a chance, and now I'm a huge Fallout fan"
15689,"174 Hours Played
200 Vault Dwellers (1 of them cycling due to max 10 waiting dwellers problem)
186 full S.P.E.C.I.A.L vault dwellers
88 max level vault dwellers
100% acheivements completed

Some things I have learned:
Sending your dwellers on quests give you room themes and schematics.
Wasteland scavenging will yield lots of crafting mats and level up your dwellers very quickly.
Chemistry Flasks are the most important commodity for crafting the best weapons and outfits in the game.
Best weapons are Dragon Maw (ranged targeted), MIRV (ranged splash) and Fire Hydrant Bat (melee).
Nukacola Bottlers obviate the need for Agility outfits since the Diner's food production is redundant.
Wasteland scavenging will keep your vault happiness from being able to hit 100%.

I hope this game gets a sequel and more love is paid attention to the PC version. There was a Chinese fork of the game called Fallout Shelter Online which had many of the features that come to mind for a PC game release.

Good luck Overseer!"
15690,"I like playing iOS games on pc, it invigorates me to the max."
15691,"7.7/10 Good gameplay, fun app and free to play"
15692,The hardest boss in the game is the UI
15693,"yeet
"
15694,Ultimate time killer!
15695,"Even though the game is pretty straight-forward there's still something to look forward to with it. Hell, I even forgot the other games in my library because of this one. 10/10"
15696,naisu yeah
15697,This is the greatest tycoon game ever i love it also its free and that makes it that much better so if you like fallout 1 - 4 i reccomend this game
15698,"I play this game almost everyday, and I dont regeret it. This game is fun whether you want to come in for 5min then log off or if you want to do multiple quest in one sitting. The microtransactions don't affect you at all unless you want to spend your money and possibly advanced quicker, but I can say you can also just as easily get Lunchboxes, etc from just playing normally"
15699,"i keep installing on and off
"
15700,"Time consuming, so good if you wanna spend time"
15701,IDK AND IDC
15702,"This game is the bomb, heh."
15703,"Great game 
"
15704,the controls do not works as interned in the tutorial.
15705,"Game won't launch. ""The game crashed.  The crash report folder named '2017-11-09_135008' next to game executable.  It would be great if you'd send it to the developer of the game!""
"
15706,"A fun casual game. It's more fun once you're able to go questing, which doesn't take long. For a free game, this is really good. I wouldn't pay $20 for it, but maybe $5 lol Has a mobile esk feel, but with good graphics. 

You got nothin to lose but time :P"
15707,"Its a fun game at first, but then its gets hard, you need to built weapons, not the ones you find on missions, because if you dont, you whole shelter will get destroyed, this has happened to be once if you play, CRAFT A LOT OF ADVANCE WEAPONS."
15708,no
15709,You'll have to pay to get all of the achievements.
15710,I clearly don't get the appeal of mobile games
15711,"Great game!

Is a must for any fan of Fallout or Bethesda in general."
15712,DON'T DO IT!!!   IT'S LIKE HEROIN!!!!   JUST SAY NO!!!!!  I CAN'T STOP PLAYING!!!!!
15713,"Wake up check the vault, go to work, come home and check the vault again. Easy and simple"
15714,"Fallout Shelter is a fun game, but issues with crashes and loseing all your progress happens often."
15715,Great game!!
15716,cool
15717,Probably the best casual game ever made
15718,is there cheats
15719,"game doesnt give me much reason to actually start it and take care of the vault. its just a mobile port, a game were you click on a room and you get money then you wait to be able to do it again. it's nothing special"
15720,"Got to say it is a pretty good and little adicktive game, great for a quick play or long sessions, 1 thing I've noticed since using a Ultra-wide (2560 X 1080) is to try and aviod zoomiing out too far and then moving the map, it tends to freak out and dissappear, it will come back when you zoom back in."
15721,gets boring very quickly.
15722,its yeezy
15723,"Incredibly fun and simple colony management sim. 
Don't do microtransactions though, find the PC save editor and get all that for free."
15724,"Don't bother with this game - ponderous, predictable, boring etc etc....  Tries hard to make you you spend more money in the game.  Sad really because the grphics are good - but that's it!"
15725,"Yet another proof why BGS should be shut down.
28% failure chance = 5 out of 6 times failure rate. If you are going to shove RNG and set chance percentage together make sure they actually work."
15726,"It's an addictive little game. For SOME reason. Don't actually know what that reason is since there's not much point to it.

I mean you essencially use a breeding pair of dwellers to churn out babies. You slowly upgrade each room and unlock new ones and progressively make the vault bigger.

Right up till the point where you have unlocked everything. Maxed out every room. Maxed out the stats on every dweller.

Then what? You can send a number of people out to do missions. Which when the dwellers are maxed becomes too easy.

You do missions to get bits of loot that servers no purpose to a maxed out vault. To find caps, which have no purpose to a maxed out vault. To find people who can't fit into a maxed out vault.

You can explore which again serves no purpose.

Wait for a couple of raiders to come by and give you something to do. Deliberately set up a radio station to lure in a Deathclaw again just to give you something to do.

I don't know. Just seems to be a boat without a rudder, in a glass smooth, man made lake. Not doing anything but slowly being blown around the surface by the breeze.

Where is it going? Nowhere. What will it do when you get there? Nothing.

What happened to the Fallout Vault lore? The human experimentation. The virtual reality worlds? The messed up social manipulation.

It would have been nice there was a proceedurally generated ""THEME"" to the vault. Where you as the overseer have to make sure that the task is followed through and you have to balance the psychological and physical balance of the dwellers.

Vault Tech wants to see what happens when dwellers are forced live in complete darkness. You have to build tech and equipment to monitor and keep your fragile dwellers sane.

THAT at least would have been interesting. Offer a CHALLENGE. I guess that is beyond the tallents of Bethesda these days."
15727,I love this game on all platforms
15728,VERY ADDICTIVE
15729,I am Luffy
15730,"I spent an hour in this game, and i spent an hour writing this review! 9.5/10"
15731,This is a game that is there to burn time real quick. I have played it while waiting to get a full queue with my friends. It is a progression game. The longer you play in one fualt the slower it gets (duh). I would not recomending trying to play it completely.
15732,NICE GAME
15733,"Free to play, yes. It gets harder and harder to play unless you spend money in-game. Nah, not happening. After a while, it gets to not be as fun. I think its going to be uninstalled."
15734,its fun and makes you work to find out how to survive
15735,"oof
"
15736,"the game is okay but im all the time stuck with only 13 dwellers and i can wait like 4 days then i get new 1 ? why
"
15737,"hey want to waste your life on this game that you can play on both steam and on your phon- (a few week later) ""i should stop"""
15738,Better bagguete than sandwich.
15739,"This game is a lot of fun! For fans of Fallout or just post-apocalyptic games enthusiasts Recommend!!!
"
15740,its2amazing4me
15741,"Heeeeyyyyyyyy, thats pretty good"
15742,It's fine to play when you're bored and haven't anything else to do. I prefer this over the app on phone devices.
15743,i find not able to save and reload save very boring you tend to just give up
15744,"Downloaded this game yesterday and absolutely addicted to it. 

It's not a game you can spend hours in, but it's definitely one that you can waste a bit of time in waiting for friends to come online or whatever the case may be.

So far, I've found the game quite easy, but there is a bit of a slow start after the initial tutorial tips until you can start broadcasting to get more vault dwellers. Missions are fun and give great rewards to fund your vault expansion and upgrades.

Definitely recommend this game. :)"
15745,"Mildly amusing, thouroughly disappointing.  

I know you get what you pay for, and I was cautious about trying this free game.  Bethesda has brought some good things, and my son and I enjoyed the Fallout franchise, and thought this worth an experiment.  The concept of managing the shelter is appealing, and some of the mechanics, bells and whistles are entertaining. 

Unfortunately, the game play is poor.  For example, one of the basic functions is moving dwellers to different locations.  Doing so should be easy with a drag and drop of the mouse.  Not so!  About half of the drops are ineffective, or the dweller runs off to a random location.  Even when your mouse is centered in the target room and the gold corners light up to confirm you're hovering your mouse over the right area, flip a coin and maybe your dweller will go there.   F.S. dwellers excel in blind stupidity either walking past foes or hyper-focusing on the number of workers allowed per area while ignoring the blaring red alert that they're under attack. 

After nominal progress lead to modest satsifaction, the game fell South fast.  Conflict with raiding criters could be an entertaining challenge.   The result:  eventually I quit after wating 12 hours I'm not getting back since the revenue generated by the survivors was not enough to revive the fallen.  
I'm going to go read a book"
15746,worth to kill my boredom and if u tired of waiting just change your date and time
15747,Funn
15748,"This god level game is for those who really want to experience the struggle of living in the Fallout universe. There is hardship, romance, drama, death, and action. This game is not a simply 10/10 GOTY, not it is more. It is 100/1, Game of Time. It changed my life, and God Howard is the reason why I am now a new man."
15749,Game Crashes every time after tutorial
15750,i am mcdonals i am lovin it
15751,its good
15752,This game probably sucks
15753,"If this game works on my phone... Then it will work on your PC, good game, many things to do, keeps you on you toes, forces you to be responsible in dealing with problem in the vault EX. You people are going to starve, make some caps so you can build/upgrade your restaurant, unless your a person that likes seeing virtual thing starve, die of radiation, monsters, thirst, and lots more, have fun its free, and good luck"
15754,fun lil game :)
15755,Cool game. I got all my friends killed.
15756,"I played it on my phone while waiting for fallout 4 to come out. Thats probably why i love it
fun litle spin of whit a bit of fallout lore in it that fans can enjoy(like myself)
7/10 Still waiting for Elder Scrolls My Little Dragon on mobile (and also fallout new vegas 2 or Elder Scrolls 6 or fallout 5 Just bethesda give me a new game)"
15757,"not to good at pc so i suggest you to play it on android or iphone
anyway this review is belong to game not platform 
so yes its is a good game and of course its free to try :)"
15758,Very fun game. It is alot of fun to pass the time. It's free and fast but intense game
15759,Great chill game!
15760,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
15761,"Recommended if you're always busy or somewhere else. It's just designed to be played sparingly, since it is a mobile game, after all."
15762,"ridiculously addicting.  been playing 6 hours straight all day ahahhaha :)

pros:
the fallout nostalgia is win/win
quests for the overseer give really good loot
good time consumer
reasonably priced(free)

cons:
very time consuming XD
not very interesting unless:
+ youre a fan of the fallout series
+ really like strat games

<3 id give it a solid 7/8 out of 10 :D"
15763,very easy to learn after 5 min of playing if you are a fallout fan you will like the only thing is it takes forever to get anyone new and you have to click on the power and water and food to store it it does not auto collect now if it does you just have to level up let me know if you are longer into the game then me
15764,"Fun game, its an phone app based game so don't expect to hop in the game and play for hours and hours because you will be bored after 15 minutes but then you stop playing it for a couple of hours then play it again for 15 minutes and so it continues. you just wait and collect: food, water and electricity and sometimes you go on mission with some of your dwellers but it takes the dwellers about 2-8 hours (depends on what mission you choose) to get to that place. you can skip that walking time by using nuka quantum bottles, but those cost money or you can get them by completing the missions. but after you're done with the mission your dwellers have to walk a couple of hours back. but your vault can also be attacked by raiders, deathclaws, and molerats so you have to equip your dwellers with armor and weapons, and those you get from missions and microtransactions."
15765,This is a very addictive game.  It is not difficult at all. I love to manage and control situations. I love keeping my stats high.
15766,game type - kill time
15767,Very nice
15768,"A very unique eye-catching game, whenever I see Bethesda making a game I always think to myself, ""Wonder what's going to happen in this one.."" or ""Just an awful piece of mixed crap"". But this new game changed my thoughts, I was a full on Elder Scrolls fan, not really interested into the Fallout series. I always thought the Fallout series was just a failure, but did I know that Fallout was coming right back at to me, this whole entire new game changed my thoughts on the Fallout Series, now I am very interested into these series, though I do still play Elders Scrolls, I sometimes play both.


When I first started Fallout Shelter, I was skeptical. ""Is this new game or another boring old fallout mobile game?"".
When I completed the tutorial, I already had an Idea of what S.P.E.C.I.A.L was; I started thinking that this game was actually quite decent. 

After 10 Minutes into the game, I started to get addicted and my thoughts on Fallout completely changed. Since you could actually explore into the whole new different world above (aka, The Wasteland).

1 Hour into gameplay, I was nearly a full on Fallout fan, ""I actually quite enjoy this game!"" I thought to myself, Bethesda really got me into the fallout series by making a game like this. Now why won't you play this game and have some fun.


9/10."
15769,THESDA IS THE BEST
15770,"Gets repetitive quickly. Mostly clicker game style meets some resource management. They have done a bit to increase the variety of activities, adding in missions and the crafting rooms. For missions, you have to send people out, and have to await their arrival (real time countdown clocks, often several hours' wait) to do anything if you don't want to spend money). Crafting rooms...aside from completing daily missions don't really seem to be worthwhile. 

Play if you like games that you check into for a few minutes a day, but not a good game for someone who wants to sit and play a game for any extended period of time."
15771,"Turned off tutorial from the start, but keeps on popping that up.... quite annoying."
15772,"EASY FUN GAME, FOR FREE ;D"
15773,"Fallout clicker game
Collecting is kinda fun
Want more lunch boxes!"
15774,"A lit game for some lit people, fun mainly when bored/no life."
15775,Great but i run out of recources fast
15776,"Sure this came straight out of the mobile but that is not always been a bad thing, i dont have many hours on the steam version. but i have spent so much time on bethesdas version in their own launcher. 

This game is a simple and relaxing game, come home from work/school and just sit back watch out on your vault.  this game is fun and i have played many moblie games that were ported to PC and it played like utter shit, but this stands out to be one of the greatest ones that I know ."
15777,It's okay for a free game
15778,"Pros - it's free; it's Fallout. If that's enough to make you squeal, try it.
Cons - gets annoying very fast; VERY clumsy drag-drop-click controls; quite limited, both in useful facilities and population; no pause or speeding up, which, with clumsy drag and drop, results in ineffectivity while trying to control the vault during any annoying random emergency; inconvenient population tabs, etc, etc, etc.

Go on, try it, it will keep your interest up for a day. Not sure if more."
15779,yeet
15780,"The first time when i started to play shelter, it was when it came out on Android and iOS. I've had a lot of fun, and i even spent real money on the game, however there was a point when every time i logged in, deathclaws started to attack my vault. Later i discovered that i placed quantity over quality, so a few months later after the game came out on PC, i've started to play again. I've had even more fun, and there was no deathclaw problems this time, cause when they came, my dwellers had good stats and gear. I had more than 100 dwellers, 60k bottlecap, so i was like, yeah it's time to expand even more. One day i woke up, and before going to work, I've checked on my vault, and it was a huge surprise i tell ya. My vault is gone, just randomly dissapeared. At this point, i'm so burnt out, that i don't even care about contacting the support, so they may recover my vault. I won't touch this game again, in the near future."
15781,"This game is a lot of fun, and being free is even better. However, be warned if you want to really get the most from the game early on, you need Nuka-Cola, which you have to buy, so you can get to and from quests faster than a day.

But other than that it's a great game!"
15782,Hoping to see Super Mutants in game!
15783,i cant play this game
15784,"Real fun game of strategy. For people who like games that involves a bit of thinking, this game is for you. It fits nicely into the Fallout game lore with accurate weapons, such as the 10mm pistol an .45 magnum. You can also customise your characters with a load of different outfits. Play the game, you won't regret it."
15785,"Fallout Shelter is a great free mobile game that got ported to PC. Fun is aplenty here as you populate your Vault with the most capable souls that can brave the dangers of the Wasteland while making sure they're fed and happy.

It certainly doesn't take itself seriously, and you shouldn't either. It's just meant to be seen as a fun diversion with no real bearing on the lore. It'll help if you've played the Bethesda games, Fallout 3 and 4, as Shelter has tons of references to those two games, with some quests being pretty much a trivia contest on these two games. No major references to New Vegas unfortunately, but I am not surprised.

It's the same game as it was back on Mobile so if you've had your fill already, it's probably not worth coming back, but they do keep it updated with seasonal events and it doesn't look like it'll go anywhere soon. If you've never tried it.. what are you waiting for? Sure there's microtransactions, but you don't need to spend a single penny to enjoy this one.

Go forth Overseer, and make that army of stampeding Gatling Laser wielding Comedians you were always meant to make."
15786,"Not bad. Expected more, but it's good. Overall: AMAZING"
15787,"It's a fun and simple game, but after a short while caps become useless and junk becomes just that... Junk. There needs to be MORE... 
More room customization, not just barracks and diners (Which are only allowed one theme each per vault, no matter how many themes or rooms you have.) 
More room tiles for building which you enter though quests and at rondom while exploring the wasteland. These become quite tiresom as they recycle the same tiles over and over, It feels repetitive seeing the same rooms all the time. And some places just look wrong. There was a quest where I went to a supermart place and the rooms were office rooms, wtf? And annother was a bottling plant wich also had office rooms. 

More things to spend your caps on, Like turrets, traps or other extra defenses, Decorations for rooms, Maybe even Mr. Handy upgrades and costumes. 

More places to explore in the wasteland, Not just the same tired locations. Add in some caves, mines, forests, farms, lakes, marshes, etc... I mean where are all these Rad Roaches, Molerats, Rad Scorpions, and Deathclaws comming from? Do they all live in the same abandoned buildings the Raiders and Ghouls live in?

More enemies. Where are all the Bloatflys, Brahmin, Rad Stags, Super Mutants, etc.. that are in the fallout universe? Why aren't they in this game??

How about the ability to visit your friend's Vault?? Or even other NPC owned friendly places.

How about Trading, buying and selling between said friendly locations??

The game offers Lunch boxes, pets, Mr. Handys, Nuka-colas and caps which can be purchased with real money, But what for?? You can get all of those very easily by exploring and questing.

It feels like the gae has potential to be great, but as it is now, it feels kind of hollow."
15788,Unsurprisingly more enjoyable than Fartout 4.
15789,"Love this game so much I play it both on my phone and on Steam!
I love everything in this game, only thing I would ask for would me for items for aesthetics, maybe some rooms you can decorate, a room that's the size of 2 elevators instead of 3? I designing my bases and I could make them look even more fabulous!"
15790,"   Can't really recommend or thumbs down as I have mixed feelings. I like sim games. Fallout Shelter is fun, to an extent... It's VERY time consuming and not in a fun way. I got bored with it veery, very quick. Personally, it's not for me but at least give it a try. You'll know within a few hours if you'll invest a ton more time into it or not."
15791,"Fallout Shelter. Very addictive for mobile game but not for Steam version, would be better if it changed ""waiting time"" to something else."
15792,"I've play this game back in early 2016, I enjoy playing this game back then on my mobile phone.

For the PC version, it's a great time killer game.
The bad point for me in this game is about those resources that you can buy from paying Steam wallet (aka. your rl money)
I love how the gameplay looks, the graphic is great and controls and eveything but I don't want to pay my money to buy anything in game.

But this game kinda remind me the old days games on mobile which aren't support for new Android version
Still, this game is great and good to try out if you never try it before."
15793,"Great little boredom buster.  Entertaining and easy to learn and play.

It's a fun Fallout themed game allowing you to build and administer your own vault.

Cons:  The larger your vault gets the more difficult certain aspects of management and random events gets.

Still, not bad for a 'freemium' game..."
15794,"The game keeps scrolling off of the vault, and then it crashes.  Can't really play it very much."
15795,"Got bored pretty fast, there are some entertaining strategy elements in there. But not enough. And when you fuck up you fuck up so hard. Too much click to win feel"
15796,"Useless microtransactions.
A normal management game, only for the fan of a brand."
15797,"Lost my saved game when my pc  accidentally got unplug. I wish there was a backup system, like having 2 saved file and the game automatically save on to the older file. So when this happens, we can just load the older file, cause I think the game auto save every 5min. And maybe the savefile got corrupted while its in the process of saving when my pc turned off. (its not the first time I was playing and my pc got unplugged and before my save game is ok )"
15798,Great Game. Better Settlement system than Fallout 4. More RPG-esque than Fallout 4.
15799,nice game but you can't play it one hour long
15800,"boi
"
15801,Good Game Well Played
15802,"So this is not normaly the type of game I play. But it is now! I have become addicted to this game the last few days. Nice easy going, until you have fires or roaches in every room lol. I recomend this to all who want a relax type game."
15803,Nice game
15804,"Played it on my phone, this game wasnt for me but I still recommend it. I got around 20 hours in all on it maybe and I enjoyed it, I just found better games on my phone."
15805,Game Developer dont give an eff.....Game is fun i like it but its annoying how the game force quit itself without a reason
15806,good background game
15807,super
15808,"I've wasted far too much time on this game. I played it on my tablet and phone for months. I played on the launcher for months. Now I play it on steam since it's easier to manage my saves.

Mindless fun for me as I don't have to think a lot. I get up each morning, have some coffee and check on my vault. After I go as far as I can, I create a new vault and start all over. Would be cool if you had a little more to the management of your vault. 

Not sure why anyone purchases the content other than to support the devs. Considering the game is free, supporting them wouldn't be the worst thing. There are editors out there that let you get everything in the game, build your vault, level your little minions and even give yourself rewards. I don't personally support microtransions in any game, so they can have all the sales they want on lunchboxes.

Fun little game to waste time."
15809,"The game is good except i notice that i didnt get any brothas ,  in other words yall need to up the spawn rate for black men in this i got ONLY white men in my vault but a mix of females , "" i guess its not white suprimacy or racism. ""  And they stop giving people i sent all the men i had out and they all died except for pennyworth or wheva some old white guy , because he had alot of stuff but i know he will die in the exploring tomarrow . and by the way i was thinking about buying some stuff just to get a brotha in my vualt .

#f^ck ur feelings"
15810,Fun game to play when bored.
15811,"So a mobile game that's on PC... 

It's fun
It's a time burner
It allows you to customize your vault-denziens
It allows you to customize certain areas
It has quests

It has paid content.....

It's Fallout Shelter!"
15812,"The game is great, but I put 20 hours into this game playing it non-stop, It's really addicting. I had over 70 dwellers until I leave my game open and go afk for a minute to come back to deathclaws killing everyone, including my legendary dweller.
I really enjoy this game it's just Deathclaws need to be nerfed. HARD."
15813,a shameful display of the fallout name
15814,fun.. for  now
15815,App trash.
15816, ÿßÿ±ÿ≤ÿ¥ ÿØÿßÿ±Ÿá
15817,it a nice game i quess it the early version to fallout three i that ive played before
15818,"Why do i have 84 hours in this game
Cause thats the time it takes to actually beat the game
While i put in more time
Yes
Why
I hate myself"
15819,this game ir really fun to play while you are passing the time but it is really hard to find random places while out in the waste land but over all it is a good game.
15820,"As much as i enjoy this game, It was hard to play because it constantly freezes and i am forced to restart it."
15821,"Fallout 4: Shelter simulator

7/10"
15822,good
15823,Great time killer
15824,"Great game,fun and never get bored!
Best free game with a nice style and really cool features that never stop!
love how also objects/characters from other fallout games apear.

 recomended"
15825,"The raiders are pretty bogus. Raiders shouldnt be capable of stealing resources if they're fighting dwellers. like, ""oh yea ill fight you with one hand and steal all ur shiot with the other"". On top of that why the he11 would you not follow someone that was just fighting you?? theyre in your house and ur juss gonna stand there when they run away... ""nope, not my problem now... they went into another room."" come on bethesda... Step it up!!"
15826,The game Has a really glitchy contoller support. Doesnt let you use the menus as the selection box jumps everywhere.
15827,This is a great game for fans of the fallout series. After you get your base building and some followers recruited it takes only a little bit of time each day for maintenance and quest assignments. The only downfall is the limited endgame and the low chance of legendary followers. Can't beat the price!
15828,really fun but needs more things to do in game but over all its a good game
15829,TLDR: Takes that thing you love and makes you pay for an empty husk of what that was.
15830,"great, just great"
15831,"Very addictive game that is very time consuming and also very fun. I could easily poor 30+ hours in this game and still be having fun. Its also a bit challenging. If you love the fallout frachise, this games for you. 8/10 highly reccomend"
15832,Not very fun or intresting.

15836,"A pretty good Game gotten from another game (Fallout 4). It has fun gameplay and requires time to finish like the original Fallout games. This is a masterpiece in building games like these. Simple but awesome. On the downside it makes you wait some time for stuff. But thats just a small sacrifice for this awesome game. Also it would be better if Nuka-Cola Quantum (The ""Rare Currency"" that is in every game like this) could be found easier and faster and not by having to do long and hard missions or build special rooms. But overall the game is great and i would definately reccomend it if you wanted to burn some time while having fun."
15837,"nice , casual, simple and relaxing game to play"
15838,moving people between rooms is a nightmare
15839,Nice little distraction.
15840,Meh
15841,Very nice and addictive game!
15842,"Simple, fun, relaxing little game that you can play without an Internet connection. Its biggest flaw is that it attempts to squeeze money out of players by making things like traveling to missions and crafting gear take ridiculously long times, in many cases real life days. Change the time on your computer to avoid having to wait days just to craft a gun or travel to quests. Its second biggest flaw is that the game saves progress insecurely locally making it very easy to cheat and edit saved games. The combination of very long wait times and insecure saves is a recipe for cheating the game, even just to make it more enjoyable. Don't believe anyone's excessive progress is real; they either spent money, changed the time on their computer repeatedly, or edited their save games. After a while the game does get fairly repetitive with a lack of surprises and no multiplayer competition to keep it interesting. However, even after playing to the point of boredom, it's still fun to load up and attempt to further optimize vault performance from time to time. The fact that it is free is a big pro towards earning a thumbs up."
15843,"+better than mobile counterpart where u can precisely click & no performance issue
-no cloud save between OSes..."
15844,fuck of

15847,"it's good game, only suden alarms (fire/raid/infection) are goin to give me small heart attack
and who idea was make radscorpions a god when they attack to ur vault? fucking 50 more stronger than 30 deathclaws."
15848,"This game is addicting. Starts simply, slowly. Then once you unlock the overseers office and begin quests shit gets real. Save your nuka-quantums. You wil get plenty of lunchboxs and special characters/weapons/suits. Harkness and Old Man Longfellow are prety damn badass"
15849,"better than on mobile where it crashes on loading screens, and better than on the Bethesda client where you have to log in all the time because the client has alzheimers."
15850,"This Game is Amazing I Might Just Do a YouTube Series On it, I hope there will Be Future Updates Leading to a Sequeal, Im Hoping To See This Game for Xbox and Playstation, I Hihgly Reccomend this Game!"
15851,boring
15852,"Well, the game is ok to play in the background. But if they could fix the problem with the unkillable radscorpion it would be a bit better."
15853,cant play for some reason.but great game anyway.peace going to try one more time.
15854,"GOOD  GAME!!!!!!!!

15855,This game is like a hot girl its last only a few minutes but it was really fun
15856,Good game on mobile but no on pc port
15857,pretty addicting. played 20 hours in a week. [strike]please help im being held hostage[/strike] its one of the best games ive ever played
15858,"[h1]Free Shelter[/h1]

Fallout Shelter is an interesting time sink. I've never played a clicker, but the word comes to mind as I manage what amounts to a game of clicking, waiting, and some planning. There is a fair amount of strategy involved in playing this game, not only as  the Overseer, but in combat, but don't go looking for a lot of depth.

For a free piece of promotional fun, Fallout Shelter really satisfies. As the unseen but all powerful Overseer, you are tasked with managing your inhabitants, or 'Dwellers', building your Vault, and issuing commands during combat. The concept starts out simply, and progresses rather well as your population grows and your vault becomes just a little deeper and more complex.

The rooms all provide something, most of it useful for developing your Dwellers or your Vault itself. There isn't much to do but place your dweller in said room and occasionally click a resource, a level up icon, and such. During a [b]'Disaster'[/b] all kinds of things can happen, and Disasters can come randomly or if you ‚ÄúRush‚Äù a room for its given resource. In most cases these are manageable, but there is one type of disaster that is woefully imbalanced. More on that in a moment.

The game is not without issues. Controls can be pretty wonky, particularly with clicking. I didn‚Äôt remember having too much trouble when my vault was new, but with more rooms and Dwellers it seemed as though clicking on one of the Dwellers would instead click the room. Dragging a Dweller to a room to perform a task also has a lot of inconsistent results. A green silhouette indicates that a Dweller has been selected and when I drag them over a room they will often go to the next room above or below. The same goes with locating the Mysterious Stranger; a random encounter in the vault that if you locate will rearward you with free caps (the game's currency). I would find the stranger, and when I try clicking him, despite where my cursor is located, I will instead get the room and zoom in, but not get him. This can become very aggravating.

One of my other big complaints revolves around the aforementioned disasters, specifically, radscorpions. During a disaster, such as a fire, it will grow, maybe spread to adjacent rooms, and generally just be a minor but solvable problem. These disasters get harder as your population gets bigger. By 50 Dwellers you begin to get radscorpions. They are extremely powerful, and not only do they do great harm to Dwellers, they are tough to kill, drain power (one of the most precious resources in the game), poison your Dwellers with radiation making them harder to heal, and they move around to random rooms. They are incredibly destructive and tough to kill. I had to evict a lot of Dwellers to lower the population to 49 just to keep the menacing attacks away. There are training rooms, better weapons, and other ways to mitigate this problem, but that will take weeks of time sinks and grinding to get to that point. The game's developers could have balanced this much more fairly. As it stands it is a harsh and largely unpleasant difficulty spike.

15859,love it
15860,"WHENEVER I LOAD THE GODDAMN GAME I HAVE NO FOOD, NO ENERGY AND NO WATER. IT TAKES HOURS TO GET IT TO GREEN."
15861,This is a good game to kill some time with. I do hate that you have to wait a long time tho. Overall 8/10!
15862,"If you're not willing to pay real cash, then don't bother... 90% of the game you're just waiting for resources."
15863,A nice way to kill a little time
15864,"Timer games are annoying,  I play to escape obligations, not to have them.  Guess that is their model to pay the bills.  Otherwise both fun and cheeky."
15865,Cool game. A little similar to building a city only in the time of the Apocalypse and is in the rock
15866,"This game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! One guy said fallout shelter is basically the sims with guns. thats very true. this game also has mutant bears giant cockroaches, so go ahead and download it. If you like the sims or post-apocalyptic games, then Fallout Shelter should be right up your alley. Also, a fun little thing in this game is that you can name your 'dwellers' as the game calls them, and you can have all kinds of people, from your sibling to Donald Trump living in your vault. because why not?"
15867,"Liked, played mobile very different yet still the the same game. 

10/10 woud recommend on PC."

15875,its realy fun at the begining you get a litle bored mayby but after you play it for 10 minutes it starts getting funn with upgrades and new rooms and you can explore the wastelands so 9/10 9 outof 10
15876,"gud, but beter on phone."
15877,i think it plays very well. and it takes the vault boy aspect of fallout and completely amplified into its own themed game
15878,"Nice freeplay game! I really enjoying killing our with this game chilling at my desk with snacks and RPG lights in the dark <3
Love it"
15879,<33333333333
15880,"Can't leave a positive review for a game that has 0 defense capability. Not only is it sloppy, is downright depressing. Sure, you can put a rifle in their hands, but they're too stupid to hit a rad roach. Not to mention the room limits leave you helpless if there's an infestation and you can only have 2 people in there at a time. 

Crappy game from a money hungry company."
15881,"great game. there's definately some flaws, but it's still one of the best mobile games out there. good for 100 - 400 hours, depending on your goals for your little town/shelter"

15896,"how to play fallout shelter

1: open the game
2: change your time and date to January 1st, 1980
3: close the game
4: change your time and date to the current date
5: relaunch fallout shelter
6: enjoy the mass amounts of time rewards"
15897,Better than fallout 4..... I said it
15898,"This game steals your time. 
A lot of games do that but at least those give you something back for your time. 
Fallout Shelter just steals your time. It doesn't grant you the success you expect from a normal PC GAME. 

It just says: ""If you like me, go to the shop and buy some boosters for cheap money - I recommend the 99‚Ç¨-one. It's the best way to feel like playing a kind of PC-GAME and also *as a top bonus* you don't get bored from clicking 3 times a minute. Because after your appreciated purchase you can click at least 20 times a minute.""

Some might say: ""In most PC-GAMES you just have to click buttons!"" and they are right.

So why you just don't give it a try and make your own experience. At least it's free."

15900,"A brilliant game for a free-to-play. May feel grindy, but if you have something else open on the side, hours can pass by. A quick word of warning though, experienced by both myself and undoubtably many other players. Should your PC crash whilst FOS is running, YOUR VAULT WILL LIKELY BE LOST. Before playing, you need to create an external backup yourself, DO NOT RELY ON BETHESDA OR STEAM, unless you want to lose your progress. I am not salty at all. Still would recommend though."
15901,good GAME
15902,"wish this were a good game but the design is so hobbled it feels sad
if they'd take another go at this as a full game for $15-30 i'd love that"
15903,Great Game!
15904,very nice games it gets boring after 90 hours playing it because yout vault will be so full of things
15905,"Its a fun little game.. for a while.  It DOES get repetitive, although I can let it off as there is plenty of stuff to get getting on with.  What I CAN'T forgive is the game breaking bugs... literally.  The radroach infestation event sometimes spawns with an invincible radroach which completely decimates the population which may reside in that particular room.  Short of turning off the game and reloading it, it's guaranteed to remain bugged.

If you are a die hard fallout fan and want something mobilesuqe (well.. it IS a mobile game ported to PC) and don't mind the game breaking bugs, then feel free to pick this up.  I enjoyed it greatly.. when it worked correctly."
15906,"i have an idea for fallout shelter, a vehicle bay above the vault door so you could have actuall power armor suits that you find pieces to on quests or in the wasteland and ice cream trucks to drive around and find dwellers in the wasteland and things like that. faster quest reaching times, extra artilery, power armor equipped people gaurding the vault if someone from Bethesda likes this idea please add it into the game. Your faithful player -Catty313"
15907,"A must have for fans of the Fallout series.  A nice, little, casual click and play game.  It's perfect for killing time at work!"
15908,"Ok, Before you gun me down with your legendary armor-piercing minigun, please take note, I like this game.


+=-PROS-=+

Fun gameplay, makes me excited
I like how you can maintain a vault how you want it. Like a weird vault experiment.
Some of the most clever ideas, having to use breeding to have alot of people to the fact those useless vault-tec lunchboxes become needed.

-Cons-

I lost about a week of sleep because of how addicting this game is. That is a terrible sign.
The timers. Takes me two hours to clip my toenails but only 5 minutes to craft a gun.
So much money lost. THIRTY $$$ LOST.
So many microtransactions.



I can't ever get my week of sleepback because of this game, and I hate it for that. Also because I wasted $30 on one vault, only for it to go down like the Titanic because of how poor it was doing."
15909,"I love this game to death, but please hammer out the bugs. The game has been out for far too long to have this gamebreaking bugs. My computer powered off unexpectedly, and my vault DISAPPEARED. Another problem that caused me to uninstall the game was a permanent loading screen. I couldn't do anything that required a loading screen or it would load for about 5 minutes and then crash. PLEASE FIX THESE BUGS!"

But maybe add it that it sync with the mobile version too so you can play on other places without pc too!
And that you can add friends and trade with them"
15913,not bad timekiller
15914,"I'm not a huge fan of mobile games, but this title caught me and did not let go. I spent around 3 months with android version of the game and now I can continue on PC with backup saves from my mobile. That's perfect!

PC version is smoother and its controls more user-friendly. Especially with a larger number of dwellers.

Also it is important to note that microtransactions in this game are not aggressive. They are not needed at all to achieve the equipment and other stuff. I'm surprised Bethesda!

Fallout Shelter is easy to pick up, simple (but has sophisticated mechanics) and addictive.

[h1]9 out of 10[/h1] raiders recommend this game. The 10th still plays Fallout 4."
15915,"a dark spin off of the hit fallout jrpg series, this game puts you at the helm of a brutalistic work camp for the minions from despicable me. you will grow attached to your slaves after watching them die of dehydration and fuck for your amusement. eventually the minions begin to whisper amongst themselves about rebellion, and it becomes your job to suppress the revolution by any means necessary, even when your own eugenics program backfires and gives the minions a messianic leader in the form of the kiswatz haderach. overall im not sure where this fits in the timeline, and consider it on the level of a fallout themed meet and fuck kingdom game."
15916,"Simple, fun, relaxing little game that you can play without an Internet connection. Its biggest flaw is that it attempts to squeeze money out of players by making things like traveling to missions and crafting gear take ridiculously long times, in many cases real life days."
15917,"Fun and relaxing, a great segway for the Fallout franchise. I only wish Fallout and Fallout 2 would be remade into a modern FPS like FO4."
15918,"The first thing you need to understand about Fallout Shelter is that it's a mobile game through and through. Even the Steam version has ended up as less of a port and more of an emulation of the original iOS game. All of the needless clicking, microtransations, and timers that are ubiquitous in the mobile market - and so out of place on the PC - are still alive and well here.

The concept of the game itself is simple enough: build a Vault that produces enough food, water, and energy for its dwellers to survive and also protect them from random dangers. The means of producing those necessities and the dangers interrupting that pursuit have a few subtle variations, but exploring the wasteland and embarking on quests are the only things that actually break up the monotony. The dialogue during those quests and the journal entries a dweller makes while out in the wasteland are both surprisingly and darkly hilarious. Combining this clever writing with the excitement of collecting new items, the time spent outside of the Vault invigorates time spent inside it. However, that feeling can only last so long before the staleness of the majority of the experience overwhelms it. The same can be said about customizing dwellers or upgrading their equipment. More options, many of which are obviously worse than others, cannot make up for the fact that there's nothing more to do with them.

Fallout Shelter was made as a promotional tool and the attempt to grow past its beginnings by adding more content has not changed that fact. Modular pieces shoddily rearranged over and over again, sadly, do not make for exciting experiences. And yet, I've spent well over a hundred hours in this game, not counting the time I spent playing it on iOS. Something about Fallout Shelter certainly seems to appeal to me. I just wish I could figure out what it is.
"
15919,"TLDR:  If you want to binge play this game as soon as you install it, you'll need to spend some $$$ (lunchboxes are best IMHO).  If you can only play for a few minutes in the morning and at night, you can still be happy and spend no money.  To understand more, read the long review below.

My wife and I were traveling to Cancun for vacation but the weatherman said it might rain the entire time, so I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab A and installed a few games on it.  Fallout Shelter being one of them (via Google Play).
Before we got on the plane, I made a Vault for myself and purchased some lunchboxes, thinking that my wife and I would share them.  As it turned out, the purchases were PER VAULT.  So, I got a bunch of lunchboxes and my wife had none.  She wasn't too concerned because she isn't that big of a gamer and did not think she would like this game.

I eventually opened all of my lunchboxes (waited 5 minutes between them to spread out the happiness) and although most of them were useless resources that I did not need, I got 2 ""Preston Garvey's"" a ""Three Dog"" a lot of caps and some other high stat settlers.  Now, you might ask if I thought it was worth the real $$$ I spent.
The high stat settlers and the extra caps allowed me to build a large base quickly and send out multiple wasteland expeditions which allowed me to do a lot of quests soon after purchasing the game.

My wife on the other hand, decided to play without lunch boxes and so she spent a lot of time unable to do anything except watch me play.  Life in the vault moves sloooowly unless you have a lot of vault dwellers.

The weather in Cancun turned out to be pretty good, so we took turns playing while on the plane, in the mornings before heading to the beach and at night after dinner.  We checked our vaults a few times during the days that had an afternoon rain shower.

By the end of the real-time week, I had a massive base, had done a lot of quests and was cranking out high level weapons and gear.  My wife managed to keep up with me as she found 2 Mr Handy robots in lunchboxes and they gave her the edge she needed to keep up with me.  Plus, she was better at finding the Mysterious Stranger and that earned her a lot of extra caps.  Keep in mind that she spent NO real-life money on the game.  It just took her longer to get to the same point in the game where I was.

When we returned home, I decided to install it using Steam and found out that my vaults were non-transferrable.  So, the $$$ I spent on the Google Play account meant nothing to the Steam version.  Just pointing this out for those who are curious.
I have been playing the Steam version for a few days now and it is dreadfully slow without spending money on it.  My wife is still playing the tablet version and is having more fun than I am since she has a fully developed vault.

Once the vault is fully developed, there does not appear to be an end-game.  You just keep sending your dwellers on quests until you get bored of it.

That said, we had more fun playing Fallout Shelter on the tablet than any of the other tablet games I purchased on Google Play.  It was fun to take turns with the wife and watch as she played a game that she did not anticipate enjoying.  

I can imagine this being a good purchase for parents looking to keep their kids occupied if you have a large screen tablet (due to the graphic details, I suspect this would be horrible to play on a phone unless zoomed in all the way).  Just make sure the kids can't purchase stuff using real $$$, because the game makes it VERY easy to spend a lot of cash if you want to.

Moving settlers on the tablet was easier with a little rubber-nibbed pointing device and somewhat difficult with my large fingers.  Moving setters with a mouse on the Steam version is as easy as you would expect.

There you have it.  I recommend it as long as you understand what you are getting yourself into.  If you are expecting to install it and play for hours and hours right away... break out your credit card.  If you are looking for something to waste a few minutes a few times a day, this is perfect.  Once you get further into the game, you can decide if you want to spend more time doing quests.

Here are a couple of pieces of advice:  
1) Breeding new settlers is ultimately better than using the radio.  Breed high stat males with high stat females.  Genetics matters.  Also, brothers and sisters will not mate, so keep that in mind when choosing names, to make it easier to keep track of who is related to who.

2) As soon as you get the Endurance Training room, train your people up.  High endurance means more health and longer survivability.  Although, the bonus is NOT retroactive.  Training a level 1 to max Endurance is more beneficial than training a level 20 to max Endurance.

3) Save Nuka-Colas for quests with expiration times.  Some quests must be finished in a short amount of time and colas will get your people there and back.

4) Dying only costs caps.  Do not be afraid to take chances since you can revive anyone and replay any mission that you fail.... as long as you have enough caps.

5) Put your first large power plant on the top floor opposite of the vault door.  That way you have 6 dwellers with high Strength ready to meet the raiders who bust through your vault door.

6) Have Fun!"
15920,"Was a very fun game to play while it lasted but the replayability just went to non existant after a while so this game would need a lot of updates and fresh ideas to actually be good to play. I do reccomend if you want 10 or so hours of fun, but for the whole game I can't."
15921,Very fun game but extremly difficult to get far into the game without buying the microtransactions which can be annoying and to costly since they don't always help.
15922,Best game tbh https://rakion99.github.io/shelter-editor/ better with this
15923,It's free-to-play and very well made.  It's cute.  Good luck getting all the achievements!  (Look at my hours to see what I mean!)
15924,ADDICTIVE.....VERY ADDICTIVE
15925,"To the suprise of noone, it looks and plays like a mobile game. Great for careless gaming while watching netflix. Not optimised for mouse-control, and some of the micro-management is annoying, but overall awesome and fun game. Stay clear of the microtransactions."
15926,"Really great time killer.
Only problem is: I started playing on PC. There is no way to get my valut on mobile version or is there ?"
15927,Its a sim. and sims never change but its fun. not something to play for hours straight but something to check up on periodically. get bored a few times but i just made a new vault and kept going.
15928,Its a really good time killer. I will admit it does get repetitive. But I've always like these type of management games.
15929,I've always loved this kinds of games where you basically dictate your character's lives. Will totally recommend this game to those with similar taste.
15930,"This is Free to Play game, but also has elements of ""Pay to Win"" games. An answer from ""Fallout Universe"" to all that farming/building On-Line games, which I found at most s#itty, but there are some - very few - games, which are good.

And this one is great. And playable (still able to reach your achievements) Off-Line indeed.

Old style atmosphere (missed hard from times of Fallout 1 and 2), very conceptual and challenging gameplay. This is not a game, that is ""easy to play"". When you want play this game, you must think ahead your choices and wrong decisions, overconfident and arrogant playing are allways punished.

Like in good old days ( 20 years ago ) in times of first ( isometric and turnbased ) Fallout..."
15931,"Though i haven't played this game too much, I know for sure this game is absoulutely amazing! The artstyle is really nice and innovative. It's a crossover between cartoon and 3D, and i haven't seen that, well... practically anywhere, so that deserves a great big thumbs up from me!

The gameplay itself is laid back and fun to play if you just want to sit on you're ass and relax while playing a not-so-hectic Fallout game.

I'm usually not a very big fan of free games, but this one was executed fairly well, and it definitely deserves some recognition.

To end this review, i just want you to know that you don't need to be a big fan, or even have played any of the Fallout games before to enjoy this.
I strongly recommend you to download the game, and play it for just half an hour or so, and see if you like it."
15932,"It's ridiculous how much time I've spent on this game. It's very addicting. So far, I haven't encountered the save bug, but I make back up of my saves just in case. Great to play when you're taking breaks from your current main game."
15933,Such a good game for free is a great deal. take advantage of this and download it.
15934,"It starts out really amazing and addictive, until you realize how little content there is there: every mission feels the same and there is only a handful different enemies you fight all game. Not to mention the absolute lack of endgame challenge after you have unlocked all rooms."
15935,"Fallout Shelter is a cool little MMO/Simulation game in the Fallout universe. Unlike the main games, there is no single protagonist since you are the Overseer in a vault. When this game first released on the phone back in the day, it was awesome for the first few hours, but once everything was maxed out there was not much left to do. Now, with the new updates, it is like a little MMO too with main quest lines, dailies, weeklies, more armor and weapons to make, theme workshops, and you can even customize your dwellers. The development team did a great job revamping this game and making it a more robust and added a slew of content. I highly recommend if you just want to dabble in a fun little game on PC here and there."
15936,"I never thought I would say this but Fallout Shelter is the most enjoyable mobile games I‚Äôve played.

To make it clear ‚Äì I don‚Äôt play any mobile games. I have no interest in them and I probably won‚Äôt ever gain any interest in them either.
Fallout shelter grabs me differently however ‚Äì the game is very simple but keeps me entertained with all the collectables, minor story elements and scripted quests.

[h1]There are various elements to the Fallout Shelter;[/h1]
[b]Caps:[/b] an in-game currency that can‚Äôt be bought with money, only obtained in game.

[b]Nuka Cola Quantum:[/b] used to rush actions instantly like travelling to a quest destination or training a dweller. This can be earned both in game from quests and lunchboxes or through objectives. If you are desperate you can buy them with real world money

[b]Lunchboxes:[/b] basically - loot crates, get weapons, pets, quantum, caps, dwellers and more. These can rarely be earned via objectives and quests but also bought from the store with real world money.

In addition to all this, rooms build instantly, there are multiple upgrades of rooms that may require caps (currency) along with a specific population count (as a means of progression I assume), there are 3 objectives that range from mundane ‚Äúcollect x‚Äù all the way to more specific ‚Äúhave x bald dwellers‚Äù. These objectives either pay out in caps, quantum, lunchboxes or pets. When you complete an objective, you get a reward and a new objective. You can skip 1 objective per day.

At the end of each real-time week you get a free lunchbox based on your performance.

I see a lot of comments like ‚Äúit‚Äôs pay to win‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs unsustainable‚Äù ‚Äì to which I reply they must be playing a different game to me, because I‚Äôve never had these problems. Even when I come back to my save file after a good 2-3 days my vault is running fine. I‚Äôm not low on supplies and I have plenty of progress to catch up on.

I have also not spent anything on this game whatsoever. Yet I‚Äôm still enjoying it to its fullest because I am collecting an in-game currency to speed up actions via quests or objectives ‚Äì meaning that I don‚Äôt ever feel the need to buy from the store to enhance my game.

I‚Äôm not playing it with 100% efficiency either. My vault is a real mash of rooms that don‚Äôt work well on the same floor but I‚Äôm still surviving just fine.

[h1]I do have a few issues with Fallout Shelter however;[/h1]

1)	Clicking and assigning dwellers can be a pain as they move about a lot.
2)	There is a steep difficulty curve that straightens out very quickly ‚Äì the game throws a lot at you quickly and then doesn‚Äôt have anything else to ramp up the difficulty with.
3)	There are a lot of rooms that do the same or similar things
4)	Dwellers can be quite small and as such I would recommend either a keyboard and mouse or playing on a tablet.

Overall Fallout Shelter is free and is worth your time if you just want short breaks in your day. It can be very addictive."
15937,"Badly optimized, looks bad on big screen, pay-to-win micro-transaction and get boring after a while."
15938,"I remeber playing it on my mobile in 2015. All of my mates form school were playing this whole day whole night. After 2 years break i'm testing it again. It's really relaxing. It's simple, but it's geting boring after 10-15h. So if you want to play good and free game, it's perfect for you.

8/10"
15939,"Not going to leave a full review, I will say the Raider Achievement is a b*tch obtain, but it's not hard to 100% with a little modding lol. Helps those Steam Stats. te he."
15940,Okay for a sims game this is strangely addictive...and like its wasteland counterpart tough as nails but fucking awesome
15941,"This game, originally for mobile for some who for some reason dont know, is pretty alright in my personal opinion. 

Pros: 
- Collection and growth of your ""Ant-like"" structure of a vault is pretty good
- Gives you a sense of progression as opposed to other games which just beat you down and give you a colder and harder lesson
- Real good graphics and design
- Utilizing the SPECIAL stats in a smart way
- Daily quests just keep on coming and give you a good amount of reward
- Allowed to skip one quest a day
- Micro transactions are pretty much only for Premium currency used for skipping wait times and skipping more quests after the free skip and Vault lunchboxes (admit it, they are lunch boxes) for loot, gear, and Caps 

Cons:
- (this is just me) Frequent crashing almost every time I load and play for a bit
- The major need for good starting gear to defend against radroaches and raiders
- Daily quests are often repetitive and make you do stuff you basically already did, thus wasting your time and caps (money)
- Remember the skipping quest thing? Doesnt always happen

That's all I have to say, I do enjoy this game so far as Im getting through it. I really do recommend trying it out before you read anybody's negative reviews because they mainly have gotten bored of it. If you like building, waiting, collecting, expanding, and repeat, then this is the game for you. Otherwise, it's up to you.

15942,hj
15943,"This is a very addicting game with high maintenance. Basically taking care of your dwellers and making sure they have enough food water and electricity. The only issue I have is whenever i tried building a Overseer's office, the game freezes on the tips explaining how to set up quests. Its permanantly zoomed in, and you can still collect resources but you cant zoom out and or build or continue on with the quests. Overall i give it 8.5/10"
15944,"Great fun game, it's a 2d game shame to say that It is more fun than fallout 4"
15945,i really enjoy this game its challenging but fun
15946,"This game is about making a new vault,then ensign the dwerllers to work in the vault,you will be a manager who ensign and create this vault,for me this is best management game in the world,p.s sorry if my english is bad xD,im still learning :p"
15947,"Fun game, but be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting unless you are p2w player."
15948,"[h1]Sims, sims never change...[/h1]

The title pretty much tells you what you can expect in this little apocalyptic-themed little computer people game. As someone who was always curious to get into the Fallout games, this is a nice free alternative to learn about the game universe if you can't purchase the original games or the latest games. But enough of that talk, let's get to the real meat of the game.

You run a vault in the wasteland. Your job is to keep the dwellers happy, productive, and most importantly, alive as you build up your vault so it can hold more people from the wasteland. I have the PC version, so I can't comment much on what happens with the Android version (since I have an Android phone). 

[b]PROS[/b][list]
[*]Considering the grime and bleakness of the Fallout series, this game has a surprisingly cheery look to it. Everything takes from the promo material of Vault Tech and their Vault Boy mascot. The big plus here is that the graphics are clean and easy to read.
[*]The audio mix is pretty ""laid back"" most of the time. The music doesn't try to overwhelm the player, and most of the background noise isn't annoying. Of course, this means whenever there's an attack or failure in one of the rooms, things are really on edge.
[*]Easy to understand gameplay. This is partly because being a mobile game, it gets a very easy to understand interface and everything tells you what you need to truly get the most out of resources and rooms. Just match up the best SPECIAL stats for a given room, use items that boost specific stats, and make the most of your dwellers.
[/list]

[b]CONS[/b][list]
[*]Idling, lots and lots of idling. This shouldn't be surprising for a mobile game (in which the goal is to get money of out people, no offense), but in some cases it feels like there's a bit too much waiting for things that shouldn't require a wait. This is true for quests, in which given the risk/rewards, shouldn't take that long to ""get to it"" and ""get back from it"".
[*]Early-game hell. In most sim games, the early game is supposed to be a sort of ""honeymoon"" period so that the player can get comfortable with what can be done and with what can go wrong. The game however, paired with the idling, can feel very tedious to start off because you simply won't have enough dwellers to get things done. Expect lots of failures when trying to rush facilities, and you might lose a few souls in the early game too...
[*]Clumsy building. For me personally, I feel that placing rooms can be a bit irksome. If you accidentally place the wrong room in the wrong place, you simply can't move it, you have to demolish it for a low refund, and then rebuild it again.
[/list]

[b]MEH[/b][list]
[*]Microtransactions. Again, this is a mobile game, and it's to be expected that good ol' Bethany Esda wants to milk you for money (as if recent trends prior of this post weren't a big sign). However, outside of waiting on a quest or a return from the wasteland, I find that you can just as easily muscle through the game without paying a penny... Besides, some achievements reward Mr. Handy and other rare/useful items.
[*]Repetitive. Well Fallout Boy, this is a sim game, so it's going to feel a bit same-old-same-old after a while due to the nature of what it is. There really isn't a goal except to build your very own Vault Tech vault and perhaps be one of those jerks who uses for an experiment like in the actual games... Or you could try having a vault of nothing but women in lab coats armed with sniper rifles... Really, that's how these games work.

[b]OVERALL[/b]
It's a fun little time waster and for some, a free/cheap easy way into getting to know the Fallout universe. 
"
15949,its a good game but only one thing sucks you have to keep going back to the game to take care of the dwellers
15950,cool crispy beans
15951,No to CC and microtransactions
15952,"good app but we both know this is bethesda just trying to get more money,,,, ""A company wanting money?? OMG!"" I know right, what a shocker and quite obvious but they want you to buy something about at every turn basically begging you to spend your money just like most apps... Don't forget about the fact you can make some of the dwellers bang there own mother... is that the reason for super mutants"
15953,"What a funny and amazing game. I love it. For me it was always too small on the phone-screen, so I am really happy about a PC version. Super cool 10/10"
15954,"Game Crashes multiple times while playing. Glad it auto saves regularly, but it does get a little annoying. Besides that, very fun game to waste time!"
15955,"Fallout Shelter is a fun experience and is perfect for those just wanting to kill time in between other things. The steady supply of in-game items gives the player a consistent feeling of progress without having to spend money on the game. Quests are fun and keeps players engaged even after obtaining all the rooms. However there will be times where the player feels like there is nothing to do at all and could easily forget about it.

PROS:

+ Quests are fun
+ It‚Äôs free
+ Visually pleasent

CONS:

‚Äì Can get boring
‚Äì Not much to do after hitting 100 dwellers

15956,It's a good time killer

15958,"Another Fallout, this time about managing your own crypt. A game that was a mobile hit, shows up on steam. And with what result? Still a hit! I just wish the game was a bit harder."
15959,"In my opinion, this is the best strategy  \(o_o)/"
15960,Just didn't hold my attention.
15961,Good game.
15962,Fun little Time killer!  Starts out slow  but as your Vault grows rapidly  grows to a frantic pace!  Lots of cute little call outs to the Fallout franchise.  The crafting and quest systems add diversity to the gameplay! Thuimbs up!
15963,its basically fallout with a bunker and then you got yourself living in a nuclear fallout situation.
15964,Loved it on my mobile. Now with a bigger screen it is so adictive.
15965,it's great.
15966,"This game isn't great, but it's ok.

If you're fine with playing it for a bit every now and then, it can be good fun: log in, set up your expeditions, expand your base, log out. Log in a few hours later, check how your guys are faring, play your quests, manage your inventory, log out again. Rinse and repeat the next day if you feel like it.

The payment system isn't too intrusive, and f2p is definitely doable. This game might not be liberal with the meaningful rewards, but it's not too stingy either - although you find way too much useless crap in lunchboxes (the game's loot crates), so I can understand why people who paid for them are not too happy with the results.

Also, it's free, so it doesn't hurt to give it a try.

P.S.: If this concept had been developed as a proper strategy game, it might have been really great. Fallout would be a great setting for a fully fleshed out strategical base-building game."
15967,"The first game I have ever rage quit, if you have lots of money and time this is the game for you."
15968,"I played it on my phone, now I play it on pc lol."
15969,celebrate 20 years of fallout. damn i feel old.
15970,"Scam Lunchboxes. 80% of the time, Lunchboxes drop legendary junk instead of weapon/armor or a legendary dweller and legendary junks are not a big deal."
15971,It is very addicting
15972,"To be Honest, this game isn't half bad. It's just some builder, you can have fun with for an hour or so before deleting it. The game belong on mobile as the game consists of waiting, clicking and repeat, while maintaining the vault. I feel like this game runs bad on mobile but feels right, while the PC version is the opposite. I wouldn't really recommend downloading this game, you will be bored out of your mind just waiting for something to happen."
15973,i think you don't need to play this
15974,fun
15975,"A clever little game for all the part-time Fallout fans out there.  This game is a time-suck with very little pay off.  There is some strategy to the game, but is ultimately the same.  There is very little replay value once you get past the initial unlockings (which you can accomplish in a day if you try).  The only story here is the one that is in your head.  With all these negatives, it's still free and occasionally fun, but still can't give it a thumbs up, because they want you to spend money on random drops."
15976,"Good game, except:
every time i play it crashes with ""display driver stopped responding"" and no one gives a **** about to fix..."
15977,"great game, gets repetitive though"
15978,Great addictive time killer.
15979,I like dis game!
15980,"It's easy, and surprisingly addictive for me. No need to buy anything from this, but it's okay of you want, but don't really bother that much because this game nearly gave you out the item freely and easily"
15981,[h1][b]<3[/b][/h1]
15982,"Fallout Shelter is by far my most favorite app (adapted to PC) to play. Build, craft, explore, and repopulate the wastland in this Vault-Tec approved sim. Controls are basic just point and click. It has a typical do some task and wait mechanics. Which is great if you want something to fill in gaps between life and playing other games. The in game purchases are not required since you can earn them for free for just playing. Continued event updates keep adding new things to the game."
15983,"just played this game for the first time. I knew about it since it's creation but assumed it was like all the other pay to play games out there. I was wrong. There is no need to buy anything to play this game successfully and enjoyably although if you choose to, the option is there. a totally enjoyable play but a warning--it is a bit addictive."
15984,"Very fun, a definite 5-star. I play mobile edition too, and it's good, but this has WAY more features. No lag, which is a big plus, and just a good game overall."
15985,"Shameless cash-grab-freemium-playtofun game. Played for 100 minutes felt like several hours, honestly."
15986,"Simple, fun, relaxing little game that you can play without an Internet connection. Its biggest flaw is that it attempts to squeeze money out of players by making things like traveling to missions and crafting gear take ridiculously long times, in many cases real life days. Change the time on your computer to avoid having to wait days just to craft a gun or travel to quests. Its second biggest flaw is that the game saves progress insecurely locally making it very easy to cheat and edit saved games. The combination of very long wait times and insecure saves is a recipe for cheating the game, even just to make it more enjoyable. Don't believe anyone's excessive progress is real; they either spent money, changed the time on their computer repeatedly, or edited their save games. After a while the game does get fairly repetitive with a lack of surprises and no multiplayer competition to keep it interesting. However, even after playing to the point of boredom, it's still fun to load up and attempt to further optimize vault performance from time to time. The fact that it is free is a big pro towards earning a thumbs up."
15987,"Pros:
Who is indisputably the most important person in Vault 101: He who shelters us from the harshness of the atomic wasteland, and to whom we owe everything we have, including our lives? 
1. The Overseer 
2. The Overseer 
3. The Overseer 
4. The Overseer
Cons: 
-Dwellers sometimes no clip
-When the vault is being raided dwellers must be directly ordered to the right room and most of the time their just crap with attacks."
15988,Quests are usually reseted b4 finished
15989,waiting simulator 2017......would wait again
15990,godo
15991,Why don't you make MAC version ?
15992,A fun little time waster that puts you in control of your very own vault. This game best serves as an app because even a day or two of not playing the game at all leads to mass shortages of food water and power which really screws up a developing vault but becomes less of a problem once you have 5 or 6 merged and upgraded rooms for each resource.
15993,Just a fun and clever game to kill some time!
15994,k
15995,I love it
15996,This game is good much fun it will keep u hooked for hours.
15997,"thank u for make this game bethesda
but,MOD KOK BAYAR? >:("
15998,Gets boring fast - don't bother.
15999,GG
16000,A game I play when I am bored... played it on my phone a lot. Definetly recommend!
16001,:)
16002,"I mean, it's a fun game. If you're bored, hit play, and have fun. But time goes by, it can be repetitive and sort of boring. But I like and respect the idea of the game since I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series! So, go fun yourself!"
16003,I like evry thing in the game
16004,"Click, collect, repeat. Klaxon sounds starting panicking and hope it's not Deathclaws. Otherwise, click, collect repeat."
16005,"I've played this game on all platforms, from tablet to bethesda's own launcher to now the steam client.

This is a better game than Fallout 4, it's alot of fun to just max everything out, unfortunatly there's little reason to play afterwards.

There really isn't any ""endgame"", once you feel like you're done playing, that's when you stop.

I haven't spent any money on any of the platforms and i have easily used more than 200hours combined on this game, well worth the time.

The PC version even has mods!
Now you can play without some of those annoying f2p mechanics.

I'd recommend this for what it is, a f2p game that you can play for hours without using any money, if that's your thing go ahead and play it!"
16006,"A great little casual mangement game set in the Fallout universe.

Can get a bit repetitive once you have an established vault but then you just start a new one.

"
16007,not bad but you have to constantly play if you want to not die
16008,"It started off free, now i've spent over $100 on this game please help me!"
16009,another pointless port why?
16010,"Great time suck.  Fun little quests, lots of busy stuff to do.  Felt like I got things maxed out a little too fast, but overall I really enjoyed this game."
16011,"Cash grab, nuff said.
Any good psychologist will tell you that this game is manipulative."
16012,Like minecraft with guns
16013,"People keep complaining about games like this, how it is trash and what not and will kill the series. I played it on my phone and occasionally on my computer. I have nearly every item and tons of legendary followers and I haven't spent a dime on it. It's just something fun to do while passing the time. I love Fallout and I think it's a neat little game. Chill out."
16014,Timepass game no use wasted 2 hrs in it T_T
16015,game is great M8
16016,"The game itself is fun. But never, ever, spend your money on this game. Even when the package is too tempting. Play it free, seriously.
The missing save files bug is ridiculous, even when you already backed them up. You'll lose your progress, and your money. It will happen anyway, sooner or later.
*Saying goodbye to my $10"
16017,"great game,very addictive. good for time wasting. includes alot of waiting seems to much like a moblie app.most people will end up spending some money on this. or just chnge the time on your computor like i did lol."
16018,"I must say, I had a lot of fun at the beginning: The quests and the sudden places to explore, the pets, etc... The problem is that all is really REALLY repetitive. The only reason I kept playing was for the achievements, but since it's almost impossible to get 20 Legendary Dwellers to get the 100% (unless you buy lunchbox like crazy but I would never spend money on a game like this), I just got too bored and stopped. Hope they can improve the game to make it more interesting and fun, it has potential."
16019,Gets boring fast so I wont recommend this on Steam. Id recommend it on a phone.
16020,"So i started playing this game a few days ago,totally have been loving it. They just had a sale pop up today so i was considering spending some money,cuz well i like to support games i like,and im happy to get in game currency or w/e. Well prior to doing so i happened upon some reviews,some of which r quite concerning. Corrupted save files....,like really..,i cant imagine a worse type of bug to have in a game,im completely disgusted to learn of this,and also shame on game develepors these days who just wanna pump out half finished material filled with bugs n glitches then just move onto the next thing withuot ever fixing them and saying to hell with the consumer. It's absolutely disgusting what the video game industry has turned into thanks to greed etc... I have played video games since atari and it was great when dev's put out games that were for the most part functional,granted the convenience of patching these days is fantastic but it should not come at the cost of lazy devs constantly screwing us. I will not recomend this game,nor will i spend money on it. Probably will not even play it again. I can do without the anger i will feel and when the game breaks and ruins my saves. You know it's just a matter of time.  I'm very disappointed. I was really into the game but after learning of such impactful bad occurances it doesnt seem worth my time. Thanks for the broken game losers...Seems to b par for the course with games these days."
16021,great game really  graphics are awesome and lots of stuff to do the only thing that bothers me is the fact you can't move rooms around once their played
16022,"Very addicting killing and dating simulator.
This game will help you get dates.
10/10"
16023,"Great game!
It's great how it's free.
I like the way it's all layed out with the quests and vault system etc 
pest part is IT'S FREE so if you dont like it now biggie"
16024,Like  the game but unless you have endless hours to play and check it everyday everybody in your place will die if you play this you have to have a lot of free time
16025,WE NEED CHINESE
16026,"I am Dictator, I bang all woman, no one makes babies but me.
10/10

ps. only women are allowed in the vault."
16027,"Vault Shelter is a nice peaceful game with amazing graphics, gameplay, mechanics, and is overall fun."
16028,"Nice game (for the first 4-6 hours anyway), but it's pretty darn repetitive with the most note-worthy thing being the addition of quests once you make an Overseer Office. The rest is a pretty basic resource management routine that has little to no variety, even the weapons ultimately work the same no matter how fancy they look. Theres nothing new to experience and given this is by Bethesda I'm skeptical that this'll get any of the care I think it deserves. It could be amazing because like I said it's a nice game with an appealing artstyle (cept the dreads those dreads look awful on everyone) and some legitimately funny dialogue, but the redundancy isn't even fulfilling because even the rewards are redundant. Don't even get me started on the bugs, when I first started playing the issues with click and dragging people made me think it was my mouse's fault for a minute and from what I understand these are longstanding issues, so it'll be a pleasant surprise if they're ever fixed."
16029,Don't believe the quest level requirements
16030,Enjoyable killing time simulator.
16031,"A free to play game done right. Sure you can spend a lot of money to unlock everything, but you absolutely don't have to. Everything can be unlocked in the regular game with enough (not unreasonable) time."
16032,Had a kid born with male pattern baldness
16033,Can't recommend games where losing profile saves is a known issue that never gets fixed. :(
16034,its a port from phones/tables and it GREAT
16035,"Fun, engaging, not as much violence as fallout,  and feels like sims but with guns












And hey, it's freeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!"
16036,"It gets boring pretty soon, but its ok."
16037,"i cant build the overseers office,because if i build it,i can not see anymore the food/water/power details,i can not zoom in/out, i can not save,just close the game,and the office is dissepearing when i start the game again... if i build again,i have the same problem. I reinstalled the game,but the problem is still the same...anybody have any idea how to fix this? by the way the game is very addictive...:)"
16038,this game is great for my Autisim!
16039,"As a fan of the series since the original Fallout, had to try this.

Controls are clunky, such as selecting and displacing Dwellers from room to room, especially during raids. During raids, raiders just leave a room and change room even while they are being shot at, Dwellers do not follow !  Was not successful in selecting more than one Dweller at a time to displace them, making the task of moving them a bit tedious

There is a lack of action rapidly - having to wait for resources is meh; had a 20 min straight consisting of just clicking the comlpetion of resources labels. Feel like you cannot make things happen. (no micro-transactions)

The concept have great potential, and maybe is more enjoyable as a mobile game, but as is it is quite limited; or maybe Dwarf Fortress just wasted me forever enjoying underground sims."
16040,Good game to waste time. 10/10 <3
16041,Time consuming but overall a nice game.
16042,it's a little slow to get started but a fun game :)
16043,"- Can't sell item in bulk, must sell per 1 item or all items.
- No End Game
- Controls are decent, but towards to bad"
16044,"I had hopes for this game when I first started it, but as I got further, it looks like more and more of a money grab game.  Gameplay is tediously boring without bying the nuka cola to speed things up.  If you want to play free, don't expect to get more than say 15 minutes of play every 12 or so hours.  It takes 3 hours to bith a child, then another 3 to raise them up to adult.   Once you can get the overseer office to do quests, be ready to wait 2-8 hours just to do the quest, then another 2-8 hours to get the reward from the quest.  If you want something to fill short bits of time throughout the day, sure this can fill that without costing.  if you want something to play hours on end, don't look here."
16045,"Very good at the begining but gets kinda boring after awhile. Thankfully they add a lot of new content to keep it interesting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liB0pL2lgCA"
16046,ok ............................................
16047,THIS GAME IS BOSS LOVE IT EXPLAINING IT WOULDNT DO IT JUSTICE  IT HAS A RPG FEEL MIXED WITH A TIME KILLER SOME MISSIONS YOU GOT TO WAIT ON BUT NO WORRIES THERE IS TONS OF ACTION WHILE YOU WAIT YOUR NEVER STUCK FOR FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT IT DOWNLOADS FAST IT IS EASY TO LEARN YOU DONT EVEN NEED A TUTORIAL
16048,"Very fun, an easy time consumer. Most of all it is free. :)"
16049,"Is gud if you like this type oof gamae
"
16050,"Just like the mobile version, except bigger because its on PC. Fun passive game."
16051,Better than fallout 76
16052,Amaizing!
16053,"I enjoy this game very much, but having one game on my Android phone and my desktop can be confusing. Do you think you an add cloud files so I can use the same save on my phone?"
16054,nice
16055,Very fun game to pass time! 10/10 recommend
16056,This is a pretty sweet game. I love the gameplay because even though it isn't 100% unique it still has a lot of unique features that make this game #1
16057,"Computer crash
Lost all progress

11/10 would crash again"
16058,Fun game
16059,"It's super boring, and also there is not much to do."
16060,"It's pay to win, so don't have any expectations. but there is some fun in it. The animations are really nice and cool. 
They have to lower their attacks, not even recovered from a previous attack, a group of molerats kills 9/10 of my polutation, game over!"
16061,"First, it's free. Kind of. I've spent $5.00 on Nuka Cola. I've spent a stupid amount of hours on this game, with 90% of them in the first couple of months. I loved this game! Now, I'll visit it 3 or 4 times a week just because my OCD wants every character to be level 50 (6 left). It'd be nice if they would add different things occasionally, but they're making money, so why cater to a sheep? After a period of time, it becomes VERY repetitive. I'd love to find something similar, but with better graphics, and 1000% more variation. Still, give this a shot. I was addicted, if only for a while."
16062,good game 9/10

16064,"Absolutely amazing game. At least that's what it would be if it didn't CRASH EVERY 2 SECONDS! I'm not even exxagerating, I'll launch it over and over just to do the smallest things!"
16065,"This game is awesome and fun! The only con is the f*cking Radscorpion. It is unbalanced, random, unfair and can (possibly will) ruin your gameplay for good."
16066,"i have an 8 year old black friday special, 8 gigs of ram, 2.4 quad core amd, and a 560 ti 2gig card.
the game runs great on it, windows 7.
i have been playing mechwarrior, elite dangerous, diablo3 .. with great results.. it is still a beast..granted,  i'm not getting 600 fps.. but a steady 20-60 on high graphics.
i had a stroke in december, so that is the range of games i can play, and thios fits in that category just fine.
it is a game that runs off the clock, do somethign, and wait for them to complete it.
when they are done, set them up with another task.
now early on, it's about getting some people togther and getting a smooth running system, one you get an overseer;s office, then the fun begins... sorta.. also the waiting.
it takes tiome to get to placers on foot, especially in the wastelands. so you're goona do some waiting.  send some folks on mission, wait for them to get there, do the mission, wait for them to get back. 
set some fiolks in the weight room, etc anmd check on them in the morning, aftyer work, and bedtime.  do other things in the meantime.
this is how it's meant to be played, casually.
-
but you have options.
dig up your save file, make a folder, and frequently drop a copy in the folder.
why, i dont know, i see people whining about losing saves.. but if you have a bad mission, you can copy the save out of the folder and try again.
-
there are ways to stock up on nuka-cola, and skip all the wait times.
that makes it a functional game.  there are pets which make the wait times a lot less, which are handy, i'll wait 30 minutes for someone to get hame, as oppossed to 4 hours.
-
yes, you could cheat your way into abnlivion, but that is no fun, jsut use that nuika cola for travel wait times.
and do the mornuing, after work, and bedtime scheduile.  and thjis will be a good game.
-
i've got 27 hours in theos game so far, and the nice thing is, since it uses the clock, you wont have to leave it on all night like X3 series.  
so get one thing, a starter pack, and cut loose, you will find most of the nuka cola you will need with the quest system, and if you touch base with the game in those three zones, it will be great.
-
it would be great if we could get some riding animals , some nuclear powered motorcyles.
find a fuel cell and save yourself some wait time.
but , the wasteland never had vehicles.
-
aslo would be nice iof you could take a team and send them off to create a vault of their own.
these 6 guys, and poof go create another vault, that is your new game.

16068,"Great side gaem but it does get very repedative and dull after you mastered the balance of resources. Some people I know, (wife) can't get enough and play this endlessly. Don't get me wrong it is an amazing product for the price and fun side game to the Fallout franchise. Worth a try and I think almost anyone will love it for two weeks and like it for two more."

16072,gud game 5/5
16073,Better than fallout 4
16074,Fun and addicting but gets boring after a while
16075,The game is pretty confusing and is hard to follow. If you are going to get this game don't get it. 0/10
16076,It's more like a game to pass the time and to check it daily. If you have some extra time on your hand this game will help
16077,"Fallout Shelter is a brilliantly thought-out game. It's fun and addictive, and the graphics are imaginitive and amusing. However, it glitches something terrible. My son got up to ten dwellers, before he had to abandon the game. I reached a lofty thirty dwellers before it froze, and failed to add the latest babies. And then it failed to reload. Since my computer is brand new and meets all specs requirements, I can only assume that there is a subscript error in the game itself. And, since there's no help site to contact, this is a huge let-down. I would love to recommend this game, but sadly I can't. If I'd known about the glitch beforehand, I would not have added it to my play-list. If it was pay-to-play, I wouldn't buy it. Very disappointed."
16078,ez
16079,"Its free which is a bonus and fun for a while, for most part on the mobile more than pc because this is a mobile phone game and more customized for it. I found there are quite a few bugs that i have never experienced on the mobile phone (2 different handsets) making it annoying for pc play sometimes. Recommended for Mobile"
16080,"Fun and good value game for fans of a casual Fallout experience. For those who don't mind a bit of a grind, there's still enough Role-playing elements to customize their own experience."
16081,"Fantastic game play, but can get a little repetitive in the late game. All-in-all one of my personal favorite games."
16082,Couldnt even get it to work. gg?
16083,Fun simple f2p game.
16084,Cannot play. Phone game designed to fleece money by way of gambling addiction micro-transactions. Boring.
16085,The story follows a bunch of incestual cannibals rebuilding society.
16086,"meh, it's fine.
download it, IT IS quite enjoyable :P"
16087,"Fallout Shelter is a dungeon master type simulation game set in the Fallout universe. It nails the visuals, theme, lore and feel of the Fallout games, fits into the universe. You play as the overseer of an underground fallout shelter managing the dwellers and trying to keep them alive.
The game opens up once you build the Overseer's office, because it lets you send dwellers on missions and fight enemies, explore and loot locations, that gives a needed variety to the game.
I have played it on my Android tablet and that actually fits the gameplay well. Still, controlling would have been better on a PC with a mouse. Very often happened that I only wanted to scroll the view, but I accidentally moved a dweller to another room. Annoying.
The game was designed for mobile devices, it is not for continuous playing, because it has crafting, training and traveling times that can be pretty long on higher levels. I had fun with it for a couple of weeks as a secondary game I would play when I had 10-15 minutes to do a mission or two.
The game is free-to-play with micro transactions, but it is well done, does not actually force you to buy anything. Of course the usual money grabbing tactics apply, like special pets, money and resource packs, speeding up training, crafting and traveling times by a special item, and so on. But everything can be looted in missions or crafted as well, 
so you are not forced to buy it, I played without paying any real money.
The basic tutorial is OK, but some game mechanics are not explained at all.
If a dweller dies and is resurrected, he forgets his assignment, and needs to be assigned to his post again, 
otherwise he will just aimlessly wonder around the Vault.
Crafting is nice and simple for normal and rare weapons and armor, but crafting legendary items takes a disproportionately long time (making a power armor with trained dwellers took 8 actual days!)
Combat is a bit too simplistic, you basically send your team of dwellers to a room and watch as they kill the enemies 
while pumping your injured team members with health packs. More interesting combat would have been better, this makes the game feel repetitive after a while.
I experienced crashes and long loading times on my tablet, but it is not very powerful, so it could be just my hardware. On my PC there were no such issues.
The attributes of the dwellers are trained in specialized training rooms and not at all during normal work or missions. That is a weird design choice. This way it is possible to train super-humans that excel in everything, from fighting to water purification, but have never actually left the Vault or worked a minute.
Despite its faults, I had fun with it. If you like the Fallout setting, give it a try as a second-screen game!"
16088,"Very enjoyable and relaxing minigame. It is indeed ""free to play"" since there is no need to invest money at all.

"
16089,"This is Some Real Timepass Stuff, First I thought so. Then the more i played i got addicted.
Simple yet in depth variety can make you interested in this game for a long time."
16090,"+download it
+use save editor get lot loot box for free"
16091,"Basically the entire game can be summed up in 8 Simple steps:

Step 1) Send Vault Dwellers on quests  
Step 2) Wait 2 - 12+ Hours  
Step 3) Complete 5 minute quests that are all pretty much identical    
Step 4) Return to vault  
Step 5) Wait 2 - 12+ Hours  
Step 6) Collect resources and Loot from quest 
Step 7) Build/upgrade rooms, upgrade dweller skills, Scrap the trash in your inventory
Step 8) Repeat step 1 - 8

If that sounds appealing and rewarding enough to suck you in then by all means it's a good game but that said it also makes me sad at how this sort of genre and gameplay could have had so much potential if they really put a little more effort into it. Hell add some more enemies/NCP's (Where are the Super Mutants at Bethesda!?) Add interesting quests with speech options and stories that actually equate to something and can we please have more locations than the Red Rocket, The Super Duper Mart and a randomly numbered Vault identical to all the others.

That said I still really like this game for some reason but this could have really been something S.P.E.C.I.A.L (See what I did there) and I guess I'm just a little disappointed with what it turned out to be. At this point I'm 46 Hours in but you have to bare in mind that for a long time I've only been opening this game once a day to try and finish getting all the achievements and if they weren't there or once I've finished them I wouldn't/won't have any other incentive to open the game again."
16092,If you like the fallout games you will like this game.
16093,YES!!  That is all...
16094,"It gets boring very quickly. Bit of fun at the start of the game but then it just starts to become very boring. Also the progretion of the gameis very qiuck and dose not feel earned, it dose not feel like you really worked hard to get it."
16095,Overall this is a fun game ported to PC from moblie so anyone who does not have a phone can still play it and enjoy it
16096,Don't worry about my time played. I wasted plenty of time on the Bethesda launcher playing this crap only to get my progress eaten and never returned. No fixes either. They don't care about you or any money you stupidly spent. Taste that? Yeah it's the flaming regret from putting time and care in this game.
16097,tedious and boring on mobile and even worse on PC... fun for about a day or 2 then you have seen it all.
16098,I think fallout is best game on steam!!!!! But there are some things i would like to change firstly the time it takes to produce radway. also the the time to produce water and power.
16099,"Well. It is a good game. Somewhat similar to Eve-Online skill que system, except it is more interaction. Everyday, I log in, play with it for 5-30 minutes, and then do something else. I wanted to see the ""end-game"", which is probably do all the quests and identify every weapons and armor/clothing. I did play this game at good length on mobile version, but I stopped when I got a new phone and... yeah ...

So anyway, it was good distraction. I did spend about $25 or so into it because I did feel it earn my money. Now do I regret it? I suppose you can say yes. Why? Well, be warned. Should your PC EVER to crash mid game, be prepared to say good-bye to your 50+ fully stats dwellers. I did not how how ""significant"" it causes, especially when people like me, did not know the importance of backing up data. I was sure Steam-Cloud is reliable, but not for this game it seems ... That $25 bucks went down the drain and can't never be used again, even for new vaults. (No really, I don't really care or its a big deal, but you know?)

This happened almost a month ago and I decided no more playing this product (or any ANY mobile-related games, even on my phone to play with). If my PC didn't crash back then, would I still play? For sure, yes when you did NOT know about PC crashing bugs your save game. :) FYI, my PC crash was un-related to the game, but it WAS running at the time."
16100,"Great afk game to play if you're at work, school and just wanna log on and just do a normal routine this game is actually the game for you I would say the game needs some updates on how we can view our characters but other than that the game is pretty good if u wanna just grind and afk"
16101,"controls are a bit scetchy, but overall a great game."
16102,"Fallout Shelter is a great time killer and very addictive! Played this so much on my phone when it first came out... Can be difficult at the start, but will gradually become easier. A great addition to the Fallout series!"
16103,"First of all.
Disable internet.
Then change time. (For example in a 1 hour mission just change hour from 6pm to 7pm)

16109,"GOOD AND FUNNNY, BUT REPETITIVE"
16110,"Not bad for a free game. As someone who played this via both Android and PC, the game is extremely buggy when played on PC compared to Android. Issues included audio chopping in and out, sub-par game mechanics, and a major bug that corrupts the save file when the game is closed improperly (e.g. Power outage, laptop battery dies).

I invested about 20 hours into my first vault and both my save and backup save were corrupted. Upon opening the save files, all the coding for the save had been wiped with no way to retrieve it. So while fun to play in between other games, I would not recommend making any in-game purchases or playing when there is a chance the game may improperly close."

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then for the low low price of free, you can enjoy all these things. with animated smug little people, giant roaches, Deathclaws, and Mr. Handies. Give your people clothes, give them guns. Then force them out into the wasteland to scavenge for supplies, or work them endlessly to keep the shelter afloat. This game can be played completely for free. there is zero need to invest any cash into it. however the little starter pack really doesnt hurt."

And its even better playing it VIA Steam.

"
16127,"It is a mobile game for pc, but it's still fun.
Just play it for like 15 minutes and then do something else, 
check up on your vault every so often and you will have a good time.
It's a nice break from other games and tasks, also a bit addictive.

And don't bitch about the micro transactions, they are optional and not required to enjoy the game.

Conclusion:
It's fun to play a few times a day, for a few minutes up to a hour.
The micro transactions just makes things easier, but buying that would ruin the game.
The starter pack is fun though, gives you a better start."
16128,A great moble game on PC? Why not I'll definitely take it.
16129,"F*** this game.

16131,"I'm not sure of the purpose. It'd be neat if you could tie in your single player toon somehow.... they missed the mark on this me thinks.

It's needs something that evokes enjoyment when the tedium kicks in. I wasn't that entertained and it's charm wasn't enough to offset the lack of inventive interactions. There were so many possibilities and Beth settled with this turd of an attempt.

I broke two playstations playing 1, 2, 3, and NV. This little bit failed to tap into any of that. 

on a 1 to 10, it's meh. 

_____

in a word:

Pathetic."
16132,"Fallout shelter, I was having fun with it. I have ~85 hours in it. 
I checked back everyday to check on my Vault Dwellers who ran out and collected loot for me. I ran quests to get all the achievements and what not. I was crafting weapons and legendary weapons after getting the thousands and thousands of caps neccessary for making them. And Finally I got tons of dwellers skilled up to have 10s in every SPECIAL stat.

It was fine you know, menial gameplay that I was enjoying.

But I didn't know that if your computer just crashes while you are loading your game, you lose your files. 
They are gone. Corrupted. And unretrievable.

The game uses a sync feature but that doesn't help at all. Say goodbye to your 80 hours you spent in the game over the countless days trying to grind up to high skills and high weapons. Say goodbye to all 200+ vault dwellers, all those Micro-Transaction lunchboxes, and everything you've worked for.

A game shouldn't have a game breaking bug like this with NO warning. I would have given this game a 7/10 but after all this, I have to give it a 1/10.

Who in their rightmind never fixes this bug? It's happened on smartphones and PC! It's just ridiculous.

16159,Fun and great way to burn time. At first you have pleanty to do starting out but once your in the late game it starts slowing down a bit.
16160,"in game purchases do not work. steam wont refund, and tell you to contact Bethesda, and Bethesda tell you its a steam issue and to contact them"
16161,"It's good, but there's a bug that resets your objective progress (almost?) every time you enter a wasteland quest or encounter, which is game-breaking and has been in the game for years."
16162,"This game is beautiful in its simplicity, yet incredible in its complexity. One thing that I really appreciated is that it's not an ""Insert Money To Continue"" game, in that there are in-app purchases, but the game is still fun without them."
16163,"If you have 10-15 min. now and then, this is a game you can play now and then. It is free to play, but then you need to wait for turns and time before you gain a next level or can do some more missions. Payment options is there as well, but the cost  vs the fun you get out of it is way to high! I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series, and this gives me something to do on my pad or phone when on breaks!"
16164,"Fallout Shelter is a waiting game that you get hooked on for a day or two and then forget about it completely.

You build a vault and send your dwellers to quests. 
You may think quests are good, but they are the same recycled copy and paste quests like in Fallout 4 - You go somewhere, talk to someone or kill something or loot something and thats it. Dont get me started on the level design in quests, there isnt any.

Enemies in this game are simply damage sponges - they take 8 quintillion mini nukes and show no response. And if that wasnt bad enough, almost every room in quests has 2 or 3 bullet sponge cockroaches.
And if THAT wasnt bad enough, once you have some high level stuff going on, you have deathclaws attacking your vault, which take ages to kill and they dont even drop anything. And they are so common, because when you send your dwellers to quests frequently, theres like 1/3 chance of deathclaw attack.

The item collecting is miserable.
There is a wide variety of clothing and weapons, but you only find bb guns, .32 pistols, hunting rifles and sawed off shotguns. The rest you have to craft and find in quests.

The graphics are decent for a mobile game, but the animations aren't all that good. The characters dont even hold guns properly.

To sum it all up, this game is wide as an ocean but deep as a bucket. The game is very empty and unfinished."
16165,"Overall it is a good little time killer. Not anything I would leave open and stare at, but I do check it a few times a day. It takes a little while to ""balance"" food water and electricity. Without clean water you slowly take radiation poisin, without food they slowly take damage, and without power the rooms will begin to shut down. Best advice is to not make a whole lot of babies at once. As far as free little games go this one gets thumbs up =)"
16166,Good game to have off on another moniter while your playing different game so you can go back to it and do stuff with it.And is a good game
16167,"If you are looking for a free game to play here and there for less than a hour, at a time, then here you go.  You can easily play the entire game without paying for anything, and has enough complexity to give you the feeling to play it again and again."
16168,"It's a neat base-management mobile game come to Steam. Not much else to it.

First and foremost, if you're planning on playing this fullscreen, you might want to look elsewhere. This game is incredibly slow-paced. Play it windowed, off to the side, while you watch YouTube videos or the news or wait for a real game to install. It is a MOBILE GAME, and plays as such.

You build your very own Vault, and micromanage the residents within. You construct rooms, send brave souls out into the wasteland to scavenge for materials, fight fires, manage your three main resource pools, fight off raider attacks... For a mobile game, let alone a free mobile game, it's quite something.

It's obviously marketed to Fallout fans, but I don't think there's any reason a newcomer to the franchise would be scared off. 

I really like it. I've actually got about 40 hours in it before Steam picked it up and haven't paid a cent. You can buy speed-up items if you're a small impatient child with unsupervised access to your mom's credit card, but otherwise it's just not worth it.


It's free, and surprisingly comprehensive for a mobile game. Give it a shot."
16169,eh fun for a while.. missions in the waste and quest are the best part of this game but i takes too long to get to them and you cannot do them all that often so your left waiting for hours just to get some action

Most likely delete the game now that this has happened to me... as there's no way of restoring my vault and I can not be bothered to do it all again."

16177,I hate myself...
16178,"The first hour or five feel like Sim Tower with guns. Awesome.
However after that initial rush, you realize you've seen really everything this game has to offer. No new enemies. Incrementally harder versions of the same 5 or so challenges. And the incentive to spend countless hours making weapons that function mechanically the same way as the junk you started with. And so the repetition begins...

If it's ever developed into something of real substance, this could become a classic. The very concept Sim Vault has a ton of potential. It's just a shame that Shelter doesn't really achieve any of it

TL;DR: The game has some great ideas going for it. However, the longer I played the more I realized just how thin they'd been stretched out. Not a bad game; I enjoyed the experience for a while. But looking back on it all, it's not one I'd be quick to recommend."

This is game is very enjoyable when you start playing it, has achievements and that makes game much times better. I can't say about it a lot, but you must try it if you already thinking about is it worth or no. Just do it ! Also there is same game for your phone, but I like the steam version more, I don't know why... This game is so good !

I'm giving it 11/10 and tottaly would pay 10$ if it cost anything, but you getting awesome game for free, so go and play it."

16195,good game
16196,"Definitely one to keep for the ages - especially with all the quests!

If you do not have a powerful computer to play the modern fallout games, this is a useful alternative to get into the universe as the game contains many elements found in Fallout 3 and 4 - it is worth revisiting on the PC as the controls are easier to deal with than with mobile devices - i gave up on my previous record on my iphone to start brand new on the Steam version and man, there have been loads of updates since i last played on my iphone!

A note to those who started playing from the time it was initially introduced - the new functions really make the game a lot harder and the odds of getting rare characters are a lot less than the earlier versions - my iphone record has 3-4 rare characters and so far i have NONE at all in my current STEAM record - so be warned!

Also, one of the fun bits is to do quests for all sorts of things for your vault - i really encourage you to check out the daily, weekly quests and especially those near holiday seasons - halloween 2017 was a real blast as i received the ghost sheet and skeleton attires which i get to keep even after the event!

All in all, it is addictive, yet fun - highly recommend it to anyone who loves to manage things!"
16197,"Overall this game is fantastic. There's nothing quite like it and it's even better that we can play without ads being slammed in our faces every 10 seconds. It's great to play and can get addicted for hours on end; yet I still can't help but wish for more to be added to the game.

Fallout Shelter was great from the beginning but I love the added features over time such as themes for the dining room and bedrooms, but what if we could customise even further than that? Over time it would be great to be able to continuously upgrade our vault doors. At maximum upgrade I still don't get enough time to move workers to defense. Deathclaws do a huge amount of damage, and as you progress in the game you encounter more wasteland creatures but it gets harder to populate, get enough weapons and outfits for each person to defend themselves. Sure the game getting harder is the point but it unfortunately leaves some vaults at the extent of major damage without recovery.

Honestly, the game is awesome for an app processed game! Being on steam as well gives it extra points because I am so on board having it on my phone AND my computer; I can see my little people so much better on the computer, my eyes get tired after a while on the phone. So thumps up x5 for having a steam version of fallout that's free to play!!! So impressed!

Hope to see more stuff like this, would especially love to see more versions of the shelter game; as long as it remains ad free and free-to-play, I'm on board!"
16198,"I've been trying to get the latest achievement of collecting all the characters for years and it's just impossible. (45.3 hours)
Still nothing (163 hours)"
16199,Really good game i can even say that it beats clash of clans xd
16200,"It's buggy, repetitive and badly optimized. Not useless or too boring, but not really worth the hassle either."
16201,"Fallout Shelter (FS) developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released on Jul 31, 2016 for PC platform. According to Metacritic (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-shelter), it has:
[list]
¬†¬†¬†¬†[*]Metascore of 63
¬†¬†¬†¬†[*]An average user score of 5.5
[/list] 

Is this title a worthy additional to the Fallout series? Not everyone will agree to this. Few I knew threw this into the shredder machine [u]without even trying.[/u] 

[quote] The game concept is different. Visually it does not appeal. I am not interested in mobile/mobile port games. I don't fancy sim games. I prefer FPS! [/quote]

While I may be disappointed to hear these words, I've to respect people's opinions. 

FS is the first mobile game developed by Bethesda Game Studios. Unfortunately for me, my mobile phone was unable to run this game. So when it became available on Steam, I grabbed it immediately & suit up my vault spandex and gears!

What is Fallout Shellter (FS) about?
FS is a rpg + simulation game where you take control of the few survivors in this horrible land and manage them/the vault's survivability activities. You're the vault boss. You decide who gets to wear what/do what/and who gets to have ""happy"" hour. *ahem* 

Base building is simple and straightforward. The prerequisite to unlock a new building is to reach a certain amount of survivors in your vault.

Apart from the common basic rooms that keeps your vault/people alive (power,food,water) you get to build training rooms, 2 form of medic rooms, a weapon & armor crafting room, a theme customization room and finally a hair saloon@character customization.

You can send your survivors on a variety of quests, most of them are fetching types. You will also get a quiz quests. Pick the right answers and you don't need to kill anyone. Pick the wrong answer.. well, lets just say it's a pew pew pew session.

To aid you in this wasteland, you have a robot that helps to defend the vault and also assist you to pick up resources. You also have pets that comes with some form of bonus (weapon damage/damage resistance/more $ or junk pick up and etc). The rest is micro-management. 


Controls, Visuals & Sounds:
Nothing fancy. It's mainly on mouse. 

Visually, It's 2D, cartoonish looking. I am assuming the main target audience are young kids. Despite the art being children-friendly, there is a GREAT DEAL of [b]DETAILS[/b] on everything. Hats, hair, clothing's, weapons, pets, rooms, enemies, objects, animations. Every visual element has been crafted, colored with great deal of effort. Surprisingly, FS is not dark at all. Its pretty and is colorful. This becomes visibly apparent once you are able to craft armor/clothing/theme room. Imagine a room with 6 survivor don in a White cleric like hats and robes. or room with 6 red swim-wears. xD literally its like a mini vault of cos-players..with guns. 

The enemies that in this mad land: Human raiders, creature/monsters; death claws and rad roach/scorpion, moles and ghouls. Each faction has been carefully designed. Some of them will have abilities - especially mini boss/boss fights. The only saving grace which us players have is: 1) Critical Hits 2)Medic/Rad packs 3) Perseverance and if all fails 4) craft a BIGGER gun.

As for the sound, every animation will have feedback sounds. It's simple and sharp. The audio keeps the mood of the game flowing. Good work to the visual & audio team.


Game Mechanics:
There is the base building, the combat, the exploration, crafting, customization, keeping-the-vault-survivor-happy thingy, leveling system, training-stats system. There's a bunch of mechanics in this product. Everything is working as intended - I've not experienced any crash or bugs. Of the surface, people may think this product was designed for kids but if you actually gave it a try, pretty much after a couple of hours, people will realize that there's actually a lot of things going on & incorporated into this product.

One of the things that will keep many players busy is keeping vault survivors happy & leveling up their stats. 
The vault survivors can die. The only way to bring back a dead vault survivor is to revive them by spending credits. Credits rule, baby! Credits play a major role especially base building. Some of these upgrades are freaking expansive. 

Now comes the premium-in-game currency: nuka cola bottles. These colas don't over-write the credits role instead they compliment them. cola's lessens crafting time, sending and calling survivor backs from quest immediately. It also can be used to speed up crafting and base building. a lot. 

Having a ton of credits is like having a sports car. Having colas on the hand, is like having a nitro.


While FS is a free 2 play game, it does have in-game purchases. This is FS's business model. I am not against them because I know, this is a business after all. What I am rather concerened is the legendary dweller. Just how many boxes do i need to open to get 1 ? 

My personal thoughts:
FS is a great game. So many elements has been incorporated into this product to keep players engage. It is fresh and interesting. 

Now, hold on. After 30+ hours into the game. I am having second thoughts. Things are becoming a routine/grind! To make it a mess, if you have above 150 dwellers, you are going to click A LOT. Scrolling the vault becomes a pain when you have a big vault. Identifying dwellers, dragging them around becomes a mess. The spy-like person that comes and goes becomes irrelevant once you have a big vault. You sacrifice your own vault dweller to the wasteland to maintain sanity in your vault management. Rad Scorpion keeps invading your vault and things turn into a big freaking mess. Death left and right, insufficient resources, productivity is low because the entire vault is unhappy -RIPS HAIR ARGHHHH- 

So here's 2 scenario:
1) the game experience does take a dip once everything becomes a routine. When a catastrophic event hits your vault and you stop coming back/When you find yourself repeating the same action over and over again - and you quit. That's the end of its shelf life.

2) However despite all the misery & setback that you've faced and you keep coming back to FS. You know, you either got a special connection with FS/you are person on a mission! That's the 2 major difference in terms of gaming experience.


My Summary:
Despite it's children-friendly visuals, FS was developed for the mass. Not just for the kids. Yes, it may have been ported over from mobile but there were no bugs for me. Some aspect of the UI could be improved. For me, I would love to see:
[list]
[*]a better control in terms of looking/handling vault dweller across the vault. Clicking and dragging one end to the other end may feel a little frustrating.

[*]The same thing could be said about Weapon, Clothing & Junk inventory management. Why cant I set x amount to be sold instead of clicking?

[*]Imagine this, what happens if you send out 50 dwellers to the waste land. With the current UI its gonna be a big mess. I would like a simple, small list. I don't need & don't want to cycle through 50 times!
[/list]

FS left a very strong impression in the first 30 hours. After that it was just routine to keep everything in check and made sure my dwellers were happy. It became a chore. The quests and vault incidents/attacks break up that chore. Achievement was what kept me going.  

*Click & drag myself into the drums room*  It disappoints me but this has to be done. *drums roll*

So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Fallout Shelter is a minced death claw served in rad sauce, worth 6/10. 

As Exquisite this product may be, with long duration of repeated tasks and a lacking objective/a closure to the vault experience, it feels meaningless. It requires so many clicks to perform an action - when a tweak in the UI would save PC gamer all the hassle.

So much to share but I've hit the word limit. 

*Walks out into the wasteland in my vault spandex* Adios Amigos. Peace."
16202,I hate how Bethesda released this game on iOS but absolutely refuses to put it on the Mac! They're dirty hypocrites!
16203,"Better than Build-A-Vault Workshop bullshit on Fallout 4. 

10/10 Would set fire to rooms again."
16204,"A Fallout Farmville? I'm in!

No but all jokes aside this is the typical ""tablet/phone"" game that you will spend each day tending to those things that take time to occur overnight and collect resources and rewards from your dwellers. 

However, Bethesda nailed it. This is no typical ""farmville/clash of clans"" tap game. This game has virtually no paywall holding you back with having fun. This game DOES have things that you may buy, but ALL of these things that can be purchased, can be found within the base game without paying a penny! Ofcourse this may take longer without paying but is still fun to play

- Cute Graphics & Funny Dialogue 
- True to Fallout (Weapons & Characters you'd find in all fallout games) 
- Free to Play/No Paywall (Everything is accessible without paying) 
- Full questlines to explore & complete
- An Addictive reward system (Mystery crates ""lunchboxes"") 

In conclusion, this free to play game captured my heart. Not only is it extremly addictive but a joy to just check in on every once and a while. I would definitely reccommend"
16205,Very fun
16206,"Fallout Shelter is your usual idle mobile game with a bit of simulation and some clicking. Made by Bethesda and Behaviour Entertainment, released first in 2015 on iOS and other mobile, updated significantly since then, arrived to PC in 2016 and to Steam in 2017.

Technically, it does have occasional glitch fixed by restarting game, such as when I couldn't remove elevator. And people say that they had their saves wiped out due to error or crash many hours later. So uncool.

And eh, idle games are idle games. As far as I care, they are soulless. Well, though this game has a bit of soul, in artstyle. It's really neat in-universe-cartoon thing. Quite nice, mhm. None the less, the one who wins at these games is not the player who fully maxes it out after 100 hours. Nope, that one loses. The player who wins is the one who checks it out and goes away once it gets shallow.

None the less, I tried. The normal play. There is your base building and basic recource management. Wait long time to get smthing. Can rush, with percentage that it can go wrong. The only microtransactions are either boxes of random stuff that you can get as loot anyway and ability to arrive to quests immeditly, doesn't matter much. Usually you can leave the game for a while unless you sent dwellers out exploring, then it goes against whole idle thing with them possibly dieing out of injury while you aren't paying attention.

I mean, it's not Pay-2-Win but it's still an idle game which is completely shameful on PC.

It's actually funny how game was different combat systems in shelter and quests. In shelter animation matter zero, everybody's health is just getting slowly sapped by presence of NPCs with their stats and only Endurance stat matters for health. Quest kinda does it more with aiming, attacks, critical hits minigames at rare times. But eh, still shallow.

And yea, it's idle. I played normal vault for a while and stopped very quickly after realizing at how easy it will be. So I tried survival instead. And boy, instead of proper challenge I got cheese-land of cheesy tactics. It's hard but in merely annoying way, not the way that makes you think or tests you.

Here are some examples of these pro tactics that are based off real life:

Nothing bad ever happens if you don't pay attention to things. In survival mode you will be bombared with incidents every few minutes which will be sapping away health of your dwellers so in nutshell you want to do stuff and leave ASAP. Leave workers to live happily and restore health, for we all know that presence of exploitative class brings only unhappyness and bad luck.

Just like in real life the best way to handle conflicts is just run away and ignore it. Right? So if you ever get incidents, in order not to get health of dwellers sapped away, you just have to move them away from whatever or whoever is invading you. If it's internal then it will spread to horizontal and vertical rooms and then end. Which also brings the only non-cheesy tactics of how to build base, aha. And if it's from outside then they just go through each row back and forth to the bottom and then go away. Just send dwellers to rooms where they already passed. It doesn't even matter if they have to go through fire on the way, it only takes away health if they are assigned to same room. Raiders also sap away recources while in shelter but in early game it's quicker to just let them run through than confort, thus takes less recources.

Did you know that pregnant women are the best workers? While they can't fight back or do quests or explore, their AI is set to always run from incidents, practically making them completely invincible. And you wait forever about bringing babies out of their bellies. What an utopia.

It also seems that if you have too much population then their odor will spread all over the wastelands, bringing bigger threat in. As a result you will have to stop at certain population and then wait patiently as you grab the needed loot. Send people on quests and exploration to gain better equipment before getting bigger. Idling. Don't upgrade to level 3 rooms early either, makes bigger internal incidents there.

Overall, I quickly realized that in order to progress in Survival I will have to wait for days to get better equipment and once I got into the fairly stable movement in the game I figured that this mobile idle game can't provide any more proper enjoyment and left the game.

I've won."

16209,"If you enjoy base building-survival games with resource gathering and tower defence elements, you‚Äôll love Fallout Shelter.

Additional Info:

Funnily enough, this is my first Fallout game. You don‚Äôt need to know anything about Fallout to find this enjoyable.

This game has a lot of sub-genres, as it‚Äôs somewhat of an idle/clicker game, when it comes to crafting and resource gathering. Although, it also has story driven quests, levelling characters, along with similarities to The Sims. It is quite well rounded off, and certainly addictive.

Can‚Äôt go wrong for a free game."

It's not like other games where it starts out fast and then gets boring af - it's sort of you start out kind of slow, then get a bit faster then a bit more and then you're slow, but it's not a boring kind of slow. You still make progress in the slowness, but it's not necessary progress. I couldn't recommend this game enough, but it is annoying when you make babies, because the food and water consumption rate goes up, and then you need to upgrade, and then assign more dwellers and stuff.

Overall, a great game."

16221,"[i]""You can build a better future underground!""[/i] [b][i]<-- Original Review[/i][/b]


[b][i][Updated Review down below][/i][/b]

[b]Fallout Shelter[/b] is originally a mobile game, but it also got released on PC. The game is pretty good and also [b]Free[/b].

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
- Great mobile port
- Base building
- You can train your vault members and send some of them on missions which you can partake in
- You can send vault members out into the wasteland on a looting adventure
- Daily missions
- Vault-Packs can be obtained for free which is like a ""loot box"" so to say
- Legendary vault members [i](Like Piper)[/i]
- Lot of weapons you can give for Vault members
- Vault members can have pets, which has their own bonuses
- Your vault sometimes gets raided by bandits or mutants come to attack you and your vault members have to be prepared for a fight.

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- Microtransactions [i](It's a free game so they must have a way to monetize it somehow[/i]
- You can't bring your progression from the mobile version [i](AFAIK)[/i]

[b]8/10[/b] This game plays much better on phone than on PC, but it is not a bad port at all. Try it out if you want.

16229,I think its a great game.
16230,I've really enjoyed this game until it recently startied to crash every time I try to open it. Today it was missing from my library for no reason. Redownloading it now. Hopefully don't lose my saved game.
16231,good game...
16232,"Bethesda introduced paid mods again. 
Protest review!"
16233,This game is not designed for pc.
16234,"Uninstalling. Had a lot of fun with the game, but it's the principal of the matter. Creation Club is a dreadful paid mod scheme that rips off the creators. Worse, it downloads all the mods in the CC to your hard drive whether you've purchased them or not. You then purchase a piece of software to unlock and activate it. What's this going to mean for my hard drive when there are hundreds of mods in the CC?

Nope nope nopitty nope. I'm not going to be part and parcel to this kind of behavior. Until the CC is sacked for good, I'm not purchasing another game from Bethesda, which is a shame because they're honestly my favorite studio until now."
16235,Good game for chilling and when is life boring :D

I wouldn't recommend this not only because of how slow and boring it is, but because like any other game generated from the app store, it has micro transactions that aren't necessarily worth it.

Although enjoyable when drop dead bored, and have nothing else to do... This game is only fun to earn the steam achievements for, which I haven't even been interested in doing as it is quite difficult on it's own.

It's Okay I suppose."
16245,"If you love fallout you will enjoy this game for sure, it adds a lot of resource management and it sticks with the fallout theme really well."

16252,As if attempting to extort money from people through microtransactions for a 2D game was not bad enough...
16253,"From Ui issues to simple control problems, this game suffers from some pretty basic, game-breaking problems.

--Clicking on Dwellers is horrifically undependable
--Often collecting a resource from a room will prohibit you from clicking on, say, Cappy or the Mysterious Stranger to collect those extra rewards.
--Combat in the vault is clunky, limited by room size, and annoying as F**K to deal with, especially because of the clicking/selection problem.
--Mission Combat is a little better, but the missions can feel tedious and chore-like if you use appropriate-level characters and weapons.

Definitely do not recommend."

16261,Great little game very addictive
16262,nope
16263,well great game xd
16264,"FWIW, you don't have to buy anything to have a good time playing this game. It just serves to improve your patience. I only wish there was some tie-in to Fallout 4 and you could get some loot or something."
16265,"Generally like this game, although it can sometimes get a bit ridiculous with the vault attacks in frequency and how fast resources are lost in them. Becomes a little far fetched as to how much goes vs how much you can actually collect in a sensible time. It's as if the game is trying to force you to be on it playing and collecting 24/7."
16266,"I love the Fallout series. I first played fallout 3 i beat the story (Story is really good), and who would not want a game like this??

Its very adictave.

If you have not played this game yet i HIGHLY RECCOMEND that you do becuase theres aplenty of weapons, clothes armor inside!! 

Bonus: Theres even some of your favorite vips from the previous fallout games!!

Dudes and Dude-ets, Get it now!!

16272,pretty alright if you enjoy waiting to feel the sweet release of death.
16273,"fun game during early progression but grindfest at 50+ population. 
to enjoy this game,you either have to spend money to progress at decent rate or spend your all your free time on wait timers and lucky drops of gear and legendry dwellers"
16274,"Never let yourself into a quest with a semi-weak graphics card. It will lose your save. I just lost my favorite vault...

edit: lol check my stats"
16275,"Fallout Shelter is a MicroManagement Phone game with an appeal strictly to fallout fans, but is playable by any old joe schmoe with a life they want to lose to collecting everything because they have to in the most strategic placement of everything while also being freemium LITE... The game was not in any way one of those premium currency type games untill recently but the game is entirely playable for hours on end without making a single purchase... I never did... But I reccomend you get it on a phone or tablet.. as the pc version just isn't as fluid or intuitive"
16276,I enjoy this game and my kids also do. Great time waster!
16277,I waited a long time befor trying this game because I knew it would be extremely addicting and I was right. I'm still truly enjoying it and would recommend just make sure you have a free schedule be for playing because you'll need it.
16278,"This game is eating a lot of my life for a casual game.  I like to watch Netflix and work on other things while I have it up, which is super convenient.  After about 24 hours play time, my vault is pretty self sufficient.  I now mostly get on to check quests and send out/recall adventurers.  It's a pretty solid game."
16279,it has it's.....falts......but with more updates coming it will be more better and maybe have a 3D mod to it
16280,england is my vault
16281,nice
16282,"THIS IS ACTUALLY A MIXED REVIEW!!! SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS!


I'm a big Fallout fan and this game seemed to be just my thing. You can manage a Vault as Overseer build resource rooms and assign the right vault dwellers according to their SPECIAL stats to it which alsop raises their happiness which is a really nice way of managing.

PRO:
You can even build scavanger teams that do missions in the Wasteland which brings XP to them and loot for you and the Vault.

There are also mini challenges which bring you additional goodies.

This game uses different kind of currencies:
* There are caps which are needed to build rooms and buy other stuff
* There is real time which is needed for different actions to take place. The time ranges from mere seconds to full hours depending on the action. Good thing is you can log out and the time counts down as well.
* There is Nuka Cola Quantum which let's you skip the time requirements some actions have. You can buy NCQ using real money or find it in the world. I think it's mostly optional to use them.

You can equip your Vault dwellers with new clothes/armor which increase their SPECIAL Values.
You can equip your Vault dwellers with guns which increase their attack values once they have to fight.
There are events that trigger when your Vault dwellers have to fight.
If a Vault Dweller dies you can revive him using caps.

CONTRA:
Well this is a Bethesda game after all and that means the core mechanics and the core game is pretty decent and somewhat brilliant. Sadly Bethesda is the 80% company that starts a game and does a great job and then just drops its tool at about 80% of the way and says ""FCK YOU"". In this game it shows when you have to do micromanagement during an attack of the Vault:
I had a case where everything was quite good; I had a high happiness, many vault dwellers, almost every room was occupied, most of them had guns and armor. Then a molerat attack commenced in one of the empty rooms and it spread quite quickly from there. I tried to micromanage the situation by sending my best equiped men/women to the infested rooms. I ran very quickly out of stim packs because you may have lots of storage space but only very limited stim pack storage. So one vault dweller after another lost lots of health and I was using stimpacks when it showed on screen. As I said I quickly ran out.

Then the fckup began... While I tried to grab my other vault dwellers from the other rooms placing them in the infested rooms I misgrabbed them. They are running around randomly and you have to try and grab them and them drag them around to another room. Sadly you either cannot grab them because you have to zoom out enough to see more than a few rooms or dropping them fails because he doesn't detect that I wanted to drop them in a specific room and just cancelled the entire thing. This resulted in alot of my dwellers dying because these molerats are 20 times stronger than in games like Fallout 4. The reviving eats away my caps AND on top the happiness drops like hell.

I just wished bethesda would give their games (not just this one) a final polishing BEFORE shipping them. I don't give a FCK that this is a free game or not, the same happens in their other titles.  If the micromanagement wasn't that bad this game would get a definite recommedation by me!"

16286,"This game crashes every 10 minutes (6 crashes within the first hour has to be a record in my experience, and ive been gaming since 1985!), plus its an entirely pointless money sink.  

Don't waste your time.

If nothing else, try it out on Android.  It works much better there."
16287,"It says Free to Play but is it Pay to Win? Not really. Almost all the things you can buy with real money, at best speed things up. Nuka Cola Quantum is absolutely not worth spending money on since you can set your dwellers to do something, save, and come back later when they're done.

As someone who spent $15 on the game ($5 for the starter kit and $10 on 40 chests when they were on sale). I'd honestly say don't spend money on anything other then the Starter Kit and that's only because it's a guaranteed Legendary Dweller to get you off to a decent start.

Otherwise though the game is more or less a very functional city builder style game with some RPG mechanics mixed in. Personally had more fun with this then the dreadfully dull Fallout 3 to say the least."
16288,"Polygamy accepted in my vault, but incest not. 8/8 m8"
16289,dont see why i need it on steam but it's good
16290,"I play the game heavily on iPad, and it is neat, but I have very few pros and quite a few contras to list as to why I am not recommending this game. If you are a free to play person and don‚Äôt want to invest money into something as short-lived as Fallout Shelter, you may have to buckle up because there will be big bumps down the road. I may repeat a few things, but everything is interconnected, so bear with me, please.

Let‚Äôs begin the review!

PROS:
- free to play ‚Äì you are not forced to shell out hard-earned cash on the game in order to give it a try;

- fun, easy going, relaxing game which hilarious dwellers that say some cheesy stuff if you zoom in and read (especially flirting couples in living quarters);

- you can rename your dwellers all you like. My iPad Vault contains mash of FO and TES universes prominent characters so despite not having a legendary dweller by names of Paladin Danse and Arthur Maxson, I was able to ""create"" them via renaming tool and turn my Vault partly into Brotherhood of Steel HQ (given I have the themes for living quarters and diner to boot);

- quests are decent enough and early game are very captivating and addicting;

- very strong atmosphere and vibe of the main game. 



CONTRAS:
- First of all, as I have mentioned above, if you are a F2P person, buckle up for‚Ä¶ restarting you game entirely quite a few times until you hit you lucky stride right off the bet with guns/stimpacks/good legendary dwellers. I restarted my Vaults about 20 times or so until I got lucky with early lunchboxes from objectives and rolled the Vault from there. 

- Inability to connect your iPad/iPhone game to the PC;

- Small starter budget. You start with 500 caps which is nothing, especially since Rushing heavily depends on Luck SPECIAL and none of your starter dweller will have it to ensure your room rushing is successful and one has no opportunity to level up dwellers‚Äô‚Äô Luck SPECIAL early on since it takes a while before your Luck Training room becomes available;

- Every rush/dweller‚Äôs ability to find good stuff on quests and out in the Wastelands are entirely dependent on one SPECIAL trait ‚Äì Luck. The rest make no real impact on the rooms dwellers are assigned to and such. It‚Äôs stupid that Diner requires Agility as Key SPECIAL, but to rush the room, Luck plays bigger part than aforementioned Agility.  
- Complete and utter lack of weapons/stipmacks for early raiders/ghoul attacks. If early objective lunchboxes don‚Äôt drop them quickly, you are SoL and might as well restart the game anew;

- if you are an OCD builder like me, you will dislike one main thing about the game - inability to build full room, right off the bet pre-set location of elevators that one cannot move which in return off-sets the rest of the vault structure. Fully mergeable rooms are those that were built out of three blocks. However, the space you are given to work with prevents you from making every room in your vault built of three blocks to maximize the space and RSS gathering;

- inability to move your rooms/elevators around. Once you have built something the only way for you to move it is to demolish the room for skim compensation and build it elsewhere. However, you are not always able to do so due to rooms being connected to another rooms or elevators or w/e. Ergo, in some cases you are stuck with some of your building choices. 

- Vault gets attacked by raiders/ghouls/deathclaws at the most inopportune moment. Sometimes its waves after waves after waves. Good luck if you have enough weapons to arm your dwellers, otherwise you are SoL. Radscorpions will demolish your dwellers if you don‚Äôt sit and watch the whole battle tapping in timely manner to heal/rad-cure your dwellers until the monster is dead. When deathclaws attack, dwellers health drop from merely presence of the DCs. 

- Game constantly will yell at you for lack of storage. Upgrading medical bays/science labs will not increase storage capacity of the product they provide. You have to build more bays and labs to increase the cap for stimpacks and radaways. As a result, half of the vault would end up being medical facilities and warehouses.
"
16291,"Very simple game to play that passes the time.
Love it on my phone, tablet and PC!
Plus its Fallout so I love the references to the main games."
16292,Poor in game transactions will steal your money and give you nothing.
16293,"The screen froze everytime I clicked a button. The game didnt't freeze, the screen did. I could minimize and max and the correct screen would be there. Very annoying and frustrating. Lost a player from this."
16294,"When I saw the achievement ""Mattress Stuffer"" I thought it was in reference to the fact I have had the same guy impregnante 10 women. 

Also, my away team is made up of lvl 16-32 badass women. I put one of them in the residence with Mr Lucky and she ignored him. She don't need no man. <3 You go girl.

10/10"
16295,"
This game has a noodle of mod, put, masturbated, fucked away"
16296,"Its actually not a bad game, unlike FO4."
16297,"Takes no skill or effort, only time"
16298,This game is surprisingly addictive for how simple it is.
16299,i think i nutted
16300,"this is a fun timewaistin, cap grindin, main series referencin lil bit of fun(besides all the usual traits of a f2p base building game)
but what really makes it a fallout game is how often it crashes for no reason in the middle of you playing it 
"
16301,"It's free, it's a waiting game, but don't ever spend a dime here since item is save file bound. If your file is corurpted there's no getting those item back. Psst! You could always use a save file editor, but that beat the purpose of playing the game."
16302,"Good game. It's fun to raise dwellers and see what they do. A bit of RPG here and there. My main complaint is that no matter what device you play on (already played this on my phone before), there will be a point where the game will crash upon loading your vault. So, is it a nice game? Yes. But there are some other bugs that need to be fixed in this game if you want to pul people in for the long haul."
16303,best game 10/10
16304,"You Build A Shelter
You Provide Everything
Damn, You Can Even Kill Anything There"
16305,is there a bug or wht ?after i build commander room my screen stuck
16306,"Lots of fun.Reminds me of a mix between Sims,and Fallout ,plus the style is superb."
16307,"This is my first review.  Don't play this game.  It's disingenuous to even call it a game.  I love everything Fallout and this game could have been amazing, but it's not.  I doubt they spent 3 months developing it.  Here's what to expect; your shelter produces 3 resources (power, water and food) each on a timer.  The timers count down from 4 minutes at the end of which you click on the room generating the resource to collect it.  There's a cha-ching sound and the time resets.  This ""game"" for lack of a better word requires no strategy.  It conveys no feeling of accomplishment or productivity and as a result imparts zero satisfaction.  It's a spin-off.  A lazy one.  This game is the Jurassic Park III of the fallout series."
16308,Nice simple game
16309,"Having fun with the game. Not every game under the sun needs to be ultra challenging and fast paced. This is a nice time waster I play while watching the kids or netflix. 

All the negative reviews I see are the people this kind of game isn't targeted at."
16310,"The game is too slow to have any fun with, and i don't mean it starts normal and becomes slow,
i mean it starts slow and grinds to a halt, you look at the screen and nothing happens for the majority of the gameplay.
It's really obvious that they made the game like that so you will spend money to speed things up in order to  actually get some semblance of progress. waste of time..."
16311,is nice
16312,Pretty good game! Enjoying it.
16313,"Wish I knew this was on steam & ""FREE"" before"
16314,killing roadmen
16315,"Game is neato sweeto, Used to play it on my phone while in class and almost got suspended for 2 weeks... worth it"
16316,"Whats not to Like... Fallout Shelter Provides the Full Package experience of Vault Simulator, while feeding your're Fallout hunger. A must have in the library."
16317,"Perfect game for the Summer
Great Scenery 
Beautiful Graphics Great Story
Would Play Again 
10/10"
16318,"Not terribly fun. For a mobile game, it's a fairly standard addition to the game lineup--set people to a task, wait a few minutes/hours, collect. But that's just it--it's a mobile game. It's not optimized in any way for a desktop. No one really likes to sit around at their desktop WAITING, do they? 

Fine for those who want to waste a LOT of time doing very little, but for me, this game isn't nearly proactive enough."
16319,power and everything is  used when u dont play. thats gay.
16320,fun
16321,wait
16322,one day after  there all dead
16323,"If u are Poor, can't affor Fallout-4.
This is the game for u!"
16324,fun to pass time with
16325,"i like the game but it keeps locking up on me makes me want to quit
"
16326,"Some people complain that it is same as mobile version, but I've played Fallout Shelter on my iPad before quests, Mr. Handy, pets, crafting, and Survival Mode have been added. So, this Steam edition has plenty of new stuff for me. However, the game still gets either pretty boring or much frustrating too soon. Initial 48-72 hours of the Vault is the most fun part."
16327,"It's a great litle time waster. Not much depth as a game as it's more of an interactive any farm or maybe ""virtual model trainset"""
16328,"PRE-REVIEW WARNING: This game contains a bug that can corrupt and erase saves after hard-locking your computer.  Be aware and backup your saves from time to time.

Now that that's out of the way, this game is a great time waster, and doesn't require real money to progress.  If you like Fallout, definitely give it a shot!"
16329,"After finishing most of the set and missions, your perspective of this game changes.  In part, it might be because this was my first survival game.  I paid a fair amount to get products later in the game I decided was foolish.  And compared to the art and style of other games I've played recently, this is rather boring.  If more time had been spent on mission management I would have enjoyed this game far better.  The cookie cutter missions really killed it, which is a shame, because the mechanics are very well balanced and thought out.  But once the Fallout lable fades from your eyes, you realize this game is basically either grind or pay with the missions getting very dull very fast.  And I paid.  And that makes me want to buy another Fallout product in the future mouch less.

 My test is this, if I recommended it to a friend, would they thank me, or would they not?  This is made harder as it is ""free"".  But it really is not free for anyone who has a job and limited free time and wants to really play a game."
16330,"In Fallout: Shelter, you are a Vault Overseer. You must ensure that your dwellers are happy, you have to make sure everything is full - make sure you don't run out of power, food or water - and you must ensure that your shelter is safe for your dwellers to live in.

As a fan of the Fallout series on Xbox, I saw this on Steam and thought that I would grab it and see what it was like. I was expecting something a lot more like the original gaming series, maybe walking through the vault itself. It's not like that at all. It's very much a one dimensional game, with just the layout of your vault in front of you. However, there's a lot that can actually be done in this game and it exceeded the expectations when they dropped upon seeing it when I first opened the game.

This game isn't at all what I thought it would be like. It's a lot of strategy and being ahead of the curve, a lot of being mindful of resources and having to know when to send dwellers out, when to rush things, when to build things. There's a lot that needs to be considered at the same time. It's a little hard on this aspect, but it's actually really fun. I'm having a blast with it, and the achievements definitely make it worthwhile to play, if you're an achievement hunter. This isn't what I thought it would be, but it's a lot funner that I originally expected.

It's definitely a bit of fun and it's free to play on Steam, which is a total bonus! This is totally a play to pass time game, but it's fun for sure, in my opinion."
16331,"This is a nice little community management game.  What I was particularly impressed by was that Bethesda, creators of some amazing mainstream games, did not see the need to ram in-game purchases down your throat, despite the game being in the free to play genre.  There is a lot to collect and build, along with little adventures you can send your dwellers on."
16332,"PC port of a fun free to play mobile game that you can have plenty of fun with even if you spend no money on the microtransactions.  Essentially boils down to a planning and management simulator with some (rarely difficult) combat and a quest system.  The game was kind of dull until the quest system came into play (when this was just a mobile title).

This game was launched to promote Fallout 4 but has no other tie-ins.

Only really annoying item in the game are the unskippable tutorial items."
16333,Great little time killer
16334,"Good game when you're in the corner crying, thinking how broke you are."
16335,"i like it , good time wasting :)"
16336,great for fallout fans
16337,Great Game actually.. theres alot of waiting involved so if you are looking for a fast paced action gae this is not it... more of a casual builder game for killing time. I would give it a fun factor rating of 7/10 though its entertaining to say the least. but the damn waiting... 7 hours to get to some quest... thats kinda redic..
16338,Super addictive and not quite the same as Fallout. Similar elements but far friendlier. Think Paradise Bay or Stardew Valley
16339,"The perfect representation of life; a shallow, endless grind. Todd is brilliant."
16340,"It's a pretty fun game for Fallout fans. And it's FREE. The only thing though, it's really more of a mobile game. I liked playing it on my phone more than on PC. It's one of those that you play for a few minutes, then turn it off for a bit and check back later. It does stuff while you're away so don't go too long without playing. Just sitting down and playing for a long period of time straight will get boring very quickly so it's very much a casual type game. Definitely try it out though."
16341,Fun to play!
16342,"i 
want to die"
16343,10/10
16344,"its a decent time killer. you can look up fun things to do and ways to ""hack"" it on youtube if you get bored. Only downside is that it kinda gets old fast."

16357,killed a man with a bb gun gg good game
16358,The tits!
16359,I love this game very easy to play and very funny! Very friendly game. If you like Fallout you need play with this game. This is a survival base builder game.I hope you like it !
16360,"Doesn't work with any controller, constantly vibrates xbox controller and mouse doesn't work without flickering the whole UI. Can't even get through the tutorial enough to change a setting so I don't know if there are any."
16361,"Free To Play is a misnomer. The play is very slow unless you buy, buy, and buy copious amounts of nuka cola quantum. The result is you probably will pay more for this game than Fallout 4. I only recommend it if you have the money."
16362,Fun little game when youre bored. Its also free so.
16363,"free game? nothing else to say, thumbs up"
16364,"Just as good as I remember when I played on Android, with the added crafting and quests adding even more fun to the game. Only problem might be that it could get a bit overwhelming as the shelter grows. Otherwise, great game to run in background and poke around from time to time while you are doing something else."
16365,"If you enjoy base building-survival games with resource gathering and tower defence elements, you‚Äôll love Fallout Shelter.
 
Additional Info:

Funnily enough, this is my first Fallout game. You don‚Äôt need to know anything about Fallout to find this enjoyable.

This game has a lot of sub-genres, as it‚Äôs somewhat of an idle/clicker game, when it comes to crafting and resource gathering. Although, it also has story driven quests, levelling characters, along with similarities to The Sims. It is quite well rounded off, and certainly addictive.

Can‚Äôt go wrong for a free game."

16368,"Best gamer singleplayer i like this genre because u need to build,manage best game of singleplayer"
16369,The game has been rebalanced to make you want to buy the micro transations. I remember the game was once was much easier and faster paced.
16370,This game is a total disaster and honestly attracts even more children to the fallout franchise tbh smh
16371,There's enough challenge to keep it mildly interesting. It's a really nice time waster.
16372,"this game is cool, because i have like all the cheats for it, unlimited moneym unlimited lunchboxes, etc :). Definetely recommend this game as it is strategic and fun!"
16373,Incredible !!! but i don't like it when your water and food go's down :I (rating *** stars)
16374,Great alternative for the fallout games!
16375,Best Game ever if you dont like=no soul
16376,"ahhhh the shit i went through, i haven't played for months almost a year.
i have pictures though, of me having 400ish people all of them where above level 16, 10,000 caps or whatever, 20 pets and ALOT of good weapons and outfits. its a good game they have most-likely updated it since but... everyone died because of 1 glitch as soon as i shut my computer down i didn't see there was a radroach attack and my really good people where on quest. so some how half the people died and then when i came back like a day later there where raiders and radroaches running around everywhere. got pissed, never played again although that was my favourite free game at the time really enjoyed it :)"
16377,Finally 100% this game and I'm pretty satisfied but not satisfied...the questing in this game is great but the things to do on here is not much once you get everything maxed out and all.
16378,"Great game to poke at and wander off from, then poke at and wander off again. Knowing what you're coming back to, and that you always can. Like most of my relationships. So, ADD friendly>>"
16379,Fallout Shelter is a post-a... U know what just play this game.
16380,good for tablets ok for pc also you can time glitch if you change your time it changes the time in game don't fix that please it makes it more enjoyable 9/10

You can go to a steam guide on how to get unlimited free lunchboxes/caps or search it up on youtube!

The game is overall good but there needs to be a feature added so that you can see your dwellers in the wasteland because that would be cool."
16386,Nice little time-killer of a game.  Keeps you thinking about ways to upgrade and improve your vault while not playing.  Great for a free title!
16387,slow start not gonna lie but it is a really addictice game when you get the hang of it!
16388,"Ever wanted to be in command of your very own Vault.The people at Vault-tec offer you the chance of a lifetime.Make a large vault,do experiments on your dwellers,Make them reproduce, and send them out to explore and take on missions. As an overseer its very easy to let the the power go over your head. We at vault-tec advise you that everything is fine and have a good rest of your days in a vault."
16389,Its a very good game what can i say!
16390,"I think I've played this game enough by now to understand how it works. And to be honest, I've really enjoyed my few hours of playtime with it."
16391,"I honestly don't know why I can't put this game down. It's addicting. The best part is it runs so smoothly I can have it up while I'm playing other games or watching the latest episode of GoT or Rick and Morty. I love this game and making my vault better than my friends and loved ones. I love the quests and my obsession with breeding the ultimate vault dweller. This is a big departure from my usual survival, horror, or action games yet it stands its ground. This game delivers a fun game that makes me manage my resources and storage while also fearing impending doom from raiders, deathclaws, and radiation.  What more could a man want?"
16392,fun
16393,Such a great game.
16394,Better than Fallout 76 or Fallout 4 at least.
16395,Gets boring fast
16396,"DO NOT PLAY this game, do not invest money and time in this game. like i did. i log on today after spending so much time and effort on my vault only to find my saved vault deleted by steam and there is no way i can get it back?"
16397,Good.
16398,"This is a very addictive and fun game. Moderately difficult to play with the challenge of managing resources and surviving attacks and challenges of completing objectives and quests. I came into this game with no previous knowledge of Fallout games and found it to be a great intro to the Fallout 'verse. This game can be as difficult as you make it, either as a daily grind, or P2W. For an F2P this is definitely recommended, enjoy the PC format the best, personally have trouble gaming on smaller screens particularly cellphone. Glad this is available on Steam client. Tablet version is probably just as good. Find the UI on Steam much more accomodating for my personal taste. This particular game is a great all around game for any level of gamer IMHO."
16399,Something fun to pass the time.
16400,I love this game but I wish I can connect this to my google play accont on my phone
16401,"I like the game At Frist This why I'm giving it a yes, But I'm one those people that get board Of playing something that I already know. But Its Good, for a free game that a other reason for yes To recommend.  
Plus if you just want a day over with. This game Can help."
16402,GOOD GAME
16403,"Awesome way to waste, this game sucks you in to the point that everytime you wake up with your coffee you have to see if your people are alive. For a free play I recommend it, however, there are in game pay options like most now a days."
16404,"I really wanted to like this game, and I enjoyed a number of elements to it, but there is a lot of inconsistency between / within content. Combat, for example, is good (not great) on quests in the wasteland, but is an absolute dumpster fire in your base. Any  time anything attacks your shelter it is just such a nuisance, and it happens *a lot.* 

I love the fallout franchise and art style, but for me this game ended up as a hard pass."
16405,kachow
16406,"I have just recently started to play this  game and already i found it to be super-addicting at the beginning and took me a little while to find out how everything works and until i figured it out i was having a blast
Pros:
-Fun and easy to get into
-Easy to master 
-Great way to kill time 
- Lots of different rooms, weapons and gears to unlock 
-Mixed in with RPG, strategy and management elements
- Its good to play while using the internet 
-Its Fallout 
Cons:
-Slow progress 
- Microtransactions are a really a bother, do yourself a favour and dont buy any of them its not worth it and just ruins the experience of the entire game."
16407,It's a good 2nd monitor game
16408,"Addictive Phone Game Simulator

7/10"
16409,NIce little game for inbetween.
16410,Love it
16411,"It won't let me do anything without a controller and the controller won't work. It even says contoller might not be supported they are aware of this and by doing what they reconmend, unplugging the controller it continues the weird act of rushing everything to the left side. Highly dislike and prefer the mobile version over this POS."
16412,Love it
16413,"""time wasted"" game"
16414,"I was addicted wtih this game for about 50 hours. Once you pick it up, it is very easy to advance.  Don't know why this is free.  Bethdesa deserves money from this."
16415,"Fun, strategy, and a good resource management game. It gets a bit stale after a while, but there's always something that you can find that pulls on your interest and makes you come back for more. The resource management isn't hard, but right as you get used to it all, you imediatly don't have enough and need to put in your all so all your vault dwellers survive. Although the wait time for doing missions is really ridiculous though. I'd give it a 7/10 to be honest."
16416,ohohooooo welcome to the superior platform my mobile friend
16417,Best game in da world
16418,"If you definitly want to kill a bit of time here and there and love the fallout series, this is a definite play. If you want to have a proper start up, it might be worth to just spend ¬£5 on each of the items available (buy 1 of each for 99p or whatever currency it is where you are), though you don't have to spend a penny and I wouldn't recommend doing so as Microtransactions shouldn't be allowed to exist, but its up to you if you have money to burn."
16419,"Played a lot on mobile, for a free to play, easily worth a go just to kill some time once in a while. Can easily be done while watching something in the background since all the tasks take real time to complete."
16420,To much sexism in this game. Shame on the developers
16421,Excellent game. No remarks
16422,8/10 to kill time.
16423,fallout nuff said
16424,"Great game, updated more frequently than I would have expected but unfortunately it is easy to cheat so creating a flawless vault is only impressive if you record every step of the way otherwise people will assume it was not done legit. IT does get boring rather quickly but its still a very good game."
16425,Very addiciting game for us vault dwellers.
16426,"It test your skills as whether you can maintain post gobal disaster Fallout shelter, maintaining water, energy, people, happiness, etc. on an on going cycle. keeping everyone sataified ."
16427,just use a trainer to get pass the bullshit microtranactions lol
16428,"It's boring to wait for them to shoot in missions and it take ages just because of that...
Then It delete 2 legendary weapons as i switched them."
16429,love it and i have huge shelter if you are a fan of fallout franchise i highly recommend it
16430,"This is a little fun game. I also played the mobile version quite some time ago, but I like the pc version more. Though you have to wait a bit too long sometimes."

16432,Better than the mobile game. The controls and loading on this version are much better and smoother than other platforms and still carries the classic fallout style and satire.
16433,"its good 
"
16434,Gave it a second try. Still fucking hate it.
16435,"It's seems to be deliberately boring just to get you to buy nuka-cola to speed the game up, and that's not happening.     There is too much busywork like having to click to collect power, water, food, etc.  Is that supposed to make me forget nothing is happening.  Then, when I log off and come back, my explorer is always dead, and I'm supposed to spend all my caps to revive him.  Aint nobody got time for that."
16436,A good way to blow off a few hours and entertain yourself
16437,"So this vault... You don't have enough food or water, but have a unlimited suppy of fire extinguishers? Logic..."
16438,"+Good graphics
+The best free to play survival 2D post-apocalyptic game
+Better playability than on the phone

-When you got everything its still the same game...
-In my opinion its pay to win (Lunchboxes/Nuka-Cola)

6.5/10"
16439,"I want more games like this.
Don't let you get bored.
Many different quests."
16440,fun game to kill time but lots of grinding
16441,"Good Game for starters. I've been playing it for a couple of months now, and I'm only just getting to the more advance parts of the game such as exploring, building nuclear reactors and growing my own food. It is definitely formatted for a phone rather than a computer, but shows potential in being an easy-going adventure game. 

It doesn't really need any experience from the Fallout Series but its fun having familiar characters enter your vault (mine was Piper, yay!!). Another good part is the development of the Vault itself and the customisation of some rooms. I found it most enjoyable when you were able to attend quests once purchasing the overseers office. 

Only the only negative is the price. I think it remember being free to download, or costing only a couple of pounds, but after that, that's where they get all your money. To advance quickly you'll definitely need some Vault-Tec Lunchboxes which you have to buy. The prices range from ¬£2.99 - ¬£50!! Which is crazy but highly tempting. Additional purchases can include pets which benefit your explorers, Quantum Colas which can quicken the processes of making weapons or adventures, and Mr Handys which collect money while you're away. 

Overall, it's a good game, but you can end up spending loads of money on it if you're not careful."
16442,Love it. Got me hooked for a long time but it gets quite boring after some time. Still recommended for others.
16443,super cool game
16444,"NONONONONO

They messed up my saved vault. Now I have to start from square one!!!

How dare you!"
16445,p2p.
16446,Just a fun little game to pass some time. 9.5/10
16447,"I love this game, it is so addicting. It does hae micropayments, but you can easily play the game without paying a penny! You can get everything in the game someway without paying for them via micropayments! I love this game so much!"
16448,I love Fallout and that is a real good free game
16449,"Fallout Shelter is a base-building survival game set in the, you guessed it, Fallout universe. You are the overseer of a vault, and need to perform various tasks to build up and grow your vault.

Pros:
-Simple and easy to get into and play, making it the perfect time-waster. Most objectives or completing of tasks or quests take time (anything from a few minutes to a couple of days), making it an idler of sorts as well.
-Set in the Fallout unverse, with some references towards other Fallout games being made as well
-Mechanics are simple, build a vault and ensure that there is enough power for the vault, and food and water for your dwellers. There is also quests which your dwellers can go on to find weapons, outfits or junk to craft the latter.
-There is steam achievements, but they take quite some time to get, as you need to grind to get them.

Cons:
-Microtransactions is the only thing which irritates me in this game, especially for the Nuka Quantum Cola, which is basically a speed boost item within the game. The game kind of tries to force you to use it if you want to skip objectives or get something done immediately.

Overall, this is a great time-waster worth a look if you enjoy the Fallout series and are looking for something to play.
7/10

16451,It's a great game.
16452,Good game for sleepy play.
16453,Pretty good
16454,Pretty fun
16455,"Great little game enjoying it word of warning back up your saves now and then apparently saves being deleted is a common bug I always make a back up when I exit the game. only 4 hours into game not had problem yet but might have from what I have read. 

MICROTRANSACTIONS THO!!! NO THANK YOU!!!! not milking me for money xD

will recommend for a time burner tho xD"
16456,Honestly a pretty fun game. Theres not much that I would change exept that a deathclaw attack can come EARLY AS SHIT AND FUCK UP YOUR ENTIRE VAULT TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN! Other than that fantastic game.
16457,Fun game if your into the Fallout series.
16458,Great game! would be an overseer again!
16459,Psst... got any med-x?
16460,"Good survival management game, so far I only bought the starter pack.
At first we need to set a survivable shelter, then later when quest is open it become more fun.

Had many shelter breach but not so much as a problem.

For me the + point of this game is ability to recruit people, survival management and especially the quest.

As alternate to recruiting we can make dweller breed/ make children, later when they are grown up they can function as a normal dweller recruits. 
"
16461,Super fun and additive for awhile. Totally worth checking out
16462,I suddenly lost my vault. Please help!!
16463,"Very addictive game. Many options to develop your ""Vault"".  The small downside I experience is that it takes quite some time to make some money. With money you can develop your rooms. You will get there eventually but you'll need to play for a while.

I really like the game play and the detail of the characters and rooms. I would definitely recommend this game."
16464,"Its quite addicting, Searching for gear in the wasteland. Bottlecap Hunting, and leveling up your Dwellers special stats. The only gripe i have with this game is the lack of information it has when it comes to what each special stat does outside of its specified resource room. I'd like to know what each stat does during a vault raid or out in the wasteland. Without having to look up a guide on the internet."
16465,"There appears to be no way to pause the game. If you are away from it people die, production stops, etc...  If the computer is off it calculates all the events at retart of the game essentially simulating the game running when the computer is off. Everyday i sepend an hour fixing the damage done by it ""running"" while the pc is off."
16466,good fun for the irradiated kiddos
16467,I Love it
16468,great
16469,Best.
16470,It's a good time killer when their is nothing to do.

16472,Good game
16473,"Very Fun, Super Addictive and a very good idea"
16474,"I found out the other day that there is a cheat mod for this on nexus. I highly recommend you don't use it because it kind of ruins the whole point of the game however, I would rather this game be paid for (e.g ¬£5) so that it would be much better to play like there would probably not be micro-transactions and also there might be more content. All in all, I recommend this game to anyone who is waiting for someone to play with on PUBG or Gmod and has spare time! 8.5/10"

"
16480,shitty game
16481,"Wait-to-play clicker that is deeply addictive and utterly pointless. A skinner box with a good cover. Nothing but you sitting, looking at the screen, waiting to click, waiting to get the next bit of equipment. Getting everything and realizing ""there is no point, there is no end, my God, is this life?""

It is too late for me, but save yourselves!  For God's sake, save yourselves!"
16482,"  This may be one of the best Free-to-play games on smartphones in my opinion, and here it is on Steam roughly 2 years after the original release. With its gameplay being building rooms and later upgrading them for more resources for your Vault (somewhat similar to something like Clask of Clans in that way), upgrading rooms (and even rushing them) do NOT require Nuka Cola Quantum (aka the games ""premium currency""), instead, rooms will upgrade the instant you purchase it with the games basic currency, Caps. The mechanic to Rush rooms to get the resources instantly is a great idea, and it works well in the game! Basically, rushing a room has around a 30% chance of failing, and it increases by +10% each time you do it, the counter will go back down to 30% if you allow the room to work naturally. If the Rush fails, there will be a disaster in the room (ie a fire or a Radroach infestation), if thats the case, the Dwellers (more on them in a second) assigned to the room will have to douse the flames/fight off the radroaches. For the Dwellers aspect, you must rebuild civilization by allowing dwellers to become members in your Vault. Each Dweller has a set of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills: S for Strength, P for Perception, E for Endurance, C for Charisma, I for Intelligence, A for Agility, and L for Luck. Dwellers high in strength can work best in the Power Generator rooms, which are vital for powering your Vault. Dwellers high in Perception  work well in Diners, which supplies food for your Vault. Dwellers high in Endurance can work well in Storage rooms. Dwellers high in Charisma do well with, well, talking; Charisma only affects males/females conversing with someone of the opposite sex, which will end up causing the female to become pregnant and after 3 or so hours will birth a new child, which he then grows up to become another worker in the Vault. Dwellers who have high Intelligence will work best in Medbays or Science Labs, where they can produce Medkits and AntiRadiation Packs. Dwellers high in the Agility stat can work well in the Water Treatment rooms, which supply water to the Vault. Then Luck affects the Rush mechanic, allowing the chance of a disaster to go down a little bit. Strong Dwellers are also very capable of venturing out in the wasteland; giving a dweller a weapon (which helps them during Radroach Infestations or Raider Invasions) will allow the Dweller to survive in the wasteland, out there he can find Caps, guns, and outfits (which will help stats for Dwellers) and return them to the Vault. Combat in the game is simplistic, Dwellers will automatically attack threats and fight fires, its your job to heal them though, if they wont survive, you can assign them to another room so they can flee and survive. If they die, you have 24 real life hours to revive them with Caps, which can be handy. When you reach 18 Dwellers, you can build the Overseer's Office, which allows Quests to be unlocked. Quests are like sending Dwellers out into the wasteland, except you select 3 which meet the Quest requirements (i.e. level and weapon power) and you send them to a certain location which can take anywhere from 1 hour or 21 hours in real time, to speed this up you can use Nuka Cola Quantum. When they arrive at their destination, they travel as a group and will fight enemies. However, combat in Quests is VERY different from regular battles in the Vault, and it is, in my opinion, a little hit or miss. If Dwellers walk into a room where there are enemies, they are locked into fighting and cannot flee (I learned that the hard way), so if you intend on doing quests, i strongly advise packing tons of Stimpacks. Aside from that, combat is a bit deeper, it's still simplistic, but you can tell which Dwellers should target what enemy, and there's a random chance a checkmark crosshair will show up above an enemy, which once clicked, pauses the game and enters a timing minigame where you must click the crosshair when it's as close to the center as possible, doing so will give a critical hit that's 5x more powerful than the basic attacks. Quests do, however, offer a chance to score tons of loot that can be used later in crafting (which I myself have not reached yet).

Side Note: if you've played a Fallout game, you will most likely recognize a ton of familiar aspects of the game. As the game, in my opinion, stays very faithful to the Fallout franchise in terms of style and presentation.

If you enjoy Fallout games or Free-to-play games in the style of crafting rooms and ect., you will most likely enjoy this game, whether it be for Steam or smartphone. I give it 4/5 Stars. If you do plan on playing this game, I hope you enjoy it! ^u^"
16483,"Fun way to pass some time, but in my opinion in game purchases are not worth it."
16484,"I was having so much fun just wasting my spare time on this game, i was starting to get decent at the game when i returned back on and it deleted my game file. So the 4 hours of everything that i did was gone dont waste your time downloading and playing this game."
16485,"Fun game when you don't have anything else to do, but I wouldn't recommend playing it for long periods of time. Unfortunantly it follows the f2p trend of making people wanting to spend money out of frustration. Hence, save yourself from popping some veins and don't play it.

4/10"
16486,"This game is very addicting and fun, Being a fan of the Fallout series since the original Fallout I really respect the use of characters in this game. I'd give this game a 8/10 for being a great time killer and being a fun exploration game. 

It is amazing for a free game even though there is in game purchases, the game is still playable without paying for stuff.

I love the animals in this game because they are really well animated and they look so adorable.

I'd recommend this game to anybody who likes the civilization style games and Fallout"
16487,forced incest yay
16488,"Very Fun and addicting game. 
I recommend this game for anyone who would like to spend time on a micro management game."
16489,"This game is fun.

However, dont make the mistake of forgetting you had the game running on your dead laptop. 

When you turn it back on, it will overwrite your save. I just lost a 200 person vault and weeks of progressing because of this. 

Dont be me."

16495,"i played mostly on mobile during release then i was all like hey, its on pc i wanna try it, and i was like fuck my mobile had 87 dwellers with perfected stats damn. So i was all like hey i can put my files from my phone on my computer, and all like put them in the fallout shelter folder, and BAAAM!!!!! i had everything the same and i can now continue playing when i wait for lobbies. 
Oh you asked why i like the game? Oh yeah fallout is fun as fuck, and this game is so fun when your just chillen.

And now my story. I started off with two dwellers on my side of living under the rubble that once was the United States. Once the bombs struck, everything was lost in time. So, shelters were made in case of emergencies. I was in Charge of vault 420, we were the cleanist and most creative vault of our time. I started with four people at my side as others came along to find a home we opened it to only the strongest. The only way of being able to live down under in the 420 vault you had to be equiped with nothing but a pistol and kill numerous creatures throughout the aftermath of the forgotten days. I now give up i wanted to finish this but ill get too into it and it will be weird if you got this far im glad you read my post thanks if you really wanna know the game is great 100% recomend yo try it out homie have fun and dont forget 420"
16496,Crashes every few minutes. Impossible to play.

i can t play the last saved 
 i lost the entire game
 please help"
16502,tis gud
16503,p2w
16504,10/10 would reccomend especially for free the only problem with the game is the 200 dweller limit but other than that this game is amazing. I want others to experience the same joy that I have while playing this game.
16505,"I actually played this game when it first came out. It was specifically for mobile (and it still is iirc). I tried it out, and it was a great concept but I had a really hard time with my vaults cause I would always die early on in the game. i just didn't have enough of anything really, and for a long time it was unplayable without a Mr.Gutsy. However, I tried it out FTP because I wanted to see what the game was like now that it's been a while for a bunch of updates. Soffice it to say, I am NOT dissapointed. It plays really easy, super casual. Since they added quests (like Bottle and Cappy, ect), I can actually rake in bottle caps AND I have plenty of guns, scrap, and outfits. I even got 2 legendary characters. So yes, I'm glad they've done so much updates, and I would reccomend it as an essential for anyone who likes the Fallout Universe lore!"
16506,"Fun little game on the Fallout universe. It's great to spend some time with and there are some cool little mechanics and ideas in it.

8/10 It's nothing too special but it's a pretty decent game."
16507,ÔªøNice time killer. A good thing about the game is that it can be played on any day of the week. Not like that you have to wait for weekends or such off days. Been playing it regularly for months now. Only one negative point noted during my playtime is the achievement for collecting all legendary dwellers is quite difficult to acquire.
16508,"TL, DR: DON'T PLAY THIS BUGGY GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING FOR HOURS AND THEN HAVE IT DESTROYED BY UNKILLABLE ENEMIES.

Read on:

While this game has some fun content, I really do NOT recommend  playing it. You will become very badly frustrated, but not until you have the chance to sink some time in. There are some pretty serious bugs which I discovered after sinking a bit of time into the game. There is one which is bad enough that I am removing this game from my inventory:

INVINCIBLE MOLE RATS

You don't have mole rats as a problem right away, but once you do, they can become seemingly infinite or you will have just one Mole Rat left and it is unkillable and will eat your entire Vault! I'm not kidding.

Apparently, this has been an issue since at least 2015 from what I was reading but Bethesda won't fix it ... If you look around, lots of people have complained about this. Maybe they have in the reviews on Steam as well, I haven't checked, to be honest.

The fact that BETHESDA WANTS YOUR MONEY for this game BUT THEY LEAVE SERIOUS BUGS IN FOR YEARS is a big turnoff. I NEVER GAME THEM A CENT for the microtransactions and now I am very glad I didn't!!"
16509,"Fun little timekiller, I have enjoyed quite well. It's free, go ahead and get it."
16510,"Nice game, i love it :) :* <3"
16511,"I first played this game on mobile, then downloaded the PC version at some point from the Bethesda/Fallout homepage. I'm really happy it's finally on Steam. It's a lot of fun managing your Vault(s), and you can choose how you spend your time with this game - you can sit there and watch and collect resources or you can log in, pick up your stuff and level your Dwellers really quick, then go do something else.

Only downside I found is that you cannot sync up your Mobile game with the PC versions, meaning on your phone you'll have up to three different vaults than on your computer. And again, the Steam version and the client version you can download from the Bethesda/Fallout homepage do not sync either, meaning you can have three different versions with up to 9 different Vaults. Of course, this can also be an upside if you like to manage that many Vaults. I, personally, like to focus on one or two, and not having the ability to play the ""same versions"" (for lack of a better term) of my vaults on multiple platforms kind of bugs me.

Despite that, however, it's a really cute game, made with a lot of love and yes, there are microtransactions but those are not in any way nessescary."
16512,"It is fine for a short time to remind of Fallout pip boy graphics. But it can be addictive, yet not too much smooth gameplay and not much new soon (yes, new buildings, styles, but no new mechanics). I spent too much time with that. Of course, if I would have too much money, I could spend some money for the extra game currency (possible to gain by normal playing, but slowly) and speed all up to get all soon.
I still think that some SimTower remake is better in the game mechanics than this. But there are few funny things, so if you are bored, try it."
16513,More addictive than alcohol. Makes you wanna pay to speed things up (like alcohol). Avoid if you wanna keep your family together (like with alcohol).
16514,itsw good but add a workshop
16515,Takes alot of time to do quests and whait for shit to happen. Still its a nice small vault simulator where you most likely need to spend hours upon hours to come to an end. Or you could just cheat in some lunchboxes thats up to you.. I spent my time on it anyways and thought it was awesome!
16516,"Boring and frustrating if u dont spend A LOT in the shop, the game is actually fun, i would even pay up to 20 dollars if the game was a litle bit more dynamic and enjoyable, but i wont spend a single buck on this cos i know that once i run out of caps the game will become slow and frustrating again."
16517,Great game.
16518,Should have just played it on my mobile
16519,"IT WILL NOT LOAD


I have been waiting for like an hour and STILL WILL NOT LOAD!!!"
16520,"A free game, yet enjoyable in its simplicity. Much like Fallout 4, the Vauly grows as you build it. Biggest thing to be aware of is the placement and sizes of the rooms. Most can be expanded to 3 wide, some are only 1 or 2 wide, and cannot be moved once placed. It's not a game to sit and play straight, but in spurts, ofetn while groups are out on quests or wandering the wastelands for supplies. YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)."
16521,"frustrating after the first hour,clearly designed to cash in on the fallout series as without paying to win youll just become annoyed by how it steers you towards the ""shop"" screens all the time and increases difficulty and removes game loot untill you buy something or rage-quit.

tbh i thought it would be a complete game seeing as how i already have most of the fo series,pretty sure i remember them pushing it as a freedie for my mobile when i bought fo4.

as it stands its just another greed driven nail in fallouts coffin.

shame as ive enjoyed all the proper fallout games."
16522,"bad on phone, bad on pc."
16523,gppd game
16524,Ez hax
16525,TOO MUCH SKILL IS REQUIRED IN THIS GAME!
16526,DOWNLOAD IT ITS GUD!
16527,Better on Steam than Google Store
16528,lovely
16529,addictive game
16530,"This game is like a free iPhone game where you play for a couple of seconds and then spend the rest of the time wasting away waiting until you can play again.  This games are a rip off and had I realized that's what it was I would have never downloaded it.  The longer you play the longer it takes for things to happen but don't worry, you can always throw your money away on caps to speed things up.  Please for the sake of gaming don't ""play"" spam like this."
16531,Fun game but shit fighting.
16532," - hey, do you play fallout?
 - yes!
*shaking hands*
 - i play fallout shelter!
*washing hands*"
16533,My name jeff
16534,"A really good game, havent win already, might be bad, buy it"
16535,"It's a fun little free game. Though don't buy anything, it's not worth it.
There's elements of management, strategy & RPG.
It's fun & easy to master however there's a bunch of UI faults:
-clickthrough UI (click on ""rush"", levelup a dweller instead)
-unprecise targeting (example: click on a dweller, levelup another one close by not on the same depth)
-no group selection
-no sorting by dweller list health/radiation status
-no UI to show you dweller's ascendents(cause incest IS actually handled, but the game doesn't show you)
hence I resorted to naming them by family branches (daughter of margaret hicks & paul grants would be Janet HG )

dweller's health is not shown in detail and is not retroactive : e.g. leveling up a dweller to 50 then leveling its endurance to 10 is .... uterly useless

-it's actually better to equip max endurance armor before leveling each dweller  .... (hoooo the micro !!!!)

-raiders continue to steal while they are agonizing, the alarm keeps sounding until they are FULLY dead.

Yeah I know, lots of negative traits. Well I think there's lots of positive reviews out there and it didn't need yet another one. I still recommend this game, it's fun, it's free, and it's forgiving enough on default difficulty that those issues don't really matter much"
16536,"""saving"""
16537,this is a very decent game thats all it is
16538,"Fun game when you're bored out of your mind, and it's free, why not give it a try."
16539,"A great game if you have a lot of time. I love the world of fallout and making my shelter function was very satisfying, I got super invested in my little vault dwellers. Give it a go, its free."
16540,"Very nice game, works fine"
16541,"-15 mins into the game
-Random raider attack
-barely have anything to defend my vault
-game chrashes
-raiders are gone

10/10 would chrash again"
16542,"This is the kind of game where you let it run in the background while you doing your task / browsing the web.
Its fun nonetheless"
16543,lmao i broke the game
16544,"I don't understand, WHY IS THIS GAME SO DIFFICULT TO MANAGE?!
Otherwise, love the game."
16545,"A company with a reputation for bugs plus in game purchases equals a disaster. I tried to buy one of the in game items through Steam. The item popped up in the Redeem tab in the game, but failed to actually redeem. I contacted Bethesda. Since the item showed up in the redeem tab, it seemed like a bug on their side. They told me to complain to Steam. Steam said they couldn't issue a refund because from their perspective it was claimed. After several days of back and forth emails getting nowhere with Bethesda, Bethesda told me they were closing my ticket because Steam issued a refund. Steam had not issued a refund. Please save yourself the disappoinment and frustration, and don't buy in game items for this game."
16546,It's free
16547,"It's a good little way to past time tbh.
A lot better than the mobile version."
16548,Amazing game if your into base building and managing supplies well. Start's of realitvly easy but as you progress more and more acciadents happen and require more attantion to the game. Overall very good game
16549,"This is an incredibly fun and addictive game. Perfect for casual gamers who love the fallout series. Do not spend money on it though, unless you're trying to support the developers. Like most casual games, you'll come to a point were theres very little left to do unless you spend money to speed things up. Just wait. You'll get to where you need to be and save money in the meantime."
16550,amzaing
16551,"I want my fucking money back i bought a fucking lunchbox and nothing happend i tried restrarting 4 time and still nothing

Fuck you bethesda"
16552,"It's fun. It gets some points.
BUT it's a clearly example for an unbalanced-game to EARN. I'm not asking for a everything free. Just take a look at Dota 2. It's a true F2P game. (of course a lot of pp pay thousands dollars for dota 2, but none of them can win the game by paying money). I dont get it- the mole rat which can use kage bushino jutsu and amaterasu while human- which can stand and stare back to those mole rat (with the gun in hand, the armor on body)."
16553,top game so much fun
16554,it's ok
16555,"well, its fallout shelter."
16556,I played this game a while back on my android phone and I loved it then. That was before a lot of the new updates such as the overseer's office and the quests that it opens up. With that added content along with all the rest this game is just amazing now.
16557,"Fallout Shelter is a freemium mobile game, that has since been ported to Steam, in advance of Fallout 4's release in order to build up hype. Sadly, that's really all it's really good for. Shelter is a 2D city builder sim where you get to live out your dreams of being a Vault Overseer, and use resources to get weapons and outfits, train your people, and send them out to collect more resources. Since quests have been added, there is a lot more to do, but there really isn't a point to the game. You collect stuff, use your stuff to make bigger stuff with bigger numbers, and use that bigger stuff to get the biggest stuff. As with all city builders, you hit a critical mass at which there just isn't anything to do with your city as it will be mostly self sufficient, and the period of time that it takes to reach this critical mass is artificially extended through the classic freemium strategy of making you wait a period of time for a certain task to be accomplished, with the option of using Nuka Cola to speed up the process. There are a lot of references to Fallout 3 and a handful to 4 and New Vegas, but there is little to actually accomplish, even through quests.

This game is good if you want a bit of a nostalgia trip for the modern Fallout games, and does an excellent job of roping in old players to come back and fire up one of the main series games again, but has no depth past that. It's best played on mobile, where you can constantly check back in on the game for the time based actions, but if you have never touched Fallout it's probably for the best to stay away."
16558,"This game is really fun!
It's a freemium game, but you can apparently do everything without paying anything for it.
Radscorpions are overpowered."
16559,"At first, you get to have fun. Then, radscorpion trolling happens. All the time. This game does not even follow Fallout logics, as radscorpion, not only alone, but are WAY more dangerous than even a group of deathclaws. It likes to punish people for no reason at all, and actually enjoys it. Very time consuming, and mostly it is for microtransaction business. Biggest flaw that this game has though is it is for single-player only, and vaults are not shared between platforms, so you have to stick with what you started it on.

Good: Free (thougt long and hard, could not find anything else).

Bad: Single-player only, does not really offer anything after you start it, it is repeative and very time consuming.

Game is mostly based on luck. Even though you get free stuff at every game, it is ultimately random, in every situation. You can eiter get one good weapon and after that, no weapons at all for a long time, get one BAD weapon and nothing for a long time, or just bad weapons all the time. Little tactics with building, sure, but when you get stuff, that is based on luck, and seriously, when tough enemies starts to troll you constantly, you do not want to come back just to get trolled again. This feature could be mostly overlooked, if there was a way to be connected with other people (trade dwellers, items, do co-op missions or just to try to send small raiding parties (but not overpowered ones based on player lvl)). Cannot really suggest games that does not lead to anything and just eats time and life. This might be better on mobile phones (as it feels more like mobile game than pc game), but for pc, I did not feel like it should be part of Fallout serie.

Also, if playing without internet, gets incredibly laggy after a while, since it tries to force itself to connect to internet."
16560,"I found a cat in my lunch box.

Thanks mom, but I think its a little under cooked. 


10/10"
16561,My vault dwellers were doing fine until a radroach infestation killed everyone because they couldnt target the radroaches.
16562,the perfect game for free
16563,"I'm not sure why I keep playing this, but for some reason, I can't stop booting it up daily. Its honestly not that great but I just can't help myself :/"
16564,Hard to start but if you manage to get into the game it is really enjoyable.
16565,"Good for spending your free time, lacks in content though| 5.5/10"
16566,Very addicting game in the beginning.
16567,sup
16568,wow
16569,"This is a very good game.  It is quite addictive and enjoyable.  However, it has major flaws that translate to its mobile version.  Beware spending money on this game, as there is a very good chance your vaults will be reset with no warning or reason for doing so.  You will lose everything.  You have been warned."
16570,it is a fun and good game over all i think if they add more things it would be better
16571,"Fun game and a massive time sink. If you're just looking for some Sims like fun and have some time to kill, this might be the game for you."
16572,"Played this so much on iPhone and iPad when it first came out...got to the point that I was killing dwellers just to start over with the ""master race!""  with MAX S.P.E.C.I.A.L

Ok...some tips

DON'T build rooms on top of each other.  Leave a gap between levels so that fires and molerats can't go up or down directly to the other rooms!

You can get MORE Caps by just sending out dwellers to search the wasteland rather than doing difficult ""achievements"" with the worst case scenario being that they die.  Then just spend some caps to revive them and you will still profit from all the junk, weapons and outfits they bring back...remember they don't get attacked on the way back!

Once you get the Endurance Room, NEW dwellers should go directly to that room to MAX Endurance.  Then give them a Wasteland Outfit for additional E points.  This way each time they level up, they will get Maximum hit points per level.  If you can get a +7 Wasteland outfit you are golden !  After that it won't matter what other abilities you pad...

Always put 2 guards in the vault door room.  It will at least slow down Deathclaws so you can get ready to react.  Ghouls and Raiders will just be an annoyance.

When you get to the bottom level, that is where you should put your Dweller Living Quarters.  If fires, molerats or other problems occur it won't affect anything.  You can concentrate on the rooms and floors closer to the top.

Have fun..."
16573,"This is nothing new and its not worth the time it took me to say that, let alone a micro transaction, there is little to no secruity stoping you from giving yourself stuff or changing clocks with as little as code from the 70s..."
16574,"Recommended for a few hours of fun, but be warned the game gets incredibly boring after that."
16575,This game is fun on mobile i am playing on laptop and when it loads it crashes please fix this
16576,I would recommend this game but one this is fucking bullshit for me. I was playing and then they computer turned off when a death claw attack was happening and when i get back on my valt save was gone and i had to make a new one
16577,A suggetion is to add some of the past Vaults like Vualt 101 or 111 and get said Vault Dwellers like The Lone Wanderer or Sole Survivor
16578,"Good Points:
* The game is not fast
* has good game mechanics
* has good difficulty.
* Is free to Play
* Sticks to the Fallout Theme
Bad Points: 
* Scrolling and Zooming is difficult in when you have a large vault
* Selecting Characters can be difficult
* No way to select the Low health,No Clothing,No Weapon"
16579,good game
16580,"A waste of time.

It's a Fallout-themed grinder with no difficulty or depth."
16581,"It's like a Fallout themed city vuilder but the city is a vault. You are the Overseer assigning your vault dwellers tasks, and in charge of plannaing layout of the vault. Occassionally someone raids your vault and you gotta defend it. There are also quests and things for your dwellers to embark on to get crftaing materials, and gear. Overall the game is pretty light. It's not crazy difficult unless you just really suck at managing resources and keeping them happy. It is a very nice time waster."
16582,"Day 1 of vault: gets through tutorial,does some daily missions,gets a couple lunchboxes etc
                        i open lunch boxes,in my first one i get sarah lyons,some power,500 caps,and 1 nuka cola quantum.
                        opens second one,gets a kneecapper shotgun (from fallout 3),another 500 caps,another nuka cola quantum,then to my suprise,ELDER LYONS.

Responce to day one:As to quote ice cube: Tuday waz a gud day

:The Adventure continues:"
16583,"i realy like this game and it really kills time (like how i kill radroaches)and i would rate five stars ,also this is my best game"
16584,"An amazing twist on the Fallout franchise to Steam from the mobile platform. A wonderful game to sit back and relax to after playing a competitive match of Counter Strike: Globel Offensive with a bunch of Silver ranks. I suggest this to everyone who loves or has never heard of the Fallout franchise (how do you not hear about these types of games losers?!) for a fun, relaxing and creative game... with brief moments of rage!"
16585,"This is by far the best game I've gotten for free from Steam. It is very well balanced and well designed, and the addition of the ""Quests"" feature adds a more enjoyable dimension to the game than it would have otherwise. Fans of the Fallout franchise will find many familiar references, although in structure it is very different from the rest of the Fallout titles. For example, unlike other Fallout fames, there is very little strategy or tactics beyond deciding how to outfit individual characters.

Usually when you get a free game from Steam, the reasons for it being free immediately reveal themselves. This is not the case with Fallout Shelter, which is an extremely playable game that is much better than the price tag would suggest. It is true that the game is set up to offer many possibilities of spending money, but spending money does very little to make the game more playable. Paying for additional resources helps to speed up the game and increase your options a little faster, but this works very well as a standalone game without any additional money spent.

There's a great counterintuitive lesson here for game designers: the more playable the game is without extra features, the more likely players are to spend additional money on it. This is the only ""pay-for-more-stuff"" game in which I have actually paid for more stuff (about $5, not necessary but no regrets about it either), but it is the game that plays the best in its original form anyway. The games that play the best *without* add-ons may be the ones *most* likely to get revenue from add-ons.

This is not a rapid-fire game with much action, nor a lot of decisions to make every few seconds. It is a resources management game juggling several variables trending at different rates, and there are stretches of time where you are waiting for some clocks to wind down. On the plus side, it is a game that continues to 'play' by itself in relatively safe ways after you log off. It is an ideal game for 30m-1hour in the morning and 30m-1hr in the evening, or a game that you can switch back to once in a while while you do other things.

P.S. For those academic-minded people who like to analyze the fun out of video games, Fallout Shelter is a treasure trove for your Poli Sci or Gender Studies courses. The male and female NPC's are equivalent in all attributes except the fact that the female ones can get pregnant. This is the only game I can think of that features pregnant women, who in this game are simultaneously completely useless in a crisis and also completely indestructible. Combine that with the fact that you as a player have to practice eugenics to be successful, and you have a nice little outraged undergrad paper waiting to be written on this one."
16586,"While it's a port of a mobile game, I say it's a bloody good game to play while waiting on things.

Got a video to render? Boot up Fallout Shelter.

Waiting for your crush to text you back? Check on that quest progress.

Had a stressful day at work? Rush your workers too much for the job they're paying you to do."
16587,very good game
16588,"Hrm. Good and bad. The game is pretty fantastic in many ways. It's got depth, progression, and charm. What it hasn't got is a decent UI. I can't remember the last game on which I used quite this many swear words as I struggled to make the interface do what I want it to do. It's amazingly aweful. I would imagine this is because it was originally made for a touch screen and the port is just kinda half-assed.

In spite of that, I still give it a thumbs up, 'cause the core gameplay is fun. And hey, it's free(-ish). I can't complain about the price ;oP"
16589,Played almost 70 hours and my vault was great until I've lost it when I was forced to reboot my PC...
16590,this game is good ...
16591,"very addicted, and can be used while waiting for installment on other games
11/10 would use to wait again"
16592,chill game utk santai aja
16593,The game was fun until I've lost the save data in a reboot (both local and steam cloud ones). A total waste of time.
16594,"Waaaaaazzzzzzzaaaaaaa!

I don't know why I'm palying it. It's a crappy mobile game....addicting crappy mobile game. Find a 'proper' game instead of this. Oh, and downvote the shit out of crappy mobile games. Take the good fight!"
16595,"Personally, I cannot rate how well I liked this game because after 5 mins, I gave up. I didn't understand how to start building my shelter, who to place where, and it wasn't really my cup of tea. 

I would recommend this game if you like games that make you think and games that make you question every single move so that you won't kill off your workers during the plaque or whatever the deal was.

 I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't want to invest time into saving your workers.
"
16596,fallout copy. bad
16597,great but boring and no ending and run on sentence also get it for free oh wait :)
16598,was fun and a bit addictive until 90 hours in the game crashed and my save file was overwritten with a black save. . .
16599,Could be better just need to fix the mouse controls. I have to click above the person to select and it gets annoying. But I still recommend this game for a casual fallout experience.
16600,Love this game.
16601,It's more of an app you'd find in the iTunes Store than a game I'd pay for on steam.
16602,"I wouldnt bother.

I was quite prepared to spend ¬£30 on this games in features for your vault. Started off well. Descended into a farce.

Not sure why so many positive reviews... I hjave a feeling the staff gave lots of free stuff to people for the good reviews...and late comers like myself just have bullshit. 

After playing it once for an entire day, a guy carrying loads of stuff died in the waste land that had guns, clothing and  items I desperatly need. 

The crrunch is that the base building seems impossible to ever have enough power, food, water. 

So its just a chore with little go want you to play more cept building more rooms that need more resources that you need ot build more rooms for...a vicious circle... BUT if I had some decent Caps to begin with or that character made it back with some weapons and suits then I might have been happy or willing to spend more money on it. 

You would have more fun nail gunning your limbs with rusty nails whilst swiming in acid."
16603,Wy does anyone like this? BORING. So Slow. OMG. Nothing happens. My guys are surviing and that is alll. Nothing is happening. Do not play this game. Do anything else. So boring. They will try and draw you in with free shit. The game is build to extract $$$$$$$$ from you. Its terrible. Slow.. Crap. do anything else!!!!!!!
16604,So addictive.
16605,"Got all my female dwellers pregnant by one guy and then again with a different dude and all their daughters. Somehow ended up with 90, started with about 18 or so. Highly recommended."
16606,"Played in mobile version, a plain pain in the ass that I cannot precisely control my dwellers while maintaining zoomed out. Playing this on PC is far better than how it would feel like playing on mobile. A great timekiller it is, I recommend you to try this out."
16607,"Just use the save editor and become rich because #F*ckP2W

10/10"
16608,10/10 because you don't need to hear ANOTHER SETTLEMENT NEEDS OUR HELP I'LL MARK IT ON YOUR MAP.
16609,Shit
16610,"Fairly good little management game. You can find plenty of reviews, tips, tricks and videos on the net and I have nothing useful to add.

Except this.

Do make regular backup of your savegame file (which is by degfault under C:\Users\{your login}\Appdata\local\FalloutShelter\
I neglected to do that and just lost my thriving shelter to a game crash and save corruption (the file has been filled with ""NULL"" characters). This is a tad wee bit frustrating, as you could imagine -and at least I hadn't bought any bonus with real money: it would have been lost too."
16611,"I PLAY THIS ON MY PHONE, NOT ON STEAM, but can't link them both, which sucks.
Been playing a few weeks or so, 75 dwellers currently, just waiting for more to turn up out of the wastes, as waiting for kids to be born and grow up is sucky. 
Never had any resource issues at all, I'm still on the same vault I had when I first DLed it.

DON'T open the game unless you can give it your undivided attention, because if you're attacked by Radscorpions or Deathclaws in the higher levels, and you're not paying attention, they can do a whole lot of damage and suck away a whole lot of resources. 
It's FALLOUT, it's not supposed to be an 'easy' game, but I don't get all the negativity, people whining about resource loss are either building the wrong rooms, expanding the vault too fast for people to fill it, or not equipping the dwellers/posting them to the right places. 

If you manage your people right and give them the tools to work and fight, everything works out fine."
16612,.
16613,"I used to play this game on my phone even though it was pay to win I still enjoy to play, I was happy when I saw it on steam i transfered my data to PC. Game is SAME like on phone no real difference still pay to win game  just trading cards and achievements were added. For first few hours you gonna like this game but later you gonna get over it and gets boring although I like this type of games. 

Rating 7/10
"
16614,"It's a great idea. However, EVERY vault I built got wiped out by vermin. Just too much agrivation for me when I was Just looking for mindless entertainment to help me relax...
I am recommending the game because I think it's me that doesn't play it well enough (Even after +57 hours)."
16615,"Gets boring really fast, another generic mobile game"
16616,is nice gaem Xdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
16617,Love this
16618,"I had to change my opinion while playing.
It's not an good game, with good balance. critical is the starting, after a couple of hours you shelter is so stable that you have no danger to lose everything."
16619,nno
16620,"Report in,
220 hours played 

Recipes: 100% (last one received around 180 hour)
Achievements: 97% ; ""Blast From The Past"" achievement: 8/20
Dwellers: 195+ / 200 LIMIT (you always need spare for new ones)

From the time your Vault becames resource independant, the gameplay is limited to log once a day, do 3x Overseer's* Quests (yes, you are the Overseer, and yet you have to do all the work!). The Overseer quests ARE limited and the player will be left with Daily/Weekly/Special Quests only.

The quests are very repeatable and boring, and they are full of glitches.
..as the game itself.  There are numerous bugs reports on forums and I presonally confirm:
- the game freeze and hangs itself,
- the game could roll back to an old save point,
- despite countless clicks/taps you still don't click the object, due to broken in-game hitpoints,

The caps doesn't matter - later in the you'll use millions to:
- move some rooms
- upgrade some 
- buy some high lever items

Summary:
The game will take around 200 hrs to complete,
The steam achievement (Blast From The Past) is randomly aquired from lunchboxes and is very unlikely to get,
The game itself is a tap mobile game to kill your time.

Overall score: 6/10. 

Sicerely,

16621,GOOD HUNTING
16622,the game is every thing i hoped for great game
16623,Its a phone game. So if you dont like video games you will love this imitation of one.
16624,"Ever since i've played this game on my phone i've been thinking if you could play it on pc & then I saw it on steam & got it, It's really fun and easier & I hope other enjoy this game. :D"
16625,Ok ok i got to admit this game is so much fun! i cant stop playing it!
16626,thumbs up
16627,"Good game, except it crashes every 30 minutes.... The reason I thumbsed up is because the game is good otherwise, but the crashing can get annoying."
16628,"so addictive once you play its hard to stop!

10/10"
16629,"horrible game not fun
"
16630,"Fun little game to come back to every once in awhile between other games. Not really a game you can ""play"" for a long period of time, more like a fun little diversion Id reccomend."
16631,Very good game.
16632,fff
16633,"Is So Good Game So So Good Game Play The Game Now
Now Now Now"
16634,Tbh its too simple Minded of a Game
16635,its just awesome
16636,"Hah, who would waste time playing a mobile game on a top spec pc?

Takes a while to get the hang of things
micro transactions (but not as bad as most free to play games)



you can play this without spending 100s of dollars which is amazing
the game is fun and good for someone who doesnt have the money
to afford a Triple A Title. the game is fallout so its gotta be good
and the in game locations are from fallout 4 im pretty sure.
and pets....
"
16638,"after 1 year played, game has cancelled my savegames. 11/10 if you dont solve it . i dont play it again."
16639,its cool and nice that you can get your own vault and control all the people and i like to get people to go out of the vault and find new things
16640,awesoe game check it out fam
16641,"
Well, the truth, this game is wonderful. At first maybe you have to make several shelters as you fail, but when going to make more shelters and you put more hours, the game becomes very monotonous and that is the great thing about this game.
I have few hours played on pc but on cell phone, do not ask me."
16642,"I don't play mobile games very often but seen as i like fallout and this game was ported to PC i thought i'd give it a shot. Suprisingly it was a lot more fun than i expected, being able to run the vault and build out the rooms, manage the dwellers and send them on missions etc was all great and addicting. I took a break from the game as i spent more time than i wanted to actually but yea this is probably one of the few games i would actually play on my phone. 

Give this a shot if you like fallout and casual gameplay  / mobile games."
16643,"Awesomeness in its purest form!!!üòÄ‚ò∫üëªüëªüëªüëªüëªüëª Oops I just died because of having too much fun!!!!
"
16644,"Fun but a waste of time.
My vault file went corrupt. This morning I was laying in bed thinking, ""Yeah I should make a backup save for my vault.""
I start the game up and vault 666 (My vault) wasn't even on my list.
Last night I got the Tb-15 power armor form a lunch box. All that shit gone."
16645,"Amazing Game, Great Gameplay."
16646,"Game d·ªü v√£i c·∫£ l·ªìn

16647,...
16648,my friends can hear the do do dod od ododoooo bfsdsdjfksd and then ask me what it is every time 100/10
16649,Best game ever
16650,"Nice little basic game with basic graphics and storyline
Good little time waster if you have 10mins per day to play."
16651,"Fallout Shelter is a free to play game that is a fun little time-killer that doesn't require you to spend money to be enjoyable.  I first played this game on an iphone, but they've added quite a bit and improved the experience for the PC.  There are plenty of tie-ins to the Fallout universe that I really appreciate and you can do a lot to entertain yourself through customization.  I'm not sure that I would recommend this game to someone who isn't a fan of Fallout in general, as the simulation aspects are fairly weak, but at none-fifty, why not give it a shot?"
16652,"This game is actually pretty fun, especially if you're already a fan of the Fallout series. It has potential for those who enjoy base-building and management-style games, as well as side quests thrown in for a *tiny* bit of story here and there. There is no overarching story, however, so don't expect there to be anything beyond a surface attachment to the characters. The downsides of Fallout Shelter are that it takes a great deal of time to accomplish anything big, and the quests timers seem to be pretty extreme. These things make it pretty clear that the developers were intentionally coming up with ways to make a little quick cash on the side, offering goods for real money to speed the processes up. Still, for a free to play game and a way to kill time when you're bored and want something ""different"" to play, this is a good game to try. I definitely recommend giving it a shot, especially since you get to poke the Mysterious Stranger with your mouse from time to time."
16653,"Not a bad game, great if you just have some time to waste."
16654,"Unless you wanna throw your monitor outta the window, better stay away from this game until the devs pull their hands outta their arses. There are simply too many instances when you get dozens of dwellers wiped simply because the game does not allow you to do what you are trying to do, either moving them to the wrong room (you have to position them to the correct BACK wall frame, not FRONT cutout), or grabbing a wrong dweller or even a room (again, because it checks not where it's on the screen, but where it projects on the backstage)."
16655,"So fun, but will be difficult when you have a very big shelter."
16656,"While the Android version of Fallout Shelter was fun, the biggest problem was the lack of ""end game"" content (I use the term loosely, since there is technically no end). You eventually ran out of things to buy or upgrade and couldn't figure out what to do with your 200 dwellers.

The Steam version plays mostly the same, but with some simple yet crucial additions that make the game more satisfying. You can now do more with your dwellers than just move them from room to room. There are quests, random encounters in the wasteland, crafting, customization and more enemy types. On the mobile version I always ended up with too much Radaway since there was barely any need for them. In this version your base can be attacked by Radscorpions and radioactive Ghouls which you can encounter on quests, too. Now it's always necessary to keep up the production of both Stimpaks and Radaways. It's also possible to customize your dwellers' appearance in the Barbershop and collect themed interior designs.

While microtransactions exist (you can buy Nuka-Cola bottles to speed things up), it's very easy to earn what you need by completing quests, without too much grinding.

A couple of annoyances include pixel-hunting when you want to move a particular dweller hiding behind several others and end up clicking a dozen wrong things, and the frequency of attacks on your base. I've barely had time to nurse everyone back to health from the last Deathclaw rampage when another one is already starting.

Apart from these quibbles, the game remains an addictive little time-waster."
16657,at the start of every game not on survival mode everyone dies to the simply bugs even though they have guns they just run back and forth.
16658,Very fun and occupying game! Never gets boring or old!
16659,"Excellent game, worth a try."
16660,"The game where you ""Speed to win"""
16661,"Kept changing computer time to +7 days to get free lunchboxes, 10/10"
16662,"Awesome game, but with an EXTREMELY ANNOYING thing that makes it almost unplayable: radroaches. Damn things keep on spawning."
16663,"Easy to play, feel fun"
16664,Why
16665,"I'm LOVING THE GAME! :D
If you're a FALLOUT gamer, you will surely love it."
16666,"It's okay, a bit money-hungry, and it keeps crashing and/or saying it's running in steam when it's not which gets a bit annoying. I guess it's kinda like the actual Fallout series in that way. Entertaining nevertheless though."
16667,"This is a pretty good sim, but however it can make an addiction. Please dont spend money on this game, it is not worth it."
16668,.
16669,"Well, here's another mobile game vomitted on to Steam. Painfully poor game in every regard. The best thing about this game? Bethesda took the libery of storing your vaults saved files, locally. One can edit these files to give yourself as many lunchboxes, quantum colas, caps and whatever one desires free of charge.

A simple Google search will come back with many easy, simple saved game editors.

Which begs the question, why would you buy any of the garbage that is offered here on Steam, when one can get it for free? Not sure. Furthermore, why would Bethesda be so stupid as to store said files, locally instead of in the Steam Cloud?

I dunno, but it's probably the stupidest most foolish thing I've ever seen in my 25 years of PC Gaming. Bar none."
16670,"Fallout Shelter is a base-building game. It reminds me a bit of XCOM base-building. At first minutes it can be tough but in time you get more stuff as pets, boxes, legendary stuff, even nuka cola.
 
I like that people who made this addictive as hell game, are upgrading it, so now you don‚Äôt have to buy boxes from where you can get legendary dwellers, pets, other great stuff cuz you get this from missions. So now you can get everything but it requires some time, so you must be patient.

I‚Äôm not such fan of fallout so I don‚Äôt really see those easter eggs that people are talking about  but I believe that they  are there (I think as legendary dwellers or more). So as you can see, not only fans of fallout can play this and have fun. I will say it once more: this game is addictive as hell, like those clickers and it is a time killer, so I recommend it to everyone. Try it its free, so why not? It is a great way to relax and laugh a bit :)
"
16671,"hey release this game on my toaster, just like skyrim."
16672,"I lost 75 hours to this in two weeks.

That's almost as much time as I spent working my real life job to pay for my real life bills.

So yeah.  Maybe a little addictive."
16673,"This game is more for the stupid people... 
Rather addictive game with little to no game sense at all. Mole Rats and Roaches fly to the roof to get to the upper floor, Scorpions beam themself around over sever floors and fire takes rather forever to extinquish even with 6 Intelligence 12 people inside the room. 

DO NOT BUY ANYTHING OR YOU RUIN THE GAME FUN COMPLETELY!!!!!!!!

If you buy, the game gets so piss easy that it is really not worth the time.. or you are a total moron, then it will be rather hard to play. 

Funny things to try:
- Sick of Molerats.. just build elevators all around your constructions. They don't enter elevators at all, not even costs to much to scrap ;)
- Radscorpion. Just move out of the way, the teleporter insect runs off after some time anyhow. You ask yourself why it came in the first place.. just to cause some havoc and go again? The idea of Fallout Shelter is good, how it got implemented is a slap in the face for each Fallout player, so why Bedestha did you do it???? Just leeching money I guess...

The game is fun and a little challenge if you do not pay to win.. everybody can pay to win.. but finish it without some money, it is rather entertaining.

Let the Scorpions Teleport forever in your Vault! And Bro.. if you need a cheap to play this game.. consider suicide for the good of humanity.

(PS: You invested money and lost a vault... please, do not reproduce, man.. our genetic pool needs a upgrade, not more down grades) ^^"
16674,i like it
16675,Just change the time on your desktop to a day ahead to get free lunchboxes and wonder why anyone would buy them
16676,"If you like the energy resource games on Facebook, this is basicly the same thing.  Manage over a very long time power/food/water/people.   Added in random events such as fires and radroaches attacking, maybe more but dont have time or inclination to do this kind of game.  Facebook resource fans will enjoy the Skyscraper but reversed managment and it is ment for long term play, not faced pace at all."
16677,"Still a better RPG than Fallout 4, but there hasnt been new content for as long as a nuclear winter lasts. Devs just want Your money and dont give a frack anymore. I came back after maybe a year after last time I played and everything is as I left it."
16678,"Fallout Shelter is a great game. It is a great resource management game. I highly recommend this game.
"
16679,"Get ready to waist 1 hour...2 hours... 10 hours of your life playing this, it's amazing."
16680,"The game is fairly fun, but if your computer turns off, because of a crash or power outage or whatever, mid-game you lose your save and the backup."
16681,"I like this game. Simple, fun and just overall a good game. totally recommend it."
16682,I'll just check on my vault and go to bed. Holy **** how is it sunrise?
16683,"Good game, you must be very patient or rich if you want to play it"
16684,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!

Game is VERY glitchy, dont spend ANY money on this game.  My entire vault after 5 days bricked and is gone. Contacted support for refund 5 days after purchase and was denied for an entire week, they finally add items back instead of refunding, and one of the packages instantly disappears after I redeem with none of the items applied to my account. Worst experience with Steam and a Game ever. Im going to go outside now and smash my head against a wall, its more rewarding than this game."
16685,"Amzing game, never gets boring untill you have to wait for an item, or quest but Great! 5/5 stars!"
16686,i do recommend ths ut i keep getting this glitch when i start a quest it take 10 hrs 30 mns to arrive so i close down the game come back 4 hours later says 10hrs 29 mins its a waste of time!
16687,"It's a really fun game, worth a try!"
16688,This is a smartphone game converted to pc availability.  Nice to occasionally play every once in a while.  Its like a chia pet or tomagochi game.
16689,What the fuck! I've lost all my game saves! This could have been a good game until my vault has been deleted even from the cloud. WTF!
16690,Ive been playing this game for a long time now with a large vault over 120 dwellers and i handle every attack ranging from death claws to radscorpions easily. I enjoy playing this game alot!!!
16691,its alright
16692,It's lower quality so people with worse pcs can easily play this game
16693,"Normally I'm not a fan of what looks like a mobile game on Steam. This game which is free however has a lot of charm and appeal. Its certainly not Pay to win or progress. I've not paid into it and have alot of fun with it so far. If you're a fan of Bethesdas Fallout series I would not hesitate to grab this. Give it a try, its free and fun."
16694,Good game :)
16695,HAS BEEN A SO FAR GREAT GAME TO PASS THE TIME WITH ID HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU WANT SOMEHTING TO DO AS A LITTLE SIDETHING TO WHAT EVER MAIN TASK YOU MAY HAVE...!
16696,This is fun game to play.  The game goes slow if you do not purchase any in-game items. But somehow that never bothered me; its just fun being in charge of the Vault. You are S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
16697,"Pros: 
-it works decently well on pc (unlike mobile)
-fallout theme
-quests
-good time killer

Cons:
-a bit hard to get good stuff without forking $$$ over, especially pets.
-limited game due to mobile origins
-there are a few bugs

Other thoughts:
This game is SUPER easy to crack. Just download the game on mobile and crack it there then transfer the file to PC and boom. instant caps, maxed people, decent gear, a sizable base, and unlimited quantum cola."
16698,"Fun time killer, especially but not only for when you're a fan of the franchise.

I've played the android version from shortly after release and got bored rather fast (that was before there were quests, for example). I didn't check back ever since, but seemingly this version comes with everything? At least it kept me coming back despite various minor bugs. Until now. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, make seemingly important progress in offline mode. While I can't confirm this happens all the time, it happend this one time and this should NEVER happen. Finished a questline that should have provided me with another but didn't.

Another big downer for me though: getting enough legendary dwellers for the achievement is virtually impossible (without spending actual money)

If it weren't for the dwellers and the game breaking bug I'd recommend this. It's free, and you can't make a lot of mistaktes, but don't expect too much."
16699,fucking goooooooooooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16700,"At first, I was very happy to see this title, especially because it's free. But then, after hours and hours of playing, building my vault and growing community, it all went down just because some irradiated animals being too vicious and impossible to control. OK, I just lost all of my people in this vault, so I decided to delete this very first and start a new one. But the history repeated, and then I lost my nerves. So, the only logical move was to uninstall, although I felt sorry, because I'm Fallout fan, but I simply didn't wish to start again from the beginning. I'm ready to install and play the game again, but this needs to be fixed ASAP, otherwise I can't recommend the game to nobody. Sorry!"
16701,"Balding children.

10/10"
16702,"Fun little idle game. Haven't felt like there was anything that I needed to pay for, but it's nice that the option is there for people that want it."
16703,A surprisingly deep and addictive game ! I recommend that everyone try this game ! Especially Fallout fans ! A Simple and fun game !
16704,"This is fun for all of 30 minutes if even that, its very slow paced, dynamic events are too repetitive, there is very little way of options and upgrades."
16705,"i had a vault that i sunk about 37.5 hours on and spent at least 70$ on it, got cool characters, neat weapons, a ton of caps! my people loved me, completed alot of quest!, but then an update or something happened, deleted ALL my FREAKING VAULTS! i wouldnt call it a waste, just a loss"
16706,"*When you lose a vault to a food shortage that you can't @$!%ing fix because no matter how many diners you build it won't really do anything and you just get so @!$%ing bored that you send ALL of your dwellers out into he waste land to DIE.*







Seriously people...
Don't play this game unless you wanna get bored as --ll and lose your vault because your DEVICE DIED, AND/OR send your brainless, stupid dwellers who can't even take care of THEMSELVES VERY MUCH (I mean, if there's a food shortage DON'T DEPEND ON THE OVERSEER, and DON'T GET UPSET ABOUT IT. LIFE IS LIFE YOU GOSH DARN DWELLERS) to the wasteland to DIE."
16707,pretty boring in my taste but hey maybe you would enjoy it.
16708,gud
16709,"Well, it is a pretty alright game.

Try not spend any money, it's not worth the cash. Trust me."
16710,eh.. fun i guess
16711,"For a free to play game this is awesome! 

I also appreciate the small details like showing the progress of the people you send out to scavenge - it just makes the game a bit more immersive in the post-apocalyptic world."
16712,Yes
16713,"I have played this game on my phone for years, so naturally I'm super happy about it being available for pc... and free! I will sink so much time into this tap game."
16714,"Fallout Shelter is yet another great design by Bethesda that incorporates the survival in a post-apocalptic wasteland into a tycoon/simulator style game. There are countless hours of gameplay included, frrom desigining your own Vault, to exploring abandonded buildings that come across you while in the wasteland on a pure luck basis, I can easily see how people have devoted hundreds of hours into the game.

The way the tycoon progresses, with so many different options to choose from and full control over your own Vault, really makes me want to play more. It might not be very fun to sit down at it for over 2 hours at a time (unless you have a ton that you can do on the game) but it's a great time-killer or one of those things I check every few hours to see how my progress is going.

If I had to suggest one thing to the game developers, I'd have to ask you to place a timer on the buildings that you add in. It ruins the immersion to just magically have a power plant appear out of nowhere, and having a 1-24 hour timer on everything you can build would seem great. Another thing that I'd like to see implemented in the game is the ability to spectate your exploring wastelanders. It would take an immense amount of time to create and code, but overall I think the experience of seeing that fugitive slave who needed to be patched up would help the game seem a lot more enjoyable and realistic.

Lastly, I'll throw in the pay to win aspect. There are many purchases that you can make to help aid you, from lunchboxes, to nuka cola bottles, and while sometimes the game can require a lot of idiling and it will help a great amount if you purchase these items, you will do just fine if you do not purchase anything in the entire time you've played the game. I'd do it only to support the developer as there's no point in boosting something taht you can just awit overnight or go to work and come back to have it done.

Final words: please give this game a try. It's a great entry level game, it's a great time-killer. It's simple, runs great on a bad computer, and I promise that you will find some kind of enjoyment in building your own Vault."
16715,"I'll give this game a thumbs up because it sets out what it means to do - scratch that Fallout itch with a light-hearted take on this fallen universe.  The mechanics are simple and easy to learn within minutes, the dialogue is funny, and the art direction is colorful and fits Fallout lore, albeit repetitive on the quests.  It's great to pick up and play for just a few minutes.  

The game does have its problems however.  I already mentioned the repetiveness of the quests and the combat is painstakingly SLOW at times.  There is almost variance to the enemies you'll defeat - get used to killing a lot of radroaches, mole rats, raiders and the occasional rad-scorpion.  I would be remiss not to mention that even though it is free to play, there really isn't a way to push through the game very quickly without spending some dough on nuka cola quantums and lunch boxes, which don't come cheap.  And getting all the legendary characters, weapons and clothing?  Forget it.

Still, if you like Fallout then this is certainly worth dabbling and having some fun with it.  If I wasn't into Fallout myself, my review might be a bit different."
16716,"At first it's pretty fun and addictive game, but when you start to play it little bit more it gets very boring very fast. There is not much to do in this game, but I'll still recommed you to give it a shot if you like games that you will get bored very fast."
16717,"The game comes off very well made, interesting, and fun. If you love it at first as much as I did, you'll want to pay some money when the sales come. Maybe <$5 for the mr. handys, maybe more.. But I've come to regret paying. I'm done playing this game anymore, because it's just lost its interest to me. I'm curious what the developers are doing, doubt they are working on this game or have for a while. They probably just make little decisions after talking to steam about when to have a sale.

I said no I don't recommend this game only because I don't think you should EVER pay for this game, not even a penny.
Go ahead and try the game out though, bur do not get sucked in... the game is time based...

ps. there are developers that make games that are SO MUCH better than this, for free."
16718,"its a good game but its hard and thats the fun part i know it takes time but still its fun i love the character looks you can equiped your character with fun costumes and the mystery box thingys so i'd say this is a good game
"
16719,...
16720,It is good.
16721,"Perfect slow paced time-killing game that requires a check-up about 2 times per day.

Requires some proper planning in the beginning of the game due to lack of dwellers and caps and need in resources, gets much more chilling mid-/lategame. Surprisingly easy to handle everything without spending money, just be patient.

No rush, the whole wasteland is yours.
Comprehended Zen ‚Äî achieved Inner Calm and Peace of Mind thoughout playing the game."
16722,"Fak THE RAT
Fak THE ROACH TOO"
16723,play for free
16724,Fallout shelter is an excellent productivity management toy. Way better on Steam than iOS.
16725,Creating an underground town. Adventure and quests. Less stress. Totally recomended for non-intense players like me.
16726,pretty fun.. but i wish we can re-arrange the rooms if fully upgraded.. thats the only thing i want right now :D
16727,good game
16728,nice game
16729,"Do not buy from the store. I love this game, but I bought 5 lunchboxes, hit the redeem button and the items just dissapperared. Talked to Steam who  say the items were consumed. No they were not. I never recieved them. Talked to Bethesda they say I have to go through Steam. 

Thankfully it was only $3.99 but it's the last $3.99 Steam gets from me."
16730,"Good, and bad.  Fun and oblique.

A basebuilding game - except you don't get defenses.

The last few updates gave us pets and crafting, and nerfed finding anything decent when exploring.  Its also made it even more of a beast: my tablet crashes whenever I elect to go into a wasteland quest, while my PC no longer ever gets wasteland quests - when it doesn't crash from an ATI driver issue.

NOT politically correct, based in morals of the 1950s you'll see things which make no sense so they could... ???  Like a Soldier's Uniform is a female-only outfit.

Still no way to tell explorers to drop the tons of junk they pick up.  Still no way to move rooms around. Still a limit of 200 dwellers. Still a limit of 999,999 caps (which are effectively useless in the late game).  Still Radscorpions who will kill off all your dwellers if you dare follow their directions and upgrade your rooms to L3..."
16731,"At first this game seems rather good, i built a large vault and had many people in it however after i had sunk many hours into this game i came accross one flaw that ruins the game. The fact that i can't go five minutes without Radscopians, Raiders, Death claws, Mole rats and Rad roaches attacking my base and harming my dwellers. not only that but fires will randomly break out in completly empty rooms and these will usually spread to the rest of the vaukt where most of my dwellers will die."
16732,Fun time killer for fallout fans.
16733,"This is a very fun and addictive mini game ,only thing that i find highly annoying is that my steam overlay never seems to work with it even though it works fine with all my other games"
16734,"pretty good, needs less preston"
16735,It's a fun free to play game that if you haven't tried yet I'd highly recommend giving it a chance.  (And if you like it you can even try it on your phone as well).
16736,"This game can be addicting and is truly fun to play if you have nothing to do. If love you Fallout, you will love Fallout Shelter!"
16737,"Fun game, simple gameplay however it's slow to get started. Bad thing is the game constantly crashes. Doesn't link up with the phone app (at least to my knowledge).

9/10 will survive nuclear fallout again
"
16738,Good
16739,"At first i didn't like it. You need to play and then you'll see wheter or not you like it. I never liked 2D games but this is Fallout and i love Fallout. All Fallout fans should get this, even if you only played like Fallout 3.
(ORIGINAL REVIEW: JULY 6TH)


EDIT (AUG 15): Quests are repetitive. Somehow i haven't gotten a f   ing fatman yet despite opening billions of lunchboxes. Also, all i get are recipes for absolute garbage @$$ weapons despite it being legendary recipes. I also get the worst pets ever. 
Still recommend if you haven't tried it.

EDIT (11-26-17): A week ago i tried to re-love this game. It basically gave me a EfYuSeeKay_You as a 'Welcome Back'; man got raideded.
Try it for yourself, that way you can make a review yourself"
16740,A ja mislio da  ce ovo biti lakse.
16741,"This will be a longer review;

Despite what is shown here, I have played this game, up, down, sideways and diagonaly, most likely for well over 500h and went late game, just not on steam but in the mobile version, in the past year and a half.

This is a great great game, with a few notes. It's not meant to be played continuously for hours and hours, although after a while you can. The great thing in the game is balance, while early game you'll spend most of your time tweaking your vault, later you will spend less time there and more time on quests or looking for nuka-cola.
The by far best thing is the fact that they took time and ironed out all the bugs from the android version, at least as far as I can see. I've have many month old vaults wrecked by a disaster that never ends, and kills everyone, and the loading time on android tended to get silly in some of the patches.
Over time the developers have indeed added many things to the game, expanding it, and there is still plenty of room left. And by far best, the game trully is F2P, everything can be achieved without spending anything, though it takes longer ofc., but these aren't obcene timers like in some of the other ""f2p"" games, ranging in hours, rather than weeks.
Indeed spending money on survival mode feels rather like a cheat than a bonus.

And the comedy in the dialogue is both hilarious, and ofc, sometimes heavily tied to the Fallout series.

For me this is without a doubt the best F2P game out there..... ever.

I think I will even write up a guide in the forums."
16742,Great game for time killer
16743,Bueno
16744,Its a very hard game to keep your peps alive but the gracpics kinda funny but its cool
16745,Run time when i'm waitting for somthing
16746,"It was a good game, but I was frequently getting attacked by Rad Roaches for no reason. No one survived the Radroach infestation of Vault 17 because they couldn't aim correctly with their Laser Rifles and 10 mm pistols"
16747,"Love this game, i'm addicted to it, it can be quite slow to start off but once you get your vault going its bomb! 
I wish that i could have more than 200 dwellers and more room to build my vault (please!)
But other than that i really love the game and it's humour!
10/10 Good work Bethesda!!"
16748,Amazing
16749,wow
16750,time well spend in my office
16751,"I really enjoy this game. I like that it's kind of a different version of the Fall out games. One that isn't quite as quick paced, and casual. Lots of achievements, and lots to do. Quests, and objectives, and dwellers to assign to rooms. Basically you make sure that as you build your vault, that it also runs well. I've had a few goes at this game with a few different saves, and it's interesting to see what works and what doesn't. Tons of fun as a casual game."
16752,Build your own vault... Awesome!!!
16753,Great casual gamer that continues the lore of the full game. However after losing my save file and having to start again for the fourth time I am out. :(
16754,"If you have multiple displays, this could be a nice distraction from time to time."
16755,"This game is everything a free to play game should be. Fun and simple mechanics, but with some depth. It doesn't penalize you for leaving the game alone for a few days, weeks, or months. You will come back to the same Vault you left. 

The microtransactions are truly optional, as you get can get the same things as a fair rate, but if you want them more or faster, you can pay a few dollars. 

It actually makes me want to pay a bit just to support this model example of a FTP game."
16756,"A pretty cute game for stalling time, but shouldn't be played for long periods of time. Unfortunantly it follows the f2p trend of making people wanting to spend money out of frustration. I'll probably keep playing it while catching up on video series I've missed, but I'm not going to put any money into it. If there was a $10 version that had active gameplay and also didn't have any pay-to-win/cash shop elements I would most likely buy it.

I have to say, art style wise this game is adorable and a lot of the random chatter is pretty adorable. I also feel like there's a lot of potential for colony sims with rpg side elements."
16757,"Well, dis game is.. AWESOME"
16758,Secretly I quit Facebook to dedicate myself to play Fallout Shelter more. It's a little addictive.
16759,I didn't thought it to be a good game. But its a good game after all
16760,Nice game to fulfill free time
16761,Building and crafting like Minecraft like Fortnite.
16762,Why is this game so addictive?
16763,great fun game to kill time
16764,Love this game <3 An easy way to kill time and enjoy the Fallout universe after playing through all the games.
16765,seem to small to control... some time!!
16766,Fallout Shelter is simple to play and addictive as hell
16767,Pretty good and fun. Go for it !!!!
16768,good and fun game
16769,"Bethestda adapations of fallout fail to capture what fallout is about. Still.. inside the vault the expected atmosphere is not too different from the adaptation.

It's not too bad but it doesn't go anywhere."
16770,ezz fun to play
16771,Hey you wanna play something that is actually decent well there are other things but hey still better than fallout 76
16772,"I was plain dis dumb gaem ... crazy shiet... I name 2 of these dwellers as Shane and Lori and suddently, iam getting raided by goddamn raiders, really original... so I look and Shane is bangin Lori in the social room and she comes out like... seems pagenant... and that reminds of thangs and fk this gaem."
16773,"Probably the best concept for a fallout game, which is to build, upgrade, manage and survive in your own vault as overseer. Gameplay is casual and centered around logging in at least once a day to run your vault.

[b]PROS[/b]
> Good concept of vault basebuilding.
> The quests are great.
> The character dialogue is fun.
> Weapons and clothing interesting to discover, build and collect. 
> Addition of pets, vault attacks, and objectives were great ideas.
> Casual gameplay. 

[b]CONS[/b]
> The game likes to hijack my camera angle and zoom distance often, and it can become a bit tedious and annoying. 
> If your character is ready to level up and you do a special attack it levels your character up afterward regardless of the fact that you didn't click to level up. 
> If a character is maxed out in a training room like perception, and you want to swap them out for another character in another training room like strength, it sometimes swaps in a character from the strength room who is already maxed out in perception, despite the fact that there were 5 other better choices. 

[b]CONCLUSION[/b]
None of the cons are potentially game breaking, they're just annoying. More fun and interesting than fallout 4 and more replay value. If Fallout 4 followed base building along these lines it would have been more engaging for me. Would definitely recommend playing if you enjoy the fallout series."
16774,"Playing this game a while, you will realize most of your dwellers come from incest"
16775,It's the 4th of July weekend and I'm having a blast. America.
16776,"Fallout Shelter is a waiting game/simulation game based on the Fallout universe. You are the overseer of a vault, and it is your job to build up your vault and its population, looking after them and protecting them. This seems really neat. And honestly, it is a really cool idea, and it is fun for a while. But eventually you realize that the game is an enormous addiction engine, and underneath that addiction, there‚Äôs actually not all that much game. After a while, you will notice that the game becomes repetitive and you will start playing just for the achievements. One of them (collect 20 legendary dwellers) is almost impossible to get by legitimate means (or by spending real money). I reckon developers are just encouraging cheating, and I really feel bad about it. The game is too long (slow progression), it has a lack of depth and is very repetitive."
16777,"Nice little game about clicking to get resources in an endless turn of repetitive events without a real story but fixed-steps quest lines.

I've enjoyed very much exploring other places, but maintaining the bunker becomes a chore after 4-5 hours. You have many choices and action and such, but it feels very soon like you go into maintenance mode. Obviously, there's an explanation for this:

> THE GAME LOOSES VERY QUICKLY ITS MOMENTUM AND TO KEEP IT GOING YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY ON IT.

That's what was expected of a ""FREE TO PLAY"" game. More like ""FREE TO PLAY for 3 hours until you get hooked, then come and whale all over the place"". Sadly for them, I don't whale and I wasn't hooked at about 6 hours.

TL;DR: same old F2P story..."
16778,cool
16779,best game
16780,"This is a good management game and it's free. I normally don't like these type of free to play mobile port games. However, This is an exception as in my opinion you don't have to spend a penny to get enjoyment out of this game at all. The game is fair to new players and gives you a decent amount of lunch boxes by completing very easy tasks.

This is the 3rd version of this game I have played. I currently have it on my iPad and the Windows 10 version as well in this steam version. I do admit I put some money into this game only ¬£10 for 50 lunch boxes during the sale. But this was mostly due wanting me to give something back to the devs for giving me an addicting and fun game to play. At the point of buying the lunch boxes my vault was coming along very well. I simply wanted to reward the devs and at the same time see if I could obtain some of my favorate characters to live in my vault from the other Fallout games.

I don't sit here playing this for hours on end as it's not designed to play like that. This is designed to play in short bursts at a time. For example ill throw this on for a half hour while am waiting for a game to download or even while am trying to decide what game to play next.

Again, this is not a game you play all day. This is just a short bust game. Again, you also don't have to put money into this game at all (in my opinion) as I think you can earn your fair share of lunch boxes by doing easy tasks. 
"
16781,Such a fun game
16782,AWESOME GAME! No doubt about it. You really just need patience and determination with this game and it will keep you busy for days. WARNING: Please don't try searching for cheats. Cheats will make this game boring within a week.
16783,"As long as you aren't looking for anything too deep this game is fine and a decent distraction.  

There are flaws:
The continuing idea of vaults being designed AFTER the apocalypse is kind of dumb and not remotely cannon.
You do Not get to play the evil Vault-Tech experimenters as there are no experiments.
It is clearly just a game designed to try to get micro transactions-it is free after all.


But it is still somewhat enjoyable.
"
16784,"This is the prequel to Fallout Shelter 2 (Fallout 4)

All jokes aside, it's pretty fun for a time killer and surely gives you something to do when all you see on your Steam Games list is ""I HAVE NO GAEEMS""."

16786,mobile is a bit better...
16787,issa good
16788,It was a good idle waster game on my phone and is just the same on pc. Good but not great.
16789,A good game to play if you like to maintain settlements in Fallout 4 or just like a low-pressure game that kills time.
16790,"Great game, 84 hours played. Game completion - 97% couldnt get the last achievement as luck was required to obtain legendary dwellers."
16791,"I think it's a good game,But not for PC,just for iOS or Android"
16792,Fun
16793,"Fun for a few days, when you realize the game is just a digital form of ground-hog day it starts to lose charm rapidly. If the developers gave even 1% of a care about meaningfull story telling this game could be awsome, but instead the quests are constantly 4th wall breaking annoyances with zero meaningfull choices. This game could be really good for a skinner box mobile game but instead it's nothing more than a souless cash grab painted fallout 4 style. No thanks."
16794,"Free, good time waster, no need to log every day to collect a silly bonus or to keep your dwellers alive like in the usual Facebook games. However, it really needs to option to save your game on cloud. I played it before on phone, then I moved to Bethesda.net losing all progress. I manage to trasnfer my progress after I migrate to Steam, but if anything will happen with my HDD I may lose it forever."
16795,Awesome
16796,"Not as good as the mobile version of the game, but serves the purpose of filling time when waiting for people to get online"
16797,"very addictive game.
i like it! 
[9/10]"
16798,Addicted to playing this on my phone.
16799,"Take fallout and add base building, RPG elements, go on missions, explore the wild.  It is fun but there is a timer effect with missions you see in games like farmvill.  It is fun and it is still supported by the devs."

16803,"Have a special someone who isn't into video games? Maybe a FWB that doesn't understand the special addiction we all share? Introduce this game to them, like yesterday. It will begin their slow spiral down into the video game depths that my wife teased my 4 sons and I about. She still revisits and plays (she is very upset that Larry keeps dying) on a regualr basis. Not sure if it's the babies, the coffee break lazies or Bottle & Cappy. Whay I do know is her video game library now includes Fallout Shelter, Civ VI, The Witcher II, Stronghold HD and a few others."
16804,fallout
16805,Good game and all its mechanics.....but don't recommend until they fix your vault being randomly deleted. Glad I wasn't one of those people who spent a ton of in-game money just to get all the hard work disappeared.

Things turn back to normal. All thing in game look clear cut again. 
So, It totally not a fault from my end and DEV fix that without mention anything. 

In this case, bug is fixed. I will change my review to recommend again. 

YES, YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME SMARTLY WITHOUT PAYING REAL MONEY TO GET GOOD VAULT. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review at the date of 3rd July 2017 

I don't know what happens in lasted patch of this game. 
It makes everything look blurry and no one knows how to fix that.

So, I not recommend you lose your eyes health over this."
16826,nice game
16827,loved it
16828,"Super fun and adictive, it wont let you rest at the moment you blink you already lost half of your Dwellers."

And i play it this on notebook. 300h
Now i play it this on steam. ???h
It is a really addictive stuff.
Be careful, i have spoken! 
This to good to be real for free.

( for the bug --> if you lose your save, you need to sign in one another pc and thats download the cloudsaving, for me thats working if i have thats save issues bug, meet pleasure)"
16830,10/10 Great for spaffing
16831,a really good game nice and calm but needs trading cards
16832,budget fallout
16833,"Good amount of content for free. 

You can use a save editor if you want some of the premium currency/boxes."
16834,"great game, but crashes all the time on PC."
16835,More time consuming than you would assume.
16836,"Lacking information on what things do, I'm full of questions. What do those special stats on workers do? What stats are good for each room?"
16837,"[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]
Fallout Shelter is a supervisor/mantinance/managment simulator, which puts you in the role of a Vault overseer overseeing a vault.
Fallout Shelter was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released Mar 29, 2017.

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] There's not much to the story... well... not on it's own anyway. If you've played the fallout games there are plenty of nods to the lore within the fallout universe.

To put it simply, the fallout universe takes place after a nuclear exchange October 23, 2077, and now the people survive in complex underground systems known as Vaults.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] In fallout shelter you need to keep your dweller's happy and content, maintain water, food, and energy levels, build new rooms, send dwellers out to gather resources, and much more.

The basic gameplay loop is ""Make sure your stats are maxed"" [i](That takes a bit to get balanced out at the start of the game)[/i], then slowly arm and equip all of your dwellers in the best gear possible.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] I started playing Fallout Shelter to do something different with my time, and to wean myself off clicker-heroes.
If you're looking for a time sink; this is as good a choice as any. While not as complex and satisfying as other simulation styled games... I enjoy booting up the game, checking my stuff and then logging off to go about my day.

16838,es divertido para pasar el rato

16842,Good game .But time consuming 34/35 archievemnts are easily archievable.
16843,Awesome lil game
16844,You can play it on your phone but when you transfer your save file to your pc on steam you will not unlock any achievements
16845,"Fallout Shelter is a F2P game that originally surfaced on mobile devices a few years ago shortly before the release of Fallout 4. I remember completely failing at the task at hand and had my Vault and its Dwellers silenced forever due to a series of unfortunate events. I can only remember Deathclaws and my poorly equipped bunch valiantly defending their incompetent Overseer. 
 
Recently the game was released on Steam and I thought it best to try and redeem this Overseer's tarnished record. The good news is that Vault 757 is flourishing nicely and has a lovely bunch of Dwellers who either wander around taskless or work 24/7 365 days of the year doing what they know best... constantly turning a valve. 
 
I have to say that having had a fresh approach to the game, it is really accessible and it  is refreshing  not to have microfractions constantly pinging up asking you to spend more and more until your savings are  non-existent.  You can have it running in the background while you do some work or browse the latest news. Yes, tasks can be repetitive and you do have to wait to reach quests(Which is the interesting part). However I'm sure you have more important things to do rather than mindlessly click on tabs... If you get tired, you can buy a few  Mr Handys to automatically collect resources. Just be careful not to have them engage with raids or infestations as these lovely machines cost 2000 caps each to repair. 

It's a neat little management game and I would recommend you give it a go. Just remember to keep those Stimpaks and RadAways stocked and you'll do just fine! 
"
16846,xaaxaxxa
16847,It's fun when you send out your valut dewellers into the wasteland to die. It's even more enjoyable when they are parents because it makes the child realize how pointless life is.
16848,Nice and simple game to spend time.
16849,Ish good game 2/10 would go to Ghost Zone for
16850,Fun little time killer.
16851,gud
16852,"Great game, originally for mobile
then ported for PC...
just dont recommend spending money on it...you spend money on lunchboxes, you loose it if you delete the vault or if they all die...really no need to buy them anyways, it just takes all the gameplay out of it...
its way better, and more fun to just get them from quests and missions
my current vault is at 40 dwellers, 75% of them are almost maxed in every special stat, and have weapons with 10+ damage
have 4 pets, and several dwellers from lunchboxes... (Bittercup OP)
havnt spent a single penny on the game

10/10 do recommend playing, both PC and mobile"
16853,"Nice game.
"
16854,Pitty good
16855,"A simple, yet good game to help wait for some other stuff going on, or to chill a bit if you're studying. 
This game will not allow you to play too much in a session, so you have to come back every few hours, or plan for much larger periods of time. 
Also available (initially) from google play"
16856,Pretty meh game not gonna lie
16857,"So far overall it is quite a fun game but please Bethesda it could have been so much better.
I do love the spin-off of the fallout universe here but it is too simplistic and mole rats that wrecks your bunker and crawl through walls and floor like it was made of paper thin aluminium, that is just intellectually offending for the player.
Everyone in the room takes damage from 1 radscorpion as if it actually was a fire in the room, too obvious and it is just as annoying to see.

Only 2 dwellers can occupy the vault door room which is the most important room you would think to actually defend and there is no option to build a defense system? turrets? guardbots? hello? How about a guard/security room that will automatically send dwellers occupying the room to the area of emergency?
The vault door is made of what? Ghouls breaking down a solid metal heavyduty vault door with punches and kicks, sigh..

Would have made it more interesting to be able to be sieged by raiders/creatures, forcing you to break the siege so your wanderers could return inside the bunker and be able to send out people to explore or go for quests again.

Being able to choose if you want to start building outside the vault to setup trading routes with settlements which you unlock through exploring would be a thing, being able to build up a town connected to your vault would be cool aswell.
Doing so would increase the risk you would be discovered by raiders/mutants/ghouls/creatures.

Raiders stalking your wanderer to your vault which would lead to severe attacks on your vault/outside settlement, you being able to launch attacks on raider/mutant camps to stop those attacks.

You are saying you are a million dollar game company yet release shallow games, where is the passion and creativity?
Make proper spin-offs of the Fallout universe and you will shower in money.

Make a new game called Fallout: The overseer, make it roguelike or at least that option to have that. If you dwellers die they die for good.
Make it so you have to hunt for food, have your own greenhouses inside the bunker and such.
A fallout bunker simulator! make it happend please !

Totally skip the realtime clock thing... waiting 10h for a weapon to be built is crap.
Not that I want everything to be instantly done but something more suitable for in game gaming if you know what I mean.
I mean the game is literally best played just by going into the game and press the green stuff and save exit asap before the mole rats spawns.

Then again this game was given for free which is very nice of Bethesda.



TL;DR: Overall fun game could have been much better.

Bethesda needs to do more proper fleshed out spin-offs of the fallout universe and not just another elder scroll reskin."
16858,Really enjoyed the game.  I played it every day.  Power goes out while playing the game.  Start up game later to find my vault is gone.  I lost over 70 hours of playtime.  If you are going to play don't spend any money on items you will lose your investment.
16859,"Just one more quest...  just one more objective... just one more level...

16908,Very wow. Much fallout. much good.
16909,"Loved this on iOS.  Unplayable on PC.  So friggin' buggy.  It will not run without an error of some sort, the latest I've encountered is the animations freezing, but the game continuing to run in the background; even in the loading screens.  I have to minimize the window to the taskbar then bring it back to get three frames of animation only to have to do it all again.  So very disappointed."
16910,"I can say that this is probably my favorite thing to do on my phone, so take my time and quadruple it if you want an actual value.  I have been playing this since late in 2015 on my phone.  It came to Steam and I love to be an achievement completionist on the games I really like, so that's what I am doing now.  This is one game I wish I had never seen, I can forget how much time I am in it to easily.

This game is addictive.  It is not a pay to win game, you can win it by just playing as it is.  If you really like it though, buy a pack or something to let them know they did a good job.  But, back to the game, it is kind of like a Fallout themed Sim Tower (a Maxis title from way back when)  but has some more interesting diversions in the form of quests.  Train your dwellers, send them on quests or just to explore the wateland.  Setup your base to balance out the needs and to have the rooms to help make your vault more successful and customizable.

Starting out the game is tricky, I have found it takes me a little while to get things rolling smoothly and to get the balance worked out.  I have built probably seven or eight 200-person vaults but the challenge for me has been to try to get a 100-125 person vault working stable, then I can weed out the riff-raff as I find legendary and rare dwellers, pets, armors and weapons.  The Mr. Handy's help immensly in keeping the base stable for gathering resources.  Being of a collector nature, this game preys on my weakness.

So if you are immune to collectionism, completionism, loss of time-ism, and addictivism, this is not the game for you, it would be too boring.  Otherwise join the rest of us, everyone is doing it.  Oh, and the first one is free. ;)"
16911,"Great free to play game. 
Everything was fine until those god dammed RADSCORPIONS

So fucking op and frustrating. 
Not a real challenge, cause i have maxed out dwellers and can just revive dead people

But this shitty thing steals way too much electricity, moves around rooms too fast. its got like 3X health of a deathclaw, almost impossible to kill. 

If its not like you have maxed out dwellers X6 in every room, you can never kill this mf in time, so this shit always takes away half your electricity. AND no fucking reward whatsoever for killing it. 

Now its just frustrating and boring to deal with these shits and the worst part is you cant do any other things while this shit is in your vault. No goal whatsoever, No fun, No reward, just frustrates the shit out of you. 

Balance change pls. Too op RADSCORPIONS"
16912,"Decent game for casual gamers, simple and fun mechanics."
16913,good game
16914,"cute, free, casual clicker"
16915,"Review for Update 1.12

PROS

- Clean design, although the characters do get very repetitive as well as the environment
- Easy game, if you frequently play the game, you will realize how easy it is, you just need to grind for money.
- The ability to do quests and receive loot (weapons, clothes, junk, pets, etc). Pets give boosts. Weapons improve damage, and clothes improve the abilities of the survivors (Strength, Perception, Charisma, Intelligence, Endurance, Agility and Luck).



CONS

- Saving does not work properly, when you log off, your base may suffer a rollback, or it could save in inapropriate times like fighting an impossible wave of mole rats that will kill all your survivors. Leaving you to grind money for a long time to be able to bring them back and probably lose all of them again on another attack.
- Monsters will keep spawning inside your base (in huge amounts per room) after you get a certain amount of survivors, something that turns to be almost impossible to defend while having survivors outside doing quests or having them pregnant.
- After a while the game starts getting boring because its always the same thing, get energy to power the other rooms, get food and water to keep your survivors happy, put the designated survivors in their rooms, and grind for resources, get money and upgrade rooms, do quests that are pretty much all the same.



"
16916,Gr8 game 10/10 would recommend
16917,"Good game, pretty fun if you enjoy these types of games."
16918,"Keeps me out of boredom
"
16919,good game
16920,Human Resource Management = Safe for work
16921,This is a very fun game im glad you can make different vaults!
16922,"Fallout Shelter is a simulation game in which the player runs a Vault-Tec vault as the overseer. As the overseer, one controls all of the vault's functions including: power, food, water and the number of vault dwellers. To advance through the simulation one needs to increase the size of the vault by adding and upgrading new rooms; each with their own function and then adding dwellers to run each room."
16923,"its cool i like it
"
16924,"this isn't helpful, but i am kinda addicted already!"
16925,Deathclaws don't know how to stay away. :<
16926,"The only non extremely tedious way to get my last achievement (Like months or years) the one you have to get the 20 legendery dwellers achievement is trough paying money buying. And I know what Im talking about, cause long ago I got the other 34/35 achiements. Steam should really look up for this matter, cause achievements should be for everyone, thats my thinking on the subject. 3 Radio¬¥s with maxed out charisma, luck and everything dwellers do nothing. Quests gives you like just 2 legendary dwellers, and making babies with maxed out coulples with twins chance pets does not work. It is wasted time, so I warn you to not loose that quantity of time like me.

When you have a problem, like Deathclaws, Roaches, etc. The dwellers seems to run elaborate ways and crossing each other, stopping you to unrad/heal them at time. Sometimes they change positions for no reason, like shooting 1on1 enemy.

Mr Handy does not collect any S.P.E.C.I.A.L. leveling ups. Clicking each leveled up one by one gets so boring.

Dont ever do the Coach¬¥s quest. It is the most tedious, long, elaborate and boring quest of all my gaming expierence from like, at this time, my entire life.

Bottle and Chappy should never be resqued. They are the worst made in hell nightmare ever.

More than 100 hours of play at the time of this review. Not to mention prior times I had this game on android. In a matter of days this game is not entertaining at all, just tedious and routine everyday repetitive rituals.

4/10 -Mediocre. Get New Vegas."
16927,I had more fun playing this than I did playing Fallout 4 with an insane amount of mods. It will steal your soul for some time...then you'll forget about it.
16928,"Great time killer, but still need more improvement. Its just look like exactly the mobile version of this game, no different at all. 7/10"
16929,"If you love management game, this game has it style. You will love and fun with it ;)"
16930,It has been an entertaining game.
16931,:)
16932,Like this better on PC than on mobile... or maybe i just have fat fingers.
16933,Fun little time killer
16934,"This game is adorable. It also stands alone even if you know very little of the Fallout franchise. It's sexist, but it is set in the 50's style apocalypse, so that gets a pass. The conversations between your residents are hilarious. For those alone I would play. Add in quests to complete, and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. abilities to train, and items to collect and I'm hooked. I will say that the lunchboxes, though a great prize in the beginning (and yes, buy the one that is ""one per vault"" to start you out), are pretty pointless later on. So I don't recommend dumping money into any but that first one, you don't need it to make it, so there isn't a need to keep dropping real world money into the game after you toss the developers their $5 for your starting pack."
16935,"Though the mobile version may be better for some due to being able to play on the go, the PC version is better in my opinion. I'm not able to bring my PC wherever I go, so I'm forced to not focus on the game at times. This makes things seem to go faster compared to staring at my vault waiting for my outfit to be finished in 13 hours. Both versions are fun, nonetheless."
16936,Very gud
16937,A bit glichy but GGGOOOOOOODDD!!!!!!!!!!!
16938,"ok to pass the time, but it is a waste of time. buggy and no sense of achievement."
16939,"Jogo divertido para passar o tempo.

16945,"It's a lot better than when it was first released on mobile, now that Quests have been added.

Also, you don't need to spend money to 'complete' the game ... unless you want to collect all the Legendary Dwellers, in which case you'll probably need to spend ¬£10k on lunchboxes and 100 hours opening them - i.e don't do that."
16946,it was graet until i wasnt able to bulde a wepens shop

16952,Nice and easy way to kill your time. Lots of it.

16954,Fun game!
16955,"this game is cool and its free 



(btw i want the steam sticker pack)"
16956,Best Building Simulator Game Ever !
16957,"Nice little game for people that work hard and just want to get their head of things for half an hour. Be aware though, one particular achievement is pretty much impossible to get unless you sink loads of cash into this game."

16961,"Funny, addictive, worth a try."
16962,It's cool I guess.
16963,it'll be perfect if i can sync this with my android vault
16964,better than F3
16965,Good game :)
16966,It's a great way to waste time.  Though it's not exactly deep compelling gameplay.  But worthy of a few minutes at the Doctors office.
16967,"Nice game for a casual run.

I have not played this game for a year and it's on PC now. There are many features that change how fallout shelter is played but it is still nice to this day. The good thing about it is no PvP which makes this game unique as it gives the player to run the game at their own pace without competition.

Definately recommend this game for anyone who wants to go slow with this game"
16968,Good for wasting some extra time.
16969,Good stuff
16970,"Even though this game is free, I cannot recommend it.  The critical bugs and poor mechanics can't make up for it being free or even that you can have some fun playing it.  I do play it a lot, but it has become monotonous and at times extremely frustrating.  TL:DR at end.

The most problematic bug that goes unaddressed is the one that will corrupt your save files leaving you to start anew.  While the game says it uses the cloud, your saves are local and if they are corrupt there's nothing that really can be done.  There are no saves on the cloud to rescue you.  You have to manually back up your saves frequently.  The bug occurs if you're playing the game and your computer shuts down, either by power loss, blue screen of death, frozen and you have to reboot to do anything, if you can't exit the game normally your saves will be forever lost.  What makes this most insidious is that if you paid money for the lunchboxes or colas then they, too, are gone forever.  Bethedsa will not give you back the items you received from them.  It becomes lost money.  Steam will not reimburse you either.  So spending money on the game is a gamble.  You must make those manual backups daily to protect yourself.

Another bug is actually with buying these items.  While I have never spent money on the game, so many others have and when they buy items it becomes stuck in their inventory without the ability to get the in game.  Steam will tell you to go to Bethesda and they will tell you to go to Steam.  You have to go back and forth in order for Steam to reimburse you and you only get that with proof of going to Bethesda, having the items in your inventory, and showing how they can't be brought into game.  It's a real hassle and so far I've only seen a few actually get their money back.

The last frustrating bug I'll discuss is when you send a group on a quest, there's a chance for you to become stuck into a cycle of click on the group to enter the quest and then getting sent back to your vault instead of the quest location.  You have to select the group again, try to enter the quest again, and hope it will send you to the quest location.  On average I must repeat this cycle about 5 times before getting into the quest and it happens every other day.  There are times I've been stuck in the loop 10 times before I give up and exit the game, restart, and then try again.  I have better luck with it working then.  

The mechanics that I dislike are how you loot, how the focus and zoom automatically changes on you during events, inability to see who's wearing what eq in a list form, poor ability to search for people, radscorpions leaving the room they are fighting in to go to another in your vault.  

On quests you can loot containers and bodies, but frequently your dwellers are in the way and it can become a pain to do this as when you try to click on them you get a dweller not the lootable item.  I've learned to loot containers after I've left the room to make it easier, but you can't loot bodies unless you are in the same room.  It becomes a game of moving people out of the room and back in to try to get them to reposition so you can click on the feet of the bodies, because that works best.  Sometimes the bodies fly into other rooms, or the wall because there is no room and you can't see them.  So you just have to click on the blackness to make sure there was nothing there.

Whenever there is an event the focus will immediately go to that event and zoom in.  This is highly frustrating.  When you have 170 dwellers, 100 rooms, an you're trying to train people, move them around, level them up, change their eq, it's the biggest pain your patootie to have the focus move from the room you were in to the vault door because of ghouls that will be stopped by your guards in seconds.

While you can find your dwellers on a list, it's hard to get them to focus.  Sometimes a double click on their name works, sometimes right clicking, other times, nothing will work.  There's probably some bug with that too.  But when you get to having over 100 people it's really hard to manage them when you can't find where they are wandering around.  And those events that pull focus make it harder.  

When your dweller has a baby it will move the focus to the top of the vault even though you were at the bottom.  So if you happen to have a population boom at the bottom of your vault you're going to be annoyed with how many times you have to move back down to the bottom of your vault to click on the next pregnant woman.  Issues like that keep coming up.  The game decided you should be zoomed in and over here even though you don't want to be.

On your dweller lists, it does not allow for outfits or weapons.  So you can't see who doesn't have them and who does.  You can see by looking if they are wearing something, but not if they have a weapon.  So you have to click on each and every dweller to make sure they have a weapon.  This is annoying and added to that the focus change stuff it makes you want to pull your hair out.

Then we have the radscorpions.  I don't mind them, but one behavior is downright buggy maybe.  If you have an attack at your vault door you have x amount of time to kill them before they move to the next room.  This continues until they're dead.  No problems with that.  If something pops up in the middle of your vault, dwellers in that room will fight it until it's dead or they die.  If there is no one in the room and no one comes to fight it they will spread to other areas of the vault until all killed.  Still not a problem.  Radscorpions drain energy like crazy.  If they appear in a room without dwellers, you will have a problem.  Even if you send dwellers in from next door and have a robot fighting it from the very beginning the radscorpion (if not almost instantly killed which is very hard) will leave the fight and appear in another room.  Even if that room has dwellers and fighting starts right away, it will keep leaving the room and appearing elsewhere until it pops up into a room with 6 people it in that can kill it rapidly.  By the time this is done you have little energy.  I don't think the mobs that popup like that should be able to relocate while you are actively engaged in fighting them.  It seems to be a bug since it doesn't happen with other creatures that pop up in your vault through the ground.

And finally, after a while, the game becomes boring as it's just the same thing over and over again.  I have fun in the beginning setting up my vault and trying to train everyone, but the quests are the same.  You don't do anything but click on the rooms to send your dwellers and then click on the loot.  Sometimes there's a question you have to answer, but they're all the same.  I now dread the daily maintenance of questing because it's long and boring. 

The good is that it's free.  The base building is limited, but designing what goes where is important and there is strategy to that.  There is no pause for a bathroom break, so just exit to the main menu to prevent an event that might kill your dwellers if you're not there to click on their healing.  There's leveling up and level stats on characters, outfits with different stat mods, weapons, and you can craft your weapons and outfits from blueprints you find on quests.  So, there's some fun to be had and I've played it for a while now.

TL:DR  Don't pay money on this game.  You MUST manually back up saves daily or risk corrupted games and lost purchased items forever.  Bugs and mechanics make it frustrating and tedious.  But some fun to be had for a little while if you are not invested in the game.

16978,like it
16979,"A nice idling (timer-waiting) game for a mobile pad probably, especially if you never turn it off, but I won't play it on PC - very shallow game with large periods of utter boredom after short bursts of extremely hasty real-time action that you can't really control, because the screen shifts on its own, making you pixelhunt your brainless dwellers in motion like f*king bugs in the groinal hair. I just hate this interface, when you lose stuff for you coudn't have touched a stupid unit in time, after a 100 clicks made around him, striking everything besides what you wished for. I just don't feel like those morons really need me, or need to survive at all."
16980,awesome game
16981,How did this mobile game get to pc?
16982,:)
16983,good for wasteing time
16984,"Let me start by saying the game is fun. Very fun. It is probably the best freemium game I have ever played, and you can reach the endgame easily and reasonably quickly without paying anything.

The reason I can't recommend the game is the prevalence of game-breaking bugs. The first one is objectives randomly resetting. A big part of the game is completing objectives for rewards. Some can be done in a few seconds, other may take hours or even several days. The problem is that they will randomly reset all the time, for no reason whatsoever. Extremely frustrating, although not relevant at all compared to the second bug, which is...

Random savegame deletion. Your vault will usually be deleted if the game or your PC crashes, but also just randomly for no apparent reason. After spending ~60 hours on my last vault, I'm finally done with this game. Stay far, far away from it unless you want to be extremely disappointed."
16985,"I can't wait till they release Fallout 4 on mobile. 


"
16986,"So have to say this game is constantly challenging. The basic routines of the game are easy enough to manage, and tweaking them to adjust for different strategies can make things really interesting. Great pace, cool quest gameplay, and addictive."
16987,This is a review to get stickers! not helpful!
16988,"when you play this game its hard to tell when is enough. I have it on my  phone and my daily timeline revolves with this. I did it for 2 weeks then i didn't play it for one day. Then I realized everything was bullshit. Since then, zero fucks. That doesn't make it a bad game tho."
16989,"It's free, it's Fallout-themed, and it's a builder, which are popular nowadays (???). Anyway, did I mention it's free and you literally have nothing to lose for trying it?"
16990,free and good
16991,"Very fun game, would give a 7-8/10 just due to the game being a little slow at times. Played it a TON on Mobile."
16992,Great game. Fun and addicting but very repetitive
16993,"general i am a fan, but some archievement should be nerfed such as legendary dwellers, because legendary baby doesn't count."
16994,This game is already in your phone but you still install it on pc simulator
16995,"Just for past time.., like when your bored playing but its fun... ?"
16996,pretty cool
16997,"I've always really loved waiting games.
Try it if you liked Fallout 3/4"

17009,"Fallout Shelter is a Free to play Construction/Management simulation game styled in the Fallout Series world. The game tasks the player with building and managing their own Vault (fallout shelter) and dealing with collecting resources as well as invading enemies.

You take the role of Overseer, the leader and coordinator of the Vault,  your job is to make the inhabitants happy through meeting their needs (power, food, water as well as tasking them to work in the correct areas). Dwellers (inhabitants) produce resources for their respective jobs at a different rate dependent on their ""SPECIAL"" (Strength Perception Endurance Charisma Intelligence Agility Luck). Most of the game revolves around this concept of balancing resources.

Pros:
+ Fun Gameplay until you hit a certain point
+ Free to play
+ Visual style is enticing and fun to look at
+ Items and NPC's from the Fallout Series are in the game

Cons:
- Lack of depth, ends up being very repetitive
- Unneccessary amount of microtransactions
- Lack of end game content

TL;DR:
6/10
Construction/Management simulator based in the Fallout Series's world, gameplay gets repetitive and lacks any end game content or a goal. Fun for a while but loses interest fairly quickly.

PS: On a side note, the game's files are stored client side, meaning you can edit your saves and adjust the times on your computer to affect your Vault."
17010,"A game that you can easily spend tons of hours on and get hooked, if you love managing games. Would highly suggest this game to Fallout fans"
17011,"Even though I have not spent much time playing the game (on a business trip for work), I could tell right away it's going to be a fun game to play.  A little difficult to learn at first, but well worth the initial time spent.  For a free game it's highly recommended.  Just be patient with it."
17012,fine to pass some time
17013,Very nice fun game
17014,Fun and addicting
17015,Great Game!
17016,this game fun

17020,nothing but timesink. one of the better ones.
17021,"Is the vault exactly on top of a f-ing deathclaw breeding ground? Every time I open the door here come some deathclaws, annoying and stupid. Make a quest to get rid of the deathclaw queen and stop this annoyance. Otherewise it's an absolute blast to play for free."
17022,This is a good game to past time !!!
17023,i have played over 100 hours and have over 170 people in my vault. thus far i have found no glitches and still have so much to do. i highly recommend this game

17038,Pretty good.
17039,Im still not even sure if I have fun playing this game but I do find myself playing it for hours on end so.... 10/10
17040,I made a nice vault that I could make into a great vault had I had the patience to train dwellers. So instead I sent everyone into the wasteland to bring glory to the motherland.
17041,As overseer of Vault 283 this game is apprved for my dwellers in Vault 283
17042,nice a bit short thoe
17043,"Have been playing the game quite a bit, i haven't had any save file gone corrupted so far, had to mention that since this seems as a issue people have been having.

It's a simple yet fun entertaining game that you can play for small pockets of time each day. The additon of quests adds a lot to the game since it gives you something to play for. Even though quests at their core are really similar they still present a thin narative to each quest.

Technical whise there are bugs here and there and i don't mean the rad roaches and over grown scorpions. The mouse interaction could've been done a bit more smooth and the UI could be more user friendly especially when handling events / desaster in the vault. Some quests fail to load sometimes and it thakes a few attempts for the to boot up at times. There are also some positive glitches that might help make the game easyer for people.

Regarding Microtransactions i feel they really trivialise the game, so if you want to give the game some longevity i'd advise in avoiding them, for your own wallet's sake and your experince in the vault. You can earn Lunchboxes and pets through out the wastes or through quests and they add to your sence of achievement, the rewards feeling a lot more earned then if you just throw 50 bucks at the game.

Overall i do recommend the game whether you play on steam or your mobile. 10 Minutes ever cople of hours is in my opinion the best way to experience it"
17044,"This game is awesome, good graphics, awesome interactions, and a little bit of humor. I recommend this game, its worth getting"
17045,fun game
17046,"If you played Fallout Shelter on Android or iOS then you should already know what to expect.

You play as the Overseer controlling a vault, the more time you spend, the more resources you need to keep everything running. It's a fine concept, for a mobile game where you pick it up from time to time.

The mouse support does help a lot, especially on situations where your vault is under attack or doing side quests, but don't expect more content if you already spent hours in the mobile version.

The only thing I think is missing is some sort of sync with the mobile game, would be nice to continue where I was.

If you like Fallout and never tried the mobile game, then go ahead, there is some fun stuff to do."
17047,"This is a fun low-maintenance game that does a good job of using the Fallout world, giving you missions to collect loot and makes good use of the SPECIAL stats system.

Main criticism is the UI which is ported from touch screen and it can cause some annoyance when trying to select a particular character as you can easily miss. Also, it's too easy to inadvertently pick someone hidden behind a wall when you move the screen around. 

I haven't spent a penny of real money on this and I'm up to something like 140 dwellers. Each time I log in I usually have a new dweller waiting to join my vault. In fact, I have so many of the little guys in there it's getting hard to juggle them around properly.

Some tips: Training dwellers by assigning them to training rooms where a particular stat is improved is essential to getting the vault working efficiently. After they have improved a stat assign them to the corresponding work room so they can level up. Having high level characters and arming them all is the best way to give your characters a good chance of surviving vault attacks and having success on missions. The only reason to spend money is if you're REALLY impatient, but it would be poor value so I don't recommend doing that."
17048,"
[PROS]
+ The concept is based on the Fallout series
+ Nice interface and design
+ Quests
+ Tons of weapons, outfits and items
+ Fallout ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L"" dweller stats
+ Funny interactions between vault dwellers
+ F2P and it's balanced

[CONS]
- needs time and constant attention
- limited space and dweller number
- illogical incidents"

17063,"Ever wanted to manage your own Fallout's Vault ? Here is your chance with this free to play Bethesda game. It's a simple base building single-player game, yet well made, entertaining and can even be addictive at the beginning.

The objective of the game is to cleverly build your Vault and manage the produced resources : energy, food, water, stimpaks and radaway. You can attract people or make your Dwellers have babies ; then, assign them to the right rooms according to their abilities (for example the power room needs workers with strength) or make them train their SPECIAL. Send other Dwellers to explore the Wasteland or on quests to gain experience and find loot. Don't forget to equip armors, weapons and pets : the Wasteland is a dangerous place and your Vault is not safe from Raiders or Deathclaws attacks. Improve your Vault and you'll be able to craft armors, weapons, themes and to build new types of rooms, for example the barbershop that allows you to customize your Dweller's appearance.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=938929825

Most of the negative reviewers mentioned a problem with the save files : they kept randomly losing their Vaults and had to start over. In 79 hours, it never happened to me, so in case you wondered, they surely corrected it.

As a free to play game I can but recommend Fallout Shelter."

17081,Very relaxed game.
17082,"I find Fallout Shelter to be an amazing game.

Just don't use your money to buy anything, like.. Ever. I spent $30 on my game and had weapons for everyone, everything was perfect. Then out of nowhere, invincible molerats overran my shelter. I paused and Googled if paid-for objects and such carried out between saves but sadly, they did not.
I wasted $30 on this game just so I could be easily overran. It was basically like me spending $29.99 for the game but once you lost, you lost the game too.

This is the only reason I do not recommend this game. I strongly disapprove that they be locked to specific saves. Especially considering the fact I spent my hard-earned real money.

""Oh, you lost? Thanks for playing. Please insert another $29.99.""

It's like a sick, overly-expensive arcade machine that instead of quarters, costs $29.99. And you don't get 3 lives. Nope. Just one. Lose it and you have to pay an arm and a leg just to start over.

This happened a couple months or so ago, but just now decided to rate it.

[h1]Final Conclusion[/h1]
If you play this, [i]DO [u]NOT[/u] SPEND ANY OF YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!![/i]

Otherwise a great game."
17083,"This is alright for a timewaster but then i sold loads of my stickers to get a few extra lunchbox's, got some good stuff. then the next time i logged in my save had reverted back a few hours. No big deal but the lunxhbox's and money from my steam wallet are gone. Uninstalling this and switching to a cracked version."
17084,Not as good as the mobile version...
17085,Awesome Game
17086,I really ejoy this game but there are some glithes for example when i completed my quest i didnt getthe rewards it guranteed

17090,"Exelente jogo, porem est√° em ingles, n√¢o √© ruim pra quem conhece e sabe entender a ingl√™s,porem
ainda precisa ser traduzido assim como varios outros jogos da Bethesda, o que ela tem contra nosso portugu√™s,  eu nao entendo os brasileiros sao consumidores em n√∫mero muito proporcional hoje em dia,acho justo que empresas grandes como a bethesda fa√ßam uma tradu√ß√£o nao s√≥ deste jogo,  mas para como outros que merecem uma boa tradu√ß√£o assim como fallout 4 teve e ficou exelente.

Excellent game, but it's in English, not bad for those who know and understand English, but
Still has to be translated like several other Bethesda games, which it has against our Portuguese, I do not understand the Brazilians are very proportionate consumers nowadays, I think fair that big companies like bethesda make a translation not only of this game , But for like others they deserve a good translation as soon as fallout 4 had it and it was excellent."
17091,Good
17092,"[h1][i]Fallout Shelter[/i] is a simplistic [i]Fallout[/i] experience that only [i]Bethesda[/i] could deliver.[/h1]

 [i]Shelter[/i] at its core is a free-to-play mobile game, successfully transitioned to the bigger screen. Being a free title, in-game purchases are included, but as always they are not mandatory and do not seem to haul the natural gameplay progression that much.

 This new installment, however, is pretty shallow and bares almost no resemblance to any of the other games in the franchise. 

 [i]Fallout Shelter[/i] is a mediocre resource management game with the [i]Fallout[/i] image slapped over it and in that turn it lacks anything expected from the series: no personal character, no player choice whatsoever, no story, minor customization(outfits, weapons).

 [i]Shelter[/i] is a decent mobile game, an average PC game and a terrible [i]Fallout[/i] game, but that's what you get with [i]Bethesda[/i]!

17093,"way better than the mobile version. 
love how I log in on my pc and everyone is still fine.. not like the mobile version where everyone is rad poisoned"
17094,A nice little time waster. The addition of the quests has freshened things up. Its rewarding to unlock the rare characters and weapons. Just wish that the vault raids were not exactly the same every time. I think its about. Time for an update.
17095,Attractive and Good gameplay
17096,cool and good
17097,Great game. Thats it.:D
17098,"On the short term, it's a fun game - as long as you manage your time correctly.
Sadly, it's not possible to 100% the achievements without splurging money into the game. Nearly 200 hours in, having done every single thing to do in this game, having opened over 100 lunchboxes, I only got 2 legendary dwellers out of them.  I still need 15 more for the last achievements, at a 2% rate, that's 750 more lunchboxes..you do the math."
17099,"It is the best ""mobile game"" i played in a long time. It¬¥s way more balanced than for example Clash of Clans. You can actually play the Game without week long waiting time with everything without paying a cent. I really appreciate this. 
And if you can`t already guess it by my playtime, it`s a really addicting game. The best way to play this game is when you have a second monitor and just watch a video and check every 10 seconds whats happening. If you buy or earn (with quests) yourself a Mr. Handy you don¬¥t even have to bother checking your Vault except for attacks.

17102,"Do not play this game! I game is rly fun and good but there is just a matter of time before you lose your save file! I played this game on Android for a long time , dont know how many hours cause it dont keep track of it and then my valut just got deleted out of nowhere. Some time after that i wanted to give it one more try on PC and same thing happen again. 
Do not play this game or spent a single penny on it unless you want to lose your money and time!

Fu devs for not fixing this, its ben like this for a long time and you dont give a shit !"
17103,Good Game ~
17104,Addictive as shit and free. End game kind of lags a bit though. Good to pass the time but Really makes more sense as a Tablet app due to long complete times.
17105,Funny and simple. Sims by Bethesda.
17106,"Fallout Shelter is a simple and addicting Vault management game. Obtain more vault dwellers, gear them up, send them on quests, keep them happy with ample food and electricity and repeat the process until you have a flourishing vault. There are plenty of themes, weapons, armor, crafting recipes and quests to unlock. 
It may be free to play though be warned, the game is filled with micro-transactions. All the items that can be purchased include:
-""Lunchboxes""- contain resources, caps, weapons, armor, dwellers and pets, all ranging in quality.
-""Nuka-cola Quantum""- used to pass time, when you may otherwise be required to wait numerous hours.
-""Pet Carriers""- contain a variety of pets with different benefits and quality.
-""Mr.Handy's""- used to auto-gather resources instead of having to click on them, or send them outside the vault to search for bottle-caps.

7.5/10- The game is a great time sink, though the amount of time required for waiting around for time to pass (without purchasing bunches of Nuka-Cola Quantum to make everything instant) becomes a bit of a bore later on in the game. Expect to spend at least some money on the game, just don't go nuts gambling on too many lunchboxes."
17107,it`s a really fun game to play
17108,"Fallout Shelter is an Enjoyable and Addictive Game.  It reminds me of Sim Tower from back in the day, which is a good thing.  It looks to be a great addition to the Fallout universe of games.

I can see getting a lot of mileage out of this game.  As of writing this I have played 10 hours, and have unlocked 8 of 35 achievements and can see a clear path of how to unlock the remaining achievements. 

The Lunchboxes (the loot crates of the game) are handy, but are not required to enjoy the game.

I would recommend all fans of the Fallout Series and those just dipping their toes into the Fallout universe (like myself) to check out Fallout Shelter.

[Update]: There was one drawback of the game. Near the tail of end of reaching all the achievements it became clear that one achievement, ""Blast From The Past"" where you are tasked with Collecting the 20 Legendary Dwellers was impossible unless you purchase lunchboxes (loot crates).  This was a real drag and did drag down my level of excitement for the game."
17109,"At first I saw it had ""match random character to stat room"" gameplay and gave up on it, but it has way more than that.  Missions that go on rotation so they're not samey, actual things to do instead of having to wait for everything, risk/reward based gameplay, and of course it's all in a Fallout game with plenty of humor to boot.  I'd suggest giving it a go if you need something to do while watching twitch or listening to podcasts and so on."
17110,"Great casual game! (And its free!) I originally played the mobile version whilst waiting for fallout 4 to be released, but once your vault got too big it would crash constantly - great to see that this doesnt happen on PC!!"
17111,"I really have a lot of fun with this game.  Saying it's casual is an understatement.  It's about getting your little guys equipped and sending them out on missions.  They collect stuff, you tell them what to build, and it's a fun little tower style game.  I liked this game on my android, but I love it on the PC."
17112,"Started to play yesterday, lost my save after the crash, i guess everyone is loosing their saves...a shame, the game is good."
17113,"It is like a mobile game that is on Steam but yet it is still enjoyable
"
17114,"This is likely the most boring game I've ever played. ""Pay to make things happen faster"" business model."
17115,"Although I would love a 3D, first person version of it, this game is amazing."
17116,its recomended to play with ur phone instead with ur PC
17117,"Fallout Shelter is a casual mobile game, ported to the PC and Steam. It's fast and easy to get into and it's got just enough content to keep you entertained between real games or real tasks. If you want to get every Steam achievment, it does get stale very quickly, however. In the end, though, you spend a couple of minutes to learn the ropes, you get a couple of hours of contented enjoyment.

It's flashy, popcorn entertainment. It's also free, so there's that. If you like mobile games, you'll like it. If you like Fallout stuff, you'll probably be entertained for a while. It's worth trying out, at the very least."
17118,"I knew this was just a conversion from the mobile application, therefore, my expectations for this game should have been low. It is impossible, however, not to feel some excitement when engaging with new material from the Fallout universe - and excitement walks hand-in-hand with high expectations. Fortunately, Fallout Shelter has, to a great extent, met those expectations. 

Why? This game is so simple to play, which makes it perilously addictive. Everything can be controlled with just the mouse. For instance, to assign vault dwellers to specific roles, you just drag and drop them to SPECIALised rooms. That‚Äôs right, the pun was intended. Your vault dwellers have the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, just like Fallout, and some of the rooms have a preferred S.P.E.C.I.A.L.s. The Science Lab required high Intelligence, for example. While it isn‚Äôt compulsory to adhere to the assigned S.P.E.C.I.A.L., doing-so will make you vault dweller very happy; and happiness, as you will find, is very important. 

The rooms of your vault, weapons and armour will be limited in the beginning, but your options quickly grow with the growth of your vault‚Äôs population, which can be increased in two ways: you can build a Radio Studio to attract dwellers from the Wasteland, or, in a more novel way, assign a male and female dweller to a Living Quarters, then sit-back, and let the amorous spectacle commence. Fortunately, for those sick-minded individuals out there, the game won‚Äôt let you force incest, or exile a pregnant dweller. 

As for the graphics, they are, of course, basic, but not repulsive or retro-feeling. In fact, the endearing Vault Boy cartoon-style pervades the game and makes each dweller quite endearing. The power armour suits, though, look a little compressed, and a little too comical.  

The replay value of the game is somewhat limited, which, of course, is because Fallout Shelter was intended to be the launch-pad for Fallout 4. This is evident in the missions, which, after incorporating some witty dialogue in keeping with the Fallout universe, fail to vary and challenge the player: the management in combat is limited, the same half-a-dozen locations become dreary, and the enemies equally so. In short, the missions can become something to run in the background, in order to gain revenue, whilst being more attentive to another task in your Internet browser. 

Overall, this game is definitely worth playing, but only if you looking for a bit of light-hearted fun. The serious gaming, and long-term gaming, remains with Fallout 4, or for more avid Fallout fans, like myself, Fallout: New Vegas.

17119,its a really fun and addictive game once you get the overseers office i love makeing a team of guys in the same armor and one really powerful and sending them off ive crashed so many times and i havent lost my save i really like it its a fun little game to play i have put quite a lot of time into this its very cool sinse i havent got the proper fallout game its the closest i have to it so yea 9/10 only reason i gave it a 9 out of 10 is because you have to buy the lunch boxes and there really rare but apart from that ITS REALLY GOOD I SUGGEST GETTING IT BECAUSE ITS FREE AND FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17120,i enjoy
17121,cool for 90 mins but it gets boring
17122,"Fun for few min, after game is only for pay money to continue. very slow time to play"
17123,"nice ,gud game 
"
17124,at first I've been opening/playing this regularly (since this being a free to play and is a fallout game caught my eye) but then from time to time it becomes a bit boring like any other mobile game.
17125,"No long term value, and not much short term value either. There's more than a decade worth of free flash games out there that have more value and more polish."
17126,"Excellent and addictive game and great time killer! !

Might not be as easy at the start but it gets easier as you progress. Take it easy, plan ahead, be prepared! Have fun killing your time!"
17127,Definitely a great game to start up your Steam Library if you don't have a lot of cash.
17128,"Its ok, Fun as hell when you first start but then kinda drags and drags. 
When you get 100 peeps in your hole so you can get that ever so awesome nuka cola bottler and your like hell yea then realize it only gives you food and water and no nuka cola is very dissapointing.
Fun to play just dont spend real $$$ in it you will be dissapointed.
"
17129,Fun game. A little boring at times. It is a casual playing game. I enjoy the game personally. I don't always want a fast paced game. Sometimes it is just as much fun to enjoy a slower paced game.
17130,"Excellent time consuming  game. Tip : for the stranger, do not search it everywhere, but pay attention from where come the sound."
17131,is a good game
17132,Quite a few things I'd like to see (like a guaranteed way to not lose a save on the Steam version so I can happily buy some pets because they're nice) but it is a fun diversion. Would like more quests. I do like the quests. God.
17133,"this is fantastic game
"
17134,Vault simulator
17135,Easy to cheat time consuming events or waiting. All you have to do is change the time on your computer.
17136,Good Game...
17137,"As little computer people go its not really bad. Considering its a port from a smallphone game i suppose its acceptable. But i dont have a ""mu"" neither yes or no button. The legendary dweller achievement is gonna take ages. At that price, its like FF moebius, if you're into completed games numbers you'll eventually get it and its free if you can muster the strength not to pay to play lol. Test your might, FIGHT .... oh no , that was another game"
17138,GOOD
17139,"Fun, addictive and very basic.
It is a time sink, but I have not noticed any pressure within the game play to get you to spend real money.
I only have 17 hours in, but it has been an enjoyable 17 hours.

Don't expect anything too elaborate and I wouldn't invest real money into this.
I give it a 6/10 as a game, and a 9/10 based upon the format.  I play on PC, but I am sure this is also a smartphone game."
17140,nice room building game for gamers who knows how to do business
17141,This is good game the interface is horrible the ingame real money shop makes me want to puke all over my keyboard but as i will never give Bethesda another penny as long as i live it doesnt affect me.Its hard and addictive sadly the game seems to play itself very suicidally when you are off line or asleep so get ready for tears if you do use your money :O)
17142,Nice time Skipper game...
17143,made 1 man named daddy make about 13 babys..good game
17144,"Fallout Shelter is an excellent game in whic hyou are the overseer of a vault.  Proceed with caution though... It is HIGHLY addictive.

17149,I Love this game Great fun can play for hours would totally recommend
17150,Fun little management game to play during 15 minute breaks. Don't expect to play this game for hours on end.
17151,"Simple and fun, i love it"
17152,"Simple and good game for checking in once in a while.
Effective micro management mechanics.
I like the fallout series so this game just keeps me stay connected to that world. 
Would recommend playing on mobile though as you would rarely play this on your main rig.

Pros: simple and fun
         Good background or mobile device game.
         Cute animations
         Deathclaws
         Fallout characters (legendary)

Cons: Gets less engrossing"
17153,"Heyyy, I have to tell you about Fallout Shelter. You'll love it just as I do I swear. Fallout Shelter is about building a vault and you are the Overseer and you have to make sure everything goes right. That's not all, you also have to defend your bunker from all threats. Yes, that includes Deathclaws too. But don't worry about that now. It's up to you that your vault succeeds. My suggestion to you is that you can design your vault however you want, but if you want to avoid a cluster of problems and complications with your vault I would say build smart and strategically. Start from the top and work your way down. So far that has helped me get nearly to the bottom on my experience. So, now that you have read this review, what do you say? Are you ready for your own vault? If so, go install and play right now to your hearts content."

17162,"Mechanics/Hotkeys/Economy:
Kind of slow - there's always something that throws you back and you can't really make money.

There are 2 reasons to downvote this game:
* You're only making progress if you often risk a lot of accidents (fires, infestations)
* If you want your colony to grow fast, women have to run around looking like 8 mont pregnant and work like normal almost all of the time.

17164,"A superbly addicting freebie and a hell of a gateway game for those looking to either dip a toe into the Fallout universe. I acquired Fallout 4 shortly after picking up Shelter and I haven't looked back. Engaging enough that I don't mind the steep learning curve and occasional hair-pulling moments when incidents pile up on each other. Highly recommend!

Only issue I had was the gendered outfits. I was pretty disappointed at restrictions not seen anywhere else in the franchise - if devs were looking to patch something, that'd be my only suggestion. Let me put Spock-ears on my ladies, please."
17165,"Fallout Shelter, Fallout Shelter never changes. It's the exact same as it was on your phone, but now it's on a bigger screen."
17166,3/10
17167,Nice little game to spend sometime between stuff.
17168,"This game is a dream come true for an obsessively organized individual like me. I keep things orderly and neat, and take care of my Dwellers, no matter how stupid they are sometimes. This game is an excellent and fun way to spend some downtime!"
17169,"Absolutely boring game.
You have to wait 3h for every new baby.
You have to wait several days for your dwellers return from wasteland.
It's time in your REAL life, you can't increase game speed. 
I reached 12 dwellers and nothing new happens for an hour except rare cockroaches attacks.

It's tamagochi style. This game maybe good for mobile, but definitely not for PC."

17172,"Pros
-great art style
-tons of variety to keep things interesting (you can choose to focus on building a bigger vault, doing more missions, maxing out stats, gaining more dwellers, etc. The choice is yours!)
-some humour, good mix of quests/battles and tycoon-style resource management
-can complete quests and get the items in the game without paying. This isn't a P2P game, which is very refreshing to see
-easily obtain the special items/currency without paying real money for them
-great support and new content + bug patches regularly

Cons
Really only not suited for those who want something super battle-heavy or don't like resource managemment/crafting/base building games ."
17173,entertaining time burner
17174,why tf do I have more than 7hrs in this game on steam?
17175,"My rating: 7/10

I am not a big fan of the Fallout series. Although, the Fallout Shelter simple graphics caught my eye and i really love it.
The game itself is fun at the start, when you expand your shelter and population. The game works on the principle that everything takes few hours, so it is more similar to the browser game, which i don't like. After a while it starts to be boring to open the game for just few minutes every day.

This game would be amazing, if it was like single player with some short story behind, let say for few hours. Unfortunately, there is no story except few ""quests"" which have maybe 2 sentences of a ""story"".

I still recommend the game, because it is nice and fun for a short time. Just don't expect any depth as i did."

17179,This is a great casual game. You can play for hours or just a few minutes. It's all up to you. The game really gets fun when you are able to do quests.

Real waste of time."
17189,"Good: Really like the aspects of the game from sending people out into the wasteland to find items and trying to grow your shelter.

Bad: The game was buggy at times. I personaly couldn't figure out how to balance out my water, food and energy.

Why should you get this game?: It is just fun for anyone who likes Fallout, building, upgrading games. The game had a lot more freedom for a building your base game. Plus it is free!"
17190,"Enjoying the game, just wish you were able to use cap for more things, after completely maxing out the vault, there's nothing to spend caps on. would love it if you could buy the Lunchboxes and Animal carriers with them."

Overall it is a good time waster and something you willl probably find yourself opening often as a daily normality"

17198,"Veri gud! faive starrrrrrs 
Me laike laike"
17199,"   What can I say about Fallout Shelter? 
   It's addictive, it's cures boredom, and it's free! 
   Normally, I only play 3ish hours on a game every other day (sometimes more, sometimes less). Yet with this game I found myself playing 6 hours straight everyday. 
   You only need a mouse (point and click), an hour to get the hang of it, and to get your first lunchbox where a bulk of the rewards and goodies lie. Likewise, they also lay out in The Wastes where you can send your residents to explore for a multitude of interesting objects, including obtaining experience points and gear. I would love to say more, but I don't wanna spoil anything. 
   I've been playing videogames for 20 somethin' years, and I can assure you that if you love The Sims or similar types of genres where you directly control your avatars, situations that abrubtly arise, etc., you will definitely lose your precious time in Fallout Shelter. It will be worth it ;) I even bought a Starter Pack for $4 cash, thinkin' I'd regret it, but no... It was 110% the value of that $4 cash. This is likely the greatest free game I've ever played, no doubt in the top 3. 

Enjoooy~~~"

17212,"A really simple yet fun game where you can get quite attached to your best dwellers.
This game was really missing eugenics though and inbreeding. Why can't I have mother and son or father and daughter producing kids together. You know that's going to happen in a real post apocalypses."
17213,good gmae
17214,"OVERVIEW:
Fallout Shelter is a time management game where you as the overseer trying to keep your happy dwellers alive. You can build rooms and join them together, assigning dwellers to do certain jobs or sent them out to explore the wasteland. Crafting items or doing quest requires a lot of time, but that's the whole point of time management games. The ingame timer is still ticking while you are not playing the game.

What I like:
- It's free and not pay to win. You can easily complete the game without paying a cent.
- You can farm nuka cola and speed up the timer.
- Everything is obtainable without the need to pay real money.
- Interesting combat system while doing quest.
- It does not requires a lot of your time. You can run it on your background & do other stuff.
- The 2D art is refreshing and cute.

What I hate:
- One achievement is almost impossible to unlock unless you cheat. I only got 4/20 process while having over multiple hours of playtime. That's just a bad gamedesign choice imo. No one will be that crazy to keep playing for so long after completed the game without any new content.

17215,"If you've got a few minutes to waste everyday, I definitely recommend this game."
17216,NICE STORY AND NICE GAME !!
17217,fucking boring jesus give me my time back ass wipes
17218,"This is definately a keeper.  fun, clicker type game. has amused me for hours.  some of the dialogs are super funny!  It has a few downfalls, but in general, its great.  Don't mind the trolls, try this game for yourself.

Bethesda, if you guys read these reviews, here's my 2 cents on improvements.  Now while I believe you have a solid game, moving dwellers from room to room is a bit clunky.  Instead of drag and drop, how about a move-to button, maybe found on dweller stats.  makes it more precise that way, and also eliminates scrolling through rooms and accidentally moving dwellers, which is quite common.

Another improvement would be to find and repair the memory leak that is hogging resources and lagging gameplay.

it is also a bit challenging to read dwellers thoughts.  when a dweller isn't happy, it can sometimes be frustrating trying to figure out just what he/she is unhappy about.  the text dialogs sometimes hint at dwellers feelings, but arent very clear.

and lastly, when you rush power, food, and water, sometimes it fails.  the issue isn't with the failure, the issue lies within the effects from failing.  it is common sense that a fire can break out in a kitchen, or power room, but in a water purification plant?  kind've silly.  also, failing any of these shouldn't bring on the effect of radroaches invading the vault.   fires, chemicals, gasses,sure, but not radroaches.  kind've absurd.

Thanks for listening! (i hope)

"
17219,"pretty easy to figure out and expand, a game you can have idle in your background or can be actively playing"

But seriously - how many times do i have to lose my vault and start over?

Fix it. 

I shouldnt have to save my vault externally ""in case"" this happens.

Fix it already."
17225,"I have always enjoyed this game but for some reason now, my game will randomly crash in a matter of a few minutes of me starting the game sometimes and i have had to be extremely consistent with saving the game every minute or few seconds to make sure i dont lose anything when the game crashes. it use to almost never crash but within these past few months ive had this game crash at least a dozen or two times and it has caused my desire of this game to drop slightly and i dont wish to lose interest in this game because i enjoy these types of games. if something could be done to fix this crash issue i would greatly apprecite it especially because i also enjoy playing this game on my youtube channel and i dont want this game to go down the drain for it."
17226,I would have paid money for a full game. I hate these pay to win bullshit games. Sorry Bethesda I can vote this as a good game...
17227,"Played 50 hours. Great fun. Forgot to plug in charger, pc turned off. Entire Vault deleted, no way to restore. To say I'm angry would be an understatement :) DO NOT RECOMMEND."
17228,its meh its ok
17229,"Mixed feelings about the game,
Normal mode isn't really worth playing as events rarely ever happen,
Hardcore mode is cruely brutal; almost as if the game is targeting dwellers closest to death,

Then there is the fact that in hardcore mode,
Its not worth purchasing Card boxes, since in the same day you get anything worth while you can lost.
It just speeds up the process of the early game.


Id say its worth a play,
However, not worth the purchases."
17230,"A nice little build-a-vault-game, great for spending a little time. But it lacks the depth to be motivating in the long term.
After 20 hours the game starts to bore.
Not a bad game, in the style of animation with Vault-Boy. There are a few shortcomings, but they are insignificant. My estimation is 8/10.
All in all, this is pretty, but ephemeral; you might enjoy messing around with it for a bit, but after you‚Äôve done a few quests, there‚Äôs really nothing more to see here."
17231,"It's ok, good time passer."
17232,"A relaxing game to play,especially when you want to break intensive FPS game sessions.Also fun to have so much control as the Overseer.This game is the perfect compliment to Bethesda's Fallout franchise."
17233,The save randomly disappears and there is no way to restore it.
17234,"I have this game on my tablet, its going great tho
its going great as well in PC Version

17238,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding lemon bars recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1) 2 cups Flour
2) 1/2 cup Sugar
3) 1/4 teaspoon Salt
4) 2 sticks (1 Cup) Salted Butter, Cut Into Small Cubes
5) Filling
6) 1-1/2 cup Sugar
7) 1/4 cup Flour
8) 4 whole Large Eggs
9) Zest And Juice Of 4 Medium-sized Lemons
10) Powdered Sugar, For Sifting

Directions:

1. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch pan with butter.

2. Stir together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the butter to the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut it all together until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press into the prepared pan and bake until golden around the edges, about 20 minutes.

3. For the filling: Stir together the sugar and flour. Crack in the eggs and whisk to combine. Add the lemon zest and juice and mix until combined. Pour over the crust and bake about 20 minutes.

4. Allow to cool in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours, then sift powdered sugar over the top before cutting into squares.

(Use an 8 x 10 pan if you'd like the layers to be a little thicker.)"
17239,"Play it for free no more than a few minutes a day for a pretty okay time.


Never spend money on this game. It's entirely too easy to lose your purchase one way or another, with no way to get it back. (Also, this is Bethesda we're talking about.)

Spending money is also redundant. There are no items you can only buy with real money, and there are some items you can only get by playing the game. Even loot boxes and speed-up boosts can be earned in-game.

Getting 100% achievements, though, is Pay to Win, as the Blast from the Past achievement can take hundreds to thousands of hours without spending (lots of) real life money (or save editing). If you're one of those max achievers and you just can't help yourself, skip this one."
17240,this game boogled my joogle and my hOogLE
17241,Hightly recommmanded!!!
17242,computer craqshed on a quest. lost the entire vault from the load list. will not be playing anymore/
17243,"I love Fallout Shelter! I like to keep in running in the background while I am doing paperwork at home, it just keeps working a little bit more fun! My husband knows that before I sit down to play any game with him, I got to check on my people and set the most unhappy dwellers up to mate and have a baby. At first it was a little slow...you have the option of playing it fast, but mistakes are made when you play it fast. Everything factors on everything else working properly.  I have paid money into the game at very dull moments with my vault. I pay $1 dollar per hour played, but I have to play those hours first. And it seems to be a game that you don't have to worry about if you are too busy to play. Everything picks up where it left off beautifully!"
17244,"I didn't really care one way or another what kind of game this was. I was just looking for a nice, free waste of time. Oh boy, did I ever get that and then some. How such a simple, game comsumed all of my free time (and some of my not-so-free time >< !) is beyond me.  Maybe its the stupid easy mechanics. Maybe its the totally true ""Fallout"" feel. Maybe its the fact that I got an insane happiness from ejecting people from my vault.  Well, whatever it is, it reeled me in hook, line and sinker.

Do I recommend this game?

Only if you have free time and free will. Otherwise, steer clear because it will CONSUME you =)

Enjoy!"
17245,"I played Fallout 1&2 ""back in the day"". They were a nice blend of grit and crit with a nice dose of tongue in cheek cheese. Fallout Shelter passes on so much grit and focuses on more on the humor. It is resource management at heart with violence. What seperates it from most resource games is it has dungeons. Not super complex, as a matter of fact, Fallout Shelter is built around fun.
If your a ""power gamer"" who wants to test their skills versus super challenges, this may not be your cup of tea. However, it may be the ""guilty lil pleasure"" you enjoy on the side. Istarted playing it because my main computer is in need of repair and the system requirments aren't massive. Attacks on your shelter can be a little hectic; but, in general, it is fairly laided back, nothing the average 12 year old couldn't handle.
It does have one ""adult theme"". Especially early in the game, your Dwellers will probably need to have children. It is not graphic. Male in female in barracks, little chat, little dance and they go behind curtain. It is not the romance fest of Sims.
I have seen many negative reviews based on bugs. I haven't experienced any that affected game play. It is Free to Play with micro transactions. The purchases are not required. It is not ""pay to win"". You can earn everything for sale in game and it is not a grind fest to get them.
My last note on the game is that it can kind of follow many mobile games where you log in, do some stuff and don't need to do much for the next 8 hours, day or week. It has enough to do to keep your attention for straight play or set it and forget it for a while.
As far as the micro transations go, you can get all the stuff in game and many of them lose value after you are established. The one for someone who really wants to ""rock and role"" is the Nuka Cola. It speeds up times. They are great if you only have an hour to play or its ""binge day"". They can be earned in game.
Free is great. There is some stuff you can buy; but it is not required."
17246,One of the Best Games Ever!
17247,"It is a very nice game,but the quest have to wait so long to start."
17248,"Fallout Shelter is a rather fun Fallout series game. Rather than the normal Fallout series actions you take, you take more of a overseer role and manage the entire vault. I enjoy playing it. It is very challenging to stay above the requirements of your vault for survival. It can get boring after a while doing the same quests just with different names but, overall an enjoyable game."
17249,It does require time to ensure your vault stays happy and running but overall I recommend. Easy to play and the rewards and benefits are awesome!
17250,"This game is a very solid game with few cons. To begin with its easy to understand and barley gets boring.
But of course there are cons but very few. later in the game it gets boring but is a great way to pass some time if you want a building game. I highly recomend this game if you want a fun free game."
17251,Sometimes can be time consuming having to wait for more dwellers until you can lure them to you via the Radio Studio and it takes awhile to earn Bottle Caps for you to build or upgrade anything but I still enjoy this game.  I started with the Android version and recently got the Steam version.
17252,Really funny game i like it a lot
17253,"There is a cancer... known as the Creation Club, a malignant growth that needs to be cut before it infects the surface.

We must protect Bethesda from it's worst enemy... Itself!"
17254,Extremly slow paced and boring game.
17255,Great game. It's even better when you dont have to squent your eyes to play it. Love the steam Fallout Shelter.
17256,My save didn't get deleted so I'd say this game rocks
17257,A fun game.
17258,"A decent mobile game, but not good enough for PC. Shallow story and interactions. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME."
17259,well its harem time if you wanna
17260,"Its a nice game but got boring after a while, only for fans of the series?"
17261,"The game starts off interesting. But quickly loses value. 

The pros: The game is nice, not exactly a fallout game but its nice to be the overseer for once. In the early stages of a vault, you can fill up spaces rather quickly and you have to keep on it to harvest your resources. Staying on top of the game means logging in for at least an hour a day and playing his little game, which does keep you interested as it can be done while you do other things. Just keep it in windowed size and minimize when you need to focus on something else. You can build up to 30 dwellers in a few days without much effort and you can build rooms to train their attributes. The variety of junk, Weapons, armor, and incidents is entertaining at lower levels. 

The cons: After you have 35 dwellers, you usually have 1-3 Mr Handies. SO now you dont have to worry about havesting your resources constantly, they do it for you. by now you have an established breeding pair(s), a pair of dedicated door guards, many people working in the resource departments, a fair amount of storage space, and have successfully fended off mole rats, Rad Roaches, and raiders to the point you dont even look any more except to collect the loot when they die. You likely also have realized that armor is ornamental and you can train your dwellers in specific atributes to function as specific things regardless of what their base line is. 

By now you also know that you either go on quests constantly toget lunchboxes that often just overload your inventory with useless weapons and low grade armor (seriously. a rusty BB Gun does 0-1 damage and they are very common. you get one on every quest, even the higher level ones). Selling weapons becomes useless after a while because by the time you ahve 45 dwellers you hit the max caps because Bottle and Cappy come by 5 times or more in a single play run. Bottle drops Quantum rather often (usually betwen 1-5 every time you click his dancing animation. have gotten as high as 6 before), and Cappy drops a ton of caps every few seconds. WHen your vault reaches huge size, keeping up with them without zooming out is near impossible. And makes it hard to even click on them. At this point, forget finding the mysterious stranger when he pops up. Even if you have high end headphones and get directional pitch to the sound to guide you toward his general location, you wont get there fast enough to click on him. 

Crafting is utter bullshit, because to upgrade the crafting rooms you have to find recipes in the quests (i have found duplicates before. 3 of the sme gun from the same quest. that was irritating) and armor does nothing but make your character look pretty. It has no effect on combat stats at all. you need 75+ dwellers to upgrade the crafting stations to make Legenday Armorand weapons. unfortunately you also need levenday junk which is about as easy to obtain as proper medical treatment for cancer. 

Sending a wanderer into the wasteland is a great way to kill them. you cant reject ppl fast enough once you hit max dwellers because even with radio off, no breeders in the vault and you kicking 10ppl an hour you have a constant line of 10ppl waiting to get in. 

By the time you have 120 dwellers you have max res production to the point you need about 1% of what you make and one mr handy can harvest it all for you no issue. your dwellers are so strong they kill deathclaw attack at the door and your quests are the only reason you keep returning in the vain hope of scoring something unique and new. 

TO get pets, mr handy bots, etc you need to drop serious cash because just buying the specific crates will often generate the exact same ones as you already have with the sme abilities you no longer need. 




In short, this game becomes very boring and unplayable after 10 hours. Even restarting with a new vault you end up with the same issues because you know how it works now and hit that brick wall even faster. SO unless you play 3 min, once a week you should have 3 max vaults in under 9 days. its not even a time waster at this point its just a waste of time and effort to find enjoyment in the game."
17262,its been fun
17263,More like Shallout Felter. amirite guis?

17268,everything was fine until recently. it wont load so i uninstalled it but it keeps saying its in my library
17269,funny game
17270,"In my opinion this is one of the best 'mobile' game I have ever played. I imagine this is due to the fallout series, but either way this game is highly addictive. My only issue is that, the beginning of the game is fast paced, but after 1 hour of playing you have to wait for a good 2 - 3 hours before new followers appear, enabling you to build more and move on to the next stages. 

~ One thing I must add though; this game does not constantly ask you to buy things for real money. The majority of 'mobile games are very pushy, whereas even though the option to purchase additional content is available, you are not forced. 

Great game! It's free!"
17271,"""Well"".
""where do I start""?
It's a good game, ""but"",
it has some real flaws.
1. INCEST. unless you start writing down names for geneologies, you're going to either practice incest or polygamy or both in your vault. It's near impossible to keep track after 20 people.
2. MMO KIDNAPPING
you will spend ""real-time"" HOURS in this game, it will kidnap you with the threat of killing off your inhabitants while you're offline through neglect and abandonment. Not to mention the hours of TRAVEL TIME which can be offset by spending nuke cola but you'd need an unlimited supply of money or nuke cola for that.
3. GAME SAVE. You have the option of saving the game but it's kinda pointless because when you close the game without saving, it does an autosave that overwrites your saved game. That is to say, you don't have control over where the game is saved.
4. SPACE INDICATORS. When you're builiding, you're spending caps (currency) but you don't really know if it will fit or not (in the space availablle) because you're left guessing while eyeballing the size of the room.
On a number of occasions I have torn down rooms I JUST FINISHED BUILDING because of a slight misfitting, and lost all the invested money in the process. This doesn't even mention when I've gone for a redesign or rebuild where I've had to tear down ""MAXED OUT"" rooms. ""booooo""
5. IN VAULT COMBAT. Yes I understand that the AI factors in ""intelligence"" and I'm happy for that, ""BUT"" I refuse to believe that dumb members of my vault would just sit in the middle of the room absorbing hits.
Not to mention that when they run around the room, it's sometimes hard to hit the stempack icon over their heads, causeing their deaths needlessly.

HAVING SAID THAT, the game has DEFINITE POTENTIAL and is overall ""enjoyable"" if not taxing.
I recommend the game but only just and would not pay for any version of this game in it's current state.
Very nice BETA though."
17272,"Download it. Stop reading this already, please. Scroll up, click play"
17273,"DO NOT play this game if you a diehard Fallout fan AND you own, or have access to, a credit card. This is the BEST GAME IN THE WORLD and you WILL convince yourself that just another 6 Quantums is harmless. 

On the plus side it inspired me to replay through 3, NV, and 4, and play 1 and 2 for the first time while I impatiently waited for my vault dwellers to do their thing. Playing these games kept my hands busy, preventing me from running my fingers back and forth across my credit card for hours, silently weighing the 2 minutes of fleeting yet gratifying pleasure provided by our favourite irradiated beverage against the ever-increasing interest charges I will inevitably incur sooner rather than later. 

So, 5 stars."
17274,"I love this game in how you have to build and survive sort of like clash of clans but now you explore and have lots of lore  of the fallout seires, overall this is a must get free steam game along with team fortress 2"
17275,bruh a couple of retarded kids just stole my bike and im like how tf does this happen
17276,rip
17277,"Maybe this just isn't my style of game, but I didn't find it engaging enough after five minutes to want to continue. I'm not keen on ""games"" in which everything is done for you; just select what you want, place it, wait for resources, repeat - no challenge. The waiting thing is a no-no for me as a gamer; there needs to be more engaging activities than pushing pixels around on a whim."
17278,"Free, fun, easy to play, doesn't require to play all the time, full of FO-dark humour. Has a slight pay-to-win possibility, but since there's no PvP you manage without. Also on smartphones free aswell! Allthought it wont synch your phone and PC game files.

8/10"
17279,An addicting lil' game! I wasnt sure if i would like it but gave it a try because i loved the original Fallout series and im so glad i tried it. :)
17280,pior jogo de sempre nao sei como as pessoas gotam do jogo
17281,"The game is fun and addicting, always find myself coming back to my vault every couple days. Its great as it doesn‚Äôt pressure you into checking up on it every 5-10 minutes, the added achievements, are a welcome addition giving hunters like me incentive to play the game regularly.

I can‚Äôt see any possible way you could hate this game, its free what‚Äôs more to love?
Its a solid 9/10 for me."
17282,"For what it is the game can feel slow at times if you intend to play it actively. Best as something you run in the background and respond to about every 5 minutes. If you can get past how idle the game is, it is fun and you can experience the whole game without spending any money. Great chill out time killer. And its free, so what do you want for nothing?"
17283,Fun when bored
17284,fall out shelter - fall out is my fave game for console
17285,"very fun

17286,Nice
17287,I like this game and I'm not sure why. It's very repetitive. Sexist. I'm obsessed with maxing out the stats on everyone in my vault.
17288,"Addicting as hell, but infuriating when your save file gets deleted for no fucking reason"
17289,Hmm ok i think :)
17290,Nice :v
17291,If you like those sort of phone games that make you wait and stuff you'l like this. Tbh it's a typical phone waiting game with just a few creative things here and there. Pretty mediocre game overall.
17292,Crashes quite a bit but is fun otherwise.
17293,Great game to spend time and you'll never bored of it XD i can guarantee it
17294,"Very addictive game in the city or building genre. You must slowly expand your vault by building new rooms, many with specialize purposes, keep the residents happy, fight off raiders and bugs. I play it on two tablets and my  laptop. ***** 5 star game, friends!"
17295,"Fallout Shelter - played on Win 10 64bit - no problems

I recommend this with a strong caution. It is designed to drive you/your kids to the DLC. I am only recommending it because I've played 100+ hours w/o purchasing any DLC. I could play more, but I'm kinda burned out on it. It's fun but not difficult. It's purposely cumbersome and clunky w/o DLC. I'm not against the use of DLC. I am cautioning you that some parts of this game use ""drug pusher"" tactics to promote the sale of DLC. 

It should also be noted:
The gameplay perfectly demonstrates the principles of communism. Workers are placed according to ability and necessities are provided for. Education and population growth are controlled by the state. All production is state controlled and all produced goods are state property. 
[While it doesn't bother me, there exists a cultured paranoia about communism. As such, there are some to which this would be of concern.]"
17296,"Incident 34%, more like 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999%."
17297,Great waste of time.
17298,Waste of time...lost all my progress
17299,"This game is great for being free Ive never played a game that goes out of its way to mask its freemium aspects so well.  There are a few problems like the clicking issues where sometimes you seemingly cant click on a dweller, or you happen to send one off to the otherside of the vault by just clicking on it.  However for the price these issues are no big deal and its really a nice little game to kill a little time here and there."
17300,"This game is fun, it IS especially for  mobile game. However, even though i personally havent experienced the cault erase glitch, after about 70 dwellers management becomes a bit more tedious, but even worse and the condemning fact that made me abandon my vault and write this is the random attacks after dweller leve 15 average. Fuck radscorpians, in the wasteland not that bad. But after random luck giving me 3 in a row, sucking every biut of power out down to zero and leaving me dead in the water unless i reorganized all 70 dwellers and kept the game up for over an hour to collect and recharge i said fuck it and wrote this. maybe you wont experience this, but after a certain point its all i felt"
17301,"This game is so fun, espically ifyouhave played Fallout 4 because it fits together perfectly"
17302,i really liked the gameplay but it has way too many bugs and crashed a lot for me
17303,"I lost a vault that I spent hours (and $40, stupidly) on.  I complained, and got nothing back from Steam support or from Bethesda.  I was addicted enough to try again.  Guess what?  after hours and hours of play, power went out.  When I logged back in to play, the vault was gone again.  Forget the backups, those dont work either.  DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME unless you want to see all your gameplay hours dissappear in a single power-outage and/or crash.  Absolule Bull."
17304,its a good game but the time it takes to progress is a bit much
17305,"[b]Graphics/maps/textures[/b] prety nice, meniu options standart

17306,one of the best addictive games i've ever played. if you like fallout
17307,Reenact the Baby Boom from the 1950s and employ them for the welfare of your Vault.
17308,"If you like survival-platform like games then this is really nice. But for users that haven't played freemium games before, this might turn out to be quite a sour experience. Otherwise I suggest you buy [i]Sheltered[/i], [i]Beholder[/i], [i] This War of Mine[/i] or even [i]The Flame in the Flood[/i].
[b]All in all, its quite an addictive fun game that you can play enterily for free, though it constantly tempts you to micropurchase.[/b]"
17309,"When I first tinkered with this game over a year ago, it basically felt like a building-sim/""tower""-defense-like exercise, which is all well and good.  Since the additon of battle quests, I appreciate being able to go out into the Wasteland to tempt fate (like in Fallout New Vegas), and then return to base to mostly gather my nerves, upgrade my resource rooms, tinker with my dwellers' skills and appearances, and generally plan my next steps (when not dealing with the occasional raider/deathclaw/radscorpion attack).  Love this game!"
17310,"Interesting, but still glitchy. If you build the overseers office it will force run the initial quest then zoom to a random section of screen, while removing any control you have. So you're just kinda screwed. If you like trying to find solutions, then go ahead and download it. I'm glad it was free."
17311,Uber fun and addictive game! Prepare to spend your hard earned money! :D
17312,pretty cool fun game
17313,This game is one of the best free games on Steam! Enjoy playing this RPG. Its cool who loves building and upgrading things!

17315,"I started playing this game on my tablet.  It had glitches and was hard to manage when my vault got up to 200 people due to the small screen size.  I was excited when it came to steam.  With a bigger screen and using the mouse it is much easier to manage the vault.  There is one glitch that is annoying but doesn't break the game.  When you click on a dweller to select him, the game moves him to the room below.  It doesn't happen all the time.  I have not spent any money on the game and I have one vault with 60 bottles of nuke cola.  I love all the additions they keep making to the game, like the quests.  
You do need to have patience with the game.  It takes time to train and level up the dwellers.  So for me the game is pretty stable and playable.  Its a great way to take up some time."

17321,Super!
17322,"One word comes to mind when thinking of this game FUN, yes pure unadulterated fun for all. Kitchy 1950s style pop art characters and a silly sense of humour this game is worth your time. The fact that is is free is a bonus. Get a copy for yourself and strap yourself in for excitement."
17323,pretty basic..not much fun outside of the app for the phone
17324,"Had this on mobile, on bethesda, and on steam. A very simple game, that can highly be addictive but is somehow lacking. 

Just wish It was cross platform so I wouldn't have to start over or play different vaults on different devices. 

The game is worth trying, specially for bethesda fans."
17325,"Beware guys this game is a trap. 
This game is not free, it is (on the contrary) the most expensive and overpriced game I've ever bought.

I've just paid more than 25 Dollars for a 300 megabyte game that should not worth more than 15 Dollars, and I couldn't play more than one day, because the gameplay slowed down again to an unplayable state to force me to pay for more (Nuka-Cola Quantums) in order for the game to continue.

 Bethesda has tricked me for the third time now,

The first time was when I paid 79 dollars for ""The Elder Scrolls Online"" thinking that it will be like Skyrim then I was shocked when they asked me to pay another 15 Dollars every month for a stupid game which is nothing like Skyrim, so I had to stop playing it and I lost all what I paid.

The second time when I bought Fallout 4, thinking that it will be like fallout 3 with tons of Mods which has different new ideas and missions, I waited for a long time until I discovered that Bethesda has (in their new graphic engine) deliberately prevented modders from creating real core mods, instead of helping them. I think that their motive wass to make sure that their expensive expansion packs will have no competition.

and now this is the third time they tricked me, I paid 25 Dollars to play for one day only a simple poorly programed game which I cannot play any more.

GREED IS HUMANITY'S WORST ENEMY."
17326,ive wasted so much time playing this game i hate it
17327,"After 11 hours of playtime I can honestly say that in the market of free to play resource management/tower builder games, Fallout Shelter definitely stands out. It has a unique art style, unique, quests, unique weapons and outifts, as well as unique dwellers. From one quest I earned 2 ""people"" called Bottle & Cappy. They randomly show up to the vault and reward caps or Nuka-Cola Quantum (The in game purchaseable or rare currency which can be used to skip quests, skip wait times, etc.)"
17328,"Fun Game. Already spent 50 hrs on my vault. But it has the typical mobile gameplay, so you have to be patient and wait to get things or pay with real money to get what you want fast. It's ideal as a companion/idle game if you are playing the main Fallout series."
17329,9/10
17330,Fun Game.  Version 1.11 was bulletproof.  Played it for 2 weeks with no problems.  They just upgraded to version .1.12.  Game locks up alot.  Wish they would go back to 1.11 until they get the bugs figured out.
17331,"Really fun and addicting, great game 9/10"
17332,"Build your shelter, advance, search and expand with some combat system in it. Its a free game, but you can use real money to acesel the game forward a couple of hrs and give you some more benefits for getting some better Dwellers when you unlock the loot/card containers you buy. You even get the containers for just doing missions and quests, you can even build training rooms for leveling the Dwellers stats. So using real money for getting some where in this game isnt anything you have to do. It is not the type of game I usually play, but it is fun now and then. You can decide if you want to use 5 min or several hrs in this game, since it is a ""semi turne based  game"". A thumbs up for sure."
17333,"If you're fan of Fallout series, it's definitely worth playing. This game can be addictive and gives fun for more than few hours. Its totally free, in game buys are not needed to survive in the wasteland."
17334,"Gets bored for a long but it's fun.. the textures aren't the best.

17335,good game
17336,should have stayed a mobile game
17337,!!!!!
17338,dont start to play :D
17339,Best microtransactions of any phone game.
17340,"i have a dark sense of humor, so i find it funny. it can be frustrating when waves of bad things happen, but it's consistently challenging. i like the building and strategy aspects. the thing i really dislike is when they say 'sell this' or do that, but they've never told you how to do that."
17341,Not sure if this game makes me concerned for the ozone or concerned about how the world thinks we will end up as a society
17342,My save file disapeered randomly and i can't get it back and they wont refund anything either. #Deleteingonpurposeconspiricybydevs #Neverplayingagain #Hashtag
17343,it's ok.. good transfer from a mobile game to pc.
17344,"I love this little game :). Simple and fun, not much to add for this one :)"
17345,"Love this game, much more fun on a PC than a phone :D"

17350,for when you wanna play fallout but at the same time you really don't wanna play fallout so you play a building sim based on fallout because its fallout but really it isnt fallout
17351,This game did make me want to play FO4 as intended.
17352,Fun little game to pass a time.
17353,"It's fun, it's free, and in some ways it's better than Fallout 4. It reminds me a lot of the original Fallout games mostly when you're out doing quests and stuff it has a turn based like style. I usually let it run and do a few other things it doesnt require much attnetion if you score or buy a few Mr. Handys"
17354,this was great until it crashed and my vault disappeared. I will not play this anymore unless the devs comp me enough caps to remake my vault!
17355,"I love this game!
"
17356,Very nice game to just log into a couple of times a day and do what you need to do.  It doesn't really have a paywall either which is nice for a free game. Quests are entertaining and the management of the shelter is fun too.

17362,I really like the game but mine is glitchy. And I hate that everytime I get over over dwellers most of them get killed by moles. It has happened 3 times. I have armor with a high powered weapons and moles still kill everyone. WFT!!!! It a fking mole!!! Please stop that.And when I get raided  the game chrashes everytime.  Other than that I enjoy the game.
17363,"Every woman is pregnant, I achieved everything

Anyway, somehow it reminds me of 'The Sims' and 'Neighbours from Hell' at the same time"
17364,If you wanna kill a few hours this is the game. Much like other wait for things to finish games you can just change the time on your computer to skip it. There's no incentive to buy anything with real money because they dont patch this stuff.
17365,Loved it - I need to max out all my people then send them to the waste land!
17366,this is the best game i ever played.
17367,I love this game its beyond addicting.!
17368,Such a cute and quaint game .. my only complaint is that they didnt bring over the Family Tree option from the IOS.. unless I am mistaken.. but I remember it having that on there.. :) its just that that function would make it a little easier to make sure I dont commit incest within the vault or any other Jerry Springer type relationship.. lol
17369,"Genious game. Fun and light hearted. 

"
17370,"I like the game alot. I used to play it allot on mobile and was waiting for a long time if it would actually turn up on steam.
The game is fun and exactly the same as on mobile. I highly recommend it."
17371,"Great simulation game, different attributes or stats for dwellers, fairly easy objectives, bonuses and such equals awesome sim."
17372,"Very addictive, casual, game. Been playing it for a while on my phone, had no idea it was even on Steam until a friend advised me that it was easier on here then on the app. Either way, I really enjoy it, though the quests can get a little frustrating but that's likely more down to my poor planning then anything.
It's got a lot of resource management qualities, and it can be difficult to get enough caps to improve your shelter without going on quests or exploring the wasteland, but the game is certainly worth a playthrough. It plays like a Sims game sort of, where you need to manage the dwellers and their resources, think of the quests and wasteland exploration as jobs they need to to make money.
You can get directly involved in the quests as well, but not the exploration (which could be considered a bit bleh), but it is still a pretty decent game, and it's free!!"
17373,"This game is neat to do on the side while multi-tasking, and the game looks like a cartoony Fallout game. The problems I have with this are sorted into three catergories.

For one, the animation is not so great. I do not have a problem with the cartoon-ish style or anything in that sort. The problem I have with the game is so noticeable that in the first minute of gameplay you might notice it. It seems like the animators did not even try a lot of times.

Second, the game seems very simple. I do not mean the game needs to be very complex. What I mean is, it seems like there is so little after getting to 90 people. I wish there was more there, like caravans that could visit you and you could buy item from them. Also, I found the defensive part of the game lacking too. I wish you could build something outside of the vault or have people stand there, or even nicer, robots.

My final problem with the game is what I have been trying to do for awhile, it is that this game lacks a workshop. I am not asking for cheat mods and weapons, I am asking for things like retextures, additions to the game, or fixes, like dead dwellers vanshing after a day, which frusterated me. If this is not posible, then I would really like to have an easier access to the image files because I have been searching for days for the files and all I found was code, left and right.

These are the things I wished were changed in this game which I think might make it more fun, but overall it is okay. I just wish it is was less boring and plain."

Great game if you want something to play for 10 minutes a day, every day, for the rest of time. Terrible game if you're interested in ""finishing"" a game or getting achievements. Make sure you idle for 2 days straight to get those raider attacks...."
17379,It's a good time passer. üòä
17380,Good game but it crashes all the time cant play like that.
17381,Fallout Shelter? More like Fallout Breeder
17382,"This is a good game but when i log out of it, my vault runs out of literally every reasorce and i used to log on every day soon after i get on my computer so that whole thing is literally saying: ""waste your entire life playing this and never do anything other then this so you dont fail"". also this was initialy made for mobile so i would expect my tablet to not seem like its going to catch on fire when i play it. and microtransactions are the devil (nuff said)."

Good for a person who  doesn't what to spend money on a game, like I did."
17390,"Fallout shelter rocks!!!!!!
"
17391,"Once upon a time, I was playing multiple facebook games on a daily basis sometimes for hours. One was a farming game, an aquarium fish breeding game and another a Cafe running game. One day it suddenly dawned on me that in all of these games, I was doing the same things over and over and over with no end in sight, no real goals and ultimately no point . 
I would just build up my farm, aquarium or cafe to make money to build more, make more money, build more, ect...ect...ect..

Fallout shelter gives me the exact same feeling. It is a decent game I guess, can be somewhat addictive but there is ultimately no point to it. It's just a non productive waste of time. Ultimately I have decided to uninstall it. Maybe now I'll spend time on a game that has an actual point to it. Maybe I'll just read a book instead."
17392,"This game is mad awesome! At first, I didn't that it was only available for mobile devices, but when I saw that it was for PC for free finally, I had to download and play. This game is quite challenging in a way, but if you understand the concept well enough, anyone can progress with ease."
17393,"This game is a horrible phone port that is not optimized for the pc at all. 

Aside from that, the game really has nothing to it. You fill supply bars while adding more dwellers uses up more supply bars. Basically this game has nothing to it. It seems the devs made this game to eat at customer wallets, cause all the fun stuff is behind paywalls.

They give you 1 lunch box, which normally costs you $5... but it has ALL the equipment that makes the game interesting. Of course you can complete 1 of 3 tasks to hopefully get a new task that will grant you an additional lunch box. But still, they put the end game fancies in reach if you just open your wallet up, and I mean all the way up. You can spend real money on making this paint drying game go faster, on nuka colas. You can spend real money on buying a pet icon so that your scavenger returns faster. 

There are more things to blow your real money on, but not only are they way expensive for a tiny boost, the game just moves at a snail's pace."
17394,alot of problems dowloading...
17395,"I'm hooked......can't leave my little people alone for too long !  Always something to do. Build your fallout shelter, look after the little people, feed them, clothe them etc, and make babies to boost your population. Increase their abilities and send them out on quests. It's the best free game that I've found to date. Give it a try and I bet you'll be hooked on it too !"
17396,"it's okay for being a phone to desktop game. 
it's not bad but is definately not the best you could get but I gotta cut some slack for it being a phone to desktop conversion. so overall I found myself spending more time on it then I thought I would so I would rate it a 7.5/10

you start off pretty slow (wich I didn't really like ""personal preference"" I guess) but after doing some work on my vault and spending twenty bucks on the vault tec cases It started going very well. cash started coming in in a pretty vast amount and my resources went well. named my dwellers after my friends and sent them out to die :D loved it. but got boring again after a while since the game is pretty repetitive but it's a good time waster tell ya that ;)
"
17397,"Fallout Shelter is a fun game for a few hours, after which it becomes like so many other free management games: a thinly-veiled attempt to nickel and dime you into paying more for a free game than you would for a $40 game.

Need better gear because you are being attacked and haven't been around 30 hours to make 10 weapons so you can have 1 in each room? Buy ""cards"" and maybe you'll find one... or maybe not.. maybe you'll just get resources...which..if you already have full storages of... won't give you anything... but hey.. we got money for it.

Don't want to gamble on maybe getting somethign and maybe not getting something? Buy something. 

People taking too long to show up so you can get the next room? Buy something


Why am I recommending it if this is my summary of the game?

Because it's free, and entertaining for those first few hours. As long as you have no intention of finishing it (or don't mind waiting LITERAL days befoe ONE THING happens... then waiting days again until somethign else happens...), it's a fine, fun, free game."
17398,"You are a Vault-Tec Overseer with no mischievous experiences to do, a pretty opened migration policy and a strong willingness to help every wastelander (Looks like someone cheated on his G.O.A.T.)
Congratulation, Three Dogs would be proud of you and your Karma-meter, you Messiah.

A little too repetitive but you are not supposed to play this game all day. It's more like a game where you go 1 or 2 times a day to see how your people are doing and to complete a quest.

PS : Fallout fans will love the typical ""Vault-Boy"" graphic style."
17399,"fn little casual game that bnorrows heavily from the oooold game SimTower, and that is why i love it.
"
17400,"Played this pretty religiously on my tablet back when the game first came out. Coming back to it on PC I'm glad to see they kept developing it and adding stuff to keep it interesting. It's still very much a casual mobile game, there's really no reason why you'd play this for hours straight after you get your vault set up, but as something you launch a few times throughout the day to do missions/whatever, it's nice.

Microtransactions are a pain, there's a lot more of them now than I remember from way back when, but I guess that's not surprising.

Overall, it's a nice super casual and relaxing addition to the Fallout franchise."
17401,"Hmmph. Not the greatest game, but most definetely NOT the worst. However, thanks to its casual gamepley, anybody can play it since it is also free so it gets kudos for that."
17402,as good as mobile's
17403,gud game
17404,My friends and I love playing this game. I definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. 10/10
17405,the game is nice... but it becomes awesome if you cheat a little to get the Anoying things away
17406,Lots of fun - need a full scal;e game for fallout like this
17407,Is a good game:D
17408,"I have the Iphone app and this game is addictive! The PC version is also fun, but is harder to check in on..."
17409,decent for when you have down time waiting on something else
17410,"This game is AMAZING!!!!!!
I would recommend it to any one who wants to play the fallout franchise, but isnt allowed to
play the real games.
Rating: 11/10"
17411,Only real issue I've had is long loading screens when loading quests. Crashing can be fixed with a quick computer restart.
17412,"Great free to play time killer. Lots of fun, no real downside."
17413,"This thing is frustatingly distractive. I can't gather my thoughts and execute my own plans to save my life.

Trying to pick a mission and assemble a team? Nononono, look at all those green things you have to click!
Checking your people's stats and re-arrange them into their correct rooms? First wait 5 minutes for the deathclaws to murder half of the population.
Wanna build new rooms? No way, it's Bottle & Cappy time!
Trying to hand out weapons and outfits? Dun dun dun dunnnnn! You have 10 seconds to find the mysterious stranger!
Topping up everybody's health with Stimpacks after the Deathclaw attack? Here's a Radscorpion attack!

It's more frustrating than fun."
17414,Nice Game but i got alot Attack Comeing At Night
17415,"It's great for killing some time specially when you're bored.
I have been playing this game in my mobile, sadly, the updates were too much to handle.
So, I stopped, but I'm planning in playing this game AGAIN.
Sooner."
17416,it erases its vaults(saved game files) constantly
17417,"A simple, yet good game."
17418,Do not work in my tablet.
17419,"This review is of course for the PC version of [i]Bethesda[/i]'s & [i]Behaviour Interactive[/i]'s [u]Fallout Shelter[/u]. It originated as a mobile app which from its initial launch in June 2015 I enjoyed on my phone very much, up to a point. I remember being so excited to hear this announced at E3! The PC version works identically, which means some pros and cons in the transition from mobile to PC.

The way games are designed on one platform or another can reflect the nature of the platform and intended use of or vision for said games. [u]Fallout Shelter[/u] is one of those that just works better as a mobile app.

Ultimately it comes down to time gated activities and rewards. It's tough to sit down and play this for prolonged periods of time as a dedicated PC game. On my phone, it feels totally natural to fire it up, hit all my resources, queue missions and all that then close the game to check it later.

Now there's potential here for additions or improvements that bring the game more firmly into the PC space; I'm sure anyone who's tried it could brainstorm up a few ideas! My own run towards a more fleshed out questing system and deeper RPG elements. I'd also request a combat speed setting of some sort (on PC) so I don't have to sit through the plodding, drawn out fights during a mission. A little too slow as is.

I don't enjoy how certain events seem to be scripted. The specific example in mind is that some type of incident triggers shortly after game startup each new day (in game or real time, not sure). Early on these crises are simple, manageable. But they increase in magnitude as your vault grows. Presumably a bigger vault has more personnel with better weaponry to repel invaders, put out fires, etcetera.

At some point though, it's just a deathclaw raid each time! So tiresome since deathclaws take a little while to kill and really burn through stimpacks keeping vault dwellers standing. That lengthy, costly routine is the last thing I want to greet me every time I go to check on my vault. It quickly becomes off putting.

It's gratifying to see ongoing support for the game, including balancing along with all new content, quests, items, etc. Bravo. They've also embraced the trend of seasonal events and mini-holidays, although that seems mostly relegated to cash shop discounts. The cash shop offers various perks and upgraded versions of regular things that can't be obtained otherwise.

One noteworthy bug to warn you of: On rare occasion should the game crash, you may lose your save! Even if the files are still there. Regular manual backup of save files is the only sure way I've found to protect against this.

I'm giving a positive review since this replicates the fun of the mobile version. Just bear in mind it can't necessarily be played for hours on end like a conventional videogame; that should be apparent from the outset.

TIP: Frequently back up save files.
TIP: The help section is useful in that it explains some mechanics & info you couldn't learn by any other means."
17420,"This game is very much like SimTower but with a Fallout twist!  It's a fun game to have running on another screen while you're doing other things, as there is often not a whole lot going on.  The quests are a lot of fun once you unlock them."
17421,"Game is fun so far, but I wish they would increase the speed random people would show up at your vault, not talking about raiders."
17422,"Phone game ported on pc, the model of phone games isnt adapted to pc gaming at all, yet i can't stop playing it.
Good game."
17423,"I played fallout shelter on my phone and PC!
This is very nice game!
I recommend this game"
17424,"Fun lil time killing game. Def worth the free download. Seems so far that you don't really need to pay to play, but just depends on how interested you are in the game is the feel. So far for 5 hours of play time, it's interesting enough to get me to come back. Unique spin on other rescource management/simulator/farming kinda games."

17427,"Ok, so I haven't played it more than fifteen minutes or so... But it feels like I've got a pretty clear picture of it, and this game is slow, really slow. Compared with other games such as Sheltered and This War Of Mine, Fallout Shelter does not have much to offer, besides that it's F2P that is. Perhaps it would be something for someone who just wants something to fiddle with while watching movies or youtube."
17428,"This game, while simple and lacking in major game mechanics, is a fun little thing to toy with on the side. It doesn't really require much attention, but makes a good escape when you really just hate whatever you're supposed to be doing (like school work, or real people work). I was very excited to see this come to steam."
17429,"A funny mobile game with nice visuals and cats (and dogs, and parrots!), but not connected with Fallout 4 in any way. Play only if youy are ready to face the horribly ported controls, the ridiculous fighting ""system"" and the close-to-naught management options for your dwellers and inventories. The microtransactions are not too intrusive."
17430,"Decent game for casual gamers, simple and fun mechanics. Although, it's not really practical to play this on Steam because you can easily download and play on mobile which is much quicker and less hassle of Steam logins, Mobile version doesnt come with achievements though. There is a single microtransaction in game which is the Lunchbox, you can get rare dwellers, pets, weapons, clothing, etc. albeit it isn't really required when you can easily exploit the time in game and get unlimited lunchboxes and instant arrive times, hope the devs fix that btw lol. I have managed to do the Christmas/Halloween/Thanksgiving quests all at the same day because of that and I didnt have to wait for those holidays to come. There is not much to do after you've done all the quests except defend your vault from incoming attacks and send out dwellers to the wasteland, It also gets boring fast once you have have and stockpiled most of the legendary endgame weapons. Still a quick fun game tho!"
17431,Have been playing this for a long time on my phone. Great time killer during long commutes. Decided to download to PC since it was offered for free. Have spent about 60 hours now playing and have absolutly no bugs. Guess I've been lucky. Since many are reporting corrupt save issues. My vault is up to 80+ dwellers and am 2 rooms away from 1 of every room. Maybe I'm not getting corroupt saves because I don't use steam cloud (have my own clound that I syc to). Also no corrupt local save either. Will keep my fingers crossed. Otherwise a great game when you have a little time to kill.
17432,"Its fun @ Android, but pc...? Okayifi have nothing too do..."
17433,After 10 minutes I had done everything that I could... now to wait hours for caps... No thanks. Uninstall.
17434,coooooooooooooool game
17435,"Great time waster.  Dont spend $, get the save editor."
17436,this game is awesome if you have the time to play it
17437,its nice for a while but now im wondering how to get my money back bc i played it to where i cant get better so please help me
17438,"Fallout Shelter, live life in your Completely UNSAFE Vault, Vault Tec did not bother building a solid vault, rather Every Radroach and Radscorpion in the entire wasteland, nests underneath your vault just waiting to gnaw its way through your paperthin walls. If Not, you are about to get attacked by Raiders, Ghouls or Deathclaws...
Because apparantly you drew everyman and creature on earth a map to your vault and then copied it a billion times.

If none of that happens be sure to be ready with a fire extinguisher in the most remote and unused part of the vault

If only the game gave you a break, but no.. I played it for 5 hours the first day, closed down and came back to half my vault dead."
17439,game review
17440,this is a time-waster.
17441,This game made me pre...
17442,For some reason I can¬¥t stop playing it. 59 hours played so far.
17443,Nice time killer. I usually leave this open in the background while I'm playing something else that demands more of my time.
17444,"I highly recommend this game, and the price couldn't be better!  It is wonderful to find a game where I don't have to start over again and again because my reactions are too slow. The play is easy to catch on to, and no motion sickness worries.  After a couple of trial shelters, I got the hang of it and now can't put it away. Windows PC 64bit platform works great.  I wish the other games I've paid $$$ for were as much fun!"
17445,"Very Addicting and Fun Game,You should try it out.Needs Some Knowledge or Brains To Be Good At."
17446,"The game ran fine up until I built the Overseer's Office. At which point the game's UI would completely disappear after sending some of my dwellers on the tutorial mission (WHICH I COULD NOT SKIP). I could not save, interact with dwellers or rooms except to level up the dwellers. I also could not report the issue on Bethesda's site. This is really unfortunate as it was good up until this game breaking bug."
17447,This game is really cool!
17448,I cannot get past tutorial. The game freezes everytime I activate RUSH now matter where I place my first generator.
17449,Not nearly as fan as it was on mobile. Can't even accept my dwellers after they return from the wasteland. These ported Time Wasters‚Ñ¢ are becoming sloppier and sloppier.
17450,"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚úØ‚òÜ
It is an amazing little free to play game, addictive but not as stupidly addictive as clicker games ‚Ä¶ it at least has a point to it‚Ä¶ to some degree.
 
I really love this little free to play game, got lost in building the perfect vault and getting all the damn achievements !!! Side note, don‚Äôt go into this thinking you can get all the achievements, even after playing 42 hours I have 2 that I just simply can‚Äôt get and won‚Äôt get unless I play aloooooooooooot longer, all the other achievements are quite do-able but the last 2 that I couldn‚Äôt get would basically require me to start new savings and I‚Äôm not up for that.
 
Anyways!!! Back to the review, you don‚Äôt ever need to spend money in this game, it is really an optional thing in this game, you CAN spend money but it isn‚Äôt at all needed and I got through the game without ever needing to pay anything. And because of that, this game is even better.
 
I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still rambling, a quick mention of what the game is about, imagine XCOMs base building but you build the base and manage the people in it, giving them the correct jobs, equipping them, sending them to the wasteland to get new items and eventually training your dwellers. It gets quite addictive at first and the implementation of Quests really added a lot of hours to the game for me and adds a nice little extra fun into the game.
 
And there we go, I cannot think of much more to say about Fallout Shelter, oh! It is a lot better than the Android port for me, after playing 20 hours or so the Android port started crashing after opening or just not working, I only encountered a problem with the Quests once on the PC version and it was sorted out with the latest update. So get this version if you want to play Fallout Shelter. 3.5/5!
 
PS it only gets 3.5/5 from me because it just lacks something, something small but I can‚Äôt place my finger on it, [url=store.steampowered.com/app/356040/Sheltered/]Sheltered[/url] is a lot better post-apocalyptic XCOM-ish base building game and because of how good that game is at what it does it overshadows Fallout Shelter a bit for me‚Ä¶ (This is just my opinion if you disagree then that is fine, the fact that Fallout Shelter has the theme of Fallout is really awesome and makes it an excellent game as well, and its art style is a lot better than Sheltered but for me, Sheltered was a better experience).

17451,"One of the most meaningless games in my expirience.
In my life i've played complete Fallout series (Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout BoS, Fallout 3, Fallout 3 NW), but i can't give meaning to this... this genre is for killing time only, almost like ""funny farms""."
17452,garbage game cant win stupid idiot game very bad game
17453,nice game
17454,"Pros:
-Addictive
-Oddly satisfying
-Not PAY to win (as long as you pay with real life time)
-Interesting process of upgrading your vault and MAXing your SPECIAL stats on your dwellers

Coins:
-Rad scorpions , raiders , deathclaws and ghouls attacking your base can be really annoying and can also make you feel like deleting the game , we all hope the game will change the cringy attacks.
-Getting more dwellers is a dead end if you rush it (take your time to upgrade your people and structures or else your entire VAULT can get wiped out in seconds)
-Rushing is kinda glitched  (the times I failed rushing on -20% FAIL chance are way too many , but it's only natural , the game is trying to teach us not to RUSH things , if you know what I mean)

Tips:
-Plan your vault (Don't just place random buildings)
-Check your dwellers and get rid of the useless ones
-Keep track on your resources , keep them above normal stat
-Don't go nuts blazing and impregnate all the women (Take your time to improve your SPECIAL stats first)
-Train your Endurance and Luck if you are to send dwellers to the WASTELAND , those stats helps a TON (Don't be a duck and give your people that you send to the WASTELAND more stimpack and radaway - this will keep them alive for a bit)
-Train your dwellers to 10 ENDURANCE and give them +7 heavy wasteland gear + train all of their other SPECIALs to 10 and send them to the WASTELAND after giving them a HIGH END weapon like MIRV (22-27 DMG AOE DMG) or Dragon's Maw (22-29 single target DMG) will help them become GODS , tbh you need 200 dwellers like this and the game would be broken (there won't be anything left to do , if you did completed all the quests (not the weekly and daily ones , cuz they are infinitive)  and you did all the room upgrades.
-Radscorpions comes at 50 dwellers and at 60 dwellers Deathclaws strike , so be smart and keep your people to 49 or 59 that really depends on the fact whether you are ready or not , good luck and may the radiation never be on your way ;) !"
17455,Somthing to pass the time.
17456,Realy interesting
17457,"Troughout my 25 hours of playing, I got 9 steam messages of people telling me that it's available on mobile."
17458,being in control of somebody elses life for a change is so nice
17459,"I liked the game on Android.  But the steam verion with forced Tutorial...sorry, that sucks.  wasting time on the tutorial is not worth it."
17460,"Horrible game, but it could be so good.  Here is how the game goes.
1. get resources stabilized
2. deal with random emergency (fire, roach infestation, mole-thing infestation, raiders)
3. use most of your resources to heal your people
4. run a mission
5. slowly growth your shelter
6. goto 1.

It wouldn't be so bad, but #2 in the list is so obviously deliberate attempt to stifle growth/attempt to have you buy a microtransaction.  It also wouldn't be bad if there was some type of AI that would deal with the current random emergeny.  For example if you have a fire in a room with no one in it, you have to manually drag a person to that room to fight the fire.  When he is done putting out the fire he will just stand there, even if the fire moved right next door, until you either move him again or all fires are put out.

Moving the people with a mouse is also very touchy/clunky at times.

In the time it took me to write this review, I had 2 'random' incidents occur; a massive fire and a massive mole-rat outbreak.  Just making some repetitive just to drain resources doesn't make for a challenge.  It just makes it grindy and boring."
17461,"Pretty good game to play in short sessions. Not enough going on to try playing for longer than an hour at a time.

One major flaw though:

I had started my vault with purchasing a booster pack and a couple extra lunch boxes. 100 dwellers later, I had everyone at 5+ SPECIAL stats, starting to gather legendaries, doing really well.

Game crashes after a mission. Local save files are deleted. Steam Cloud save files are deleted. No vaults showing up in game. No saves located on my computer, anywhere. Just lost the cash I spent on micro transactions (shoulda known better, but just wanted a boost), along with my time played.

Not worth starting over after just throwing some cash down the drain. Don't bother playing if you want a sense of accomplishment. If you just want to kill time and will be playing for free, can't hurt?
"
17462,"Great game, adapted from mobile to PC. At least there is no ""How about the settlement, go help the settlement. I'll mark it on your map""."
17463,fun and addicting
17464,"I enjoyed the game for the first hour, but then it got tedious and frustrating. I had to constantly check on it and there was an endless loop of shortages. All of this was bad, but the thing that made me quit was the raiding. It harmed my people and got in the way of everything. I wanted to just play this occasionally and have a relaxing time but it just annoyed me. I wouldn't reccomend this game, however, it wouldn't be bad to try it out if wou are willing to give it some time."
17465,"Great game, runs while computer is off"
17466,"Fun time sink, esp if you're a Fallout fan. It's basically time managment game that forces you to balance everything to expand further or you'll get pissed off and / or dead (possibly both) people who won't want to do anything for you. There's fighting, food and Boot calls...what else could post apocolyptic survivor want? 

And for the folks that have had problems with save files....I play this on both my Android and my PC (WIN 7) and I have had no issuse. Well, occasionally if you latch long duration to get to quest, once you arrive you wont have your Stimpacks or Radaway that you know that you packed. So either tough it out or head on back. But not game breaker."

17481,"I was on a quest where i needed to talk with spy's. 
This was a question: Tell me where your vault is located! or we will kill you.

The first 2 options where tell them or not. 
But the third answer was like this: ""Its underground"" 

10/10 would make jokes again against heavily armored raiders. 
BTW my guys died yay"
17482,this is the best game iv ever played!!!!!!!!
17483,Fun. Making mah harem now hahaha
17484,Epic addictive game I tottaly reccomend it!
17485,"Nice game!
I recommend this game because you can create and defend your vault.
You can send dwellers to Wasteland, you can complete quests and earn rare things: weapons,outfits, junk etc....
This is a very creative, and good game!
By President Donald Trump :D"
17486,"the game is really fun if you spend time on learning the machanics it will take you a couple of vaults but its really rewarding you if you play your cards right. pretty good game for someone who doesnt have a lot of time to play and also likes indes. but i found frustrating to use the touch bad and end up losing some of my dwellers  , also i've heard that there is in game crushes could corrupt your save files i haven't run into it yet but i've heard that's really common. the only thing that i hate is that you cannot repair a mr handy before it gets destroy and that you can set only three teams for the quests. overall the game is good."
17487,Very good game! I advise!
17488,"Fallout Shelter is a lot of fun, especially if you can't run it on your phone. It's relatively simple once you get the hang of it and can keep your vault dwellers alive. I had issues running it on my phone after I got past a certain vault size, so I never played it much. Now that it's on Steam, I can actually play much further into the game. Quests and exploring the wasteland are a nice way of keeping the game going after you have a ton of dwellers. Idk if pets were in the game on Android when I played it, but they aren't a bad addition. Overall, I'd recommend this if you're into the Fallout series."
17489,Really fun to play!
17490,This Game Is Really Fun And I Would Recommend It.
17491,Very good
17492,"It's fun for a while. 
After you make a fairly decent vault not much progress happens.
You still get to go on quests and defend against raider and monster attacs which is okay.
If you want a quick game to give a couple minutes every day this is good for that."
17493,"Neat idea, but 95% of the game is waiting for production cycles, immigration and babies."
17494,i played this game and it's f***ing awesome man
17495,I cant play
17496,"lov it
"
17497,good
17498,Its just in general an awesome game that you should download.
17499,"I spent my whole day off playing it, that was fun.
I came back the next day and my vault was missing, that wasn't fun."
17500,"If you're a fan of Fallout, you'll enjoy this game, it's a light take on the Fallout world with you in charge of a vault all your own. There's several missions you can send your vault dwellers on, and eventually you can set a theme for several of your main rooms, and make your own weapons and armor for your vault dwellers. If one of your people happens to die on a mission, no worries, you can pay some caps and revive them, no problem. After about 20 hours or so you'll have enough caps and resources to do just about whatever you what to do in your vault. The only real issue honestly is keeping your men and women separate in barracks, because if you don't, well, expect another kid to pop out, which eventually can cause issues with overcrowding."
17501,Decent game not the best but its fun when you're used to it!
17502,"I like the game, but i have one problem. The game crashed and now my save file is gone. i put both time and money into this game, now what? Who do I talk to?"
17503,I LOOOVVEEE THIS GAME. It's not boring because of the quests and rewarding too for a free to play game
17504,"Game Has game breaking bugs. Google them. If your pc crashes while playing save file gone. You spent money also gone. Thanks  Bethesda Game Studios . Avoid this game at all cost. If you do play make backups of your save file on a different drive. 


Wasted 55 hours because the Lazy F***s cant fix a bug thats been around since 2015"
17505,My vault save was deleted after 4hrs
17506,"This is a fun, addicting game...
This game doesn't seem to be made for a Windows 10 pc.  
The game will freeze up constantly. However, if you aren't using Windows 10 the problems I'm having may not occure.
On that note, I would still recommend it, because it is free to play."
17507,"I recomend the game :)
"
17508,"This is a great game, but it crashes ALL THE TIME! It is incredibly annoying and it happens about every 20 minutes. So far, I haven't lost anything - yet. But it is by far the most annoying aspect of this game."
17509,"can we get ""famelly tree"" in the game when we point dawrler"
17510,"It's really a free game, I didn't spend money until I hit 100h of gameplay and then I decided to support the developers that worked in this game and bought a starter pack. I was playing the original mobile version also but this time, game really evolved. Especially the quests are really great, crafting is amazing, filling up your shelter with max SPECIAL dwellers is priceless. Well how can I even spend 100h on this game right? Well it's because I'm a achievement hunter and it's pretty fun to achieve in Fallout Shelter! I suggest for a time killing 10 minutes game a day."
17511,of cours is good
17512,"Steam stays on page 'Preparing to Launch Fallout Shelter' Please respond. I played the game for about 5 hours until now

17513,This was one of the most addicting games I've played and it is very fun if you like games that require checking on it every time you log on and getting equipment and achievements that reference the other games then I'd say 8/10 recommended

 - Management game
 - Graphics
 - Mechanic
 
Dislike
 - Excessive difficult in survival mode during combat

    >> Not recommended to play in survival mode for fun / relax
    >> Causing me to play ""oxygen not included"" from Klei instead."
17515,"It's a fun little free-to-play game. 
I've never played any fallout games, and when I saw this on steam I thought to give it a shot. If you can't figure it out from the ~80 hours I've spent with it, I actually do enjoy the game. Alot.

Sure it has the same ""f2p"" elements as they all: You can spend real money to get lunchboxes, Nuka Cola quantums, pets and Mr. Handy's. But I wouldn't say you are forced to do so. You'll find all of those from the quests (which are really funny and entertaining, the whole reason I've been playing so much) and from various tasks you complete. Quest's take various times; Some have 22 hour travel times, some have an hour and others are something between those two. With Nuka Cola you can speed up the travel times, but as I said, you don't necessarely need to actually buy them. You'll find some from the Wasteland (either quantums or from lunchboxes) and if you do the quest about saving Bottle and Cappy, you'll get those two coming for your vault multiple times a day and the other one gives you Nuka Cola when you click him while he waves his hand for you (I don't know does he give them more than once a day however).

Probably the only minus what I can think of now, is that the quest lines will eventually finish. I think I have three quests left and without quests the game gets really boring really fast. But I guess nothing good lasts forever."
17516,"col gamre n ujgf  [;nk jk[ pi[h bu but need s more features
"
17517,"I actually enjoy this game quite a bit, even though someone could easily argue that it probably doesn't have much depth to it (plot-wise). It's essentially an app. For that reason I wish Bethesda would do more with it, like find a way to make it multiplayer or make your steam game connect to your facebook and other systems so that you could have it on your phone and take your little vault with you wherever you go or perhaps share it with others (there is a version available for free in the appstore through Googleplay, but from what I understand, this is a separate file from Steam, so you would have to start over and make separate purchases, etc if you decided to do so).

Altogether I love this game, it's very casual, but it does require a little strategy and carries some modest entertainment and cute little quirks which are all what keep me coming back to it. I look forward to seeing what the devs decide to add to it."
17518,"Love this game. I have it for PC, tablet, and phone!"
17519,fun little game no cash necessary.
17520,very good game but im not usually a single player type player
17521,"This has to be, without a doubt the most frustratingly difficult game I have ever played and a waste of every hour I have invested in it. I started 7 different vaults and every one either ran out of power, or was littered with dead dwellers after multiple attacks by radroaches, radscorpions, mole rats, bandits, deathclaws etc. Every one became non-viable after hours and hours of building, exploration and allocating dweller X to room Y...rinse and repeat.
Considering it is a nucear fallout shelter, the the vault is far from impregnable, creatures just tunnel in and slaughter, while bandits can open the vault door with swords and .38 revolvers!! Resources are hard to come by; every cap is a prisoner because they want you to buy more in the store. As a ""free to play"" game it is impossible and, rather than spend money on more caps or 'starter packs' I simply uninstalled it. Someone needs to remind Bethesda that games need to be FUN as well as porfitable for the developer. I will not be playing this ever again because I'm liable to burst a blood vessel."
17522,i like its concept but getting caps are a chore an even then a month of time wont get you anywhere
17523,"It's nice time killer, but really need save sync with all devices."
17524,I like Fallout Shelter Because It Reminds Me Of The Real Fallout Shelter On Minecraft I Built what it looked like and i spawned people walking i was a mod!
17525,"very fom game, but the save files dissappear.  Dont waste your time.  This game is based on progress but all your time could be erased."
17526,"Cheatable by just changing the clock
"
17527,"good game lags on laptops 
 
"
17528,EXCELLENTTTT AND GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
17529,its ok but not the best it is better for mobile but you should play if bored
17530,"Fallout Shelter started off as an app for android and apple devices and now its been bought over to the PC!
I had played it (via an emulator) and from what I can tell, it plays and feels the same! You are the overseer and you basically build and layout how the vault is. You level up your fellow vault people, you can train them to help improve get resources such as power, food and water which you need to live! You also can go outside the vault and explorer to meet new people, take on quests and collect junk and weapons to craft other items. You can also take a pet with you on the way you are also able to bump uglies to increase your population!

Game has optional microtransactions but you can get them for free by doing quests and objectives. Has achievements which is nice but no steam cards :("
17531,This game would be a lot more fun if it could stop crashing every 5 to 10 minutes. In three hours it has crashed at least 10 different times. Really annoying.
17532,It is a fun passtime sim type game where you manage a fallout shelter.
17533,horrible. dwellers die easily and impossible to produce enough resources.
17534,"Fallout Shelter. Good concept.

But it sucks.

I am a HUGE fan of all of the Fallout series, even when they were beind developed by Interplay. With the release of Fallout 4,  my love for the series came back. So when I went on Steam and found this game, I was very excited, then dissapointed. 

I can sum this game up in two words that any professional gamer like myself would automatically stay away from: mobile port.

The game is a good concept: running and establishing your very own vault set right in the Fallout universe. But it lacks in many places, the biggest I think is keeping your interest in the game. There's been points where I just stare at the screen for (I kid you not) ten minutes straight without anything other than resource icons appearing. Not only is the game lacking in design, but like most other mobile games, there are the dreaded, microtransactions.

If the word ""microtransactions"" didn't set off some kind of warning, then nothing is stopping you from playing this game.

Besides the fact that there are microtransactions, they're used in the worst of ways. You can pay money for a couple things like Nuka-Cola quantum, which can be used (to my knowledge) to buy these weird lunch-box things. And guess what these lunch boxes have in them? Nuka-Cola quantum. Usually less than what you paid for the box itself. It's little things like this that just make this game unplayable for me, but I think that if this game went a little faster, more things happened, and the microtransaction were removes completely, I think it would be a decent game. Not a great one, but one that I would play if I was waiting for something or on a plane.

I hope that this review was helpful! this was one of the first reviews I've written on Steam, and I hope that I conveyed my message clearly. Thanks for making it this far! You now known not to play this shitty game."
17535,"Good time killer, was excited when it first came out for android. My only complaint is the freaking radscorpions, like hot damn please lower how much power they suck out of you."
17536,good game
17537,"Downloading another Steam game while playing it caused it to clash,  deleted my 100+ hour save. 

Pice of shit!"
17538,"Starts game.

17540,What a waste of time.
17541,"It doesn't even let me run the game game anymore even though I can run Fallout 4 with large amount, exceeding 100 fps is this happening to anyone else or just me?"
17542,THIS GAME IS INCRIBLE BECAUSE he holds us
17543,"DO NOT try and play this GAME until they fix SAVE game/files bugg!

17547,"+ Even Crappy Laptop will run it
+ Can mindlessly click at while binge watching TV 

- At some point when designing the concept for a mobile game Bethesda had a choice between the Wait&Play/Pay&Play model, or creating a fuller set price game that honestly could have potentially been on to something.

Use a save editor to boost Nuka Quantums and play it at without the waiting.

17550,"I really do love this game. It's addicting and it's a nice little cool down game between my long Fallout 4 plays. The dialgue is intertaining, the characters are cute. The quests are fun and I do enjoy the little surprises. It's a nice way to kill time if you're bumming out too. It's pretty well rounded.

Although I do have some complaints. Nothing too big to make me stop but enough to cause annoyance.

The lack of a pause button. I don't want to have to go to the main menu if I walk away to grab a snack or something.

The battle system is kind of clunky. I honestly thought it was broken when I'd drag the target to an enemy and not have my Dweller attack it right away, until I did an internet search and learned those with high agility can attack faster.

A pregnancy meter would be nice. I know pregnancies are 3-4 hours, but there are some that have been longer and I've been sitting around waiting for a Dweller to pop long past the 4 hour line.

Again these are just small things, not big enough for me to hate this game as the pros outweigh the cons, but if they're still applying updates to this game these would be nice additions/fixes."

17552,"I could literally feel this game making me dumber, 6.5/10"
17553,"Things continue to happen in the game even when you're not playing.

I think this kind of game creates more frustration than fun, because it's hard to get things done ingame, but easy to lose them, as I've just felt."
17554,nice game
17555,THIS GAME IS AWESOME 10/10 IGN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17556,"Good points are many and FREE is a grteat strater, gameplay is addictive, sometimes enthralling, as your shelter grows.The only bad point is no game pause, the doorbelll rings while your playing in a fight or within a quest and bang no pause."
17557,Meh waiting for things is annoying and the game can easily go south but it is okay.
17558,Crashes every 10 minutes
17559,its a llitle slow but it works and its free
17560,love this game / app you dont even need to know the game fall out 4 (i do anyway) 10 out of 10
17561,Is gud
17562,I love this game hahahah
17563,Survival Mode is not simply brutal it's impossible without buying stuff or getting super lucky in your first few lunchboxes
17564,thumbs up
17565,"Well the game was fun to play, but my vault save became corupt, so if you willing to waste time playing the game to lose your vault after 100 hours of play time by all means."
17566,"<3 Like android
"
17567,Ok
17568,Everything that the other negative reviews said plus go to hell with the vaults simply disappearing...
17569,"the game is fun... at first...
but ressource collection is a stupid shit that force you to stay there to click... and once you logue out with all ressource at full and your consumption being always replenished to full by the ressource you collect everytime; you expect that when you log out and back 24h later, they all gonna be full again... but no... all in red almost empty !

and when you fail ... invasion of giant radioactive scorpions!

I hate absurdities... you fail a rush and accidents happens... fire ok... flood... even downgrade... but the basic concept of building a base is to secure the inner center by reinforcing the perimeter... but now in that game ... everyrooms got to be secured with guns and all inhabitant got to be trained to have great stats to survive...

that's totally counter intuitive and illogical.

radroach big as rat infesting in ... that I can tollerate.. but giant scorpid bigger than a dog swarming inside the very middle of the the bunker!!! how did that bunker survived during the nuke if it is so easilly breach!!

played intensly for 3 days... and now I uninstal that shit"
17570,looks like s**t
17571,"Terrible game... With a game like this, it has to be intuitive and smooth - it is not.
I was enjoying it to some extrent until my first deathclaw attack (up until then it was just raiders). The deathclaws basically ripped through my base and killed everyone. I had my two best fighters stationed at the front door, but attackers never stay in the first room, they move from room to room, seemingly randomly. all you can do is try to drag you fighters to the room where the attackers are (and the attackers move to another room before your fighters kill them), or click on a vault dweller in the room and awkwardly scroll through your weapons to try and equip them with something useful, only to find they have already left that room! I play games for fun... These sort of game mechanics aren't fun or rewarding.  Why not just nominate two dwellers as your fighter/defenders and equip them with your best gear, and in the event or an attack, they follow the attackers around and defend accordingly. I could go on about the fighting mechanics but I won't. Do bathesda even play their own games?

"
17572,"Enjoyable Time   m  u  n  c  h  e  r !!     (STEAM why were  there HEARTS blocking this perfectly sensible WORD OUT, so I punch it out differenly, now what!! ) 

Pc version better than mobile. Kinda misses the 
mark I guess, non the less!

-->>Bethesda, we know where your talents ly now!!! It's tooooo late!  You cannot lead your  computer zombie TES army on a new course!!    

I think there is a small country worth of people waiting patiently... but GNAW BITINGLY  on TES6!! <<--

17575,Nice game
17576,"Hoo boy. When they said that you were going to make your own fallout shelter and leave you in charge of maintaining it, I wasn't expecting it to be this hard! Every time you upgrade a room, it draws double, or even triple the amount of power that those power plants can provide, and then you have to build another one somewhere in the vault.  Then later in the game you're tasked with keeping your expedition alive while you go on quests.  Someone gets killed during the expedition and you don't have enough caps back at the vault? T-O-O BAD! I ain't dragging your dead ass back to the Vault!  Why can't this game let you use the caps that you earned DURING the espedition to revive them on the spot?  This game doesn't even spawn enough dwellers and my Vault is very stretched thin.  Can somebody say ""understaffed?""  I finally set up a radio room and it's taking 2 damn hours to get anyone out in the Wasteand up here.  The only way to make more dwellers is to cohabitate a male and female Dweller and procreate.

I also hate how they go on coffee break after they return to the Vault after exploring the wasteland or coming back from the expedition.  The most nagging part was right after I put in the Overseer's office and the damn Fallout Boy tips guy would not go away!

I might have to remake my vault the way things are going, but the overall happiness of the vault is at 97% last time I checked and I don't want to start over.  Also, this is one of them ""pay-to-win"" games, so if you're the casual sport that hates waiting on a quest to get started by the three dwellers you sent out and you don't have any Nuka Cola Quantums, this game is definitely NOT for you."
17577,"This game is a great time killer, with lots of things to do like building your vault in a way where the elevators don't give you OCD and making your dweller's hairs multiple shades of the rainbow. The saving function has given me problems, though, so be careful with progress, its set some of my quests back pretty far (and they aren't quests you can do in a short amount of time)."
17578,Pretty entertaining for what it is.  I originally played the iphone version when that released and have got to say that it certainly has more content then it started with.  If you're looking for a time waster that won't take too much attention then you might as well give it a try
17579,This is pretty cool actually.
17580,"Great game :)
Offers a variety of builds, upgrades, explorations and craftings etc.
The good thing about this game type is that your game is still progressing while you are offline.
- I would say that it is not a type of game where you would continously stay and play for hours, but rather a game you could check on once in a while :)
Anyways, I am a good fan of fallout, and I think they have managed to create a nice little cozy, cartoonish version for another target group."
17581,"Best free game I've ever played, apart from MMOs of course. Better than most games that cost up to $10 on steam, great fun, great gameplay!"
17582,Good mobile game now on PC!
17583,Everything gets fuzzy/blurry since recent update...
17584,Iz gud
17585,"-The best vault fire simulator out there. Who would have thought, that functioning sprinkler system would be lost technology in the future world. 

- It's good game, exspecially so since it's free to play."
17586,Best f2p mobile game i've played to date.
17587,"Good game. This is the furthest i have ever gotten compared to the IOS. I just hope that my vault save doesnt get deleted like some other fellow vault players.

However ever since i started the game i cannot collect the lunchbox that comes every week. Which sucks because i miss out on the good stuff"
17588,Such a fun simple game and highly addictive ... but so is crack!!
17589,wonderful game until the radscorpions screw everything up.
17590,I prefer playing on the computer instead of my phone even though the port is obviously built for a touchscreen. It's fun and not much of a time sink which is nice.
17591,So much fun!!!!
17592,This game is amazing and super addictive the only problem is with the save file when an update occurs (this is Common among other game and for all i know impossible to avoid) it just dosent work this also happens when you go from offline doing things to online but only with steam not on mobile devices so it has to be a problem with steam and the game interactoing together or just having to have a large update every time that interacts with the save
17593,Addictive!
17594,Was really into the game till my vault disappeared . Thanks for turning my time into nothing .
17595,Slow but ok
17596,Bethesda you should add Abortion clinics in this game. It sucks to have 200 people in the vault and 30 pregnant women. If the female is a high level one you cant send her on a mission BTW. This game is a real timesink.
17597,very homo
17598,the fucking last patch ruin the game now my game runs at 20 fps wth
17599,Really fun game to past the time. 10/10
17600,i love this game
17601,"This is legit one of the most entertaining fun games you can get on Steam for free. I'm having endless fun with it, and the references to the Fallout franchise are a nice bonus :p"
17602,Coool
17603,Para matar el tiempo 8/10.
17604,this is a game where you have to wait for something to happen its like clash of clans if you have played it.but it is a pretty good game but it could be better but i am putting a thumbs up because it is free and ho dosent like free stuff :)
17605,Its a good time waster.
17606,"Short 'n' Sweet Review

Sound:  Meh (2.5 out of 5 points.)
Graphics:  Pipboys come to life art... I like it. (5 out of 5 points)
Gameplay:  Blatantly obvious it's a mobile phone port.  Which means *microtransactions* or you have to grind forever.... and wait hours upon hours (or days) before doing Quest missions.  (-5 points out of 5 points)
Overall:  2.5 points.....  it's a good thing it's free to play.  

Remember kiddies,  Microtransactions and Prepay ruins lives and helps the terrorists win."
17607,"This game reminds me from when I lived in Kentucky.
The family Tree's are telephone poles."
17608,Good fun for some Fallout fans..
17609,Nice little sim game.  Keeps advancing when you are off line and great to pick at when you don't have a lot of time.
17610,"Fun game where the atomsphere of Fallout Shelter isn't completely serious and bleak and you could treat yourself to this if you are feeling like you could just read and tend to your vault at the same time. Even then.... mircotranaction doesn't have to be taken seriously as you could just wait for quests' destination to be reached and back and wasteland expedition (which is if your dwellers are coming back to town). The game even have characters from the franchise itself with the likes of Colonel Autuuem, Sarah, Piper, and a few other characters if they aren't talking in-character which again this is not suppose to be taken seriously which leads to silly moments when they get to speak in and out of the vault."
17611,"The game can be addictive. I would not recomend spending any money in this game. My computer crashed and I lost all my saved games and $20 down the drain. I have 130 hours into this game, just to lose the vault that I made and all the dwelers inside of it."
17612,you can call your dwellers butt need i say more?
17613,"Great Game, fun to play, doesn't take too much space"
17614,"As a whole Fallout Shelter is a great game, It's a few years old now and updates like quests and weapons/clothing factories have made it that bit deeper and more playable. I've got probably 100 hours both on Android and I'm not far off the same on Steam. I've enjoyed all these hours.

Pros:
- It's great to jump on for 5-30 minutes once or twice a day, do the quests, check how your dwellers are doing and just generally play around in the Fallout universe in a different way.
- It's free. Also more importantly the pay to win side isn't needed. I've got over 100 Nuka colour sat as I don't mind waiting to start quests or for dwellers to level up alone etc. There is plenty of content for a free game and you don't feel like you need to spend money.
- It runs well, the graphics have a nice feel and look good.

Cons:
- Using a mouse can be painful at times. I think it's because it was designed and out first on touch screen devices. The amount of dead dwellers I've had from not being able to click on the healing or the amount of times I've raged from not being able to drag a dweller. it's not a huge problem and doesn't affect the game long term, just frustrating!
- It gets predictable at times, I guarantee that I'll have a Death Claw attack within five minutes of getting in game every time without fail. Again nothing major but gets a little dull.
- Achievements. If you're an achievement hunter, don't bother unless you're worth millions or have years of time. I'll explain as it frustrated me greatly as an achievement hunter wanting perfect games.

- Get off my land - Survive 50 raider attacks. After 60 dwellers you mostly get everything apart from raiders. This ends up in starting a new game to try and get them more frequently. IMO it should be stop 100 vault attacks. This way as you progress and get Ghouls or Death Claws you can carry on getting the achievement.
- Blast from the past - Find 20 legendary dwellers. Don't bother... I've done my 200 ish hours on both devices and had five. I should be due a couple more from the last quests but that totals maybe five after 100 hours. It's basically a case of waiting for lucky lunch boxes. 

All in all the game is good, I've enjoyed my time on it and will log in once or twice a week for some time still. Maybe they'll update at some point and add more game time which would be nice. The bad points aren't huge and don't get in the way so I'd recommend this game.
"
17615,"I was willing to let the naughty nightwear issue go because, sure, women like them some sexy lingerie sometimes. What made me quit and uninstall is the fact that female characters cannot wear the mayor's outfit. It's 2017 folks. Stop telling people what they can and can't wear."
17616,the game worked for 30 min. Then after i bought something on it... it crashed... and I can't restart it anymore.... Enjoy my money... you won't get any more.
17617,"A very good casual time sink. Picture Farmville but set in the Fallout universe, and way more interactivity. It's free, so what do you have to lose? You can buy Nuka Cola to speed up some processes but you should be able to find enough out in the wasteland to get by.  I've yet to spend a dime on it."
17618,"Love this game, and in fact all of the fallout stuff. Excellent work."
17619,really addictive game since fallout series in going well 10/10
17620,"I recommend playing this game casually and not religiously, It plays well as a pick up and play for a few minutes at a time. The missions are interesting addition at first but become very redundant very quickly. All the lighter side of the fallout series, this game makes a great pallate cleanser or ""refractory"" period in between titles.

Warning to achievement hunters out there you will either spend a lot of time on this if you are looking to perfect it OR a lot of money trying to get the last couple of achievements."
17621,"This game is very fun and addictive with its cartoon like style there are very few glitchs and its pretty fun but u need 2 keep checking your vualt at all times but i love it and i very much recomend it as much as possible but one small thing,Why Cant I GET INTO IT I MEAN THERES A GLITCH AND PLEASE KNOW THAT THIS VERY TIME CONSUMEING GLITCH STOPS ME TO MY HOME PAGE WHILE ITS LOADINGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But very good game.
:]"
17622,did you know that I post scripts of old Thomas the Tank Engine episodes on different websites just to piss people off and be an utter dick?
17623,Game is boring after first 2 hours. Long time waiting + repetitive behaviors.  Game functions were also limited.
17624,"It's OK game that's super charming and deeper then other free to play waiting based games, but definitely but on mobile for convenience (plus you don't lose saves)."
17625,Good to play for free time :)
17626,"One of the best games of this genre I've played, with a *slurp pop* NOICE artstyle, kinda cute, it has a nice sense of humour to it and it's actually fun to manage the Vault. I remember playing it when it had just come out and I'd immediately been like GODDAMN IT WHERE ARE QUESTS, I WANNA GO OUTSIDE THE VAULT, I WANT MORE STUFF TO BUILD! MORE MORE MORE! And then I came back to it a while later and voila, it's all added. 

The Questing system is fun and rewarding, and it's actually satisfying to sustain your Vault and watch it slowly grow. There are a few bugs and sometimes the controls using a PC is a little annoying, however overall it's worth playing. If the Quest system was expanded further and there was more stuff to do upon completing a Vault etc however it'd be even SEXIER ;)"
17627,"Love this kind of game.in 2 day already play 16 hours.interesting games and love build own station with own taste.need improve the survivor.its like paper human stick on the book.lol.no problem with save game.hope improve this because lot ppl dislike because save game.Game is great so nothing to complant on this time.hope put new weapon,building,attacker watsoever to make game interesting."
17628,Played it for 47 mins and then it inexplicably broke. It won't even load and Vault 467 is forever doomed. This horrible port has therefore been erased from my Terminal.
17629,"Great game save deleting simulator!

10/10 would have my game deleted again!"
17630,Kinda Fun Game to play :)
17631,"nice graphics, works on calculators, fun and enjoyable...
..for first 5-8 h. 

Then you realise that it's just clicker with micotrasacions. - 1
ridiculous deathclaw vault attack everytime you lunch the game - 1
last achievement - 20 legendary dwellers unobtainable without paying for vault box - 1
grind - 1

I enjoyed but it could be better..more like neutral review then recommendation,  if it exist in steam.

overall 6/10
"
17632,I love this game and would recommend to get it. Of course Though I heard that the file at some point will crash so I backed up my game. I'm not a fallout fan but this got me interested Also If you are reading this BACKUP YOUR GAMES FILES NOW BEFORE SOMETHING HAPPENS.
17633,"downloaded the game, couldnt play at all, it had all the controller buttons flashing all glitchy. did a search couldnt find a solution had to uninstall...im very dissapointed"
17634,One of the more involved and in-depth games of its kind that i've ever played.
17635,It's a nice game but the Controls if you play with a mouse is a buggy nightmare plus theres a lot of complints about the corrupt saved files.  You want to play this game?  Install Bluestacks and play it at it's full potential without those problems steam version is garbage!
17636,"It takes too long to do anything, and this really doesn't deliver the experience of a game. All this game does is waste your time in order to get you to spend actual money on it. 3/10"
17637,"Havent been playing it long, but it seems to be a pretty addictive game, but time will tell if i might change my mind"
17638,"Nice little time waster. Don't get too invested in the game though as it's plauged with corrupted save glitches. As of writing I'm giving up on the game as it has developed a crash on start up glitch from nowhere (not related to corrupt save)

Not worth constantly duct taping the game to get it working again."
17639,"this game is like sims with loot crates, everything eventually goes to shit or you actually build the best thing ever."
17640,"It gets kinda boring after a while...
There is no way to speed time and so things take so long to do."
17641,Grate game
17642,"I think something went a bit screwy in the balancing in Survival mode.  I was chugging along great, my guys were having no problems with opponents, until I got to the boss on the final stage of the Bottle & Cappy quest.  I had 1 guy at full health, and 2 a little wounded.  Boss drops a grenade in the 3rd round and the fight is over.  Total wipe.

If I'd been struggling with opponents I'd be like, ok, boss is clearly more powerful and I was already outmatched.  But there was no warning.  My guys were 4+ levels above the minimum level for the quest.  They had cruised through 10 rooms already and used maybe 3 stimpaks total..and 1 guy was at full health.  I never saw a 1-shot total wipe coming.

Up until that it was kind of fun. But this game is just broken.  Glad I didn't spend money, since money wouldn't have solved this problem."
17643,"Before attempting to participate in this game, make sure you do NOT have a controller. It will destroy the game for you and dev's are not willing to allow you to disable controllers."
17644,"This game is excelent! I played the mobile app, and this keeps everyhting good about it, but also makes it easier to navigate your vault. It's a great game in every aspect."
17645,"im so fucking addicted





[u] stop [/u]

EDIT: the game deleted my save randomly. fuck this game."
17646,"I'm a little obsessed with this game.  I like how you can customize your dwellers (when you unlock it) and how there are references to the Fallout games in the missions.  Being able to craft your own weapons and armor is nice too, since I ususally find mostly low level stuff in the wasteland and on the missions."
17647,Not bad.it would be great if dev add more sound or music.
17648,Good game! Enjoyed it on Android!!
17649,"The obsession starts again, I just can't get enough of this lmao."
17650,What could have potentaly been a great game is ruiend by freemiump trash.
17651,"This is a great game for killing time and enjoying the fallout universe. The best thing is it is free and if you really want to buy the micro transaction items they are generally pretty good. This is an Android game ported to pc. I love the fact there are achievements and it references fallout storylines. 
I have put nearly 24 hours into the game at this point and enjoy trying to build perfect quest teams and a perfect vault layout. 
The hardest thing will be getting attacked by deathclaws and radscorpions. The Raiders and Ghouls can be challenging but the previous 2 are more troublesome. They are not exactly hard, they just require your attention more then the other too.

I usually run the game why checking emails or listening to my favorite music. A fun game with picking up and enjoying.

The only Con I can think of is it can freeze occasionally but it generally recovers. Also it sucks when someone you like dies and you don't have enough caps to revive them so keep an eye on your dwellers.
"
17652,"good game, kinda hard, and it takes a while and some skill, but anyone can do it. Overall pretty good game."
17653,basic
17654,Really annoying to try and move a person from one area to another on a rush. Hard to select people and they don't go where they're supposed to. Starting out with few guns and people make raids bad. I move people places and they don't even attack or defend themselves sometimes. Most of the time i cant even get people to move to the correct rooms
17655,"This game is horrible. 

It get old after a couple of hours, it's extreemly tempting to spend money getting past the ""Startup"", only to realize, that was the whole game. There is no ""interesting"" endgame. It's just an endless repeatable grind, for ..nothing. 
The whole game is set up to milk you for money at every angle. Most things can be bought. Infact, most good things have to be bought. 

The game makes NO sense. You can have the best of the best base defense, but still get whiped out by a single radscorpion invading a empty room, draining MASSIVE amounts power. Yeah, it didn't kill anything, it just drained all your power.

After a while, you'll realize you'll need to kill 75% of your dwellers, because they didn't have enough Endurance while they were leveing up, and now cannot survive lategame. But Endurance training is a lategame feature, so you really never had a choice. 

You'll get attacked by Deathclaws five times an hour, for no reward, what-so-ever. If you can't produce enough stimpacks, you're dead. Oh, and that vault door you maxed out, it falls within 10 seconds to anything that attacks it. How about a giant welcome mat. 

Oh, and you can spend $1000 and have your savegame go corrupt. Sucks to be you, start over. Refund, lol?

Stay clear of this turd."
17656,10/10 time waster.
17657,"Fun* game, ( for a time)"
17658,its for you if you like it enough to play it for days checking up on it day after day
17659,"The Game looks good and is very addictive, but after awhile I had to take motion sickness pills. It's a strategy game, it's cute, you basically click on things that blinks. 

Since I adore almost everything from Bethesda, I really wanted to give it a thumbs up, but I can't, but just because of the eye strains I got playing it.

Wasn't even a long while, but too much small objects to keep my eyes on.

Catch the musterious stranger for more cash! Or in my case, DON'T!"
17660,good sex simulator
17661,"TL;DR version near the end.

I'm sort of a fan of idle games myself, the thought of a game playing all by itself with you just stopping by to collect a couple of things is half decent for me, even if it seems like play-to-wait games nowadays are one of the many problems of the game industry.

Now, this game....Well, I'm looking at this from the eyes of a person who isn't really that savvy when it comes to Fallout, but who's got an interest in the setting of the series nonetheless. (So, I know little about the plot other than basic stuff and whatever I've seen in the games I have played so far.)

This game isn't all that bad. It starts slow and painful, and I do agree that the whole ""Wait for shit to be done"" hurts the pacing and the general enjoyment in this game. It would've been better if they fleshed out the combat and building aspects of this game, got rid of the sit n' wait, and made this a paid product. I'm totally up for that, the idea doesn't seem that bad. Being an idle game, this is one of those games that you play for 20 minutes - an hour or so each day, and then you just move on with your day, and that is kinda bad, there are times when I just want to do another quest or explore another place, and I realize I can't because I have to anywhere betwee 2 hours and a day for my dwellers to reach their destination....Or you can use the premium currency of the game, nuka-cola quantum. Yep, that's pretty much the hook, take it at a snails pace, or cough up some cash. And it hurts me that a fairly interesting game gets reduced to that. 

I wouldn't recommend spending money on this game, though; As far as I know, lunchbox/Mr Handy/Nuka Cola purchases only affect a single vault (AKA save file), and if you lose that vault, like for example, a bug (More of that later), or just a standard game over because all of your dwellers died, your money is gone with that save file. 

And even if you think you can handle it and you're 100% sure that you want to spend money in this game and that you aren't going to lose all your dwellers to some catastrophe, this game is still a bit buggy. It has never happened to me personally, but people have lost their files in the past, with all of their hard work deleted, and yep, that's right, even purchases. And even if you don't suffer from said dreaded vault removal bug, there are other bugs here and there, like losing the progress of your objectives, and that one has happened to me at least 10 times. From what I understand, the chances of your save file getting corrupted are reduced if you don't tab out of the game when it's loading your vault after a quest, and I've done my damn best to avoid disturbing my game while it's loading, and so far, my objectives haven't been fiddled with anymore. 

That being said, the combat in this game is a bit lacking, your dwellers attack automatically, and the only things you can control are who they are shooting at, how much damage your are going to inflict with a crit (When you get one), and when to use radaways/stimpacks, kill every enemy in the room, loot, move to the next one. Rinse and repeat. A 2-D Fallout game would work if combat was a bit more fleshed out, IMO. Now and then, you get to choose dialog options in a quest, but as far as I know, your choices rarely matter. In some cases, the enemies will/won't attack you based on your dialog choices, or might/might not give you an outfit/weapon or come with you, but other than that, there's not too much to it.  

The enemy selection in this game is still relatively small, you get radroaches, mole rats, radscorpions, feral ghouls, raiders, deathclaws, and that's about it. When you send a dweller to explore the wastelands (Basically, you just wait for hours and they will find goodies and deal with enemies, but it's only text based) they mention mirelurks, dogs, yao guai and super mutants, but they do not appear physically in the game. So, your worst nightmares are going to be the radscorpions, feral ghouls and deathclaws, and as far as I know, the first two aren't all that threatening in the main series. 

I personally like the artstyle, it's pretty much the retro style that you see in the trailer of Fallout 3, with your dwellers pretty much looking like Vault Boy. I like the visuals, and I think the Power Armor, as scary as it is in the main series, looks rather cute in a way in here. 

TL;DR 

It's a nice game if you like idling, it's one of those games where you check what your vault/dwellers are up to daily, and then you move on with your day. It's fun, I would give it a try, but I would recommend not spending money in this game yet. With its dreaded vault wipe bug, and purchases only applying to a single save file, it feels like you aren't getting much out of your cash. Plus, everything can be obtained in game, even if it's a bit grindy."
17662,It's ok I guess.
17663,"Pros: Good For Killing Time
Cons:Better Suited to be A mobile game with the in app purchases and waiting required to play."
17664,9/10 only flaws are buggs

10/10 - Chris"
17668,this game was designed to keep your cat busy while you are gaming
17669,"I dunno why people spend money on it and then complain in their review.
You don't need to. The whole thing is just fine without and you can keep playing. (And you don't have to complain about lost money afterwards xD)

It's fun though! unlocking all the rooms, getting dwellers, going on quests. It just ends kinda early, I'd like to have even more rooms. At some point, you unlocked all rooms and there are just quests left.. kinda boring... and sad because this game is really addicting. First time an addicting game stopped me instead of me stopping myself because I spend too much time with a game."
17670,"I'm a lover of Fallout titles, so as soon as they released this game, I didn't hesitate and tried it right away. When I turned on this game for the first time, I was very enchanted. The big + is that they often add updates to the game, which, as usual, improve the game in many ways.



For me 9/10"
17671,Really fun sim game with some challenge to it
17672,"–∫—Ä—É—Ç–∞
"
17673,"Fun little game to kill some time, especially if you're a Fallout fan. And the vault dwellers are super cute."
17674,"It's quite fun. If you have a lot of times to play. this is the choice, but you have to wait for your workers to do their work."
17675,"It's a decent Port, A big Relief with better controls and not needing to use BlueStacks. Though as much as I love this game, Fallout Shelter is more of a ""Time Killer"" kinda game. Recommended for sure though."
17676,This game is fantastic for being free! I was scared at first about in game transactions but they are definitetly not needed. Haven't spent a penny but have gotten pretty far overall!
17677,"Fallout Shelter is a time management game where you as the overseer trying to keep your happy dwellers alive. You can build rooms and join them together, assigning dwellers to do certain jobs or sent them out to explore the wasteland. Crafting items or doing quest requires a lot of time, but that's the whole point of time management games. The ingame timer is still ticking while you are not playing the game.

[h1]What I like:[/h1]
- It's free and not pay to win. You can easily complete the game without paying a cent.
- It does not requires a lot of your time. You can run it on your background & do other stuff.
- The 2D art is refreshing and cute.
- You can farm nuka cola and speed up the timer.
- Everything is obtainable without the need to pay real money.
- Interesting combat system while doing quest.

[h1]What I hate:[/h1]
- One achievement is almost impossible to unlock unless you cheat. I only got 4/20 process while having over 150 hours of playtime. That's just a bad gamedesign choice imo. No one will be that crazy to keep playing for so long after completed the game without any new content."
17678,"Two words:

Fuck.  Radscorpions."
17679,"The game is heaps of fun and there is room for you to explore and attempt different ways of building and such. However, after a while the game did become rather boring but for sure it does tale a while for one to reach this stage."
17680,"A solid well done and simple game really no reason not to try it.

This is simply resource management and a very simple take on it at that, you have food, water and power, build rooms which produce these, populate with people who consume 2 out of 3 of these and of course the rooms them selves consume the 3rd resource.

You can also do a lot of little fun time sink things, collecting and crafting weapons and cloths, these help with the occasional raid on your vault or other little misshaps, you can even send a group of 3 on quests from the overseers office where you lead your group of 3 through a series of rooms looking for some item, person or just to kill a bunch of things.

Keep in mind the game is 100% a time sink, there is no epic story, no multiple ways to play or anything groundbreaking hidden here. Its a very basic resource management game ported over from mobil with tons of great polish and presentation set in the Fallout universe."
17681,"7/10

The game is addictive, cute and funny at times. But as with every game without a real goal, it becomes boring: you've upgraded everything, you've a lot of money, yet nothing you need to buy, etc.
Since it's free, you can always try if you like it. The reason that I kept playing is that I hoped that the quests would lead to a bigger story. They don't. What you see in the first 10 minutes, is exactly what you get."
17682,"I have played it on android. Now i'm playing it on PC.
There must be something good in it."
17683,Recommended
17684,"I can say that this game is ADDICTIVE !!! It's so cool how you can manage a vault, how you can connect with the characters. All is animated and very attractive. To resume what you must do in this game : you build more rooms to sustain life in your vault, take care of your dwellers, [spoiler] make babies if you need more workers [/spoiler], go on a quest  to complete tasks and kill [spoiler] raiders who attack your vault or cockroaches [/spoiler].
This is a very fun game and if you don't have too much time to play and you still want to relax, then this is for you !

How can it be easier to click on a dweller in the mobile version than in this?

17688,"I placed a whole family in the Living Quarters in my vault. They all seemed to have sex and now I have to deal with imbred children in my vault.
The Wasteland is truly an unforgiving place."
17689,"I am amazed this game has women who scream and run around when there is a problem but men always calm. I guess Bethesda doesn't have a single female executive. Maybe they have one and she spend her day screaming and running randomly around the office. I plan to spend years trolling them at game conventions asking their wives and girlfriends to watch the footage. Then I will ask them if this is how they act at home because their SOs seem to think so. 

The starting game is fun. But the further you go on it starts to drag. Some of the missions are fun ad clever. I have found a build strategy which is very effective at the start.  The game loves random number Geebus which can make things fun or really redious. You might start a game with 3 megaweapons or you might get to 30 people with nothing better than old rifles.  Delete and start over to get the game you want. With enough patience Random Number Geebus will give you a mega start.

One of the main strategies to learn to not playing. If you start something and log off its always done when you come back. If you sit there watching 6 people with charisma 1 try to date you spend hours watching fires and bug attacks interrupting. But if you log off when you log back on you get your success without the hassle. The less you play the game you will get more auto-successes and you can focus on the fun parts."
17690,Poor optimasation. How can't I play a game on my laptop that I can play on a fucking mobile? Something went wrong there.
17691,"Who the hell is going to manually back up their saves every time?
 My computer froze once while starting this up and came back to my save game gone.
 This game is both a waste of time and money, i played not only to have my my progress lost but also money spent in their store wasted.


"
17692,This game was moderately fun.  Until it completely crashed and somehow managed to delete EVERYTHING.  I'm OCD about saving additional versions to avoid this.  Thanks for the auto save and making this impossible.  0 out of 5 stars.
17693,"A low resource game that is easy to use on the go or from your computer, it is mildly amusing and fun with a few interesting perks along the way. I actually rather enjoy the simplicity of this game, it makes an interesting change of pace and i continue to look forward to any new items and additions. I will say that you really do need to plan ahead and play smart. So if you are not use to such games, i suggest you follow and read all the reference material hints and support items to give you the best chance."
17694,Absolutely love this game. Just so so much fun.
17695,so fun own your own vault get people and get food this game is so fun trust me
17696,"Remember gigapets/tamagotchi?  Basically this game is an updated version of those.  You have to keep your people happy, and you have to wait on them to produce things, so it has an element of farmville in there, too.

Not my thing."
17697,"Addictive and light fun game, a little repetitive after a while but for what is just a mobile game gone to PC it works well. Good to easily pick-up play and put down for those that slot the odd few minutes of gaming in around other things (like work).

Note: If you're an achievement hunter, like myself, you'd benefit from ""Googling"" alternative ways to get the 'Blast from the Past' achievement than emptying your bank very real account buying lunchboxes in the Steam store.

PS: I sent Preston Garvey out into the wilderness as soon as I got him and he's still out there..."
17698,"One of the better mobile ports on Steam. Completely free to play and on ""survival"" mode it even provides a decent challenge.

Don't buy lunchboxes, just use a save game editor if you want anything from the store. 

Make sure you back up your save files as they can get corrupt.

Don't blame the game if your vault can't handle radscorpions, learn the game and get better."
17699,Fun but I think its better on your phone. But for the PC its really fun to get back to the wastland and get your hands dirty. 10/10 on the time waster scale.
17700,amazing game to relive stress
17701,"Somewhat interesting game. It's fun for couple days and probably even longer, since it requires only about 1 hour of attention every other day. However, all negative things that I have faced, drives me away from it. I can't enjoy it as much as I would like to.

The game uses real life time to progress, meaning that scavenging trip out in the wastelands literally takes hours of real time. There is no speeding it. You put your vault dwellers do tasks and close the game. After couple hours or days, you open the game again and see the progress. There are some events that fire only when the game is running.

Pros:
[list]
[*]Tasks takes real time hours to complete. It's nice to close and forget the game and tomorrow return to it and see the progress.

[*]Quests and stories are nice.

[*]Lots of references to events in Fallout 4 (duh).

[*]Micro-management is light.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]Combat takes forever. Now I know that this is port from mobile game, but seriously speed up the combat!

[*]Horrible UI. Again, I know that this is from mobile game, but god damn this UI and forced camera. It frustrates me. Animations takes forever to finish and cannot be skipped.

[*]Gets repetive quickly.

[*]While dragging camera around your vault, you keep picking dwellers accidentally up and replacing them to wrong rooms.

[*]Raid events cannot be resisted at all. They will beat that 50-ton door down with a fire-axe and harm your dwellers. Use security? What security? Only thing that you can do is to equipt weapons to dwellers (I'm okay with this), but I wish for dedicated security that can HOLD the attack at the front door.

[*]Quest requirements are stupid. They should recommend level and equipment.

[*]A veteran BOS officier, who happens to become pregnant, loses her skills and willpower to fight a threat? Sure..
[/list]"
17702,as of 5-18-17 they have not fixed the bug that erases your vault
17703,"Fallout shelter is a game based of the popular fallout serise, it focuses on building a safe base for your dweller. You must manage their hunger, water and electrcity while making sure your base does not get raided by raiders. It is free but has many in app purchases, I advise not to send your dwellers exploring over night and always have security on guard. I rate this a 7/10 because once you reach 60 dwellers you get constant attacks by creatures that kill all your guys (or girls remember gender eqaulity). This gets very annoying, Good luck."
17704,"Awesome game, worth to play. i can tell 25 record hours of gameplay will be enough lol , unless if u wanna keep checking over and over again to collect and build."
17705,"After months of play my PC crashed while in-game. Save file corrupted, backup is corrupted. Everything lost, thank you Bethesda, for this fantastic save management..............."
17706,"This an amazing game. It looks like a mobile phone game but it trully shines on a PC.

Easy to learn, fun to master. Paying (for lunch boxes, Nuke-Cola and Pet-cages) will make the game complete the tasks faster but you do not really have to do this. This may be one of the very rare honestly free-to-play games. Nevertheless, Bethesda does deserve money for this, so try to be generous with them. And because no one is come to raid your base while you are gone, your success and failures are all your doing.

It is addicitive but it is usually run in 20-30 minute sessions so it is easy to fit in any schedule.

Highly recommended!

17707,kurang paham
17708,it can start out very slow.  and takes a bit to get outfits and guns. but over all good time killer.
17709,"[h1]Fallout Shelter[/h1]

Being a fan of Fallout 4, I did not bother trying out this free-to-play game.
As the overseer of your own personal vault, you have the possibility to do a lot of things, such as customizing your vault as you like to.
On top of that, although the game does not have a price, you can do/achieve everything without needing to spend any real money on the game.
Very good."
17710,"I did not experience the save bug people are ranting about and I firmly believe that anyone who spends money on this kind of games needs professional help.

But what makes me give thumbs down is the zero variety, non-existence of late game content and the click-on-something-every-5-seconds management. It's enjoyable for a while but at some point you just snap and realise it just stopped being fun.

Legendary, rare and common equipment work 90% the same. The neghbouring tiers differ 20% in performance but 500% in price and crafting time. This is the bait for all the morons spending money on this shit.
There are several types of weapons. Long story short, they have different visuals and damage but that's where variety ends.
Quests = walk through a set of random rooms, go home.
Quest dialogue choices = 3 categories: 1. fight/not fight, 2. get item/nothing, 3. doesnt matter altogether.
5 or so types of enemies total. Not like they really differ in any way to begin with.
Quest combat mechanics = health potion + choose target + use crit when it appears (or save it for later).
Vault defence combat mechanics = normal things you can do with your vault out of combat - 90% of them because its combat.
Wasteland exploration = stock up a dweller on health potions, let random events happen to them and let them die (look it up, that is actually how it's done).
And vault management? At some point, it stops being an idle clicker and becomes just... clicker. If you don't babysit every single level-up, production success, crafting finish, critical event and raid, you begin to stall. This would be okay if it wasn't happening every 5 seconds.
I started playing because it was something to do during working on other stuff. I stopped playing because it stopped being that and instead turned into a failed abortion."

17715,an EPIC survival simulation game but it needs just one thing : MULTIPLAYER
17716,"its not pay to win, its play to win!

Great game to pick up to from time to time when you have time. It runs at real time so travel and training to crafting progresses slowly (or fast if you use nuka cola).


2 things for those getting started Endurance needs maxing first off for all dwellers before you level them too high. Get the cappy and bottle quest asap, the rest is sim tower meets the sims in the unique humorous post nuke war torn world of fall out. Just wish i could get the fallout radio to play all the time. I miss Mr New Vegas.

17724,"The game refuses to run after playing it once. It keeps crashing.
EDIT: Turns out it was just Steam being dumb, lol. This is a great game."
17725,its good but too much grid and it eats your time with not doing actually anything  just wasting meaningless time once you build everything
17726,"Fantastic game indeed, great game to set and keep in the background when doing something else or to directly engage in when doing quests and such.

the one thing that i can think of that didn't quite do it for me is the fact that you get to controll up to 200 dwellers in the late game which i think is a bit overwhelming as it depersonalises the dwellers,

that being said there is really no reason not to try this game, you might like it you might not, in the end all that you've wasted if you didn't like it is your time."
17727,"Positive: Almost everything :-)

Negative: Shopping things for real money. Why? I think this is cheating instead of thinking and planning."
17728,"The game is ok to play at first. Howver, as you get a bigger vault and more dwellers its harder to manage everything, and just becomes a tedious event you periodically log in throughout the day to check, instead of devoting a few hours here or there to enjoying the game. It should have stayed as just a mobile game. 

The quests are a little bit boring and are not all set up right. Example- I played several quests that spelled out certain (really good) rewards, and I did not recieve the rewards, this come after confirming with walkthrough video/guides on where they were to be found. 

User interface is also annoying if i wanted to click through multiple dwellers in the same room and look at their stats/ items, I can not go from one dweller to another, it makes me click out and in for no reason."
17729,Played this when it came out on the app store and now I play it on steam. Its good for passing the time but it gets sort of annoying when deathclaws start raiding the vault every 5 minutes.

1st week
- AWSOME rewards
- Easy maintenance
- Easy populution build

1 month later
- attacked every 5-10 minutes
- room 'accidents' every 5-10 min
- Deathclaws attack every 30 min
- very hard maintenance, due to the ridiculous ammount of attacks / accidents

You can use a controller but there is some drawbacks.  I know you can purchase items, such as lunchboxes but you can still have fun without paying any money.  I'm glad they added quest as that really improved the game play.  I wonder what else they might add later.  Even if they don't add anything else, this is still a great game. Plus, you cant't beat the price of free."
17734,"I had heard of the Fallout game but never had a chance to play any untill about six months ago when a friend gave me his copy of Fallout 3 for PC. I played it, finished it and loved it. Now I've finished it about 8 or nine times and still I play it more. when I discovered Fallout Shelter I thought it must be good and fun... I was right!

Instead of being the one who goes out and saves the land, you are the Overseer(GOD) and you controle the people's fate in your vault! Set them to work, breed them, cloth them, arm them, send them out to explore or send a team out on a mission. After viewing just a few videos online for tips from other gamers about better layouts for your Vault rooms and population and training the poeple inside, my vault progressed like crazy but I'm not done yet perfecting my ideal underground Utopia!

So if your a Fallout fan I deffinitly recommend this game for you!

But the few negetive things about the shelter....

1 Themes : When I was able to fabricate my first theme for the dinners I thought this will be great because there are four(4) themes for the dinners and four(4) for the living quartes. So a made sure to have four(4) of both ready so I could decorate the way I wanted and that was to have a dinner and living space each dedicated to a theme so that I could have them all visible at the same time and on display for the fun of it but when I activated my first theme for a dinner it changed all my dinners to the same theme... BORRING so I have put off making the other themes because if I can't decorate the way I want MY VAULT to look them why bother! I will eventually complete all the themes but only for the achievment then I will convert them all back to the default theme.

2 Miss-clicking : When bottle and cappy show up (after you complete the mission to rescue them of course), they split up and wonder your vault. The problem here is that when you pass your curser of a dweller they light up with a green outline around them but not bottle and cappy. It has happened many times that I could not collect from either bottle or cappy and what happened was the camera zooming in or out of the room their in, which changes the view and position of your mouse and yet my curser was directly on them and the end result was missing out on some much needed caps or nuka-cola quantums. That was very frutrating and it still is frustrating. I feel the developers should fix this so that when you do find them they should have an outline around them to confirm there are no miss-clickings. Also I had a vault dweller training in a room and I had finally saved up enough Quantums to speed up his training. To speed up his training you need to double click the room their in and click the nuka-cola quantum bottle for that dweller... here's the problem, two(2) dwellers side by side and their bottle images overlapped and the wrong dweller got boosted....MAJOR PISS-OFF RIGHT THERE. when you boost a dweller with your nuka-cola quantums a window pops up and asks confirmation "" Are you sure you want to boost this dweller with X number of quantums?"" it does not give the dwellers name for a more accurate confirmation another issue the developers need to address I believe.

Aside from these issues that I have a frustrating problem with, it is a fun game and yes I will continue to play  and yes I recommend it to anyone who has played any of the Fallout games even other people who haven't. it's a good way to relax at the end of the day or a good start to a gamers day."
17735,I'd rather play Minecraft with 8 year old kids who cry over people stealing their dirt.
17736,"[b]Warning:[/b] [u]Do not spend any money on this game! If you do play, manually back-up your save files.[/u]


The save corruption that renders your time and progress completely pointless also renders this a horrible game; this fact is compounded if any money was spent on the title. The game also becomes more fun at higher levels that require the time (and/or money) to reach them."
17737,I highly recommend this game IF YOU WANT TO LOSE YOUR LIFE playing it lol. Its super addictive and theres a ton to do in it. Especially since they added quests. I actually wish there was an even more detailed version of it. But for what it is its a really awesome game. If youre a fan of the fallout universe or just management games in general give it a go.
17738,Great game. very Addicting :)

17740,"Fun game, unfortunately after 24 in game hours my first vault save file simply disappeared. Just... gone. Discussion boards show this has been an issue for a loooong time, and even people who spent money on the game don't get a refund... they just lose the vault.
Can't recommend a game that is so fundamentally broken. Fix your stuff Bethesda."
17741,"Addicting, something to always do. though if youre comp freezes or lose power RIP vault. feels really bad when you pay for something only to have it deleted right before your eyes. would still recommend."
17742,"I must say i like this game, its great to just sit and relax without any intense situations arrising that require you to get deep into game play, like Fallout4 or 3 or nv etc.. As great as the game is, I must say that it some extra options would be great, like being able to choose themes for individual rooms instead of a complete theme change for all rooms at once.. like being able to make your own themed level within the vault.. 

One disapointing this is the camera that automatically goes to an event. i think it would be great if you could switch that feature on or off, because if you are busy organizing something somehere, it can take you off track to what you were doing..  for example when raiders attack from outside, the camera goes directly to them.... 

Other than those things, its a good game and compliments the Fallout series of games..."
17743,"Micro-transactions
Long wait times
Real time task
All those shitty mobile games combined


I wouldn't recommend."
17744,this is a really addictiong game that kept me checking for days.
17745,hentai is great lolrt
17746,the shit is goood
17747,"if co0lby is read this he suck isz bad
"
17748,"God I've sunk so many hours of my life into this game on mobile. I remember watching the Bethesda E3 conference in 2015 when this was announced and being overly excited because Todd Howard had said Fallout Shelter was coming out that night, then actually had to wait a fair few months because he forgot to mention that is was Apple Store only apart from Google Play. 
When I finally got to play on launch, I was instantly hooked with no surprise, I adore both Fallout and management games so this was an instant addiction to me. I have been playing ever since it launched on Android and I've loved every minute of it.
Surprisingly Todd did not lie about this game during the conference, there are no paywalls if you want to build a facility it's instantly built, you will get caps and lunchboxes rewarded to you in fair amounts for completing quests and sending your dwellers out into the wasteland etc. (You can buy more lunchboxes if you choose too but it's never shoved down your throat),
I did not mind starting a new vault because it's no secret I love this game and I am willing to put more hours in on PC."
17749,Its free but the game is really boring
17750,"This game is so frustrating.  trying to keep the food water and power levels from dipping into the red you are forced to rush constantly. but the success percentage chance shown is absolutely NOT accurate. in \ 100 rushes showing success chance at 34% i failed 63 of them. and thats just when i started tracking them. higher failure chances are even worse. 
eventually gave up when a failure resulted in a Mole Rat infestation that killed over 40 of my Dwellers. all of whom were armed with sawed off shot guns, rusty lazer pistols and enhanced hunting riffles. 
i had ONE good soldier in the high 30s level with a Gauss Riffle whom i used for over night exploration missions for several days, he was the only reason i ever had Caps enough to revive my dead dwellers.
gave up after the mole rats though.. 
i wont be trying this game again. 
have to pay money just to not loose your whole base. 
i might have payed money to buy Nuke Cola or Caps if the game wasnt impossible without paying. 
but im not going to get suckered into a money pit game."
17751,"DONT play this version , this (steam)version has a verry bad adjustment. Go to android emulator en play it there if you want to play the real original."
17752,"Yes yes and yes!
Wanna to kill some time but with responsibilities? Play it then!!
Build your own bunker and take care of your crew 

Explore outside the bounds find better items, and kill radioactive beasts and steampunk crooks

17753,good
17754,This is such a fun and easy to use game!
17755,"Entertaining, playable, addictive, and hey, you can't beat the price."
17756,"It's Good For Real

I Can Feel How And Why I Love This Game"
17757,"so real much educating~

This should be one of classes in school to prepare for WW3

just spending heaps of time doing cardio +  training ""luck"" in casino room  + cosplay as a professional
ez we can now  operate  nuclear reactor / run water treatment / learn to cook.

now that I think about it... why do people go to school again??"
17758,Decent game to waste time with.
17759,Great Game sucks theres waiting times but its a moblie game what can we do and i wish there were more mobs
17760,"fun with a save editor. fun without one too but you'll be waiting out timers and wishing you had nuka cola quantum, it is a mobile game after all"
17761,I love playing this daily. It's different to a lot of free to play games and you can invest a lot of time into it without getting bored. I am a big fan of the Fallout series and this app is quite the addition to the Fallout brand. Lots of fun.
17762,This game is addictive.
17763,"It is good game, free, so... itz a very noice ;)"
17764,"It's a decent time killer, and it's framerate is far better than the mobile version, so if you want to get this game, pass on the mobile version and get this one."
17765,"this game is great but the game runs when your not on and my vault nearly die there should be a update so your food,water,and power does not go down please update the game with this idie"
17766,"This game is both fun and stupid. 
I recommend this game because you can play its full potential without paying*

Fun, cute little graphics with a familiar Fallout theme. A slight ‚ÄúTiny Tower‚Äù type of dweller management and room upgrades. An addition of quests, funny dialogue and sometimes difficult missions makes this game pretty dang enjoyable.
I played this game as long as I did only to complete all achievements‚Ä¶ With that being said, I'm going to help you get them all.

Note: There is ‚Äúalmost‚Äù no way you can earn all 35 achievements without paying (or cheating). I was able to get 34/35 by with some patience and allowing the game timer to run overnight and during the day. 
I‚Äôm only listing a few of the non-obvious achievements, or, some difficult ones with tips that might help you get them a bit faster. Keep in mind to check your vault in the morning and at night. Should take several weeks to complete them all.

QUEST ACHIEVEMENTS:
---Big Pharma (Collect 100 stimpacks‚Ä¶)
---Decorator (Collect all pieces of 4 themes)
---Survivalist (Complete 60 quests)
The key with these is to constantly have dwellers on 3 quests at a time.

TIME-CONSUMING ACHIEVEMENTS:
---Fashion Statement (Collect 20 legendary outfits)
---Armed and Dangerous (Collect 20 Legendary weapons)
---Interior Designer (Craft 1 of every room theme)
With these, keep x1 outfit and x1 weapon being made at all times. They must be legendary and keep in mind what type of SPECIAL is needed to make it go faster (This depends on what you are making.) Also keep the crafting room themes going at all times as well.

THE TWO HARDEST ACHIEVEMENTS:
---Get off my lawn (Stop 50 raider attacks)
The reason I‚Äôm stating this as a hard achievement is because if you progress too fast, raider attacks become very few and far between; Raider attacks depends on the quantity of dwellers you have. 
1-39 dwellers = Raider attacks. 
40-79 dwellers = Raider, Ghoul attacks. 
80+ Dwellers = Raider, Ghoul and Deathclaw attacks.
With this being said; 70+ hours in, I stayed steady at about 190 dwellers and completed all but the Blast from the Past and Get off my lawn. I was at 37/50 attacks and I was only getting attacked by Deathclaws. I saved my game, made a backup and evicted all but 39 dwellers. I got attacked by Raiders 3 times within an hour. (changed the game to Windows mode swapped from Chrome to the game every 10 min) A pain I know ‚Äì but I recommend staying around 30 dwellers until you get about 40 Raider attacks, then I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get them all later

---Blast from the Past (Collect 20 Legendary Dwellers)*
OK, honesty time here. At about 75 hours in; I was about to give up hope. I had two achievements left, Get off my lawn and this one. Also, at this point, I didn‚Äôt spend a dime on the game. I researched how to get legendary dwellers and, besides earning 1 or 2 from quests, you can get them ALL from lunch boxes. So I thought to myself ‚ÄúSelf, you threw down 75 hours of free play, buy a few lunch boxes‚Äù ‚Äì However, $5-$10 bucks doesn‚Äôt get you much, and what lunch boxes it got me‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt help. So I ‚Äúobtained‚Äù a save file with 9999 lunch boxes and went to town opening- with  9999 lunch boxes, clicking to open them for several hours and BAM, 485 lunch boxes later, I got the achievement. So this means: (from my own experience)

485 / 20 = approx. 0.04% drop rate per box
485 * 5 = 2,425 cards (there are 5 cards per lunch box)
2425 / 20 = approx. 0.008% drop rate per card

The reason I‚Äôm saying all this is because if you plan on buying lunch boxes just for this achievement, then you may want to rethink it. I also feel cheap ‚Äúcheating‚Äù to earn achievements, but shit, Bethesda has earned enough of my money over the years. They can take one for the team; I sure the hell did with Fallout 4

"
17767,"Nice relaxing game to play easy.. feels like sims but better at least i don't have to manage them going to the bathroom every 2 minutes
best part its free"
17768,"i saved the game and it did not save it and i bought the starter pack and it did not give it to me and i wasted my money
"
17769,"The same as in the mobile platform, but you can easily change the dweller place in the vault with the mouse."
17770,"A Fallout-ish theme hiding another Farmville clone. Neither skill nore strategy involved: just click on the farms, I mean the rooms, when the resources are ready to be collected. Long cooldowns on every action to incite you to pay to progress faster. Pitiful fights on a regular basis which requires you to drag and drop your brainless gunmen to the next room. The level zero of gameplay.

20 years after the start of the Fallout series, it's sad to see it has fallen so low."
17771,"I've been playing this game since the time it was released on Android and this is the only RPG simulation game i'm still playing. The concept of this game is one of its kind. It requires a lot of mental planning on how to make your dwellers survive attacks and where to spend Caps (the currency in this game). You can not buy Caps with real currency so buying Lunchboxes with real currency is probably a waste of money. You don't need to worry about Caps if you keep your Dwellers happy and strong (which is also the main goal of this game). The game is extremely slow paced and rushing your vault can lead to Ragequit and kind of depression (LOL). Also the game doesn't have an end or there is no specific ending. You can always start survival mode which is more challenging.

I've seen people playing this game on Steam have problem where their save files have been deleted and there is no way to recover their precious vaults. There is no Cloud Save on steam. I have more than 100 hours on Android and would love to play this game on my PC which has more achievements but I can't because of no Cloud Sync between platforms and I think lot of Fallout Shelter players would want this feature. 

Overall a great experience and a must play! Enjoy!"
17772,"Despite all the reviews about crashes I thought i'd give this game a go. Started a game last night - about an hour played, saved it to the cloud. Loaded this afternoon and it's unplayable - 'oops the game crashed' on load."
17773,"Lets burn some hours in the work . :D Im playing this everytime when i can. And enjoy, you dont need to charge steam wallet for special things. 
Try my Guide to increase all aspects in your shelter.

17774,Best simulating game and good graphics
17775,"Good game, well designed, great graphics. very slow in the beginning."
17776,"the game is probably the most amazing game out there. but there is a glitch in the game that causes the mouse to not be able to move or do anything. it caused my laptop to crash and my vault was deleted. i spent days working on that vault. i sure hope someone out there can fix it
"
17777,"Bugged as fuck. Missions restart, legendary dwellers disappear (just like my father)... etc"
17778,"It gets repetetive once you hit 50hr mark. Hell, it gets repetetive after 30 hours.
But its still fun to run your own breeding program. 
Some achievements require you to cheat or spend lots of real money."
17779,I enjoyed this way too much. Send help.
17780,Was fun until I lost my save file.. Don't feel like trying again after losing so much progress.
17781,"Updated:  Old review below this comment.  If you build a ridiculous number of power rooms, then you can fairly quickly recover from god-like rad scorpion attacks.  Once you get to that stage, the game can be pretty fun.  If you can put up with the frustration of getting there, then it can be fun.

-------------------------------------------

I can't recommend this games for one reason only.  I love all of the Fallout games.  I really like Fallout Shelter with the ability to level up my people and train them.  However, I am actually thinking of quitting this game for one simple reason...  ""Radscorpion Attacks"".  I have 83 people in my vault who are well armed, but one Radscorpion goes from room to room, steals all of my energy (which I had a TON extra built up), kills multiple people, seriously injures a dozen more, goes to random rooms, and is almost magically impossible to beat.  The Radscorpion attack is absolutely ridiculous and needs to be removed or greatly reduced.  These scorpion attacks make me want to quit because they destroy so much of your hard work that it's just not fun.  One scorpion attack kills way too many people, uses almost all of my radaway/stimpacks, steals pretty much all of my resources, and makes it just not fun anymore.  I've had them maybe 5 times and every time they basically destroy half my base and it takes forever to try to recover.  If it wasn't for these attacks, it would be a pretty darn good game that I would recommend."
17782,"This game sinks a lot of your time. Aside form from graphical glithes and some issues with the mechanics, this game works well and is quite fun. I plan on saving a million caps then never touching this game again."
17783,It's Fallout .
17784,"I found myself easily addicted to this game. It's a nice thing to have on and play while watching Netflix. Things are a lot harder if you don't pay to play, but it can still be fun."
17785,"Pros: Fun addictive game and with some patience you can get a sweet vault going.
Cons: You will notice outside the vault the clothes are much more diverse (colors) than what your vault has or you can make :(
The legendary weapons you get on quests or on characters from the Fallout 3/4 games sre not worth keeping, low damage.
Note: You can play this on Mac. Download Bluestacks (a Android emulator) then just download this game from Google play"
17786,"Fallout shelter, in my opinion, is a good game. It's free, and in this case the saying ""You get what you pay for"" is tossed out the window. Yes, there are some flaws, but that makes the game interesting, and it doesn't matter whether you have an IOS device, XBox, or PC, this game is still enjoyable."
17787,GG
17788,potatoes
17789,This game is a cash grab.  If i had spent money on this game the mole rat invasion would still have killed all my dwellers.  This game is alright but i would not recommend spending money on a game that will randomly introduce a disaster and wipe out everything you spent the money on.
17790,"Alright game, but game bugged out and deleted my save game. With 40 hours in it was not worth playing again."
17791,"[h1] Pros [/h1]

17792,Awesome game!!!
17793,This game is hard for me!!
17794,I recommend it viri nais
17795,"i played this game before on android. it was fun, then i tried on steam . . . on the first guide they told me to click hammer and i tried to look over the whole screen to find hammer. then i close the game, create new fault and there it is the hammer come. I just dont understand why i need to put people on living room to make them doing that ""THING"". i mean you can feel love on work place then go to living room for doing that ""THING"" and it make lot easier not to re-assign them to the right place. well this game fun though"
17796,"Very addictive little game with a steep learning curve. Don't rush it and you'll survive.
The customization of characters and your vault is cute, its fun to explore the locations in the wasteland and build your own vault to your own design. Kind of wondering if there are new locations and quests made for this game as it can tend to become a bit repetitive after a while. Still a good game and it's free... what more could you ask for ?
"
17797,"This game is fun but I will list the pro's and con's.

pro's:

Customisable
Exploration
No Lag
Free2Play

con's:
Slow Moving
Time Consuming
No Story

Detailed Review:
I have played 2 hours on this game.  So far I have learned that it is slow moving.  If you have a few minutes to play the game collect your resources and then leave yet to come back the next day.  This game is for you.  I hope this has helped you.  Good Day."
17798,"Well I used to play Fallout Shelter on my phone but all it ended up being is one Deathclaw attack after another so I deleted the game, so I decided to try the pc version and once again once you have a population of 70 everytime you log in it is a Deathclaw attack followed by a Raider attack followed by a mutant attack all right after logging in. It has happened 3 times in a row after logging in and you spend the next 30 minutes trying to get the Vault back in order each time. it also make no difference what level your Vault Door is they just walk right through it so that is a waste of caps to even upgrade it. The pc version will now get deleted since it isn't any fun trying to build up a vault if all you do is rebuild, revive or repopulate after every log in."
17799,"bethesda softworks always make great games (bar tamriel unlimited mmo) with titles like fallout 3 and fallout 4, fallout shelter is a game you are the overseer, build your own vault, gain more dwellers, do quests the possibillities are endless enjoy wastelanders"

17804,"Best free game out there I think, massively addictive, here's a few tips from my experience with the game

You don't need to buy the lunchbox's or bottles you can get them on quests and even more bottles later from bottle when he visits with cappy.

Post some guards with good weapons at the vault door.

If you build a radio room, even if it's for the achievement of build one of every room, don't set it to broadcast to the wastelands it just attracts more DeathClaws and out weighs the rubbish people it attracts.

When you send people out on long quests do it before you exit the game, the time counts even when your not playing.

The easiest way to lift the happiness score of anyone is to send them of for some sex, instant 100% happiness for the grumpy git.

Have fun, I'm sure you'll find loads of other tips as you play."
17805,"I only recommend this if you're bored off your ass and don't have any other fallout games.

Seriously. I launced it, spent a lot of time, realized I was addicted, then asked ""Why am I not playing Fallout 4 right now?""

17806,"Aslƒ±nda √ßok eƒülenceli ve keyifli bir oyun olarak ba≈üladƒ±m. neyin ne olduƒüunu √∂ƒürenip geli≈üene kadar yakla≈üƒ±k 25 saat harcadƒ±m. Daha sonra tam geli≈ümi≈üken ne mi oldu?

Actually it was very funny game at the beginning. ƒ± spent nearly 25  hours to learn what is it , waht is the purpose or items etc. Then what happened? My saved vault folder just dissapeared. If you check the internet you can see lots of people lost their money and save folder at the same time. The game is not stable. I dont know why not the steam cover save files but it's suck. If you dont wantto spent hours for NOTHING dont play that game. I was upgrade my dweller's skills to top but now , i have just dissapointment. FUNNY CANSER thank you steam, you suck."
17807,"I've always detested Bethesda games because they're poorly made.  However, I end up playing them all because of the mod community - they fix all the little bugs and make the experience much more entertaining.  I should have realized that this play-on-the-toilet game was something to avoid because it's not available to be modded.  There is no game I've sweared at more than this, and I've been gaming for a few decades now.  The unwarranted zooming in, the incessant lag (like it needs all the processing power of all existing computers), and the frustating interface.

Once you expand enough, you can't fit your shelter into one screen.  That's not that bad, but when you want to scroll up or down, you almost always click some dweller and move them to another room and that makes something from that room leave.  But wait, maybe click outside the vault to make sure you're not selecting a dweller?  Nope, because now you bring up the display of dwellers outside and have to wait for the animations to load so you can close it.

On top of that, the mouse is not aligned to the rooms you want to drag someone.  You need to try and see it as the silhouette of the dweller, not the cursor.  Otherwise, you're moving dwellers to other rooms or letting dwellers die because the help your sent are picking their noses above the room you actually wanted to send them to.

Combat is a pain.  You characters stand there and get smacked, then play musical chairs as they cross the room to get smacked on the other side of it, and shoot once every 15 seconds, while the enemies seem to attack more often.  Dwellers that just walk around unassigned could give two s**ts about what's happening in that room to help out with combat.

Seems like all outfits work for all males but not for all females.  So that's nice.

Want to do some renovations?  Nope. Even though a neighbouring room is connected to a room and an escalator, you can't remove it.  You'll need to demolish the neighbouring room and THEN the room you actually want to remove.  So that's doubles your cost.  Lovely.

Want to make sure your vault's resources are being collected while you're doing a quest?  Too bad.  Long quests, you'll come finish it to see your resources are in the red.

Storage rooms and living quarters.  Zero point to have them except for increasing your capacity for people and resources.  Empty rooms are always targets for attacks from inside.  But you don't want to put anyone there because you'll impregnate someone and never get XP just to eliminate some threats.  What a nice balance if being a perfectly needed waste.

They say crazy is doing something over and over and expecting something different to happen.  I think I need to unistall this game once and for all before I actually end up in a padded wall."
17808,good to keep you busy for a while

17810,"No need to spend money on ingame transactions! All you gotta do is find some code, input it into your game files and there you go! you have all everything you want in the game right in front of you. Best thing is, is that devs dont care to fix it at all. The game is alright for what is, but the fact you cant just cheat like this ruins the satisfaction of your own bunker knowing other people can just cheat and get whatever progress you done with the simple file decreption of files."
17811,"For some reason it's a real performance hog on the Steam version, play it on Android or the Windows Store. You'll thank me later."
17812,not enough electricity 10/0
17813,"Really fun game, great 'Time killer', and its SO addictive.
"
17814,Great game!
17815,aye
17816,"Nice time waster and building game
"
17817,"This Game is AMAZING
"
17818,Game is decently fun. I played it when it was origonaly on phones. Still pretty good. Just wish it was easyer to make money / caps besides doing wasteland runs and rushing rooms.
17819,"Played it a lot actually and it was fun.
The more i played, the more bugs came to happen.
Now, every time i start the game, all my objectives are reseted."
17820,its realy a good time waster and its fun and dont do survival mode unless you like a challenge
17821,"awesome

"
17822,"Terrible F2P money grab.

You literally sit and wait for shiny things to pop on your screen so you can click on them. Most of the time there is nothing you can do to progress in the game (except pay money to get free stuff).

The game doesn't tell you about important bonuses and limitations so you end up building your base in a clearly unoptimal manner at the start and then you don't have the ability to fix your issues anymore as it's too costly.

The game seems to provide very little in terms of engaging content, it's simply you waiting for things to happen for minutes at a time.

Just get something actually good of the genre instead of this. Try e.g. This War of Mine, Sheltered, Oxygen Not Included, Project Highrise, and the many others out there and you will probably have a better time."
17823,My vault disappeared and all the fun is gone...
17824,Fun game. Was fun watching my characters grow and populate the vault. The quests take awhile so go play another game and come back later.
17825,8/10 would play again
17826,the game always makes my dreams reality and it will make yours reality
17827,Cool game !
17828,Doesn't appear to be any different from the mobile version. Still formatted for touch screens... and it's supposed to be for PC?
17829,kinda boring but good as mobile game
17830,Crash....always crashing....
17831,"Might be.
Ocassionally.
Not that bad.
Meh."
17832,Sitting around for hours waiting for stuff to happen is simply terrible...
17833,"Game breaking Save game corruption bug. 1 crash and all your grind is gone. steam sync wont recover it. dont waste your time, good luck"
17834,time waster... just what I needed =)
17835,easy flow and nice to relax and play
17836,"spent tons of time in-game, opened it today and crashed at title screen...steam crashed and logged out, restart and *poof* its gone from my library and so is my vault.

what a load of *****************************"
17837,"it pretty moist
"
17838,"I have still no idea why have I played it for so long. 
You think it'll get better with time? You are wrong."
17839,"great game 
"
17840,"This game is good for people who want a game where you start our small, but keep expanding. It also makes for a good timekiller, and it can be addicting. Even for people uninterested in the fallout series, like me, this game is fun.

Of course, no game is perfect. And this game does have it's flaws. For example, not many disasters happen. It's not that common for let's say, a fire to start. And even if one does, it's for absolutely no reason. But apart from those flaws, this is a good game and I recommend you give it a try. Also, a free fallout game? Yes please."
17841,Just trash not fallout.

fun time waster..."
17843,Fun game
17844,"Great game.

7/10"
17845,good game but the time it takes to do things is too long
17846,"time waster. lol . in 120 H game play, u will start to boring . but mostly its very fun to play and customizing ur dweller"
17847,"Very Rewarding and not to often do you come across a free 2 play where the materials from micro transactions can easily be obtained in game to the pace of benefiting only the most ADD fallout fan, think this is a fun addition to the universe and curious if it involves any Easter eggs"
17848,10 / 10
17849,good fallout 4's worrkshop is vault build  <3
17850,Better than Fallout 4
17851,"Good port of the mobile app. Gets repetitive after a while, but the missions add some variation to the game."
17852,Just like the mobile version but In my opinion a bit better since the mouse allows for more control.  Fun little mindless game that is a nice fallout fix.  It is free to play and doesn't push BS microtransactions. 7.5/10
17853,Good option to play when you are bored
17854,"Great game, but it needs like a family tree system. I dont want my vault dwellers to start banginig their grandmas or smth..."
17855,I love all of the Fall Out games. This is a cute time killer.
17856,"This is a great time waster game obviously based in the Fallout universe. I have better unboxing luck in this game than TF2, I got a legendary Hardened Fat Man in my 2nd lunchbox. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) After that I got a legendary cat in my first pet crate..."
17857,Better love story than clash of clans <3
17858,"I had the game, loved it. Was playing when my computer accidentally got turned off, got my computer on and the game uninstalled and erased my vault file. I know have to start over, very frustrating experience. Game is decent.

update i found a way to get back my lost file, and unforuntely all the different methods didn't work. the las method is too unistall and reinstall the game and have your backedup files loaded. I hope this works otherwise I'm not starting over"
17859,"The addition of quests has made this game much better than a mobile port.  That being said it is a very easy game, just a time consumer.  If you love the Fallout franchise you will enjoy the humor and easter eggs."
17860,edves megstamiausias
17861,"Good game, but crashes delete your save game."
17862,"Really really fun game. Its Micromanagement to a whole new level, sprinkled with a little Fallout spice. Fallout Shelter puts you in the position of an Overseer controlling your very own vault. To me, its a very awesome experience. Even I introduced this to my friends and they all enjoyed it. The rewards system is great, the loot system is great. And also, learn to have self-control. You can play this game and have fun with it without spending a dime on it. Even I didnt spend money, and i still had fun, had some good loot and enjoying the Fallout Shelter experience."
17863,"You are the overseer of your very own vualt, now do your best to help it grow and keep your people happy and...... alive. :D

The game can be very frustrating at times but its very rewarding when things go well for your vualt.  Patience is key.

Nice looking game, good sounds and music etc.  I give it a 7/10.

"
17864,"Game developers are sadists. This is proof. The game is too hard and you waste your time collecting resources instead of building.

I lost 5 people from a radroach invasion. An unnaceptable loss in this game because if you lose that many then you can never recover. You might spend 24 hours recovering from that kind of loss but then you'll have the chance of losing even more and I'm not going to waste my entire life on this fucking stupidly designed game. This game goes at a snails pace.

Sure it has great graphics, great mechanics and great items. But it all takes too long to get those items. You might spend a week entirely focused on this game and get nowhere.

Also the game severely restricts the amount of people that are coming into your vault so you can never grow your vault at any speed at all. It does this in various ways. it not only stops completely the influx of new people into your vault after you make a new vault but it also gives you stiff penalties towards trying to create more people through reproductive means by having such incredibly long waiting periods between conception and birth and then adulthood.

The game goes far too slowly. I was hoping that it would be something like Sim Tower but it is not and it is a painful game to endure. Its not worth my time and concentration.

You also need to be focused on the game nearly all of the time, you would be able to watch a movie but then you'll get distracted and if you don't pay enough attention your people get killed off by some raiders or a radroach invasion.

Too much of a time waster. If you waste 8 hours of gameplay per day on this single game then you are an idiot that is throwing his life away.

The game developers are money hungry fuckwits that want you to perpetually buy in game content and you need that in game content to get anywhere."
17865,Too simplistic and boring. I think it's mostly made for children below 9 years of age.
17866,"Much similar toward the gameplay of ""Tiny Death Star"", lovin' it since I installed this game! An unique way to enjoy such gameplay with a smart outlook of concept rooms, highly recommended!"
17867,"A free game is a free game, but you often get what you pay for. 

A lot of the game's design choices are about grabbing more of your time, and it offers to exchange your time for your real life money.

There are F2P games that are more fun and aren't as aggressively trying to take your money.

Also, the game runs when your not playing it, so unless you plan on playing it daily you're going to come back to a vault in dissarray."
17868,I am telling you now: if your like me and had only played the crappy mobile version THIS VERSION IS 100X BETTER!!! It has everything the mobile version has except that it runs better and doesn't crash! I love it!
17869,"This game is a good game. But there is one key reason why I cannot recommend it. 

The bugs. Mainly the game breaking bugs that take away all of your progress. I have encountered a few where my Objective Progress would be inexplicably erased. 

But most importantly, twice now I have encountered a bug where the game would crash, and all of my data would just be erased. I lost the 4.99$ I spent on it and nearly a week of progress. 

If Steam refunds me my 4.99 I have spent twice, then I will give the game a recommendation. 

Cause its a fun game. I really do enjoy it, and I want to recommend it. But the fact that the game can crash and all of your data goes away... 

It is why I cannot recommend this game."
17870,Great time waster
17871,"This game is maddingly frustrating, and even if I was paid money to play I would not do so."
17872,"*starts up game* 
*collects resources*
*deathclaw appears*

happens everytime..."
17873,"Great game for an easy casual night ....Or so I thought. At first this game had me playing while i watched some anime,then id play during dinner,then i'd play more while watching more anime.Well that was a mistake because in a matter of one episode my tidy little vault got over run by radroaches and all my dwellers died. 11/10 would neglect agin."
17874,Addicting & manageable once you get established
17875,Its very fun
17876,"Fallout Shelter prevails where Fallout 4 Vault-Tec Workshop failed.
Take on the role of an Overseer and look after your dwellers, go on quests, protect them from danger and have fun whilst doing so.

Totally enjoy this game, have done so since the Mobile Phone release! <3"
17877,"Great game, lots of fun. Spend 15-20 minutes each day, set everything in motion then go play something else. It's quite a bit deeper than it seems at the start.

One drawback I have seen many people post is the corruption of their save file, then they lose their entire game. Here is a post to not only show you how to play, but how to back up manually so you never have to worry about losing everything. I have not had the problem, but I do back up weekly because it takes seconds and why risk it?"
17878,"So freaking addicting.... 
Perfect game to jump into for few minutes few times within a day. Can be easily and patiently played without microtransactions."
17879,"I absolutely love Fallout Shelter, the only thing that I don't like about it is that it has recently crashed and now won't even start up. Does anyone know how to fix this? Bear in mind, I've already tried validating the files and uninstalling/reinstalling the game."
17880,This is a great game and i love playing it.
17881,"after 70hours playing this game i can finally give my honest review



great game, if you like to wait.
no need for buying things with your own hard cash, if you're patient enough you'll get anything you want.
great time waster.
great f2p game.
10/10 will check the game again in 12hours for another quest"
17882,It requires you play it every second of every day!
17883,nive game tho!!!!!!!!!!!
17884,"This game has a save game breaking bug, you¬¥ll loose all your progress. No way to recover it since the files will be gone from your computer and the instant you fire up the game without no knowledge of this it will sync and is gone forever.

There¬¥s no mention of this on any review, but you can find thousands of people having this issue on the forums and on the internet and Bethesda keeps ignoring them, on a game with payed content."
17885,"I can't believe how many people actually seem to like this game. What do you compare this to?

The main mechanics is about either waiting or spending real money to skip waiting and getting right to ... more waiting? 

Milking the Fallout merch, are we, Bethesda? Seriously: this is embarassing. Is this the way you're going to do business in the future? 

As a sincere Fallout Fan I hope this game was just a one-off.

0/10"
17886,"its.. addicting.. must.. play.. again.. and again...

btw.. its nice bethesda!, simple game, average mechanism, good reward system, and last but not the least.. i still can do other thing while enjoy playing.."
17887,A simple game but with some complex game mechanics. Damn I'm addicted to it already!
17888,"Fallout Shelter
Mh what can I say about this.. I had this game on my Mobilephone, on my Tablet and now on Steam on my Pc and Laptop.
I've allways loved this game it sure is timeconsuming but its such a nice game to get time over with, and it had the Fallout feeling I adore.
I heard about this game first before Fallout 4 came out and I was like.. I wanna have it, so I tried it. I was really far in the game suddendly my game kinda lost all its progress and I never touched it again since I've spent so much time to get that far so I was like mh F*** it and I left it there to dust.
Suddendly I heard: ""Fallout Shelter ready for Windows 10 gamestore!"" I didnt think much about to get it but I wanted to try it and suddendly there comes Steam, I was online roaming around doing some things and then I see a friend of mine playing ""Fallout Shelter"".. at that point it was clear, I NEED IT AGAIN! and thats what I did and still play now.
Its a free game where you CAN spend money in, or youll just take the time and wait its not like you cant wait for something to finish in 4h, you dont need to buy Nuka Cola Quantum in the game because you can get them normaly in the game.
I love all games of the Fallout Series and even this simple one is great, so its a 10/10 for me but you should plan lots of time in this game like in all Fallout Games.
In the meanwhile when you ""wait"" just open the game later again and it should be done I open it in the morning and once in the evening thats more than enough. 
(Also you should know some about the Fallout history to understand certain questions which will be in the game but pshhht)"

17890,its fun playing once you reach a stable state in game i had fun loved it
17891,"It's free and No need to spend money u also go to max level easily with 16.3  hours .
"
17892,"I started playing this because I was under the mistaken assumption it provided unlocks in Fallout 4. It does not, if you have the same misconception.

So, why the negative review? And the answer is that the game uses tedium and enforced grinding as a gameplay mechanic, and it doesn't have to.

The game concept itself is novel enough, and if you like the Fallout universe, it's pretty cute. It's simple, but it was meant for mobile devices, so that makes sense. Build a vault, manage your settlers, fight baddies for loot, rinse, wash and repeat. All of that is just well and dandy.

The problem arises from the fact that there's basically no ai, and everything is AGONIZINGLY manual. Resources got produced? Gather those suckers manually. Loot got found? Gather that stuff manually. Danger at the vault? Manually tell people to go help. And then go to the next room when the danger spreads, rather than remember why they were sent. Ready to give birth? Not until the Overseer delivers your kid themself. It goes on and on.

It's micromanagement without depth, which means that it's just a chore, at the end of the day. Well, that and waiting. The combat system is 95% waiting, and not whilst the app/game is closed; sit there, and watch healthbars slowly fall, hoping you'll get a crit and somethingf to do.

And then they hit you with the paid content to make things quicker, easier, and more automated. You literally pay to play less, and be bothered less. Nothing against paid content, they have a right to make money from their work. But paid content should give you more of the game, not less of the annoyance. Top tier weapons? Just less waiting in combat. 

You can  bypass the whole process by not playing it at all."
17893,fun game !
17894,i poor not able to afford fallout4 so i play the cheapo fallout
17895,"Im tied horrendusly on if they should be letting companies post android/IOS games on steam, as wierd as it may seem to me it is free so I suppose I can not complain to much.

The game itself gets repetitive quick. Pay wall isn as bad as other games, but it is there. Over all: was fun to mess with for a few hours but then I deleted it, more or less exactly what I did with the mobile version (There is no diffrence)."
17896,its awesome
17897,"Not bad.If you have lots of time to kill,you should try this game.But,because this game is endless,you'll feel boring after a few days."

and hope after changin pc i dont get any other player experience, losing game data :)"
17900,"A great game for anyone whose desperate for a sense of achievement, but can't be bothered to focus or posses any sort of skill.

Enjoy your life as you atain a false sense of achievement from numbers getting higher and higher, whilst you litteraly do the same thing over and over again, but this time... the loot is LEGENDARY!

So put on those nostalgia glasses bois, because it's got the Fallout franchise attached to it, and therefore it is awesome!"
17901,"For a free to play game its nice to not be force into putting money inside the game .... I appreciate that its has been made where everything can be gotten by effort and time... Dont buy in this game you do just fine without taking shortcuts...Being its a ""free to play game"" its does have bugs .... I reconmend not buying inside purchases in the event that your game is deleted money will be wasted ...... Otherwise this is a fun game for anyone with the time and patients to monitor it on regular bases"
17902,"At first sight looks like game is very easy and not so interesting and not so challenging. But, if you are starting to play it a bit more seriously ( I'm suggesting you to play this game at least for one or two weeks, because not all the features will be available in the beggining), you will, see, that this is not so easy to find right balance between production rooms and produced resources, to keep this balance after surviving disasters. Also you will have dilemma - to send your dwellers our in wastes or to missions, or to leave in vault to produce resources or to increase their skills by training...
About the story in few words - action goes on in post apocallyptic world, where people are living in underground bases called vaults. You are in a role of Overseer"", who is in charge for their people. You are planning development of your vault - building rooms, assigning dwellers to produce resources, sending dwellers to missions or just to explore wasteland. All this will be very familiar to those, who already played any of Fallout games.

Give it a try and enjoy it :)"
17903,"Game keeps crashing. I built the overseer office and the game crashed trying to go through the quest tutorial. Was able to send my dwellers out but the game would not recover from the information/tutorial screen that blocks all interactions with the vault. Had to manually close the game and lost my progress. Also sometimes when loading a vault, the number of caps, cola bottles, and the hammer for building new vaults is missing. Have to reload the game and usually resolves but nonetheless irritating. Great game otherwise and I spend hours playing. Do wish there was a timer for when a woman will give birth."
17904,It sucks ok. It just does.
17905,Nice game :)
17906,I love the fallout universe and fallout shelter is a great mini game everyone should try. Now I fully understand what social experiments Vault-Tec Corporation were conducting :D. I would love if they add more stuff and to the game it is really nice.
17907,"It's a pretty good game ,but after you are going to spend some time in this game ,you are geting bored."
17908,"If the hours I've clocked up don't tell a story, then hopefully this review will. Actually I highly suspect the hours I‚Äôve put into this game say less about FS itself, than it does about me. At least this recent addiction seems a lot less harmless then spending time at the Pokies or a Casino, though I do think FS uses some of the same cues to draw the players in, sounds, colour and constant feedback loops. The promise of ever better loot is also in line with a game like DIablo mainting that just another 5 mins addiction.

 I originally played the Android version and whilst designed as a mobile game, I found the screen size to be an issue, especially on a phone, though also on a tablet once your vault reaches a certain size. This was also a problem when selecting vault dwellers on the touch screen and led to much frustration accidently dragging dwellers between rooms. Thankfully not really an issue with the Steam version
. 
If you have played this on mobile then it's more of the same, just easier to navigate. The gameplay is pretty uncomplicated. You will be spending most of your time playing a lite resource management sim with some RPG elements. Different rooms you build provide resources such as the cafeteria, food, or nuclear reactor, power.  Each room can be upgraded and must be manned by vault dwellers. Each room type is also based around fallout SPECIAL stats such as Strength for power or Charisma for the radio room. Assigning dwellers with high points in the respective stat for each room decreases output time and lessens the chance of a catastrophic event such as a fire in that room.

Aside from the vault and dwellers management you can send dwellers out to the wasteland to collect Caps or junk, weapons, armour etc. Junk is used for crafting ever better items including some which requires you find the recipe first. Dwellers can also be sent on quests. A party of up to 3 can go on adventures allocated through the ‚ÄúOverseers Office‚Äù finding ever more loot and gaining experience points to level up. As this is a free game there are time constraints applied to everything. As an example it may take you up to an entire 24 hours (real life time baby) to reach a quest location. Nuka cola can be used to skip these restraints, though these are scarce. Nuka cola can sometimes be earned as quest rewards or once Bottle and Cappy are unlocked via one of the aforementioned quests trees, randomly provided during visits from the duo to the vault.

 Of course you can also purchase Nuka using your real life money if you desire and don't have the patience to wait for the meagre supply in game. Your hard earned can also be spent on things like Lunchboxes (another scarcity in game) that give out random items from Caps to Legendary Dwellers.

 By no means are you required to do so to win, it's really up to you if you want to line Bethesda's pockets further or not. I did indulge in a few lunchboxes and Nuka Cola bottles early on to speed things up, but now that I have a vault nearing the maximum amount of dwellers allowed, I have found through a combination of visits from Bottle and Cappy and from questing that I have a near constant supply of both Nuka bottles and everything else.

 As far as free game's go this is not a bad little game, if a somewhat casual in gameplay as one would expect from an experience built for mobile gaming. Still there is plenty of fun and some depth to be found so I recommend it, especially to fans of Fallout."
17909,"So far so good! I've played 12 hours or so of it. It's fun to do on your spare time, haha. I'd recommend this to those who like this type of games."
17910,"13 long and hard hours I grinded this game for. I had some amazing dwellers, high damage rare weapons for everyone, I had almost finished a very rewarding quest and things were beginning to look up for our vault.

In 30 seconds, my utopia was destroyed. Everything that I had slaved over 12 hours working to build to maximum capacity had been ripped apart like a deer to a hungry pack of lions. All that work, all that time, all of it lost.

And some would think, ""Wow, was it deathclaws? Did another nuke happen? Was there some sort of virus?"". 
No.

Do you know what it was that my 37 dwellers couldn't defend against?

A few fucking mole rats.

GG Bethesda. Rot in hell."
17911,This is a very nice game for free.
17912,"As someone who got their work done super early in high school. this was my life on mobile
not a game you would want to 24/7 grind but a awesome and fun game



10/10 would call black baby poop stain again"
17913,get this game on google play for mobal devices it is good but not on pc. it seems like they tryed to hybred it for xbox/pc in a half ars fashion and it is glitchy AF.
17914,"There is something addictively fun about this little game. The missions and random attacks keep the common building mechanics from becoming overly repetitive and I find myself checking on my Shelter at least once a day even on hectic schedule.

Like most games of this nature, there is a store for real money purchases, but it isn't needed to compete with the game. I have made only one purchase, the starter pack, but it was more to show the love for the game than any need for what was inside the purchase. We need to support little free gems like this. Worth your time, give it a try!"
17915,"Yea, I could never get this game to work, it would just load a blank window, but i could hear the music."
17916,"its a good game if you like real time games.

the only thing i would recomend, after playing the mobile version, is an option to give stim paks and rad away to all dwellers. after a dweller got radiation poisoning in my mobile vault, all my dwellers got sick. when i tried to give them all rad away, i would notice that the first person i gave rad away too, would be sick again from being around other ill dwellers. i had like 60 dwellers, so thats alot of rad away and stim paks to give."
17917,Great game to pass time.
17918,"This is a great mobile game that somehow works better on a monitor instead of the small screens it was made for. It has micro transactions, but they are useless and can be ignored."
17919,epic
17920,Nice game but I want Turkish language support in the game.
17921,"Pretty fun when you start playing it like any other mobile game but other than that its a mobile game just ported on to steam. Filled with little microtransactions that are generally useless if you just play the game for a good amount of time. I typically just leave the game on and click on my resources once in a while and do quest when the timer is up and I can do them. Most of the hours I have on this game are AFK hours but overall its an alright game, but if you have better games to play, go play them."
17922,"A great way to pass the time, it's fun, controls and sounds are ok, for those who enjoy fallout from a conferred.

Like every ""free"" game, there is something going to take a lot to unlock or make you spend $$. Otherwise it fulfills what it promises.


um √≥timo jeito de passar o tempo, √© divertido, controles e sons s√£o ok, para quem curte fallout valer da uma conferida.

como todo jogo ""free"", tem coisa que vai demorar muito para desbloquear ou fazer vc gastar $$. tirando isso cumpre bem o que promete."
17923,"Strangely addicting. It was hard to resist the urge to buy up lunchboxes, pets, mr. handys, etc. for the first week or so but I'm glad I did. They don't offer anything you can't get for free just buy playing the game. There's no sense rushing things, just take it slow. It's important to keep in mind that this game is meant to be played when you have nothing else to do. Pop in, manage your vault, get out and do something else. Eventually you'll realize your vault's not going anywhere and you'll get bored. Until then, it's fun and doesn't cost you any money."
17924,"Deathclaws killed my vault. As my dwellers died, so did my interest."
17925,"The game was very fun when I started.   I even spent money on the in-game starter pack and some additional lunchboxes.  Then after 75 hours invested, my save file was corrupted and deleted from the cloud.  When I e-mailed Bethesda, I got some pathetic auto-response email that redirected me to a website that suggested I load the save file from the cloud, and that apparently that was an option in the game.   Turns out there is no option to restore my save file.  So 15 bucks down the drain.  Also found out that this is extremely common, has happened many times to other people, and not only is nobody receiving refunds, but also no solution has been implemented to prevent it from happening.  First time Bethesda has ever lost my respect."
17926,Very nice game! Keep it up!
17927,Guys. I spent like 40 hours playing particularly one Shelter and after one PC's  turning off l lost my safe. What is wrong with the developers? If you have any chances your PC might off sometimes - don't you ever play it.
17928,good very good
17929,"Fallout Shelter: Free
Fallout 3 GOTY: $19.99 (Not Optimized)

17930,"+ Good time waster or something to have open in the background.
+ Mircotransactions don't make the game unbalanced.
+ Is Free! So thats a reason to try it.. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
+ Runs well - Feels like it runs better than the mobile version but does still have the odd bug here & there.

- When playing in windowed mode I've noticed that the cursor doesn't line up properly when trying to drag dwellers around; can get annoying.

17931,"Fallout shelter is a really fun and addictive game which is also free so I would definitely recommend it. From what I've played, it is very enjoyable and I constantly find myself checking my vault daily. Overall, I don't have many complaints, I guess the rushing system can feel to be rigged at times (sometimes you fail 10 in a row) but in the end it doesn't really affect the gameplay very much. This is one of those games that just sucks up your hours without you even noticing. I would definitely recommend Fallout shelter (it is free and a quick download).

8/10"

17950,"+ + + BACKUP YOUR SAVEGAME + + +

If you don't do this, you are liable to lose your progress, and with it any purchases you've made. They will not apply to your next new game.

https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Fallout_Shelter#Save_game_data_location
https://archive.is/OIEcf

1. On a PC, open File Explorer and find the Users folder in the root directory. Now pick the folder with your username and then Appdata and Local. (As an alternative, just enter %LOCALAPPDATA% in the address bar.)

2. In that Local folder, find FalloutShelter, and alt+click drag it to c:\games or the desktop (wherever you like) so you have a handy shortcut next time.

3. Now ctrl+click drag the FalloutShelter folder to an empty spot in the panel you're in, or to where it says Local in the address bar above. Windows will automatically number your new copy so it doesn't overwrite your previous backup.

4. If you don't want incremental backups cluttering things up, make a folder called FalloutShelterBackup, ctrl+click drag the FalloutShelter folder there instead, and confirm the overwrite.

5. Double check to be sure you haven't accidentally moved the savegame folder instead of copying it.

Since this is a recommendation, I'll note that the game is better than it looks. What starts out with the appearance of timer & boost sleaze eventually gains momentum and offers plenty of actual gameplay. Most of this is a Tiny Tower style job optimization exercise, made more interesting with buffs granted by gear and the fact that the characters level up. It's ruined a little by lack of a good overview for juggling gear, but that's an artifact of the mobile format and forgivable since this is mostly a very good port.

Not great, but also not the ugly cash grab it might appear to be. At least... not yet."
17951,Awesome game to complement the Fallout universe! 5/5
17952,Why?
17953,Excellent for a Free-to-Play game. This is a great twist for those who love Fallout. This is so far the best Free-to-Play game I have ever played.
17954,"Good game to have when your main gaming PC is dead and you want to feel Fallout.
Attack speed is ridiculous. 10-15 seconds or so before each strike with a pool cue, for example. Remember to bring shitloads of stimpaks on quests because of this.
Don't mind the minimum requirements, the Q9550 can run Fallout 4; I'm running it fine 1366x768 on a Celeron N2840 with onboard graphics and 4GB DDR3."
17955,"Hey everyone, I dont really ever do reviews but honestly i waited a long time to try this game. Honestly I was pretty surprised, its pretty damn fun and in my opinion captures the spirit of Fallout pretty damn well, The Quests make it more enjoyable and they are loaded with loot, the outfits the weapons etc. It's awesome to recieve loot that you recognize from the franchise etc. Anyway if you are interested at all I would say try it, it's free and you can simply uninstall it if you dont enjoy it.

I hate waiting.

I like it when you can get everything from the store with old fashioned grinding.

I hate pay to win.

I like it when I can 100% achievement a game.

I hate cheaters and when developers dont do enough to stop them.

I DETEST Legendary Dwellers, took me 2 weeks to get them all.. and I had to pay for the last 3... uuugh!!!!

I got this to 100% and uninstalled it right away.

17959,"My vault is not a shelter, everyone died when the first deathclaws arrived."
17960,"Wow. A Bethesda cash grab game on Steam.  Ok game to pass the time with, but then I can do that on my Iphone. Play the game cause it is a Fallout game, but I wouldn't spend any money on it. 6/10."
17961,"This game is quite addictive!

Your mission is to be a vault overseer - this means that you have to keep the people inside (vault dwellers) safe from raiders, radscorpions, ghoulers, etc. You also have to make sure you have enough resources, such as power, water and food.

By assigning a male and a female inside a living room/barrack, you can reproduce popularity inside your vault until you hit the maximum capacity, which is 200 dwellers.

Alongside this, you have to assign the correct dwellers to the correct room by looking at what stat the room acquires and what the dweller has, this is called S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats.

S = Strength // Power generators and nuclear reactors
P = Perception // Water treatment and water purification
E = Endurance // Nuka-Cola bottler (makes both food and water)
C = Charisma // Radio studios and living quarters (radio studios make people in the wasteland know about your vault)
I = Intelligence // Medbay and science labs (these makes ""Stimpaks"" and ""RadAway"" )
A = Agility // Diner and garden (these produce food)
L = Luck // Increases chances of rush attempts succeeding

Having the correct S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat dwellers in the correct rooms makes the room finish producing resources faster.

You can also, when getting the command center, go out in the wasteland and do various missions which also gives you some items like bottlecaps or wasteland junk which you can make clothes or weapons out of.

[b]SPOILER ALERT[/b]:
[spoiler]There's also a ""mystery guy"" which appears when you hear the piano sound playing, he will be hiding in random locations inside your vault for about 10 seconds, if you click on him you will get a random amount of bottlecaps. Try to navigate towards the sound as it is a hint of where he is.

[url=http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cf896781d49b9368a878696008ef5aa0.jpg]He looks like this. (CLICK ME)[/url]
[/spoiler]

Resources will slightly be used when you exit the game, pregnant women will start giving birth after around 3 hours, even if you're away. Kids will use plentyfull of resources until grown up, so if you do not have plentyfull of living areas or resources, you'll have quite a bit of problem. You can also not drag them into a room of your choice, they will roam around your vault as they see fit.

Also, some quick tips: Do not randomly place the rooms, if you have 3 rooms right next to each other, they will merge and produce more and can store more resources, 3 is the maximum merge limit. Also, if you upgrade one room, you might not be able to merge another room to it. And you should only upgrade rooms when they are merged together, it's cheaper. You should also equip all your dwellers with weapons, so they can defend themselves if neccessary. You should upgrade your vault door and assign 2 dwellers with heavy armor and the best guns in the vault entrance.



I really enjoy playing this game, it also has steam cloud, but I don't think you can sync it towards your phone/tablet, I might be wrong though.

The best part of this game is that it's free, huge thumbs up for Bethesda.

I give this game a 8.5/10.

Have a nice day."
17962,Bloody addictive. Never thought I would be so attached to a mobile game.
17963,you fail every single rush from 28 to 62% and succed when you got 80% chance of failure.
17964,"*Note: My playtime on steam does not reflect the many hours I played on my phone.

So I saw a lot of negative reviews on the game and I do understand where they're coming from. 
BUT, to be fair this is originally a mobile game and most of the problems that are pointend out come from the fact that it is a MOBILE GAME...

To get straight to the point do I recommend?

Hell Yeah! If your a fallout fan and hungry for some extra fallout content definately go for it. Its even FREE.

And really by all means try it out cause its not a bad game at all. If you've played mobile games before you'll aprreciate that it is one of the gems in a shit storm that is the google play store...


For a more detailed overview, here are the Pros & Cons

Pros
-Its Fallout
-Decent vault managing content.
-Nicley polished Fallout style graphics.
-Lots of loot and equipment.
-Not a pay to win.

Cons 
-Quest lines can become repetitive quick.
-No strong story line or dialogues treading in grey areas.
-Difficulty drops pretty fast.
-Can take long to perform upgrades or crafting.

Now with all of the above being said...I'd like to point out that some of the Cons are quite inevitable for a mobile game.

""-No strong story line or decision making dialouge""
For this I have to say I do agree that life or death deciding moral decisions will spice up the game a lot.
BUT, you have to take into account that this is F2P. People spend cash to get there rare equipment or dwellers.
Imagine the shit storm the devs will have to go through confronting angry players who had there cash items disappear to an ingame event... 
(The main Fallout games can give you difficulat decisions cause you have a savegame to fall back too. Plus if you fuck up you can always start a new game with out having to pay extra for anything...)

""-Can take long to perform upgrades or crafting.""
ITS A MOBILE GAME... guys... people who play mobile games usually don't spend hours to play a game in one sitting. They usally play while on break, while they go home, during lunch, etc...The hours don't matter to much because they spend most of that waiting time to do what they do. Plus the game isn't a public service. The devs need money to create new content. Upgrade speed boosts are a good way for them to monetize the game.
You can hate on microtransaction all you want but, this game has one of the more reasonable microtransaction schemes I've seen in years for a mobile game... Plus for Fallout Shelter the paying is really just for time reduction. There is no PVP elements so your not missingout on anything even if you don't pay.


""-Quest lines can become repetitive quick.""
""-Difficulty drops pretty fast.""
These two I actually have to admit are probably the biggest flaws of this game. Even considering the fact the devs can't really throw you difficult decisions, the questlines available are very bland. Just to be fair I think the devs decided to add the quest content as an afterthought because it dind't exist at launch.

For the difficulty, it gets really easy pretty quick. The raiders/death claws/roaches become easy to repel soon enough and serve nothing much than a minor annoyance in the later game. Occasionally fires might breakout in the vault but, that is also a minor issue. Until the devs introduce some new threats and new buildings, after you build up your vault(100+ dwellers) it will get repetitive.

Thats pretty much all I have to say about this game. It has a fair share of flaws but, if your a Fallout Fan its deffinately worth checking out. It might serve as a good filler in between your long journeys in the Mohave and Capital Wasteland.

8/10 will send dwellers out again for population control."
17965,I played for 2+ hours in a row then logged off. When I was back it crashed me when saying fallout shelter before I even click enter vault
17966,"I remember hearing about Fallout Shelter shortly after it was released. Since I didn‚Äôt own a smartphone at the time, I ignored this game. Then, last year during the summer, Fallout Shelter came to PC via Bethesda‚Äôs launcher. Gaming companies have been releasing their own game launchers, like Steam, and they‚Äôre getting numerous, but I love Bethesda, so I installed it.

I played the game for a little while. It seemed like a game that contained a lot of waiting. It‚Äôs easy enough to play and the game does a great job of teaching you how to play and providing some great tips. Dwellers can act on their own, but it‚Äôs up to you to manage them. Each dweller has their own S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, each of which is good for something. For instance, you‚Äôll want to put your dwellers with high Strength in your power production rooms. Perception is good for water production, while Agility is good for food production. Intelligence is good for the medical room that produces Stimpaks and the science lab, which produces Radaway. Charm is good in the Living Quarters where you can breed your dwellers.

You can ‚Äúrush‚Äù rooms, hurrying their production of a resources. If it goes well, you‚Äôll get a bonus and caps, but if it fails your dwellers in the room will have to deal with an incident. Before rushing, the game will tell you the percent chance of an incident, so if you find that percentage is high, then it‚Äôs not a good idea to rush the room. The room can catch on fire, or creatures can appear such as Radroaches, Mole Rats, and Radscorpions. If your dwellers get hurt, you can given them Stimpaks. If they die, you can revive them after the incident. If not taken care of quickly enough, the incident could spread to other rooms.

In the meantime, there are chances that Raiders, Feral Ghouls, or Death Claws could invade your vault. Once they get in, it‚Äôs up to your dwellers to fend them off. These enemies always work their way from left to right on each floor, going to the next floor if not defeated in time. If you have a Mr. Handy, it will fight them, too, if it‚Äôs on the same floor or you can drag it there. Mr. Handy can also help protect your dwellers during an incident. It can be destroyed, but can repaired for 2,000 caps.

Rooms can be upgraded and expanded. Most rooms can be three room wide and it‚Äôs a good idea to make your rooms three wide. This means that 6 dwellers can fit inside. More dwellers working in a room, means it can produce quicker. You unlock rooms by getting dwellers. Once you get closer to 50-60 dwellers, you‚Äôll be able to build new, better rooms for resource production. I have three of each, I removed the old resource rooms.

There is a limit to 200 dwellers in your vault and having that many can be a bit of a nightmare, especially if you have not yet made every room. The rooms that train dwellers S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats are really good. You can train a certain stat in each room and rotate dwellers in and out. There‚Äôs also a Barbershop for customizing your dwellers, which I‚Äôve made, but haven‚Äôt used. Also there is a theme workshop that lets you create themes. You‚Äôll find theme recipe pieces on quests. It looks like the themes are Brotherhood of Steel, Railroad, Institute, and Minuteman. 

There are a good number of quests to do. On most quests you can have up to three dwellers, but some quests only allow one, or have other various requirements. They can be difficult so it‚Äôs a good idea to bring your best dwellers with the best gear and the max amount of Stimpacs and Radaway they can carry (25) from the Vault. You can get a variety of rewards such as weapons, outfits, pets, lunchboxes (which can contain anything), junk, and more. If you fully upgrade the Overseer‚Äôs Office, you can have three groups out on quests at once. If your dwellers die and fail a quest, you can retry for a cost, or revive them and send them back home. I have a few certain dwellers I send out on quests. Many quests take some time to reach and get back from, but you can speed this up by spending Nuka-Cola Quantum, which is a very rare resource.

Speaking of quests, there‚Äôs a Bottle and Cappy quest line and when that is completed, B&C will occasionally visit your vault, raising happiness. While they‚Äôre exploring your vault, you can click on Cappy for caps or Bottle for caps or Nuka-Cola Quantum when they‚Äôre dancing. This is so valuable that I highly suggest doing this as soon as possible.

I like this game a lot more than I thought I would. I think this is about as much fun as another Fallout game. I‚Äôve clocked 67 hours in Steam. I‚Äôm not sure how many hours I‚Äôve spent playing on my phone or via the Bethesda launcher. I‚Äôm often surprised that this is a free game, you don‚Äôt always expect free games to be so good. You can spend real money to make in-game purchases, but I haven‚Äôt found that to be necessary."
17967,"Nice game.
Gets a little boring and repetitive.
Makes you wait a lot so that you buy ingame cola with real money (speed things up). 
I recommend because it's free, I don't recommend that you spend money on it.


"
17968,"Game itself is fun, but purchases have been a nightmare. First went fine but then everyone since has not gone through. Steam has been helpful with refunds which is great, but I would much rather have the items."
17969,It is a really good game you can get real lucky in the being but I wish there was a online mode were you can interack with friends or randoms
17970,"Buy it.
Be a good dweller. 
Please do it for the vault.



-The Overseer."
17971,"Here is my review of Fallout Shelter.
(Sorry for any typos, my native language is'nt english).

(It should be noted that i've played this game for about 5 years now, on my phone). 
First of all it is a great game (Considering its free), thats not only funny, but also a cool concept, for a game. 

GAME INFO:
You are the overseer of your own vault, and it is your job to gather food, water, electricity. You are also tasked to provide safety for Raider, Deathclaw and Goul-attacks. And you can create a lot of weapons and armor in the 3 qualty-classes Commen, Rare and Legendary. The game it self has some pros and cons (obviously), here are the following:

PROS:
+Funny.
+Time consuming af! 
+Lot's of different thinks you can do in-game.  
+Lot's of weapons and armor to craft and skavenge. 

CONS:
-The missions in they game can become very repetitive and boring.
-Savefile-bugs (Haven't had the problem myself though).
-Time consuming af! 
-Maybe a bit more building space.

SO SHOULD YOU PLAY THIS GAME, YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF?:
Why not, ! I hope my review could help you :D

My rating for this game: 8/10*
======================"
17972,"its aight, good for passing time"
17973,"- It's easy
- It's fun
- The addition of quests adds excitement
- It's free!

If you're looking for one of those games where you know you're wasting time and don't really care, this is it. The best part honestly is that it's free and still completely playable WITHOUT microtransactions."
17974,this game is great but it brings you in the game so you keep on going on and if you don't have a mr handy then your food and electricity will go down so your dwellers die :(:(:(:(:(:(::(:(:(:(:(
17975,A good way to waste time.
17976,A good way to waste time.
17977,"Great game, very few things that i have a problem with. I play a hacked version on my xbox, and my vault never leaves me with my Phone. All hail the mighty vault, May Vault Boy's light shine upon you all (Far Cry refrence)"
17978,"Quite addictive! Get it, you won't regret.
"
17979,Nice
17980,"Most idiotic base building game I ever played. Constant clicker to get resources. Or have a robot to collect ELECTIC current somehow.... LOL Or gather water. If not then magic player controled cursor can gather that stuff. This game was only made and is only for gathering money from unpatient rich casuals. No logic in this game just plain simple clicker.
Also this game is lazy made. It is going crazy if peripherals are pluged in. It suggest that user should UNPLUG all stuff just to play this freaking game!!!
I play games like ETS2, Spintires and car games also space sim games so I have to unplug 2 gamepads, joysticks and steering wheel just to play this lazy made piece of turd. BRILLIANT!
What lazy moron did that game?!"
17981,Played this game for about a half hour wondering when it starts to get fun.
17982,"The Good.
-Free to play
-Nostalgic 
-Relaxing

The Bad.
-Micro transactions seem to be required for some achievements to be completed in less than hundreds if not thousands of hours of game play. 
-Difficult to get stop raider attacks achievements because all you see is deathclaw attacks once into the game a bit. 
-You will never make the top lists on the leader board if you care about that. For example, I see people with over 600 rooms. You can‚Äôt have over 600 rooms, there is not enough space.

Overall, very good free to play game!"
17983,"Fallout Shelter Logic:

Evacuates everyone from another room to living quarters. Didnt see there were a man and a woman.
Five minutes later i realise i have 2 pregnant women.

10/10 would evacuate again."
17984,"I tried it on both steam and android, however, after been played  for less than half an hour, i figured out that it isn't really up my alley."
17985,"I would like to post a review on the game, except it wont actually work. I run the app, but all it displays is white screen. All the sounds are playing, but i cant actually play it. Tried it in compatiablitly mode too- windows 7 and 8. (Im running 10) if anyone could help that would be great. until then i will be listening to the sounds of what i persume is the start menu."
17986,i like it

17990,"WARNING: This game is really really addictive. =D

Seriously, even though I just casually checked my vault every now and then I found myself piling up a bunch of hours in this game rather quickly.
Great game, lots of fun, and very much playable and enjoyable without spending any money on it at all."
17991,"within 2 hours i have so far
-had a black guy wearing comedian clothing and a toga wearing woman be the duet duo of recruiting people via radio station
-another guy be the genghis kahn of the game and bear me 20 offspring for the vault (not too sadistic i made sure it was the same woman)
-That being said, the octo-mom of the vault by literally birthing out 20 children
-sent in seal team 6 (with 3 people) to kill both normal big sized, and big radioactive cockroaches using nothing but pool cues
-sent a couple of people out to explore and had to spend a ton of money (in bottlecaps btw as is fallout currency) to revive 3 of them.
-said people brought back a ton of guns and junk
-turns out said junk could be used to craft makeshift weaponary and  clothing
-accidentally set fire to most of the rooms as well as cause a roach infestation
-built my underground metropolis from a generator room a diner and a water filter room into bigger rooms with areas to make health guns and clothing
-all this in the span of 2 hours since the game runs on a real time system, so fucking around with your computer clock makes it go faster

Overall, it's a great f2p game with microtransactions that help you progress faster, although you don't need them with clever planning and playing time traveler for a bit.
10/10

update:
-armed every survivor to the teeth with at least a 5-7 marksman gun
-unlocked every room
-reached 120 vault dwelers
-had to remove my broadcast station because there was too many vault dwelers not enough room or resources
-had to build 5 more storage areas to house all my guns and junk
-have a trio that does all the mission (lab assistant, wasteland dweler, and a power armor rocket launcher leader)
-it has literally only been 2 days

-its been 4 days now
-maxed out all dweler lvls
-unlocked every room and theme
-deathclaw raids dont get past the 4th room, rarely 3rd
-fuck the jersey mission"
17992,more fun than fallout 4
17993,"stupid game is too fun for no reason. been playing it all day since I downloaded it. hope i don't get on it tomorrow.
gotta give it a thumbs up.."
17994,.... GG
17995,Really fun time wasting game
17996,I liked this game for  my andriod  phone but it doesnt run for the PC so uninstall it is..
17997,Surprise.. [b]Good one![/b]
17998,great game 8/10
17999,Excellent game play.
18000,wtf my game progress went back to lower level
18001,This is a great game except everytime I get to 30 dwellers the game uninstalls itself and I have to start over >~< it's so angering! Others are having similar issues so why hasn't this been fixed?????
18002,"Actually a fun, non-money-grabby sweet little free to play. Too bad it eats your savegames when it crashes."
18003,"Excellent game. Its a management simulator with a Fallout theme to it. There are multiple types of buildings you can make that provide resources such as food, water, and electricity. There is a population management component to it and you can send people into the wasteland to look for goods. There are quests that provide more to do as well. You don't have to pay to get the full experience of this game, but it will speed things up."
18004,"PROS: Noice

CONS:shit"
18005,Very Fun! Bringing Back The Fallout 4 Feelings!
18006,"I used to play this on my phone. Now I play this on my PC... is that progress, or regression? Anyway, I want all the Steam Achievements because I am a completionist noob (Oxymoron intended). 

The quests actually make it feel like there is a purpose to the game, shame about the microtransactions, but I can forgive them as it is a free game and was ported from mobile"
18007,RIP my time.. :D
18008,Great game. Played it while it was on iOS as well as on Android and still enjoying the game in PC.
18009,wasted my time very well yah
18010,Good game üéÆ
18011,"It seems Bethesda have their hearts set out on making video games that are so unhealthily addicting now that as soon as I get my hands on one of their franchises, I just cant stop playing it. Such is the case with their new titles Fallout: Shelter and Fallout 4. I could spend entire days binging these games like a leech sucking blood. Fallout: Shelter is a special case, with a real-time game mechanic that engages the player to continue populating, building, and supplying their vaults with occasional yet repetetive situations requiring vault dwellers to defend the vault, may it be fires, radroach infestations, raider attacks, or deathclaws, there will always be something to keep you on your feet. Once acquiring enough dwellers, you are able to create various rooms to further improve the expansion and happiness of the vault. The game also features a working offline mode achievemnt system, for those who dont have the time to play online to ensure their vaults survival, and is easy to micro-manage with or without transactions for a smoother experience, and does not recquire constant interaction which is VERY helpfull for busy gamers like me."
18012,nah
18013,Very slow and better suited to mobile but the quests are ok. The rest just doesn't seem to have much in the way of game. If your a fan of the series you will like it but other wise steer clear.
18014,"Well it's my first game review so i wanted it to be special. Englisz is not my primary languege so I apologieze to grammar 3rd reich. My vault 379 was pretty happy place. All of the dwellers had their place in the world, workers, fighters, even a couple to reproduce. One day one dweller came to my vault. He would prabobly be trained to work and live the rest of his life with nonconstructive activities. But he was special. He looked just like me and had similar name. So... I put him on charisma training to be a fuck boi. I levelled his charisma to the max and put him in the living quarters. I took all of the female dwellers firstly to the barber to make them look like some kind of kinky prosstitutes and give them a pretty attractive nickname (roxi, belle, that kind of stuff). Then i dressed my dweller. Usually it was a pope outfit, sometimes the king, major and even ninja once. He fucked whole vault except my famous couple. But he wasn't satisfied. So i put couple to the living quarters and made them fight for the girl. My fuck boi won the competition, so i made the other guy watch his girlfriend getting fucked by a persone in church's head outfit. Now my vault is full of his daughters and he still wants more, he's still horny and im sitting here wondering..."
18015,Fun little F2P game.
18016,"Such agreat fallout version, if bathesda can add co-op online player help player, not mvp, if mvp exist too many cheaters will take over just to win against other player, its better to have co-op, explore together, and if we can have another vault (in which we 've found an empty vaulted ta hauntedby monster and we clean it and take over the vault)
and how about making a traps before the monster get into our vault, and maybe we can make safety guard outside the vault.
and if oline co-op is added maybe we can send reinforcement for example.

anyway the game is great awesome, cool. maybe theres other great features to add in the future, if that so we cant wait it XD."
18017,This game is awesome. It's very fun and if you put time into it you don't have to spend any money. :)))
18018,"[h1]Excellent for the one handed[/h1]

I recently spawned a small human, and have found myself sitting at my PC for hours with one hand available and the other attempting to rock an angry gremlin. One hand is useful for a wide variety of things - but most games seem to be rather bias in favour of two. In short, I've been playing a lot of Fallout Shelter this month because I can do it with a single mouse click. Since I've managed to rack up 60 sleep deprived hours on the game, I figured I'd write a review. I'll make it brief, do you know how slow it is to type with one hand?!

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Only requires one hand.
[*] Free to play that doesn't require you to spend money to build an awesome vault.
[*] Very extensive amount of gameplay, way more than were on mobile on release.
[*] Quests have interesting and amusing lore / dialogue.
[*] Very polished, everything is well implemented and balanced.
[*] Addictive.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*] You'll lose a great deal of time.
[*] You can give your vault a significant boost with spending money - but you don't need to.
[*] Extreme micromanagement might get boring fast for some.
[*] Addictive.
[/list]

That's all I'm gonna say - you don't need a breakdown of what it is and how to play it. If you're bored and have plenty of free time, enjoy micromanaging and want to save the lives of gingers from a cult in a quest, this is the game for you.

[h1]It's a free to play game well implemented, in a lore-rich universe. Really no reason not to try it and see if you enjoy.[/h1]"
18019,Pls activate to my libary :) :D:D
18020,"Never underestimated the game. You will slowly sink into your role. Yes, as a blonde wearing blue jacket working as vault manager. 

Your mission is simple, build a good vault, max it, try to get everyone happy when coming here. 


Great 2nd graphic, great game play, will be a bit repetitive after long time (the quest place and travelling time sometimes is too long)
You have special dwellers, pets, weapon, uniforms. From crafting your vault's interior design to your dwellers haircut. It is really train your micromanaging skills.  


*You will really hate Raiders, and that two annoying dancing Bottle and Cappy"
18021,"At first I used to play this game on phone and connect it with my smart tv. Now, I don't need to."
18022,"I was originally going to write this game off as just another mobile microtransactions cash grab, but Bethesda has surprised me with this one. There is absolutely no reason to use their in game store, the game does a pretty good job of standing on its own two legs. The game starts with a decent enough tutorial, and there is no penalty if you want to reset your vault because the drops weren't terrific. Base building is fun and addictive, and the downtime that plagues mobile games (which is how they rope you into buying things from their store) is actually pretty acceptable, given that they throw in the Mysterious Stranger (who gives you caps if you click on him) and the Disasters, which often require your attention as you send your Dwellers to fix whatever the situation is.

Quests and Objectives are nice, as they grant tangible rewards, unlike venturing into the Wasteland, which is dependent on the Explorer's Luck Stat (which is likely to be low, unless you got a good Dweller from the Lunchboxes). Even though the Wasteland's rewards are RNG dependent, they do exist, and a good haul (especially the outfits) can really bump up Vault production.

I think the only real gripe I have is that the bedrooms have a nasty case of catching fire (and not in the good way) which is odd to me, considering I've stopped placing people there since I built the Radio Room. Maybe it's just my bad luck, but I'd like to find the idiot who keeps leaving lit cigarettes by the bedsheets.

All in all, I fully recommend this game if you're looking for a free time sink. And like any mobile game, I also recommend staying the hell away from the in game stores. If you can do that, there is literally no reason I can think of to pass up this game."
18023,"[i] We gotta fun little game here that will please some and frustrate others [/i]

IT IS NOT PAY TO PLAY, THE GAME GIVES YOU GOOD OPPERTUNITIES TO GET THE IN GAME CURRENCY IN GAME, any real money purchases are a personal descision, not a necessity... it's suprisingly good considering what it is, and especially good considering the price..."

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Can be annoying if unlucky (repetitive deathclaw attacks)
- Expensive microtransactions
- Can become repetitive

Personal Rating: 4/5"
18027,Fun game but don't pay for it.  You really don't need to put any money in and you will still be able to see all there is to see.
18028,"kinda reminds me of The Sims in some way, would definitely recommend it to everyone ^^"
18029,"Surprisngly great game for a mobile port and its free too, the micro transactions are non-intrusive so you can play without having to spend anything.
I have yet to encountered the file save corruption bug mentioned in other reviews, but be aware alot of people seem to be experiancing that issue.
It's also a shame they didnt add much music to the game from thee fallout game series."
18030,"Fallout Shelter is a click game simulator where you are the controller of a Vault-Tec Vault. At the start of the game, you are randomly assigned a number from 000 to 999. The number you receive will the vault ID and will determine the attributes of your Vault, similar to the lore in Fallout.

The goal of the game is to grow your vault and keep your population happy. To grow your population, you need to increase the space in the vault, grow more living quarters and feed them. You feed your dwellers and keep them happy by maintaining Food, Water and Power supplies. To maintain the supplies, you need to build Diners, Water Generators and Power Generators, man them and click on them to collect the resources (just like Farmville). 

As your population grows, you can unlock other facilities such as the Storage Room, Medbay, Science Lab, Overseer's Office, Radio Studio, Weapon Workshop, Weight Room, Athletics Room, Armory, Classroom, Outfit Workshop, Fitness Room, Lounge Theme Workshop, Game Room, Barbershop, Nuclear Reactor, Garden, Water Purification, Nuka Cola Bottler. As you complete objectives, the game will reward you with lunchboxes which is basically a bundle of Caps, Item Cards and other equipment.

Conclusion, it's just another P2W click simulator. Best price is $150 for 1000 Nuka Cola. You can safely ignore Fallout Shelter without missing out on anything.

Note: I am surprised that Bethesda Games would fall prey to the P2W business model. 

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Simple to Pick Up
It's easy to learn and you can just pick the dwellers and hover over the respective rooms to see if it's a + or -. 

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. Pay To Win
The grind currency are Bottle Caps and the cash currency is Nuka Cola. 1000 Nuka Cola for $150.

2. Click Farm Simulator
No auto collection. Remember to log in to click-farm.

3. Can't Remodel
Want to demolish a specific room? It can't be connected to 2 adjoining rooms, otherwise you're screwed.

4. Caps?
Seriously, caps to build a room. I mean, there's a limit that the imagination can stretch to."

Though the waiting part of it is an annoyance, but it is expected sense this was a mobile game, it would be good if the time of waiting on here was reduce.
But it is a pretty good game and have change a lot, last time I seen this game, it didn't had pets, crafting rooms and quest. It wouldn't be everyone cup of tea, but I recommend giving it a try."

Club Penguin Replace?"
18060,"Vault techs most neferious vault ever.

So nearly gave this a thumbs down, this wasn't a vault tech vault I said, where are the experiments designed to drive residents insane or make mutants? Then I saw it all, a front door designed to protect against nukes, that falls to raiders with swords. Random fires and infestations of molerats and radroaches. A strange man that appears without opening the vault door and explodes into caps when hit. The ability to breed a single woman into creating a whole army of new residents with random men (sadly not yet with her own children (you would think that would be right up vault techs street considering)). Forcing pregnant woemn to vault hobby horses and climb ropes for endless hours until the stress makes them give birth.

No this is vault tech being more sadistic but subutle about it and as overseer it is your job to have a hand in this madness, working from behind the scenes invisibly moving people around so they work in areas they are no good in and watch as their happiness drops then force them to work harder to set rooms on fire and force them to battle OP radroaches.

Or you can make them happy and put them in the right room and enjoy highly productive vaults. But where's the fun in that?

Pros
Free to play
Good time sink
Reasonable learning curve
Good selection of missions
Naming the dwellers what you want

Cons
OP Radroaches
OP fires
Raider attacks that break down the vault door.
Lack of early information on room fusing bonuses.

Overall: 8/10 good game reminds me of Xcom EW but with less aliens."
18061,"This game is very addictive ... I am so tired from impregnating all my women LoL I need a freaking break my PePe is going to fall off :)

This game is amazing, simple and fun, hours of your life can waste away without knowing it.

I recommend this to all fallout fans and if you‚Äôre not one you will still enjoy it ... its FREE !!!!

Have fun enjoy your day & Game On

18065,"I came back to this game only recently after playing it on my mobile for quite some time when it was released. I quit because there wasn't enough content. By introducing Crafting and Quests the game is interesting again.

About the payed content: The prices aren't as high as in other games and paying is definitely not necessary for progressing since you get some Lunchboxes and Nuka Cola bottles by doing said quests for free."
18066,"game is fun at first once ya start to feel safe the game gets super unbalanced, mole rat attacks that take 5 minutes to kill, the all powerful deathclaw attacks that kill your vault"
18067,WTF the game is good but some shitty scripts i was returning a explorer after 2 days he was almost home and I though why not let him explore while i sleep sence he will be back in 1 hour. but when he tried to return right after hitting explore it's fucking 20 hours. wtf eplane the logic other than you're making America great again and hireing shit programmers.
18068,TBH...I would rather just play Fallout 4.
18069,"meh mainly a big time killer and pain number, 7/10 gets boring fairly quickly though..."
18070,I really like this game I played this on a lot of other devices. It acts like every other one but it glithces more. Its weird that I had 2 feral ghoul attack in a 2-3 min peroid and i had 41 people and a lot of room so i dont know why. But other wise i like this game and it dosen't subtract a lot of reasores when i get out the game.
18071,"i love the game . i wuold recomend this if you sre 9-24 or if you just like this type of game
"
18072,I really like this game!
18073,Recomendad√≠simo
18074,"Terrible, Just terrible, why does this exist? first off, the whole ""manage a vault"" idea might be a good idea on paper, but when executed like this, whats the point in playing? the game is super tedious, for example: get on, collect water, collect power, food, and repeat. sure there are quests, but thats pretty much what this game is, going on quests. and what makes the quest system so bullshit is that you have to wait for your ""dweller"" to travel to the destination, this can take from 30 minutes to 12 hours. which is ridiculous.

    the worst part is, there are microtransactions. you have to pay in order to get these cola bottle things. you can however, use these to skip the quest waiting time. its pretty obvious bethesda made this game for money. 


      Honestly, the game lacks content and replay value, I downloaded this on my phone. (thus explaining why I have so little time on this game) go ahead and download it. its only really good ifyou have nothing to play."
18075,Don't have a gamepad. Looks like I need a gamepad. Can't get camera to move anywhere. :P If someone can tell me how to turn off gamepad controls I will give this a thumbs up. :P

18077,"The only F2P game that does not squeeze you for every dollar in your wallet while still providing a well designed, balanced and entertaining game! Using the great setting of Fallout, this Vault Simulation game will provide you hours of casual entertainment while making your close relatives tell you how they would never live in a world ruled by you, despite having provided 100% happiness to hundreds of dwellers!"
18078,"Definately a game that Fallout fans will enjoy, It's mostly about strategy; organising your power, food, water and even which vault dwellers work best using their atributes. Overall, it's a pretty decent game and I would recommend for those of you avid Fallout fans out there like me. :)"
18079,"Takes awhile to set things up to a point of where you can really move around and do the things that you would normally expect such as quests and grinding. 

Fun for passing time, but the slowness of the game can be boring at first. 

My vault dwellers randomly died once my population hit 40 people and bumped all the way down to 16, I don't know if this is a glitch or not --perhaps there are lifespans but I doubt it."
18080,"Great game, may be my favorite free to play game."
18081,Great little Game But if your pc crashes or powes off mid game there is a good chance you will lose your vault and all the ingame purchaces. 50+ pounds gone due to a power cut. steam support says contact Bethesda and  Bethesda support says contact steam. by all means play it but dont spend any money you dont mind losing
18082,"~ 9 / 10

Fallout Shelter! What a magnificent little mini-game to have on the side. If you, like me, love Bethesda's Fallout universe and like to have some of these small mini-games on the side of your other games. I can highly recommend this as a good option! It has a nice way of scaling, options to explore and collect in the Wasteland and to create unique places for your dwellers to live!

Great mini-game!"

18085,"Well, it's fun up to a certain point where it just turns into grinding for resources. The quests do add a fair amount of entertainment. What killed the game for me are the Deathclaw attacks. They are 'a tad' too frequent.

If you enjoy a daily bit of resource management, give it a try. Just don't spend money on it."
18086,"
If the end of the world is like this, the adventure is just beginning  :)"
18087,fgfgfgfg
18088,"Well actually I didnt expect it to be this good. After playing for a few hours straight, thinking I would've gotten bored after 10 minutes. You can cheat pretty easily but its not needed, by playing enough and playing smart u can build everything up pretty fast ! 


I for sure recommend this game, solid and not too much pay to win :) ."
18089,"I'm really half and half about this. I feel like the game itself is good but its too much of a mobile game in the sense that it is P2W and you really feel that too. Progression is heavily timegated, leaving you attempting to speed things up without spending money which fails a lot, I think the fail % and luck on dwellers seem to go up against each other rather than it being the fail % that matters if that makes sense. It's addicting but it's heavy P2W but the issue is if you spend cash you feel no progression either because in these type of games there's always either too easy or too hard, which is done on purpose to make you spend money.

It's a good game but like I'd rather spend 2$ on it than play another cash grab game."
18090,"1.) What this game needs is an ""Loot All"" Button. (This function will use all ready dwellers, meaning if they have a level up or the powerplant is ready to harvest or a skill up - it will be collected automatically.)
2.) Option to speed and lower the combat speed... x2 x3 x4 And why not make Pets loot corpses and items? (everything is so slow i wanna throw up watching the slowmotion animations.)
3.) Proper way to select and send units to specific designated areas. (Managing 50+ dwellers slows the actual gameplay down even more - i suggest a proper interface to send dwellers to either other stations or directly into the wasteland - the finding the dweller ""game"" is getting tiresome or selecting them via the wheel -> looking for them - selecting them via pixel grafix is hard enough but then dragging them to the wastelands for a mission... its funny the first 1000 times but after that it just encourages me to throw up)
4.) Inventory management is terrific - first you loot thousands of items - some via chest you cant automatically sort out and others like rare pistols - yeah i need them definetly so i can throw that crap away - scrolling and sorting weapons, outfits and junk should be made much easier and quicker. For example there could be an option in the inventory to always automatically sell specific outfits and weapons. And for selling junk i recommend a function were you can set ""how much junk"" you want to sell... selling one or all is pretty lame....
Overall an addictive, fun and lame game. Those freemium games were you can purchase items which speed up the gameplay are as pathetic as one can imagine. Especially if everything in the game is about slowing your gameplay down... I hate the guy who invented that ""freemium - ingame speedup purchase"" addtition..."
18091,"I can't play for more than 5 minutes without it crashing to desktop.

Getting really frustrating!

It got better though..."
18092,"At first this game was fun, I got 42 people lving in my underground bunker and things were going great. half of them were lvl 20+. Then the pig attack happened and ONE pig killed off all my lvl 20s and about 10 lower level characters. Everyone had a gun and shot the pig until they died. I cant see wasting any more time on a game that puts an indestructable pig in your bunker. I shot it about 100 times and it seemed to not take any damage at all. If this is a bug, its the bug that made me delete the entire game. NO THANK YOU. What a waste of time. fix your damn pigs."
18093,I do enjoy it more as on the phone but you shouldn't let it open without paying attention because than it will fail.
18094,"This game didn't transfer over from phone to computer very well. The viewing window can't be resized to have it used next to other windows, but you still need to micro manage it constantly to get it anywhere and if you have it open and aren't paying attention the resources can't auto collect so all of your dwellers will start dying very quickly. 

It was ported to computer, but no work was put into making it work for computer."
18095,"
Pros:
 Nice little game.
Build rooms and build more
Establish your vault

Cons:
Micro transactions are so annoying.
Once you get to 14 dwellers it's a while before you get more.

OVERALL:
7/10

USE A TRAINER AND HAVE FUN!"
18096,"I want to give them a bad review becasue I'm raging against them right now.  But I'm raging because I've been playing so much for the past week that I eventually wanted to start a new vault so I could apply all the lessons I learned.  And I have every dweller with a weapon out exploring and I'm not really keeping the lights on when I build the Overseer and it kicked off the F)#&(#$^$&#(ing tutorial mode you can't break out of that forced me to send a completely unarmed and unarmoed dweller on a quest.  Not rememebering how long it was, I only sent one with my only packet of healing sicne I really was barely keeping the lights on, and I can't complete the turotial quest.  So I was forced to strand a dweller 10 hours away real time, and to spend another THIRTY hours on the f#*&*&*(*ing quest if I want it sicne it's 20 hours away and they gift you enough nuka-cola quantum to chop off the 20 hours.  And that's real money to purchase.  Oh, and really it's more then that because 10 hours puts him well past sleep time, so I'll lose even more before the quest is available, let it will occupy my ony quest slot for a long time.

But really, I'm only raging because I'm having such a good time with this game and am anxious to get my new vault going that I regret the time the dweller is gone instead of just walking away and coming back later.  It's a lot of fun.  But it's got all the little addicitions of ""play another minute"" in spades, so watch it eating your time."
18097,"needs a way to make caps at the beginning
."
18098,"cool
goot o pass time"
18099,Great game! loved playing it on the tablet and love it even more now that i can play it on my computer in the back ground
18100,"great game, good time killer. would suggest to anyone."
18101,"very good game, its free and fun to play."
18102,I CANT STOP PLAYING!!!!! so good
18103,"move from smartphone to PC. just that. No Different. 50/50 
change to thumb up if dev got unique update on the future."
18104,Jaun of my favorite games to pass  the time and grind for hours. It has many unlocks and lots of content XD
18105,"I realy realy like this game to play inbetween others. but i just lost my vault. idk what happend , might be my mistake maybe i dident turn on cloud save or whatever. but its gone. and this should not be happening...."
18106,"This is a recommendation with reservations. The game is free to play and I've played it for a number of hours so all good so far. Watching your little dwellers level up is good fun too but then it all gets a bit repetitive and the micromanagement elements start to become tiresome. I have a ton of training rooms in my vault and have ended up scrolling around to see where there is space once a dweller has maxxed a specific skill. This gets a little dull particularly when it dawns on you there's not much else to do except send dwellers out on increasingly similar missions which result in rewards that, after a while you don't really need anyway. Every now and again some radscorpions or raiders tear up the place but the biggest inconvenience of these invasions is that you're usually in the middle of rearranging your dwellers. I go back to this game for a few minutes a couple of times a day and it passes the time but then, I am currently working in Qatar, one of the dullest places on the planet so I have an excuse. If you don't have an excuse you'd be better off taking up golf or something."
18107,"Oh what could have been.  Anyone who starts playing this game is immediately going to enoy it.  It's fun, fast paced, and you even get to care about the little characters you have in your vault.  With that said, it's a freemium game, and although there's nothing inherently wrong with that the point of problem is that with most freemium games they don't want you to lose out on anything, they just want you to spend money.  So here are the main problems I have with this game because... well, there's absolutely nothing to lose except time.

Cons (rather than do the positives, which are numerous because of the joy that Fallout brings to so many fans, here are the negative aspects that make the game totally bland within one week)

 - Never lose a character - someone die?  no problem, just give 'caps' that are so numerous you'll never have to worry about risking someone

- Missions - your characters train so fast that missions are ridiculously easy, never having to worry about not making it back

- Family unit - It's a free-for-all when it comes to making babies.  Trust me, you'll start out worrying about the right people making babies so you don't confuse blood lines, etc., and it's pointless.  No penalties for anyone at anytime making babies with whoever they want.  This could have had a ""Sims"" feel to it and at first I thought it was going to but it doesn't.  It's just, 'hey, need a kid, throw any two together, no worries'.

- Weapons - Good weapons are easy to come by, no work required to get them.

- Bottle & Cappy - these little idiots NEVER STOP showing up, it's every 3 minutes it seems which is so annoying

- Stranger - the Stranger shows up, and at least you have to find him, but he also shows up every 1 minute it seems and it's pointless to keep worrying about him, he just becomes annoying

- Can't attack other vaults - this could have been a great aspect to the game if they included it... but they didn't, so enjoy clicking on your factories every minute and going on a mission every few hours because... well... that's about all you get to do.

I've played for 87 hours, and at first it was a lot of fun to build up my little vault, but it's just in the way now.  I actually sit down to my computer and think about the game and then kind of dread having to do all the little mundane things.  In fact the only reason I've continued is that I hope updates are released or something to make the game more fun for a computer gamer, but alas this game is a tablet/phone intended freemium game, so the game that I want isn't going to be released or 'updated' any time soon.  Oh well... I've got board games to make anyway."
18108,"It's been a while since I played a simulation game. The first vault I built I expanded too quickly (too many inhabitants and too many rooms) and it is suffering for it (not enough weapons to fend off intruders and constant issues with power, water, food, the 3 resources you should have plenty of or your vault will fall apart). And money as well. My second vault fares much better, and leaves me actually time to go questing and exploring at a regular basis. 

I have not had any issues with ""save"" of the shelters thusfar, as I read that some experienced in the reviews of this game (although it appears linked after investing rl money in the game, which I have not). I'm also glad to see that after being away for 8+ hrs I didn't return to the vault finding all my dwellers dead, I feared a bit for that, but even though time does not come to a halt upon logging out (babies are actually ready to be born by then, or children grew up, both taking a bit of time) I can start collecting all the resources. So that's pretty cool. 

I enjoy the micromanagement (keep tabs on every inhabitant and keep them happy, have enough resources, enough medpacks, weapons, ... ) and the diversity of things to do. There are various ways to earn money (caps) in this game : collect resources, explore, quest, catch the intruder in the brown outfit (not easy, he announces himself with a sound and another sound when he disappears). The caps I received for his capture varies. The most I ever received was 4800ish caps. Which is very welcome in my first vault as an unexpected attack of rodents wiped out almost my entire vault, meaning I had to resurrect them all (the price of ressurection goes up with their level). And this is best done asap, as any surviving inhabitants will get very unhappy very fast (they don't like bodies in their vicinity, and can't say I blame them).

I suggest not to leave the game running when going for a stroll or doing something else meanwhile as things tend to get out of hand then, such as low on the main resources or an attack (and when you don't monitor those, casualties tend to fall unless your habitants are well armed I suppose). You can save and go to the main menu, or save and exit. Talking about saving, I tend to save now and then, not that you can load the game from the last saving point, but force of habit.

I'm playing the game for a few days now, and see myself doing so for a while longer."
18109,A fun way to spend your time. The perfect game to study while playing. I set up the training and all the time-requiring actions and study for the duration. And repeat :)

18111,"Game inherited a bit clunky controls and interface from its mobile version, but has higher quality textures. I doubt devs will see this, but mouse has two buttons, and it would be great if M1 and M2 had different actions. Just saying.

personal opinion: I like the game as it is, microtransactions or not. I liked it at launch, but my smartphone sucks and doesn't run it well, so when the game was released on PC on bethnet launcher, I thought that I could play it and love it, but it turned out that the game won't be ever released in Russia. Time passed, and the game appeared on windows store, it crashed a lot and I couldn't port my android saves there. Boo for windows store release. And then this came, the Steam release, which made everything right. The game should've been released on Steam in the first place, it makes sence, as Steam has almost everything the game needs - microtransactions, cloud sync, achievements. only one thing is missing: notifications, and that's for good."
18112,"Ive always loved this game on mobile, its just as good on PC. More screen space, and loads alot faster once your vault is bigger. 10/10 IGN"
18113,"Nice time killer, you can keep it underground while you are doing something else and the Fallout vibe is just a plus to me. It's free but can deserve a few bucks just to say thank you."
18114,I love this game it is fun to play when i have nothing else to do
18115,ok
18116,It's a survival and strategy game related to the sims! No wonder why I like it!
18117,"The worst part about this game is the fact it might have been an okay game if it wasn't free to play. The core of the game you play as a vault manager which on paper sounds great to be able to build a vault how you would want while also setting people to do certain jobs and giving them armor, weapons, etc you find on missions outside the vault or craft. 

The problem with all that it doesn't matter when you can simply buy loot boxes which carry armor, weapons, credits, pets, even vault hunters, etc which is way better than anything you can find or craft. Yes, you do earn boxes by doing missions etc which would be fine however If you don't really want to spend your real-world money for the loot boxes or play the game legit you can simply download a save which gives you max boxes.

Yes, It's still possible to play the game legit however because they built it with free to play in mind stuff can take ages even days to unlock things which can be boring. Which is where the need for you to ""buy loot boxes"" comes from to help speed the gameplay up by giving you credits which you may need or weapons or armor to make it simpler for your guys to live."
18118,these mandatory helpful hints are the biggest pissoff and radroachs are OP get 1 infestation that lasts for more then 2 seconds your dwellers are basically dead and not to mention that constant running around not shooting animation yea lots of fun >:l
18119,"Game is alot of fun, 54 hours in and gets more fun as I go, getting more powerful weapons and upgrading your people.  holding off attacks easier, and going on missions good time, free to play.  bought some packs early in game now do not need to because you can get the stuff on missions.  give it a try its free so what can it hurt.  Its one of my i play it everyday at sometime."
18120,i need someone to look into a crashing problem when i start it up it it goes into the loading screen then crashes so can someone look into it for me please
18121,5*
18122,"I like this game
Thank you for your attention"
18123,This is a great game I'm really enjoying the way that it ramdomly assigns characters stats and you have to make due with them.
18124,"sorry, just another Sims game but based in the FO universe!"
18125,literally spent the past day and a half on this......and went on my porch for 2 minutes to check the weather out. 3 out of my 21 dwellers were left...too time consuming for what its worth. if you got extra time its great. if not i dont suggest it. coming from a die hard fallout fan.
18126,"its your typical mobile game
what more do you want?"
18127,"It is really fun at first but after you build most of the rooms and have a lot of dwellers it gets a bit repetetive, I'm glad they have quests so you can explore actually in the wasteland a bit. That's good.

This game is just a really good pastime. I like playing it windowed, with some music in the background and surfing 9GAG or Reddit, it's really fun for that because you don't need to always look at it while the rooms are working and you're collecting resources passively."
18128,An enjoyable time killer. So much better than when it first came out as a phone app.
18129,I really really like this game
18130,Not worth time and effort.
18131,"[quote]Combining banal gameplay mechanics and abuses of the weaknesses of the human mind along with tens of timers and a pay-to-skip business model, Fallout Shelter embodies much of what is wrong in today's gaming industry.[/quote]
Fallout Shelter is compelling and addicting. It draws you in and it doesn't want to let go of your attention. It is cute, has a lot of attention to detail and it is fun. It is also devious, manipulative and abusive.

The game uses a combination of various banal gameplay mechanics:

[list]
[*]Timers. There are timers everywhere. It is the one mechanics that is introduced first and it will follow you everywhere. After a few hours you will juggle tens of timers. 
[*]Clickers. Pretty much all timers must be acknowledged and restarted with a click (or a tap).
[*]Hidden objects. The mysterious stranger, Bottle and Cappy or looting the dungeons are hidden object minigames
[*]Quick-time events are used during fights.
[/list]
These four mechanics are combined so that the game forces you to compulsively check it out regularly for short moments, but if you want to move the story via quests, you must wait hours or even days. These long timers can be skipped by paying real money in what is one of the worst gaming invention of the last years.

There are other considerations for the player: How to lay out the shelter, how to breed and train dwellers, what quests to tackle in which order. These are all hidden behind the layer of the aforementioned juggling of timers, clicking to harvest and looking for hidden objects.

Fallout Shelter not only preys on the weaknesses of the human mind with a devious mix of banal, casual and meaningless gameplay, not only it adopts a business model that goes against fun and fairness, it also represents abuse of the name of an old game series that used to stand for clever writing, branching quests, meaningful choices and consequences and a lot of possible ways to play through the game.

Fallout Shelter is a compelling and addictive abomination."
18132,Very fun
18133,"c'mon try play this game. I was enjoying it so much.

+waste time
+craft and custum your shelter
+looks great
+simple
+free game

CONCLUSION: DO NOT SPEND REAL MONEY FOR THIS GAME (but up to you lol)"
18134,"like this game so much but, a little bit harder than i thought"
18135,"I have just started to play this neat little game and i allready love it.
Everything is very smooth and logical arranged. Nice gameflow and cute graphics.
Also it immediatly soaks you in and the typical addictive feeling, common in such progressive minigames gets growing.

It a really nice freegame, with of course possiblitly for minitransactions, but not in a offensive way.
I totally recommend to check out his game. Perfect for wasting some.

9.5/10"
18136,"The same game on the mobile device with achievements

Good
* Fallout shelter on computer
* Lot of quests
* dogs can be help you
* craft and custum your shelter
* Nuka cola
* not hard to unlock achievements

Bad
* Can't explore the world manually"
18137,"First try: Everyone in my vault has weapons, Constant attacks constant other stuff Mostly gets attacked by deathclaws dies.

great game"
18138,"I started playing this game a little over a week ago and I have 10.5 hours of playtime. 8/15 achievements, almost zero gameplay tutorials viewed.

My opinion of this game is (letter grade and explanation):
* F / Unfair game mechanics
* F / Poorly implemented ""random events"" system
* C- / Game progress is much slower than ideal, leading to too much waiting
* F / Game forces you you pay for in-game currency if you want to progress
* C+ / Many game mechanics are poorly explained, leading to a lot of wasted time/resources as part of a ""learning process""
* A+ / Visual style of game and 3-D effect
* A- / Load screen menus and intro sillyness
* D- / Mouse usability within gameplay (being able to click what you want to click)

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND (not even worth being free / you would have to pay me to play this)

Now before you conclude ""oh this guy just don't like this type of game..."" I actually do. I think the visual style of the game is beautiful and I'm a huge fan of slow-paced clicker games. This game was in fact free to try, but it leaves you with the feeling that someone is constantly nagging you about buying in-game currency to be able to do basic things. The difference between this game and what I would have wanted/expected is like the difference between:

1) Standing in line and...
2) Standing in line with 100 toddlers that are screaming.

If you know what nagging, uneasy feeling I am talking about then stay away from this horrible game. The game did not have a sense of urgent post-apocalyptic building-a-city-from-nothing. It was like struggling to find ways to actually play the game that the developers had not thought to charge for.

This is the end of the review. The following is more specific details about why I am about to delete this game.

Firstly, I don't like Bethesda. I won't go into why, but I think they do more damage than good for the gaming community. I ran across this game several times and said ""no"" to it because of the developer. Nonetheless, I gave it a try due to the visual style and I have a friend that said it was ""an okay game."" I'm not about to read every how-to before playing it, and understand my first attempt will probably not be ideal, but the game has serious issues.

Today I was playing, trying to do the questing as well as explore and keep my shelter slowly growing and dwellers leveling up. The problem I ran into is that the fires/roaches just continue to randomly spawn, even when your not rushing, causing your dwellers, who only some of which are armed, to constantly have health issues, causing your healing ""Stimpak"" to be in short supply. If you then run into the situation where you have an power emergency, you end up having to stack a ton of people into the reactor room and then ""rush"" it. The more you fail, the longer it takes and the worse your percentage is to ""rush"" again.

I found that when it says ""33% chance"" to fail, that actually means 90% chance to fail, and it never changes. I'm not saying that the percentages are slightly off, I'm saying I think it is stuck on 90% fail rate no matter how low the displayed percentage is. I've failed at 30-40% far too many times for this to be an actual percentage. Keep in mine 33% means you should fail about 1/3 of the time. not 9/10, which I was experiencing.

In addition to the ""Stimpak"" issue, dweller death causes the same issue, because you need to revive them, which costs caps, which are always in short supply and are even more in short supply if your dwellers start to die and therefore cannot assist with the gaining of caps.

Hopefully even players that have played this game can understand my frustration by this point."
18139,Fun to mess around on
18140,I need to find a way to transfer my vault from my mobile phone to the computer...
18141,"Free.  To.  Play.

Do not treat this game as a serious representation of the Fallout universe.  But if you love Fallout, you will enjoy all the little references.  Shelter is about as addictive as an ant farm.  Check in on your dwellers once or twice a day, waste a little time, exit the game and go back to more important things.  Let the game go through its stupid timers (or cheat as others have suggested) like any usual port of a mobile game.  Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat.

Atmosphere is cute and comical (even deathclaws) and the script is corny.  There are reviews complaining about unrealistic combat and microtransactions.  Again, this is not a serious game.  And you do not have to (or should) spend a dime playing.

(There was one game breaking bug in the initial version that was fixed by early April.  I've not had issues with the game since though others have complained of vaults getting corrupted or lost.  The only oddity I've experienced is that my gamepad, which Shelter can use, rumbles on occasion though I just use mouse and keyboard.  Not a bug-free game but you get what you pay for.)"
18142,Fun.
18143,Probably one of the most fun free games I have ever played! I haven't got more than 12 hours into the game so I can't comment on the corrupt save files everyone seems to be talking about.
18144,Very fun and addictive
18145,If you like Fallout 4 this is your game :) ! PLAY IT NOW ! It's free
18146,I open the vault I created and then the game crashes.
18147,When you'll understand the game. You will spend whole the life in this game shelter
18148,Family fun for everyone

18150,i love it so much i don't know why so many people complain and get angry about this game *deal with it* atleast be thankful that it's not a pay to play game that it's a play to have fun game

When I say go, be ready to throw
Go! *big boom* *becomes a ghoul*

this game is really cool and is a great game to play when u have nothing else to do
even though all ive gotten is shit luck in this game
still cool"
18153,Really good game
18154,"I really loved this game, when they released it on Android. Then i lost interest after i had 200 dwellers and everyone one lvl 50 with SPECIAL got to 10... Then it was released on Bethesda's private platform on PC, and i imported my saves from phone. I uninstalled the game when i realized that my dwellers are disappearing from my vault. Now it was released on Steam, and i started it again. I enjoyed this game a lot. Until after 245.9 hours of building my vault my computer crashed and this F*****g game rewrote the save file and the backup as well, so i lost everything. Thank you Bethesda! Good job, well played... But at least i can quote now: Dobby is FREEEEE!"
18155,"Good mobile game, after 4 days it gets hard to concerve energy and resources so it does take alot of attention. Fun game for the most part."
18156,"It's better than the mobile version, it's a good free game.
Just don't buy anything since that's a waste of good money."
18157,"Although i do like the idea of this management-game, i stopped playing for 2 reasons: 1st, i got some huge errors trying to turn off Steam as the game kept playing (even after ""save and close""). And 2nd, when i got hit by disasters, the hints that were given were disappearing too fast for me to be able to read them (and i couldn't find if i could somewhere read them again!), so i had no clue as to what to do and i got low on all resources fast because of it... and was unable to recover from it (new disasters coming too fast, perhaps also due to being too low on resources?)... end of game for me (for now, as i understand the game is still in Alfa?) :-/"
18158,Veeerryyy goood  gaaammmmmeeee.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18159,"Piece of crap, if game crashes or you have a blackout, your savegame is gone.

Noone should ever buy quantum\lunchbox, just use a save editor."
18160,boring after 2 days
18161,"4/10 Bethesda just screwed this game up again...

1. deathclaws attack every 15 mins and screw you in the arse and kill all your dwellers
2. quests or objectives are horseshit, i got a an objective saying customize 6 dwellers. so save 10000 caps and buy a barbershop to customize for a pathetic 200 caps
3. the AI attacks are so unforgiving,  i had 1 mole rat kill 6 dwellers who all had guns with damage higher than 5 each and nope, the mole rat won and half of those dwellers were double digit levels
4. it gets so boring, continuously click on the room to get the resources that will not help you cause the dont fill up the stock or storage room at all
5. i sent 5 dwellers into the wasteland and in 2 hours they only found 1 outfit each and 2 guns out of 5
6. you have to customize and select everything and do everything. boring gameplay

suggestions:
1. have a better AI which can give you more realistic and vault progressing quests, with rooms you have or you are so close to unlocking
2. whenever you get a new dweller have the game give them a gun like a bb gun for protection (same as when a child grows up)
3. with the fortified vault door, the max level for the door have a turret that can help you protect the vault and dwellers, its a waste of door and room.
4. have the ability to click on a dweller so they can give you which room they want to work in or if they want to traverse the wasteland.
5. also when you click on a dweller they can give you feedback on what they want in the vault or what could make everyone more happy. instead of just random guessing.

its not a bad game, but it has problems, and even though i enjoy fallout 4 and building games, this game really bores me after a few days/

18168,"If you are a Fallout fan, this is a must have.  It started out as a mobile game and was ported to pc a few years later.  This is a great time waster if you're bored.  There is no endgame.  The quirky graphical art style screams Fallout in a very goofy Fallout kinda way.  This game will run in the background if you log out (quests, explorers, etc. still continue).  But, gone are the days of a random fire or deathclaw attack happening when you're gone, only to find out when you log back in and find your entire vault dead.  Great boredom filler with a Fallout touch."
18169,Its alright. You should NEVER delete your first vault due to the fact that your lunch boxes only give sweet loot the first time.
18170,I played this game on release and decided to try it again because my friend recommended it to me and i was amazed how far and well game has advanced.It is plesant thing to see mobile developer put in fresh ideas and drastically improve game over time you wont donwloading it.
18171,Really...addicting and keeps you on your toes. Just leaving the computer for a minute...while playing the game and something will happen.
18172,"Very good game, Once over 100 vaulties, there's no new rooms to add in. Though I think it would be good to have a cosmetic room, So you can change faces, facial hair and make up."
18173,"I loved this game, until... one day my vault was gone.  Looked on the forums, followed suggestions, but the vault is still gone, along with the 60+ hours and $40.00+ purchases for the vault.  It is a shame, but based on this experience, I can't recommend this game."

18180,"I had played this game on my mobile and it wasn't too great.
I saw it on steam for pc and thought about giving it a chance on my pc and see if it will make the game have a better experience. It sure was. I would say one thing that is lacking is cross-saves between phone and pc so you can do the water the food and the energy whilst gone and bring back your person after so much time from the wilderness without having to boot up your computer just to do it.
Dont let the minutes fool you as i play this offline normally!"

Have that Fallout theme set, it makes me feel to get back to Fallout 4 sometimes and fun to play.

People complain about the waiting time is too long, there's actually a way to speed up the process without spending $ but I think you shouldn't do that, either wait or support the dev first before go down that path."

18185,"Decently fun amusing game, but not the most gameplay heavy game. I find myself opening it, playing for a bit, and then closing it not to long after. Then return later in the day to see whats happening."
18186,Vault dweller no homo pls
18187,This game is amazing but no matter what i always get the most useless people
18188,"Careful, it's addictive."
18189,"This game is prety fun but normal mode is prety easy for me and i need more challange, so i try survival mode.
it was hard as hell without spend any money, but i manage to survive until my vault resident is 44.
my deffens is good, my people is always full HP and my heal stimpank is full 35.
i can survive from ""death claw"" many times its no problem, but i didnt expect the hardest atack come from ""Freal Ghoul"", they kill my dwellers.
usualy they can killed in just 4 or 5 second in the first floor (my best atack and defens floor)
but that day is come, they swarm my vault and my 1st floor only can kill 1 or 2. they proced to the other floor and they still have like 6 ofthem.
so my vault now is doomed.
my conclusion is this game is unbeatable.
Please fix this problem duh == im so sad r8 know (sory for my broken english)"
18190,"GREAT GAME 
Been playing for a year on ios and PC is a bit better nicer graphic at 60fps and Still addicting AF have on both PC and iOS

BIG PROBLEM 
IF this is linked TO YOUR PHONE THIS WILL BE AMAZING"
18191,"Addictive and good fun, though the drag & drop of dwellers between rooms is a PITA and a better dweller overview system would be nice."
18192,relaxing game
18193,"I definitely recommend this game. If you're like me, who used to own the mobile version, but hated how time senstive the game was, the PC version is your solution.
The original moible version was amazing, and i loved it, but if you didnt collect your resources in time, your shelter died out in no time. This PC version, is the solution to this, as when you close the game, it also 'pauses it' in a way where:
1) your shelter's resources dont take into account your time away
2) any quests, or expeditions, continue going, so you can come back after your quests return, and they will be there.
I dunno if this was intentional or not, but i love it.
Besides that, there are some minor performance issues, especially when you try and rush rooms for the first time since opening, but that's forgivable.
I love this, and it will probably remain my favorite tower building, however you call it, game currently available."
18194,"faaaaaaaaaak
"
18195,"There isn't really any longterm investment unless you're a hoarder like me and just want items. Then you quickly realise that collecting items is the only reason you still play this. I honestly had no other reason.

The most optimal way to get into this game is if you play in short bursts. Log in now and then and check on your vault dwellers exploring in the wasteland, do that quest which took your dwellers many hours to get to. When that's over check out and come back later. Otherwise it's just an interactive screensaver I suppose, which can be fine too.

Quests are 'meh'. They're just an excuse to get to see a different location to your vault, but they're not too different visually or even interesting. Combat in quests is awkward as well, you just wait a very long time until your vault dwellers finally attack the targeted enemy. I've read that the attack speed can be increased by upgrading certain stats, but till you get to that point you're spending a lot of time waiting for your people to finally do something. Dialog options, which rarely come up, aren't that interesting either.

It works okay as a mobile port, but dragging and dropping vault dwellers to different rooms feels off. Sometimes you have to hover them over a room above the room where you want to place them to. This gets annoying if you quickly want to move a lot of people to help in combat during an attack. It also seems that its possible to edit save files in order to cheat.

While it is a free game, the lack of any compelling reasons for long term investment kindof defeats the purpose of what I think its its designed for: to keep you coming back every time and eventually spend money. There's not too much to get from this experience considering the combat is so dull, which is one of the main reasons why you'd want to get good gear. The other reason why you'd want gear is for your vault dwellers to perform slightly better in their act of standing around all day to give you resources to tap on. That's it."
18196,"If you've played the mobile version then you know what to expect here. Only gripe I can think of is carrying over saves from said mobile accounts, other then that, a solid f2p game"
18197,‚ô¶
18198,I think the game is wonderful and fun. Neat concept and fun to waste time on.
18199,now i can get achievment on profile for review :D
18200,This game has as much action as peeing in the wind!!
18201,"Good game, played it once on my phone, now it's for PC, can this game get any better... but one problem... when you leave the game after saving, your vault can still lose food, power, and water.... plus the vault can be attacked or have fires.. i found this out after i saved my game and left the game, all my dwellers were a bit fine.... once i came back to my vault the next day, one dweller was dead, plus most of my dwellers lost health, i wasn't on survival mode... seeing the version is version 1.11.1, this needs to happen only on survival mode"
18202,"I want my money back.
Game crashed, can be cheated.
WTF???
How stupid I am for pruchaseing the f**king item!!!!"
18203,"Well, put simply, it just isn't that fun.. Repetitive.  Battles are boring.  Hard to click on stuff.  Other than adding more ""stuff"", it's hard to see what the overall goal is."
18204,"Bottle and Cappie are in another castle,"
18205,"I enjoy playing this game. I believe this was originally a game meant to be played on a phone given its setup. Sometimes upon starting the number for my caps only appears after I click on it and close the menu that opens. The game requires paitence if you don't plan on using real world money to speed it up but it's not unbearable. The speed up or rush option has helped me a couple times when I'm short on power, water, or food.

As soon as you acquire a firearm or better clothing issue it to your vault dwellers.
Rad roaches and raiders will break into your vault. Raiders will steal supplies that you don't get back even if you kill them all in your vault. I hope that is changed.
Watch your challenges as some can be mainuplated. For instance after having 18 dwellers I had a challenge of assigning workers to the proper area. I just moved everyone around and removed four or six people needing only 9 more.
Completing challenges gives you caps, pets, clothes, weapons, junk, and rare items."
18206,"Fun game at first, but gets boring really quickly, the game is more ""wait until something happens, take care of it (which only lasts a minute tops) than go back to waiting for something to happen"""
18207,"Sell common items means 'sell everything worthwhile you just went to collect and keep the scrap, you have earned that, you scrub'

2/10 would vault again"
18208,Deathclaws and radscropions need to be nerfed but the game give a good experience and similation of the vault minus the twisted experiments vault tech creates.
18209,"Really enjoyed this game. very addicting, played this game this morning and get home to find out that it didnt save any of my progress so the vault that is on the save now is from 6 days ago, so dissapointing i was having a lot of fun with this"
18210,"I'd say this game is not too shabby. It has nice sound design, quests are fun, it's satisfying to organize everything in first few days of playing. You get a decent amount of free-to-play currency without paying any money too.
But after 10 hours or so gameplay becomes a drag. You don't need money or resources, you just grind dwellers to open up a  few more rooms that don't do much.
If you like time managment games, you might enjoy it, but it's safe to drop it once you hit 30-40 dwellers."
18211,Achievements are grindy (takes a LOOONG time) and the game doesn't stay in your library upon uninstalling.
18212,"this is such a fun game and i think everyone should download if they have fallout 4 
"
18213,"This game is pretty awesome for a Freemium game. The only problem is that it seems pretty usless to have this on steam when you can have it on your mobile device for easier access, notifications, etc.  Overall I would recommend this game even though it is freemium, but I never feel like im forced to buy anything or that I ""need"" to buy such and such because such and such is taking too long etc."
18214,In this game everyone fucks with everyone thats why I rate it 10/10
18215,"Awesome, and it is FREE! Pay to win os optional. Great game, well done!"
18216,Best game for office!
18217,Good game!I like it...
18218,Played this on mobile before it was pretty fun in my opinion
18219,"This game is a special kind of stupid.
At first it is a little boring. You build, collect resources and grow people. 
Then it gets intresting when you can send people on quests and send people to explore the wasteland with good equipment (it is stupid to send people to explore with bad or none equipment). 
But just when you start to enjoy the game you get invaded by the molerat army. But I think they are Deatchclaws in disguise. They take A LOT of damage and kill everything in sight. It depletes your caps and stimpacks in an instant (you need A LOT of stimpacks in this game). 
It is just like the game and Bethesda hits you in the face with a sledgehammer, tells you that the game is over and laughing in your face. 
I am very glad I did not put any money in this game. DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY MONEY AT ALL!

I have not felt this disappointed with a game since I played Mordheim: City of the Damned. 

You should only play this game if you are a masochist!"
18220,Its good but should have more members to recrute then just a hand full. Challanging and somewhat hard.
18221,Very funny on PC too !
18222,"If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3¬Ω tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn‚Äôt suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.
Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"
18223,It's fu****g addictive. Be aware of microtransactions xDD
18224,enjoyable building game
18225,"fun times, name dwellers after your friends. manage errythang to make it work"
18226,"I played this since it came out for the iphone, and it took me a while to try pc version, but now that I did I am loving it! It is easier to convince my friends to play, and we are having a great time comparing vaults and doing quests. Keep the content coming! Bethesda- one of the best companies ever!"
18227,Really enjoying Fallout Shelter. A well laid out game about nurturing your vault and the people inside.
18228,"Boring game. The graphics is good. But, I didnt like the game.
2.5 / 5.0"
18229,Very shit and if you dont cheat it takes 6 hours for pregancy. would recommend for people with cheats.
18230,"Saved file lost, super annoying."
18231,Play it <3
18232,Love the gameplay! And the moving characters are creative :).
18233,"its a fun game and i am really happy that i can play it on pc now
"
18234,Just play it on phone.
18235,It's pretty lit.
18236,"Back up your game files for this game or risk losing all of your work,I lost around 80 hours of game play.Back to square one and a total restart.
For this reason I'm going to say NO don't play this game.
The game play is rather good for a small game, plenty to do and to keep you amused, I miss the game but
will never play it again due to the above problem which left me with a feeling that I had been robbed of the time, effort and
a small amount of money I had invested in this game."
18237,"Fallout Shelter is a fun game to play in your spare time,
As the director of the vault..
You can make it as big as you want.
You need to make shure people are safe in the vault etc.
but there is one big problem...
The game crashes very often, if you forgot to save your vault before it crashed, you pretty much just lost your enitire vault..
So my tip is to save every 15/30 minutes!
For a free game i would say:
Just try it out, you got nothing to lose..Its free!"
18238,"Nice game to log into every now and then but you won't be sitting there for hours and hours at a time. 

The basics are:
- Add rooms for energy, food, water, housing, storage, weapons, consumables, clothes, customisation, training.
- Put dwellers to work, have them make babies, send them out to explore or send them on missions.
- Exploring and missions yield currency, crafting material, weapons, armor.
- Equip dwellers with weapons and armor for missions and for defending the vault against monsters and raiders.
- Dwellers will level up while working, exploring or doing missions.
- Dwellers can also train up their stats in certain rooms which makes them stronger, smarter, etc.
- Add dwellers with a Radio room or by letting dwellers do naughty stuff ;)

All in all i like it. It's very casual friendly as you can just put them to work and send them exploring or on a mission (traveling there takes Real Life hours) and then you can do RL stuff and check back later.

18244,its good but cant say great
18245,"Spent 30 hours on a vault and had tons of legendary items, then for some odd reason, my vault was randomly deleted. Do not reccommend this game, unless you want to waste time on something that will just get deleted

18246,"Nive, but not my cup of tea. Try it, yoou may like it or not."
18247,"I can't get past the point where the vault is made. I get
an error message that says  It can't provide the requested
resolution. adjusting the size doesn't help so far."
18248,"Great game to play and its FREE!

Download and try it out before you dont and regret it your whole life, then one day you tell your son or daughter how you failed to play the best FREE game on STEAM.
"
18249,"This game has no cloud back up, lost everything, time and money. And the official web for the game was a shit that gives no useful solutions."
18250,good game
18251,"very funny game, just a tipical fallout... for free...."
18252,I love it
18253,"This game is the ultimate time killer!

love the gameplay and resorce gathering.

is that a bioshock soundtrack overlay or what.

only complaint is with the quests. a lvl and weapon strength restriction is fine, but a 6 to 24hr quest wait?

personal note- The kids and I wish there was another section next to quests to opt into visit, help, attack, or be attacked by up to the 3 questies. (lvl restrictions for fairness) or friends/foes"
18254,"Fun to play. I don't have to ""Pay-to-Play"" if I don't feel like it."
18255,Iz nice
18256,"HD version of Facebook Apartment Game..
+ ""with Polygamy & Incest"""
18257,This game is a fucking piece of shit and punishes you for playing it.
18258,Overall a really fun game to mess around with.  Survival mode adds a decent challenge and is rewarding to complete quests.
18259,good game but hate it when you get the controler pads coming up and i cant find a way to disable it
18260,"oh man its just soooo much fun putting so much effort into a vault only for the game to crash and erase all your progress, I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this. 

give this one a miss as even hammering rusty nails into your fingers would be more productive."
18261,This game is good if you are bored. I really like that game.
18262,"10/10, dwellers bone each other and you can have pets. What more do you look for in a game, honestly."
18263,"there is a lot of waiting if you dont pump money into the game but it is still fun to play, Just play multiple games gto cut down waiting time to keep the excitment flowing"
18264,"Good Game, but gets boring after you reach like 60 to 70 dwellers"
18265,10/10
18266,"Sounded promising, but turned out to be pretty boring. This is just one of those mobile ports where you have to wait for days."
18267,needs to be one block wider and allow 300 or so dwellers and something to do during the long waits
18268,"You get to accidentally set your entire shelter on fire and get assaulted by raiders every 5 seconds.


420/10 would get raided again"
18269,Essentially slave labor
18270,It's a good game they should lower the raiders spawns it makes it hard to send trops out.
18271,"If you are a Fallout fan, this is a must get. The gam ig free !!! I have been playing for some time now and have not needed to purchase anything to help move me along in the game. Most "" Free to Play"" end up costing you down the road, this does not. You will be tempted for sure but it is not needed. This to me is more of a tower defence+ RPG all set in the Fallout world. I play it several times a day. This game becomes very, very, addictive."
18272,"–Ø –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª –∫–æ–¥ –Ω–∞ –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ª–∞–Ω—á–±–æ–∫—Å,  –≤–≤—ë–ª  –∏ –Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ"
18273,Interesting game. But very hard to get ahead unless you pay irl money for caps etc. This game ended up being short lived for me. Too difficult.
18274,"So i was a huge fan of Fallout since it came out,I played most of the Fallout games but not on steam...
When i saw this game came out on steam i was soo happy that i can play at least 1 Fallout game on steam :)

Pros:
The Graphics are in my opinion very good
The game is awesome
Everything is awesome ^^

Cons:
No Cons for this game :)

10/10 -Should try its free :)"
18275,"Great game for the price of Free!  

Addictive addition to the Fallout series..."
18276,Love this! Great game to relax!
18277,"I LOVE THIS GAME LIKE A FAT KID LOVE CAKE!

For people who are having problem with save ""just save before you quit"" that EZ."
18278,"Funny, Great little sim. Sadly it need lots of hours to unlock anything because people are not commin to your vault, and babies are not born fast too :P But IMHO Great game"
18279,"Interesting but I got bored quickly.

- Basic basebuilding
- Tech-tree advancing
- A little bit of resource management
- Some mobilegame-like clicking mechanics
- Pretty graphics & sound effects
- Fallout 4

Suitable for killing short amounts of time. You won't be losing anything if you skip it. But it's free to play and small in size, so you may wanna give it a go.

Mediocre 5/10"
18280,Nice
18281,"not played it yet on mobile device? Try it, and dont rush!"
18282,Good time waster.
18283,"Like many others have mentioned, the save feature is hopelessly broken. If you want to ensure that your Vault progress is kept, you have to manually back it up at regular intervals. I have lost two Vaults so far, which is unacceptable given only the few hours I have played this game.

The gameplay and concept is enjoyable, but I would be extremely wary of investing money or a lot of time into this game. Because this, I wouldn't recommend this game until a proper Cloud save feature is introduced."
18284,"lost my vault save after pc restart (was alt tabbed out of game and had to restart for windows update didnt quit game with save and exit) 
Logged back in ran the game. and pooof no vault. 4 50 lvl characters with pets, gazzilion worth of everything gone. just like that. better play something that creates saves than waste time in a game like this"
18285,Good game
18286,fun flexible commitment game best value game on steam i've come across so far.  Highly recommended by me.
18287,"[h1]Fallout Shelter[/h1]
This GAME IS GOOOOOOD!!!! Free, so why not own it lol."
18288,"Honestly, after downloading the game it keeps showing me xbox one controlls on my PC, it won't let me move or do anything. So frustrating with no controller connected either!!!"
18289,Wish I can delete this game
18290,"Was really enjoying myself and had played the same shelter for weeks, so I was extremely angry to find after returning home from a weekend away that somehow my shelter had completely disappeared and my husband's vault, from his completely separate steam account, had been written over mine.

Will not continue to waste my time with a game that can screw me over so unpredictably."
18291,Addicting as hell.
18292,"Someone, at some point, thought [i]Fallout Shelter[/i] was a good idea. I'm not really sure who that was since the core mechanics are awful and don't translate well to PC [i]at all[/i] but someone decided it was worth the time to port, so I figure that means it's worth the time to review.

The Good:

It's another [i]Fallout[/i] game?

Seriously, though I didn't notice as much lag in this version as the original mobile one. That could just be my Vault was never big enough to reach that point, but we can discuss that later.

Adventure Mode/Quests: These weren't part of the game at launch (I remember when quests were added, anyway; the basic expedition is a core mechanic) and they make [i]Fallout Shelter[/i] feel like a really crappy, [i]Fallout[/i]-themed version of [i]Dwarf Fortress[/i], or at least they would, if your Dwellers weren't both incredibly stupid and incredibly lucky. Stupid in the sense I've had them get beaten by [i]bloat flies[/i] before, and lucky because I've had Dwellers leave the Vault in nothing but their suit and make their way back in high tier or Legendary armor with fifteen different guns on their person. None of these will save you from the game's most deadly enemy, though, which I'll get to soon, fear not.

The Bad:

If you needed a very succinct, painless explanation of why the Bethesda-made [i]Fallout[/i] games are inferior, [i]Fallout Shelter[/i] is as good a place as any to start. Aside from the absurdly large number of references to [i]Fallout 3[/i] (and later [i]Fallout 4[/i]) this game has nothing to do with the rest of the series. Weapons, characters, and enemies don't appear, despite them being logical additions: every weapon in the game, just about, is from [i]Fallout 3[/i], with the fourth numbered game's stupid pipe weapons thrown in for good measure. It's almost as if Bethesda thinks if they just don't mention the four core games they had nothing to do with the creation of (well, three, since they published [i]New Vegas[/i]) everyone else will forget they exist.

Balance. Your Vault can be doing very well for itself. You can be churning out medium-grade weapons and armor, generating enough electricity to power a small island, and have enough purified water to fill a swimming pool, and it won't matter one bit because a sudden infestation of rad roaches or, God help you, [i]mole rats[/i] will [i]literally[/i] kill everyone unless you're very lucky. Now, I can believe a deathclaw or three could pull this off, but it's ridiculous how hilariously overpowered joke enemies like these become. It's not a matter of me not equipping my people either: I've watched mole rats kill Dwellers in Combat Armor armed with scoped M29s and lever-action rifles before. Never will I feel guilty about completing the ""Wasteland Survival Guide"" quest in [i]A Tale of Two Wastelands[/i] again.

There's also very disappointingly little opprotunity to actually chose how your Vault is set up. There are only a handful of really power-gamey set ups that will give you a good return in the longrun, but more than that, you can't even decide [i]where[/i] your Vault is. You should at least get to pick a state to put your Vault in (I like to think mine is in Missouri, but it could be Nevada for all I know since the Wasteland is depicted as a desert at all times). 

I will give Bethesda credit here, though: this game is free, unlike the Vault-Tec Workshop DLC for [i]Fallout 4[/i], which is still like $10 and actually adds considerably less content."
18293,good game
18294,"Good that it is free, but otherwise has little substance."
18295,"My entire vault was destroyed by radscorpians.

10/10 would buy lunchboxes again"
18296,"it's a good game but on pc it's not very fun, even a clicker could do better at entertaining you on the computer. Some controls are akward since it wasn't made for the computer like scrolling with the mouse instead of the mouse wheel."
18297,love this game but dont play if you think the power is going to go out and if it does owell u can restart its not so bad take what u learn and make a better vault if you like to use your brian and micro mange the tits off thing and i do then this ame great and tons of story and great quest. ps NO NEED TO PAY I WILL NVR SPEND MONEY ON A FREE GAME  and i am doing very well mind u i play like 8hrs a day lol
18298,"A great free game, but the save system is still bad since all your saves are local. If you change computers or format, be sure to have an extra copy somewhere. Another problem I see is how the devs forgot about this project a long time ago. They just give us minor updates, only focusing in special sale packs of skins  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø ."

18303,Good enough.
18304,Great game. def. worth it.
18305,"It's a Great Game

I used to play this on my phone before F4 got out (I'm a big fan of Bethesda and obviously, Fallout is my favourite game).
Then when it came to PC, played it there.
And finally on Steam!

I love it.


                                                                                                                        Aproved by Wilco 10/10"
18306,"It's an idle game with the Fallout theme.  That is pretty much the gist of it.


If you like the type of game where you just occassionally pop in for a few minutes and check on everything you will probably enjoy it. If you prefer a game that is more active then i would suggest to avoid it! Be aware! It is a game from the mobile world gaming so it will test your patience and you wil find yourself scratching your head.


Want to play a fallout themed idle/wait-game? This is worth checking out, if you are not into such games i would suggest to avoid!"
18307,I have something in common with my Dwellers. We both have no reason to live.
18308,"Did you like SHELTERED? 
Do you enjoy resource management style games?
Are you a megalomaniac that will show them all ""Who has the God complex?"" 

If the answer to any of these questions is 'yes' then this is the game for you!

Send your minions on quests, build their homes, tend to their petty needs, enforce a strict systematic eugenics program, give them pets! The choice is yours, Overseer.

The game is a twice a day checker, see how those ants are doing, laugh at their strife, defend them from deathclaws, resurrect them to continue their unrelenting suffering in the wastelands. The game is freemium, but anything you can get in the store you can get in game with time and/or luck. Throw money at it or don't, either way it'll still be an enjoyable experience."
18309,its boring game nothing good.. dont waste your time or money on this game..
18310,"Its an ok game at first, nothing special really but now ive gotten to a point in the game where everything is just waiting. Want to go do a quest? Ok well wait 20 hours for your dwellers to go out and then spend 15 mins clicking on rooms and wait another 20 hours for them to return.

wouldnt really recommend and DONT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME"
18311,"I do recommend manually backing up your saved games. Yes I have lost some vaults yes I was irritated but bottom line you get what you pay for. It is a free game if you do not like it, simply uninstall and do not play again. But its lots of fun developing your vault. Just backup your saved manually sonifnyou do crash you have a point to go back to and do not lose everything. Simple. Have fun! Enjoy the free game! (I have fully built a vault with 150 dwellers without spending a penny on this game. No need to waste money)"
18312,"Great game.  Absolute gem.

Very addictive and can't get off it.

I'm not overly fond of micro transactions, but I recommend purchasing the ""Starter Pack"" giving you a head start. 

Love Fallout, then you'll love this too.
"
18313,"Mobile game ported to PC. Fun for the first few hours, after that it may as well be dead. High RNG risk game unless you spend money. Good tip is to rush room and exit game right away if ""FAILED"" to prevent the RNG of failing.

Challenges/Objectives are your main source of lunchboxes and pets but they can get very painful and almost impossible with minimal rewards to the point where I gave up and I cannot be bothered to wait a day just to re-roll one of the 3 challenges which could end up being worse. 

Even though I keep the dweller population low the objectives only get harder as you complete them, so after completing 20 you could still have 10 dwellers and you will get objectives such as ""Survive 30 mole rat attacks"", ""Craft 15 outfits"", ""Get 9 perfect critical hits"" and one of my most hated objectives.... ""Explore 7 locations while in the wasteland"" seriously dumb considering how random and long it takes to find a location while having to be active 100% of the time. If you don't get a pet early on which gives multiple objectives completes per an action then I wouldn't even consider progressing as it will only get painful.

Game can be otherwise fun if you intend to play just to collect resources once or twice a day but exit the game quickly as you will always get attacked after being away a while when you come back which is a waste of time. Exploring locations for quests should have an automatic mode as it gets boring quickly.
"
18314,"The game is fun in the beginning, but it gets repetitive after a while and the micromanagement gets very annoying. Yes, you can reduce microamangement by not expanding your vault, but then there's no more progress to be made.

It just lacks good end-game content and features that could reduce micro-management."
18315,"suck that you cant see the workers cant eat 
and we cant see whem they fuck xd"
18316,"Pay to win game..

It has something addictive to all Fallout fans. But in fact it's all around ""wait X days or pay"". In between there is NOTHING to do.. fighting countless fire accidents, breaking eye when trying to find mysterious stranger.. no thanks.

And as always it's terrible port. Buggy for 1920x1200 (talking about mouse scrolling), glitchy, annoying auto-zoom, accidental dragging.. PC has keyboard, I am serious guys, there are 104 keys, dragging everything is not what we like.

Otherwise very good game. Remove that crappy shop idea and it would be amazing 5-10$ game I'd buy and recommend."
18317,"Ok interative wallpaper, not a Game."
18318,Do not spend money on this game!. unlike all other games if you need to upgrade your computer or reset or reinstall this game all that you have spent is gone.
18319,Themed in the Fallout World this is a fun cousin of the traditional game. Available for mobile devices you can play it anywhere!
18320,"good game
better on pc than on a shitty phone
#Pcisbetterthanmobilegaming"
18321,"The moment I played this game I knew I will be having stiff necks and backaches. It is so addictive that you totally forget the time and the tasks you are suppose to do in real life. For those of you who loves to base build and play same concept of this game from facebook, I am warning you to stay away! You'll be so hooked that you even forget to eat and sleep!"
18322,"This little gem is way more fun than i expected. It even made me re-installing the gritty Fallout-Shooter, which isn't as entertaining as this wonderful little time-waster. Strongly recommended."
18323,Great time killer and a perfect free to play model.
18324,It's alot of fun
18325,"good game, great pass time"
18326,"Whack-A-Mole. Deluxe.

However, it is hampered by UI issues stemming from being a port of a mobile game. It was not optimized for mouse/keyboard input at all. This leads to some floaty, bad, and downright unreliable behavior when attempting to select or move dwellers from the main screen. For general management, this can be mostly sidestepped through some secondary menus, like the master vault dweller list, however, the master list doesn't give you all the important info you need--like their equipment, or which power plant they are working in. 

The secondary menus are also useless when trying to recruit help for dealing with incidents--and given the native cowardice of dwellers, that's a problem. The worst is a radscorpion event, because they're tough, and they move around randomly. Even with a small vault, they're an enormous pain because of how difficult it can be to snag assistance and direct them to the room presently being thrashed. That plus the fact that a typical radscorpion only stays in one spot long enough for that dweller you finally got sent to fight it to get there, and that you can't really do anything else until the radscorpion is killed, and you now know why I uninstalled the game.

The game is great for what it is, but the UI is horrible for anything."
18327,"Not worth the time to play let alone spend money on.  It's designed to completely trash your vault.  You can have one invader that will obliterate your entire structure.  If you happen to get very lucky and get a rare weapon you can survive for a bit, but they continue to send foes that can enter your vault with impunity.  The only invaders that are usually okay are the raiders because they are about equivalent in strength.  The mole rats and radroaches are very inconsistent in their strengths, sometimes they can be dispatched relatively easily, but other times they just mow down your entire fortress.  Deathclaws and Radscorpions almost always leave my vault with numerous dead dwellers.  I can't see a significant difference in dwellers that are level 25 and those that are level 1.  The main thing is the weapon they weild and the armor they wear and those aren't easy to obtain, especially the really good ones.  As a result, you can play along and think you're doing well when one invasion will literally decimate your forces and you'll struggle just to keep vault resources coming in enough just to let it survive, let alone prosper.  It's too random and you are too vulnerable to attack to make the game worthwhile, of course, this is what they want... they want you to spend money to get out of jams (and there are plenty of jams).  It is fun for awhile, but very disheartening to spend a few hours getting your vault established then to have one event destroy everything.  At least, I didn't spend any money on it (which is probably one reason game is so difficult, they almost make it that you have to spend money.)"
18328,2/10 NO PIGS FOR PETS
18329,"Tons o fun. Casual gaming at its finest. DL it, sit back, and enjoy."
18330,"much enjoyable game from the developer since 2011 (no cash spent)

-bug free-"
18331,"So far this game is okay, after reading reviews on people losing saves , i have been manually backing up my saves. If you like this game and you are worried you will lose your save go into your appdata/local/falloutshelter and you will find your saves to manually back your game up. I agree you shouldnt have to do this and hopefully they release a patch to fix it."
18332,nice

18338,congrats on pc and it's another hundreds of hours playtime awaits
18339,"Played it on mobile, now its on steam. Kept me entertained while I was away from the house doing productive things.... Now it keeps me at home."
18340,"Honestly, this is the best idle game I've ever played. And sometimes it's not even idle! I enjoy reading the wasteland explorer dialouge and the vault dweller dialouge. It has an amazing amount of work put into it and you can see it. The amount of math and coding that's gone into this is extraordinary. I would recommend this game to anyone looking fora game with immersive strategy and a diverse upgrade system. Very well done Bethesda ;)"
18341,"Other people are complaining about the game deleting save files. That must be quite frustrating but luckily I've never encountered this. If it doesn't happen to you, this game is incredibly fun and rather addicting."
18342,"Good game, but can be really adicting and time consuming."
18343,Strangely addicting
18344,"I went into this with very low expectations, looking for something casual but with enough gameplay to keep me interested.

I should note I'm a fairly big fallout fan, played it since Fallout 1 back in them there 90's, and almost every game since. The use of fallouts music, sound effects and pipboy cartoon style graphics are almost enough to garner my interest from the start, but the game has enough merit to keep me going for at least a few days.

The game is essentially a real time anthill strategy game, with about the same level of depth as a reasonable board game. You construct a vault from small number of settlers, add various rooms, and assign your settlers to work in the rooms, do quests outside the vault, and then theres the breeding... which is highly amusing.  you put a couple in a room together and if/when they hit it off, they disappear into the back of the room and the lady comes out pregnant. There is a degree of entertainment here just in making sure you don't breed out the genetic diversity from your settlers. Not too difficult but but novel nonetheless. 

Earlier I mentioned realtime. When I say realtime there is a lot of waiting around... the idea (from the publisher) being that you get sick enough of waiting and start paying to win (in the form of nuka cola quantum bottles which speed up various tasks). I should note that 'pay to win' type games are something I normally run a mile from, but Its buried enough that It doesn't interfere with the gameplay for me.  In regards to waiting around this is (primarily though many things take time) for your teams to go on quests and for the babies to gestate, and then grow up (about 4 hours each in real time). One nice thing is that the game time keeps running (for about four hours max I think) whenever you shut it down, so ideal if you have a real life as well. You can come back and spin the plates, match up some new couples, set off on a new mission etc, and then step away again. 

Quick summary.

Great if you like casual wee strategy games with about a board game level of depth, and indeed being a fallout fan will help keep you interested. 

It is addictive, and really quite fun, great for hourly doses a few times a day. 

Biggest negative is that this was a mobile game ported to PC, and the interface is a little clumsy as a result, but still bearable. Pay to win not an issue if you are fairly patient and don't need to binge this game."
18345,"Fun game, but there's a save file corruption bug. Don't bother."
18346,very good game exept for the time it takes
18347,Game is pretty good

18349,It continues even when you shut the game down. I'd rather be there when my game is being played thank you.
18350,This game fucking sucks!!
18351,This is just fantastic! Thank you for finally getting this onto Steam. Bethesda really know what they are doing. Reminds me of the classic Sims Tower.
18352,"Fun, time consuming, easy to learn, and addicting..."
18353,"I remember when this was first released, and I enjoyed it, although it being only on my mobile was frustrating, particularly the wonky screen attention movement and the really bad zooming and focusing.  ultimately gave it up and uninstalled.
Now, I see they have somewhat improved it and released it on steam. Great!   that wonkyness with zoom and focus is still there, but much better on a larger screen, and the pc  mouse control is way superior to the tiny touchscreen interface.  I like the additions of the pets and workshops, and the quests! 
HOWEVER, and that is a big however, the RNG event generator is broken.. I mean really, frustratingly *ing broken.  I think I understand how the algo is supposed to work, and it IS effective. however is there a better algo rng than ""whatever will * over the player repeatedly, and make the experience less enjoyable""?  come on.at first it was multiple deathclaw attacks in a row laying waste to multiple layers of dwellers.  ok. some levelling, and it's down to one, maybe 2 vault layers.  so now it's  10 unkillable radscorpions in a row?  Seriously? I can see if it's only 2 or maybe 3 dwellers in an attack, and it gets bored and runs off, but laying waste to at least 3 full rooms of decently armed dwellers before running away.. seriously? oh, and spawing other unkillable rs's to do the same simultaneously? seriously? 
another item that needs be addressed  is the scaling.  on the quests, you have the three dwellers that can take on a full structure of radscorpions, or irradiated ferals, or what have you, and  while they take damage, it's not the insta-drain it is when the same # attack the vault.  if there is a weird scaling, where on the quest,  one is one, but at the vault one is 5, I could see that, but not the one is apparently 10... 
Because it is initially enjoyable,  I am giving it a recommendation. it IS at it's core a good  work.. it just REALLY needs to have better clarifications and some tuning to make it more about difficulty than just being mind-numbingly frustrating."
18354,"I would like to start by saying the game does have a good overall concept, and I believe that the issues here can be fixed.

The biggest reason I find the game unplayable is that combat is very confusing. Frequently, you will get raids by sword weilding samurai. They don't come for resources, they just come to kill your survivors, and suck their soul into a pokeb- sorry, wrong game. 

If an attack does happen, your characters just kind of stand around and do nothing. You can equip weapons and all that, but the effectiveness varies. You also have to manually move either the weapons around between characters, or move your characters to the room under attack. 

This could be improved if the survivor AI is updated to automatically seek out and destroy threats, and to automatically move to rooms under siege. 

It would also be kind of nice to have more mechanics in the underground. In XCOM, you build chambers very similar to the game here. In XCOM, geothermal caves will spawn underground which provide extra electricity if you build a power plant on it. It's little things like that which could really add to the game's playability. 

So summing up, I ask that Bethesda makes combat more fun, and less confusing, as well as adding a few mechanics to give the player a reason to keep coming back. It's that thought of, ""gee, I can't wait until I can build my base up to reach this cool looking location."""
18355,"I'm going to warn whoever is reading this comment:

Don't spend your money on this game. Firstly, I've lost a vault and luckily I didn't get any of the DLC. Also, You may get a good event or a good item once in awhile, but for the most part, not so much. Another thing is, even if you spend money on this game, everyone of your dwellers will die either way."
18356,"Fun for a while but it's buggy as shit. My dwellers never go into the room that I assign them to, the camera fritzes out, sometimes, I have to click way off of the character to select them instead of ON the character itself, and I could go on. Its a damn shame because its a fun game but it's annoying as fuck to play cause of the bugs."
18357,"I love the fallout series and this is a different way of playing, its addicting at times. I wouldn't encourage buying things for the game since the thing you buy is only bought for 1 vault not all 3"
18358,gets vary hard to play
18359,This is a great game to play when you want to pass the time. Imagine yourself owning a vault now think that can be a reality your dwellers are your minions and you make them do what you want have fun and be creative.
18360,"This is game of micro managing idiotic fires, in clunky and idiotic way.

Like in cool Faster The Light game, but without pause. People in room with fire will quickly die if it is 3rd or 4th fire and you do not have a hostpital to heal them.

They will NOT auto evacuate from the room if they are dying.
You have to manually drag them out.
If you miss-click and lose 2 or 3 seconds, characters are dead. So you need to send in more support and evacuate others, leading to a death spiral.

That's retarded, not fun at all.

Also no way to build any kind of automatic fire supression, or better extinquishers.

Also, even my water plant - room full of water, randomly catches fire too. 

Idiotic."
18361,"Fallout 4 was my first experience with the series and loved it. Saw this and had to give it a go. You little Addicting BEEYOTCH! lol It's a fun, not-so-serious time killing game that's well done. The concept is very fun and casual. I spent $5 buck for the starter pack...So I can bet being free to play they are making some money off this. Inspires me to hurry up with my Game Development course lol. Highly recommend if you love the Fallout Series. This game is Level 10 Charisma for sure. Now, where is that Mystery man..."
18362,Cheated me out of too many things. Not really worth the time.
18363,"Errrrrrrrrrr.....is good?!?, I prefer to play the mobile version hehe :P more portable"

18371,nice
18372,Great game & It's free!!
18373,"This is a very fun free game, but not without it's share of faults that need to be addressed

Pros
- Gameplay is pretty fun and varied. From vault building to quests to exploration, there's a lot to do.

- Quite a bit to the strategy of this game. It looks simple on the surface, but it's quite complex, with it's SPECIAL stat system, which determines how dwellers perform in different situations. A lot of trial and error is needed to master this game.

- A bunch of different rooms, allowing you to craft your own gear, train your people to your liking, as well as producing the basics to keep everyone alive

- You can earn all the pay shop items through regular play, which is always a plus to me.

Cons
- I saw another review use the word ""chaotic"", and that is a perfect word for the game as you progress. You very quickly  jump from simple to challenging to completely insane as you're bombarded with things like Radscorpion invasions, which will not only beat you senseless, but deplete your resources as they do it. It can be very hard to just tread water once the difficulty ramps up. I like a challenge but I'm finding this to be a bit over the top and the level of micromanaging is also a bit much.

- The programming is on the poor side in some areas. You can tell it's a port. There's a mystery man that pops up every once in a while, and you've got about 10 seconds to locate him. There's nothing like hearing his music, being right in the middle of looking for him when you have a raider attack, which centers the camera on them, hearing the music of the mystery man disappearing, then killing the raiders only to watch one spend 10 or 15 seconds limping across the screen as he drains your resources in the process, and you're helpless to do anything until he finally collapses. It can also be painfully difficult to click on things such as the mystery man, finding that the game thinks you intend to click on the room itself, and you may lose him in the process. Hopefully things like this are addressed because they seem like unnecessary punishment for doing nothing wrong.

- Not impressed by some of the cash items. Mr Handy, for instance, moves painfully slow when he's on resource gathering mode. I find it much quicker and more efficient to just manually collect, as you lose resource production time when he's dragging himself all the way across the floor to collect. In my opinion, if it's a cash item, it should be instantaneous. Also, not much to say for his cap collecting ability on exploration. Even though he can't take damage, it's much more lucrative to send a regular dweller exploring. He seems like a jack of all trades, master of none. I found mine through the course of the game, but if I had spent money on this thing, I would feel ripped off.

- There seems to be one gamebreaking issue where save files become corrupt, and if that happens, support will not help you. That.. in a word, sucks. In fact, I might be tempted to spend money on this game, but after hearing that, I will not. Not if that's the level of support they provide.

So in closing, it's a perfect free game. That's the right pricetag in it's current state. It's fun and worth your time to try it out. Enough to earn a thumbs up, but not a glowing endorsement. If they address some of the issues, it would raise it above that level."
18374,"Cons: 
- you have to pick up the resources manually, and more you upgrade a room the faster it produces, so at a certain point you find yourself picking up resources and not having time to do nothing else
- no real sistem to organize your citizens, so it can be difficult to give them the best tasks for their SPECIAL once you have more than 100 people down there
- same for weapon and clothes
- if you build 2 rooms next to each other and later you want to change the first one, you have to demolish everything. and that is quite annoing specially later on the game

Pros:
- the irony is the same as the main game
- graphic is nice, dialogues too
- MIssions are interesting and vary
- the reward sistem works well, and even the nuke cola awards dont make you feel the feeling of being in a Pay to win
- the weapon and clothes sistem is nice, even if the storage could be bettered
- free

Summary: 
a nice game, can be addictive and requires many brief sessions of play during the day but even if you leave it for few days and then come back nothing disastrous happened.
take it if you are looking for something to distress you for few minutes several times a day, dont if you are looking for a game to start and that keep you playing it for hours without stopping"
18375,"Just Barely Fun + Micropay = More Fun?

I'd ask for my 2 hours of life back but I believe not wasting anymore time on this ""game"" is good enough.  I was almost going to drop money on a starter pack then realized what a stupid move that would be.  

The gameplay is so basic a baby or monkey could probably excel at this game.  I believe I quit after seeing my people repel the first wave of raiders with ease.  It is best to put your power plants on top floor and load them with strength characters (with decent guns and armor) because they raid the top floor first and then make their way down.  

If you want an interactive screensaver that almost passes as a game then go ahead.  This game is too braindead for me."
18376,"It is ok game, but if you play it for the first time, do not go on survival, it is just really annoying, not hard..."
18377,This is such a fun games and i would 100% reccomend it to pass the time and to play if waiting for another game to install :)
18378,"Before I get into it let me just say I tried every example on the web to restore content. There is nothing that works. Needless to say, my vault deleted itself. 

Nearly spent the same amount of time trying to fix the problem as I played in hours. Sure it's free to play so I guess that is an excuse, right?"
18379,"Played this one on my tablet a lot.
This seems to be some automatic PC conversion and it is unplayable for me.
Controls are not working allt he time. View is all the time moving right without user input, it was unable even to set my vault number using mouse (did not figured out how to set it using keyboard).
Wait fot Nethesda to fix it or just play full grown Fallout.
This one is not worth your time even for free."
18380,Deleted my save. I worked hard and the game deleted my vault. Stupid fucking creators.
18381,"After hours of hard work, My entire vault of 41 people is overrun and killed off by a pack of over-sized rats.

10/10 Would lose entire vault to over-sized rats again





Hitler used the wrong method."
18382,"The game is designed to have you on the verge of making a microtransaction, and there is plenty of reason to. BUT, it is definitely something that can be avoided. That is if you don‚Äôt mind going in for the long haul and grinding for the pleasure of enjoying the game and its surprises when you finally do achieve something. The concept is not bad, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs a free to play. Honestly though there could be some dlc. There should be an option to change your pip boy HUD color just like the real fallout games. There also should be a trade room where you can trade between vaults since the game is single player and all exists in the same world 1 game for 3 game saves. So, all my vaults numbered as they are technically existing in the wasteland together. 

It would be nice if the devs actually read these. Anyways other than that the 3rd and finally improvement would be more variety in actual gameplay. in other words, if it was a little more immersive and hands on between modes. Adding a mode that is more challenging and rewarding for players would be nice. Otherwise it‚Äôs an idle game with 2 modes random location dungeon crawling with combat that works mostly by itself and the main vault building management mode. Those two modes make up most of your actual gameplay and what you will mostly be looking at. I wish there could have been a few more modes or at least more player involvement. 

The AI in the game could be smarter they could actually do a little more on their own inside the vault. The game is ok considering you spend hours looking at the same things and dragging and dropping like hell. It‚Äôs also a pretty good incest/inbreeder simulator 10/10 because literally the only real way to increase your population is by intermingling mom, dad, son and daughter brother sister cousin‚Äôs nephew‚Äôs niece‚Äôs aunt‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs grandma and grandpas and great ones in the sickest web a family could possibly achieve. Otherwise you will spend days (irl) maybe even weeks‚Äô juts getting 1, just 1 survivor to show up. The real challenge of the game is all luck. hoping that next objective will reward you with a vault lunchbox and some decent cards. And hoping that you will get some of the Nuka-cola bottles too. 

The game is good its addicting and interesting. but the more you play it the more you realize how boring it is and how much of the same it offers. so really if you did just spend money on lunchboxes or Nuka cola bottles the game is now ruined and pretty much a huge waste. because you just have created a finished virtual fish tank and there‚Äôs nothing more to do and all the great stuff you have is pointless cause there‚Äôs nothing it REALLY does. It‚Äôs all just a simulator that you play to pass the time. It‚Äôs a cool concept but they could do more with t if they really are taking it seriously. Flash game Inbreeder sim 5.5/10."
18383,"Fun to play while multi-tasking other activities, i play this game as i would play games such as Clash of Clans or Boom Beach. Fun to play while watching a t.v show and such."
18384,"As far as games go as fan service it's a nice little free game. 

It's a simplisted building population management game which is fun and time consuming for a free to play game with the burn real money feature for misc goods or in game currancy type ""Nuke-cola Quantum"" which i don't recommend doing cause it is litterally burning money. but if you have disposable income to waste have at it. 

Personally i think the limits of building and allowcating build space is extreamly limited and you should be able to excavate more space to at least use all the seen soil for the vault construction space, also the fact your limited to 2 people to defent the vault main door and entrance is frustating but understood it is that way for ""difficulty"" but I personally beleive you should be allowed to garrison a unit outside the entrance like the enclave and BoS would if you want to be Militaristing in the management of your vault, while the game is extreamly limited in it's scope i think if they expanded the game in number of methods will aid the longevity of the game."
18385,"Log in. Collect, Level Up, Exit. To avoid dem Raids and Attacks..

18386,"Me: Time to check on my vault dwellers!
*loads game*
*Death claw encounter*"
18387,Great casual strategy game. Even better that it's fallout.
18388,"This game starts off really well. You do get a good hang of it. But after you have constructed enough rooms and have enough members in the vault, it becomes super chaotic. I do love the concept of the fallout game but this is a bit more chaotic for my taste. If you are looking for a relaxing game then this is not the right one!"
18389,Good kill time.
18390,"Don't be turned off by the app/iphone game vibe. There is a huge amount of content here, with incredible polish. Must play for Fallout fans. And you can't beat the price. Not a hint of scam as of this review. They could charge $10 and it would still be worth playing. Pay addons are completely unnecessary and just move the game along faster. 
Beware though, it can be tricky and its very possible to screw up your vault early on. Don't hesitate to restart if you did something stupid in the first few hours of gameplay. this is the third time I am playing it, first appstore, then online and now on steam. So I know what to expect. combat is entirely SPECIAL based, weapon stats are dmg only and armor only boosts stats. Build your vault slowly, focus on sustainability and send people on quests ASAP for the best loot. DON'T WASTE THE FREE LUNCHBOXES. Their contents make a huge difference, giving you potentially access to high level loot not available to craft til MUCH later in the game. Restart if you get nothing good."
18391,"love this 'app' actualy Uninstalled fallout 4 to make space for this....

aint spent any money on it, and it still works swell....

made me want to intstall the old fallout games again."
18392,"This game is awsome!!! I heard so many people talking about it I just wanted to try it for myself the game is really really really really (300 days of really later) really good.


I'n layman's terms, the game is okay."
18393,"This is a really fun game! I enjoy the different characteristics of each dweller and the range of rooms for purchase. I reccommend playing this, or at least giving it at try to see if it's something you'd enjoy as well!"

18395,"it is good but need more work and i""am waiting update for the game :D"
18396,"it is fun at first but once you get everything unloocked, it can get a bit boring"
18397,This game is awsome!
18398,Played this mainly on my Android tablet until it had expanded so much that the tablet struggled to run it anymore. Now I'll give it a go on the PC.
18399,stress
18400,"very good

18401,This game become boring way too quickly
18402,I try this game because one my GOOD friend notification me its good i try it and its rly good u can do quest build new rooms getting more ppls better guns and cloths:-) 10/10 ;-)

Highly recommend!!!"

18406,"Hours long timers than can be skipped by real money transactions.
Mindlessly clicking to harvest resources is most common form of ""gameplay.""
Combat sections are truly awful.

I suggest skipping this and playing one of the many great simulation games on steam instead of this shameful, player abusing cash grab."
18407,Well i was playing and then the game crashed booted it up again then boom lost my valt all of it no back up save dont pay anything to this game but it was fun so im gonna try again it hurt to lose all my progress :(
18408,no ofline progress means nothing ever happends
18409,Great game to spend your free time !!! I would totally suggest it to players who love source management games!!!
18410,good game to kill time when you nothing to play.
18411,"Been playing since beta on android, it was a lot more basic than how it is now.

Great development, great game, great genre, great easter eggs. Have fun!"
18412,So wow
18413,"i just uninstalled, this game has deleated my saved games twice"
18414,"I loved this game. Only problem is that its glitching up for me. Maybe a bug? 
If you want a good, addictive and fun game to pass the time play fallout shelter"
18415,The game is addictive especially if you play other series of fallout. It serves as a more casual version of the main game. However could be better if the game allows save files synchronizing with other platform.
18416,Good game to waste some time on
18417,"Dwellers in my vault slinging that bling.
Up;graded rooms fit for a king.
That legendary dweller cheevo harder than shit.
I like girls with big tits."
18418,"At first I see this game I was like [i]""Well, it's free, nothing to worry, I don't need to spending money, just try it a little bit.""[/i], so I give it a try. And unfortunately, I did actually like the game, and was kind of addicted, at least for first ~12 hours of playtime in 7 days. In that time I actually did buy one Mr. Handy, because I think this is a good game, maybe buying one item will worth it. But, that just happen just a minute before I got another 2 for free: one from a Lunchbox from quest and one from Objective completion. [i]""WTF!? Are you kidding me!?""[/i] And then [i]""Okay, just take it as buy-one-get-two-free""[/i].

But then time passed for another hours, that I started to lose my appetite. Few moments later when I open steam overlay I see something disturbing: [b]SAVE EDITOR GUIDE[/b]. F-ING HELL!? I edit my save immediately, give it full 999999 number in all text box, and play it a little bit just to feel bored even more, because no challenge, so I revert my save to my original unedited one, and play for another hours, finishing all room upgrade, unlocking all room until I get to unlock Nuka-Cola bottler, then there is my bore comes again, even stronger.

And after 13 hours, I think I don't want to play this anymore.

My advice: try to edit your save game before you decide to buy items/contents, if you think it's worth it, you can go for it.
I rather buy this game for $4.99 and get items based on progression and as reward than to get this game for free and spend $0.99 ($1.2 if you convert it from my currency) for one Mr.Handy."
18419,"I really enjoy playing this game. It has its flaws, but if you're like me and must have anything Fallout, here's another for the collection!

I see a lot of people saying ""don't spend any money on this game"" etc.. Well it's free! (And the items you can buy for it, you can also get for free simply by playing the game)
And others complain about Vaults being deleted.. Since I read that I copy my files daily, no problems yet. And it's not the end of the world, it's just a game! Where you happen to live in the end of the world.. Don't take things so seriously, at least in the real world you don't have to worry about radscorpions!"
18420,"Brilliant game for a freebie and I am addicted to it. 

Problem is time becomes an illusion and nothing gets done around the house. It is probably best played in short bursts rather then spending hours on it as I can imaging it becoming a tedious chore after a while.

I don't intend to spend hard earned money on the game as like many others I have played it's far to easy to waste."
18421,"It's a good time waister, its free, its fallout. It's pretty hardcore on the grind and it really wants your microtransactions but you don't technically need to spend money. Get this is you want something to kill 10 minutes with everynow and again."
18422,nice
18423,Stopped working. I even bought a new computer and it won't work. I spent time and money on this game but its broken and I lost everything
18424,"A mad Deathclaw rocked up to my gatho and had a mad muzz with me and the bois (yeh the police). nek minute i opened a lunch box and got the ""whats 9 + 10"" guy. he then broke into my dick and rolled me for my Tn's (Laters oi laters). then i sucked his fat toes and (deez nuts) gaht eeemmmmm. I then decided to bus a nut in the corner while nigel thornberry did a gabba in the bathroom to the damn daniel trap remix. anime"
18425,"My favorite part is when your power plants can't store and produce enough energy to sustain your Vault, so then you take a 25% risk to rush production and instead fail and everyone dies to Radscorpions. It's great."
18426,"I love love love this game. It's super addicting. I have a couple vaults just so I can try new layouts and have more to do while I wait. It's a good time passer. My only dislike is how hard it is to get Nuka cola bottles, which help speed up time. Otherwise, I have to set missions and wait hours (once 17 hours) just to reach the mission. Of course, this is how the company makes their money! Which is totally understandable. I hope they continue to update this game and add more!"
18427,"If you've ever felt like maintaining your very own Vault-Tec Vault, you now have that wish granted, for free! While it may seem boring on the surface(pun intended) for some, it goes deeper than that(double pun!). Fallout Shelter has hours upon hours of gameplay, from quests, to upgrading your rooms to simply trying to collect every weapon, outfit and pet in the game.

Pros:
-Free
-Hours of entertainment
-No pay-to-win advantage

Cons:
-Honestly, not many. The game isn't large(storage wise) and it is free, so it's technically impossible to get ripped off here. I would recommend if you like Fallout and/or management games."
18428,"Just like the android/phone version of the game. The game is fine, but the game works better on a phone than on the pc. However, if you don't have a smartphone, then by all means, you can try out this game. Basically a phone game (which it is)."
18429,"What an incredibly awesome gem of a game.  With it's roots on mobile devices as a persistent world, you take oversite of a vault.  By building various rooms that bestow applicable assets to your vault, you can build a thriving community.  Outfits and weapons can be found throughout the wasteland while questing outside of the safety of you vault.  Did I say safety?  Well, mostly, but you'll have to fend off attacks by raiders from time to time.  There are also fires and attacks from infestations of the local fauna.  Quests offer fun mini-games and offer you a chance to find some valuable loot.  Weapon and Clothing crafting are present, and the occasional appearance from the Mysterious Stranger and a bit of ""Where's Waldo"" as you try to locate him in your vault rounds out the experience.  I cannont more highly recommend this game, especially if you have an experience with the Fallout world."
18430,"Enjoyed playing for a few weeks and even spent money.  I logged on the other day and my vault disappeared.  I tried uninstalling and re-install still no vault.  It looks llike several people have had the same issue.

Don't waste your time!!"
18431,Love the concept and hate the idea that it runs on real time. I will not under any godly reason sit in front of my computer every 1hr or so to make sure people are alive. I don't have children and I certainly don't want that responsibility with a computer game. 2/10
18432,honestly didnt like the game the games good but take forever for everything theres no speed up button and how chances keep getting higher for everytime you rush and stuff idk personally didnt like it. played it on the phone expected something different but still hte game i didnt like.
18433,man i love fallout games... can get a tad boring but the game keeps going after u turn it off so thats awesome. but the ingame purchaces are dumb another way for a rich kid to have fun. fuk u rich kids
18434,Rather boring game. If you like waiting for things to happen this game might be for you.
18435,"i got more lunch boxes here than my parents ever gave me
im hungry

18444,Its Pretty good X3
18445,"Have played the game on desktop and tablet and find it work great on either. It comes across as a pretty simple game but don't be fooled. You can run out to the kitchen for a beer and when you get back all 47 folks in your vault are dying. You don't know why and you can't strop it....its crazy. You don't have top spend a dime in the game but i strongly suggest you spend the $4.99-USD for the Starter Pack, it really helps and gets you off to a good start.
"
18446,"Very casual game, can get really frustrating when your dwellers die."
18447,"well done and pretty amusing.  It's like an ant farm, but you get to mix n match the breeding partners."
18448,I'd love to shop the shit out of this game but i am poor
18449,"it deleted my game and my vault, when you spendng time on a game and everything stops working
it is extremly frustrating! having to reinstall it over and over isnt the best either. work on your game please before realesing it to the public free or not!"
18450,"At first this game didn't seem to bad, but as i started playing i liked it more and more. Its one of those games that you get addicted to almost instantly. I highly reccommend this game. I really enjoyed it."
18451,"***Don't spend money on this game unless you plan on manually backing up your save files regularly***

I was enjoying the game and spent money on the vault starter pack for it. A few days later my power went off while playing and when I reopened the game my save would not load. I did some research and found that this is a common problem. The game is basically constantly writing to the save file so if anything interrupts it (game crashes, windows crashes, computer turns off) there's a very good chance it will corrupt your save file.

That wouldn't be so bad if you could at least get the content you paid for and use it on a new save game. But you can't, believe me I tried. Steam Support tells you ""it's a consumable item"" and refuses to reissue or refund it. Bethesda Support tells you that they can't do anything and you have to talk to Steam.

If you still want to play the game and especially if you are going to spend money on it, download a utility to regularly back up the game save file so you don't lose your progress/money when your game ends up corrupted.

Also: You might think, ""But won't I be able to restore my save from Steam Cloud?"" Nope, the corrupted save gets uploaded to the cloud so you're screwed there too."
18452,it's oki
18453,have this game in android too ^^
18454,money
18455,"Best Strategies game ever
The thing that make this game a little bit annoying is the waiting time
Good Game Overall Though"
18456,its verry good game and excited
18457,Petty good for a free game.
18458,"Very good graphic,but sometimes the game get freez,hope u guys prove it again"
18459,"f*ck dat radscorpions, totally ruin this game."
18460,"its a free game...

there is no real strategy to this game... its completely mindless... there is no plot,  nothing happens... i played the game for a few days to set up a vault...that was a little bit cool... i love all the fallout mythology... but they really sold out here.  they put no effort into this.  they could have made this awesome.  but i feel like they chose not to.. i feel like they are closing down the fallout series. 

fallout 3 new vegas is my favorite game of all time... and this is like a parody of a rip off of a defective version of that game."
18461,this game is really amazing :D
18462,"Nope... cool concept for mobile. It just does not works on pc. Controlls are badly ported, game tempo is not enhanced for pc... just nope. Most of the time you just staring at screen and waiting for... something to happen? Maybe im doing something wrong... maybe i should move my PC rig to  toilet to fully enjoy this game... i dont know... srsly WHY IN THE HELL you need hotkeys for game where literally nothing happens for 5 minutes? Its not like you can get carpal tunnel syndrome from this game... Its more like tamagotchi, on mobile it works, you can check your pet once in hour to check if it shit itself or died. But on pc? God know im procrastinating lazy fuck, but this is way over my capabilities of lifeless staring at screen"
18463,im so  addicted to this game i can't quit!!!
18464,pretty fun if you're looking to kill some time without having to think too much
18465,fun but annoying when u work hard only to have raiders attack twice in a 30 mins time frame and lose ppl
18466,"Fallout Shelter is an excellent mobile game based on the Fallout series. Originally released on the Apple store, not much has changed in the PC port except for a few updates and tweaks. Essentially you are tasked as the Overseer of a vault, which you can choose to populate and design however you choose. Time management and planning skills are necessary, as you are faced with problems like radroaches and fires. You also need to manage your resources and the people in your vault wisely. Like the other games in the Fallout series, it is a unique addition, and it's free-to-play, but not pay-to-win structure is a bonus."
18467,I think it's a fun game that makes you think and plan ahead
18468,can someone please tell me how to play multiplayer?
18469,"I don't understand the hype with this game, people kept speaking highly of it, but, this game just pisses me off, long story short, Mobile Games just don't translate well to PC, it almost forces you to buy you're way out of trouble, atleast it's free to download and play."
18470,Good time waster to have on in the background. 10/10 will get addicted.
18471,Awesome!
18472,"It seems that the game is more intent on frustrating you to buy stuff instead of making it fun. The mobile version was better, this is just annoying."
18473,"In Fallout Shelter, the player takes on the role of overseer of a vault from the Fallout franchise.

You can construct twenty four different rooms within your vault, each of which serves a specific purpose. The dining room and water treatment facility will generate food and water to keep your people alive, while the power plant will generate electricity to keep all your rooms operational. You can increase your population by using a radio room to attract new settlers from the wasteland, and you can place male and female dwellers into living quarters so that they‚Äôll have children who will grow into adults. Other rooms will let you craft stimpacks, radaway, weapons and outfits (which boost the wearer‚Äôs SPECIAL stats).

Each room is linked to a SPECIAL stat (for example, the power plant requires strength) so ideally you need to assign people to work in rooms that make use of their best attributes. There are separate rooms dedicated to improving each of a dweller‚Äôs SPECIAL stats.

You can also build an Overseer‚Äôs office, which will allow you to send teams of 3 people on quests. Unfortunately this is where the game becomes extremely flawed.

The story on these quests is almost non-existent. Its mostly a case of ‚Äúwe need to find a thing‚Äù, ‚Äúoh look here is the thing‚Äù or ‚Äúwe need to find a person‚Äù, ‚Äúsorry you just missed them, try looking in this other location‚Äù. Fallout games usually have varied dialogue choices and multiple ways to solve quests. Fallout Shelter even has an achievement for making 25 dialogue choices during quests, but this is misleading. Most quests don't actually have any choices, and you can't control what your people say. My achievements page shows that I've completed 33 quests and only made 17 dialogue choices. This means that literally half the quests have 0 choices, and the other half have a total of 1 choice each.

The combat is also terrible. During quests you‚Äôll fight the usual Fallout enemies ‚Äì raiders, feral ghouls, mole rats, radroaches, radscorpions, deathclaws. (These creatures will also periodically attack your vault, which is a complete waste of time ‚Äì 3 enemies making a suicidal run against my 100+ vault population is not even a challenge). Your people attack on a cooldown timer, so they'll fire 3 times and then wait about 10 seconds before firing 3 more times, repeat. Enemies seem to attack quicker, so you just sit there thinking ""you're taking damage idiot, fire back"" while your people just stand there doing nothing.

The most infuriating part is that sometimes your people will randomly decide to move to a different position instead of attacking. But this serves no purpose. They aren‚Äôt moving to get into attack range. I've seen guys equipped with a sniper rifle move into melee range, and guys with a melee weapon or shotgun run to the other end of the room. Its just stupid. After making sure your people are equipped with weapons that have the highest damage values, the player will mostly just watch the combat play out, and occasionally click icons to do critical hits, and use stimpacks or radaway to heal your guys when they're on low health. If they die you can pay caps to resurrect them after the quest ends.

There‚Äôs also lots of waiting. Its a free to play game with microtransactions that was originally on mobile devices, so obviously the whole game is set up to try to make you spend money to skip the waiting. When you send people on quests, it can take anywhere from 2 to 15 real world hours for them to arrive there (and the same time to travel back to the vault after completing or failing the quest). You can also only have a maximum of 3 active quest teams, with a fully upgraded Overseer‚Äôs office. That‚Äôs 9 people on quests, even if you‚Äôve got 100 guys in your vault. You have to wait hours for babies to be born, and more hours for them to grow into adults so you can assign them to work rooms. You have to wait hours to train SPECIAL stats. You have to wait hours to craft stuff. Its pretty much a case of play for 20 minutes, get to the point where you can‚Äôt do anything else, close the game and come back a few hours later. But of course, you can use nuka cola quantum to skip the waiting and do stuff instantly, which you can either buy with real money, or occasionally find for free on quests.

Now, maybe you can say these criticisms don‚Äôt count, because the game is FREE. But when deciding whether or not to play a game, you don‚Äôt just think about the money. You think about the time investment as well. I‚Äôve put 18 hours into Fallout Shelter, and unfortunately I can‚Äôt say that I ever really enjoyed it."
18474,how do i uptain my free lunchbox
18475,holy shit i've already played 15 hours.

18481,"I fail to see why anyone who can play this game on their mobile smartphone or tablet would ever want to play this on PC. Maybe if you could link your cloud save between mobile and PC, but even still. This is a game designed for mobile devices and the gameplay just doesnt translate to a game you would sit down and play on your computer. Dont most people have their phones nearby when they're on their computer anyway? 

Its a fun game but I cant recommend it on PC."
18482,"A casual simulation game, originally released on mobiles in 2015. Creating and managing a vault might sound enjoyable but there isn't much to do apart from waiting.... 

Lot and lots of waiting.

When you remove the essence of what makes Bethesda games enjoyable (the exploration), this is the result. A shallow, joyless, uninspiring waste of time."
18483,"hey





that's pretty good"
18484,"I like Fallout Shelter for its simplicity. It's a really good time-waster if you have othing else to do. I like to play it in between classes just to kill time. It can get a little repetitive, but most phone games can. Overall, a really great small game."

18488,"Plus points:

Can be played for free and doesn't punish you for not paying money
Relatively fun and varied gameplay
Plenty of progression

Negatives:

Buggy as anything
Terrible port from mobile"
18489,"After spending hours and hours on tapping this game on my phone screen, i can finally click hours and hours more on PC now!!! Fantastic!!!"
18490,"Okay, this might come off as a tad hypocritical seeing as I do put time into this game and I do enjoy it despite what it is. But the thing is, what it is, is a skinner box game. Seeing as it is a mobile port this is hardly surprising as the majority of such games fall into that category, in fact I even used to play it on my pad before it came to pc up until the glasses patch where 90% of all dwellers were stupidly given glasses for some reason.

For what it's worth its not among the worst of such kinds of games, the replacement currency of nuka cola bottles aren't super rare or anything and lunch boxes, pet boxes and Mr. Handy boxes are all available as drops, nothing is really behind a pay wall so with patience it is very much a free to play game if you want it to be and have the willpower and patience required. But having said that, that's like saying it's a mild form of cancer. These types of games really shouldn't exist in their current form, and while I'm aware that having that opinion and still playing the game isn't very conducive, I can only shrug at that. I care, but I don't care enough to meaninglessly boycott and trying to drum up support for the cause, that's just the sad truth of it.

But I cannot in good conscience give this game a thumbs up, even if I can enjoy it, because I'm as far away from the target audience of these kinds of games as humanly possible, heck I even have it as an ironclad principle to never pay a single dime for something I can get for free (within legal limitations ofc). But the target audience for games like these, are gambling addicts, people who chase endorphines by clicking buttons and seeing flashing lights, dinging sounds and seeing bars slowly fill up, the proverbial Pavlovian dogs of humanity, the weak and vulnerable. The cynical mobile developers even call these people whales, and they are the small percentage of f2p players which keep monsterous games like these afloat. Because they actually pay for these games, and they pay ALOT. Much more than what is advisable and sane, because they're addicts, because they can't help it.

It's especially disgusting for a well established developer who are already making tons of money on actual games to dive into this cesspool side of mobile gaming. And I am a bit ashamed of being passively an accomplice in this but at least I'm not paying for it and never will, so there's that.

As for game mechanics, there are some ways you're getting screwed. One of which is the UI and the Rush mechanic. While it may say that it's 30% chance for an incident to happen, it's probably more accurate to say that you have about a 30% chance for an incident NOT to happen. I'm in no way exaggerating this, if it says 30% or higher, you're almost guaranteed for it to fail. I've even had it say 18% and it still failed twice in a row. Statistics-wise this may be possible, but it is in no way probable and I've had it happen with such consistency that I can guarantee that the UI is lying to you and like with all skinner box games/badly weighted RNG in general similar to one armed bandits, the odds are weighted against you.

Another failing of the UI is not giving you the information you require. There's no hard data being displayed on how much of a resource you are currently using, there's only a little line on a bar giving a weak indication. The further to the right the line is on the bar, the more of the resource you're using. But there's no compilation info available on how much you're producing in total, at what rate you're earning versus losing resources, so you're constantly either overproducing or struggling.

The available in game help is extremely lackluster and doesn't go into detail regarding anything either. Like how anything actually works. Is it better to have one power station with a full staff or two with half staff in each? Is it better to have two unupgraded power stations versus a single upgraded one? Is it better to have a few fully trained workers and are there any stats besides the primary room one and luck that matters at all? Does having low luck affect the rush mechanics somehow without it showing in the UI? What's the difference (if any) between the different types of weapons? Is it like in Fallout that they simply use different S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats (which is bound to become pointless once you've maxed all stats) or is all combat dependant on the same stats no matter the weapon? Does the DPS rate differ? Is there any reason whatsoever not to always use the weapon with the strongest attack available? 
None of this is mentioned or explained. 

And while some of these questions could no doubt be answered using spreadsheets and careful monitoring, why should the player need to put that much effort in? Having crossed the boundary from mobile to pc, I see no reasons why this game shouldn't be held to the same standards as normal games, at least when it comes to things like clarity in UI and explanations available. Mobile games look and function the way they do because of the limitations of the medium, these same limitations disappear when we play it on PC, so there's really no valid excuse for it, especially when they hope to monetize it the same way on here.

Another way a mobile game just isn't fit for pc consumption is the way you're intended to play. Mobile games are meant to be played a few minutes at a time, and this game even goes as far as to punish you for actually actively playing it. It does so in the form of incidents, which range from fires to various raiders.
Now, one could argue that without these events, it would get kind of boring with nothing happening and there are some events which even have some inherent reward to them, for instance defeating the raiders gives you caps as well as some random drops and even recipes, which is great. 
But there are also events which give no rewards and are only there to punish you/discourage you from playing at any length of time and waste your resources, and sadly every single other event except the raiders are just that. Feral ghouls, mole rats and death claws definitely belong to this category. You get no reward for killing them and you're usually forced to waste rad aways and stim paks when they appear. On top of that, you can't build anything as everything goes into lockdown mode when an incident occurs. 

The longer you play for, the more incidents occur. The severity of the incidents also goes up as you upgrade rooms and build up your base. So it's not a good idea to upgrade too many rooms too early.
I would also wager that the risk of some incidents occuring increase when you have an empty room, and some rooms are always bound to be empty so that could definitely pose a problem depending on how you build your base, as if an incident goes unchecked it will spread to adjacent rooms. You can get around this problem by building rooms like the storage bays and bunk rooms (which are likely to be empty most of the time) separated with one empty level with nothing but 2 elevators on it, but doing so is expensive, requires planning ahead and will only be possible during late game. There's also the possibillity that some of the late game incidents can bypass this, as I haven't really gotten to the very end yet in this version, but I know that so far it works for fires, rad roaches and mole rats at the very least.
But that's only helpful for the empty rooms, incidents can and will still occur in occupied rooms as well and failing a rush (which is bound to happen often seeing as the RNG is heavily weighted against you and the UI is lying to you) results in an incident as well.

Anyways, tl:dr; if you know you lack patience, have a disposition towards addiction and/or is just under the age of 18, I would strongly advise you to stay far away from this game. I  gain some enjoyment out of this game despite it being what it is, not because of what it is and only because I'm not its intended target audience."
18491,"Very addicting at first but grows very old, very fast. I would most likely still play this if i didnt do practiclly everything i could do in a week."

18496,"Not a bad game, Timekiller!"
18497,"Actually a very enjoyable game UNTIL you try to do some quests. The attack animations are SOOOO F.CKING SLOW that it takes centuries to clean one F.CKING room.

Great game to play on the side, as there is some waiting involved. 
I'd say it's a pleasant game for the low low prize of your sou....

No annoying ""Sign up here"" - or ""Click to subscribe to our Newsletter"" - bs? ---- Well WTH, why am I even bothering with a review then?

18501,"As you may already know, this game is a port from mobile devices and, I must admit, it's a pretty decent port. I haven't encountered any problems or issues yet (fortunately). I even brought the save from my Android device to Steam and it worked flawlessly.
It you're looking for a very casual free to play game, search no more. Fallout Shelter is super fun and I'm enjoying it more on PC than on my mobile phone.
For a more immersive experience, I highly recommend to play the game while listening Diamond City Radio or Galaxy News Radio."
18502,"Room has 1% chance for disaster
Room is rushed
Room gets a cockroach in it after the rush fails
Cockroach kills entire room of people armed with miniguns and rocket launchers"
18503,"This is one of those games that either wears off reeeeeeeally fast, or draws you so far in you can't stand to be away from your vault for too long.

For me it wore off just after the first week. 

There is terrible balance in this game, very unforgiving and seldom rewarding. When you ask for assistance via the forums, everyone tells you the same thing ""Don't get more than 49 dwellers until EACH AND EVERY DWELLER HAS A FREAKIN' LEGENDARY WEAPON AND OUTFIT."" Basically ""Don't play the game"" 

Best thing you can do is build about 6 rooms, get a mister handy, put a Diner, Power plant, and Water treatment on the same floor, and simply never play again.

Radscorpions will stop your game  solid, and whats worse if yo utake too long to defeat one, as soon as you do kill it, another oine spawns right after the other. Draining power faster than Mole Rats, draining health quickly, AAAAAAAAAND dealing radiation damage. Whats the official solution? Don't exceed 49 dwellers. 

Want to rush the medbay at 25% chance after a sequence of repeated radscorpion attacks? Too bad that 25% is all it took and it failed. The punishment? A radscorpion attack. Have fun.


I recommend the game to try, but I don't recommend playing past the first week. The game runs on REAL TIME meaning everything matters because you have to wait REAL TIME for things to happen. And it takes less than 5 seconds for all that work and progress to drop dead. 

Everything you know about Fallout, the armor, the weapons... .you can forget about all that because only SPECIAL applies. If you so much as STAND in a room with an enemy in the room on the other end of the room, you will steadily lose health and/or gain radiation damage. 

Expand your vault, but do not progress. Kinda an oxy moron isn't it? Because morons are the ones who programmed this asinine combat system.

While a quirky little human ant farm, it has MUCH WORK to be done before it is polished and becomes actually fun.

Sadly the forum community finds their illogical solutions more reasonable than admiting the fact that the game might just be flawed and needs a few patches, if only just better in-game instruction.

I'll keep playing it for a few minutes a day, I'll give it that much of a chance, but so far after ignorantly evicting about 7 perfectly useful dwellers in hope of curbing the radscorpion madness, I had a molerat attack that spread faster than I could assign dwellers to the room. The result was half the vault dying as the mole rats were in every single room except the Overseer's Office and I couldn't possibly keep tabs on every single dweller, happieness went from 96% to 82% in less than a moment.... not to mention the dwellers were still recoverign from the previous 2 consecutive radscorpion attacks, in whihc the medbay was drained of all its stimpacks fighting that one.....

Christ, the game needs work. Some game mechanics need some changes... 
No one gives a mole-rat's arse about my opinion though, I'm pretty sure on Bethesda's perspective, as long as they get people buying their glorious Quantums and lunchboxes they probably won't do anything about the game balance.

""Play by our rules, wuss. We are right and you are wrong."""
18504,"If this was played on a mobile phone I think it would be more enjoyable as a PC game (and I use the term game very loosely) it's awful. Basically a waiting simulator. Click to gather power, food or water and then wait. Once the rooms are ready click again to gather. 
The people do level up and you can give them items and send them into the wasteland to explore / do quests. Each person also has different attributes making them work better in a given area of the vault. Drag and drop them into a room and that's it. You can also get them to breed to make more people. That's basically the whole game play for 10% of the time, the other 90% of the time is basically waiting for something to do.
You do get rooms come under attack at random and your people deal with this themselfs but you can also micro manage your people to stop them from being hurt to much.

 I can see that after a lot of time and effort spent this could eventually become a semi decent micro management game, however getting to that point is itself a challenge with basically nothing to do but wait or pay real money to speed things along.

It is worth stating that the game continues to run in real time (1 minute of real life time = 1 minute of game time and each day in game takes 24 hours) even if you are not playing. So if you want a game that you log in for a couple of minutes click a few things and then leave alone while you play something else until the next day you can do that but it's not the sort of game your going to want to boot your computer up to rush back to. It's clearly aimed at mobile user where this sort of short term play works best. As a PC game... 

2/10"
18505,Great pick up + put down game. Is not P2W and can be played casually for a lot of fun. This is a real gem at a great price.
18506,"If you are going to spend real money or a good amount of time in this game: SAVE YOUR SAVEGAMES by yourself. Or you will one day maybe lose everything like me. your entire vault will be gone and you will have to start from zero. you ask why? because the savegamesystem is garbage. wouldn't recommend such a horrible experience. but if you are goint to play this, you now know what to do =)"
18507,"The Game is OK, sure not the best but still ok, even though i will rate it negative.

Why ? Cause its a Mobile Game, nothing else as a Money Generator and this shouldnt have a place on the PC Platform specially Steam. Mobile Games are the reason why stuff like Microtransactions sniffed into several Games and changed in other regards aswell. If Games like these reach a wider Audience because surely it isnt a bad thing but will change the way we pay for Games even more when things like this get mixed between AAA and Indy Games and reaching popularity what they usually do. Most of the mess with Microtransactions going back on PC and not many Developers and Publisher really want to invest into them to not hurt Sales. But with actions like this what do you think will happen when Publisher see this ? More Microtransactions, Paywalls, high priced DLCs and Season Passes, cut out Content, crappy Games etc etc, the List is pretty long in how Mobile Games actually hurt AAA and Indy Games.

Like i said the Game is ok but everyone who actually pays anything for it damages the Games of a Company what actually Developes good Games and expect Fallout 5 with Microtransactions !"

Easy to play,
Easy money grab.

Classic Bethesda."
18509,"My review isn't going to be a good one unfortuntely and the main reason for that is because every time I try to load my vault the game crashes over and over again. I've tried to look online for a solution but nothing seems to work and personally I think it's something to do with Windows 10 (I might be wrong about that). 

I am disappointed at the fact that I can't play this game on my computer and ever since I found it was free to play I couldn't wait to play it. If someone can help me with a solution or a fix that would be massively appreciated! 

At this moment in time I cannot recommend this game but I will say this, if you do want to play this game on pc (or any other console) be mindful that my problem can be your problem and if you think you would be able to play it give it a go."
18510,"Fun and addictive, but fairly difficult. Your probobly going to have to re-start a few times but its not Dark Souls."
18511,Let your kids play this and avoid having to teach them where babies come from. ;)
18512,"Very fun and addicting game.

Summary:
I give this game a 9/10, one of the reasons why I don't rate it a 10/10 is because it gets harder to get caps once you complete certain objectives. Yes, there are ways of getting them such as the stranger which gives you a random amount or the objectives and quests. Another thing is that it takes too long for something to speed up (such as the women who are pregnant). I would agree with many other people about putting a speed up timer somewhere to make things go a little faster. Overall this game is really fun."
18513,"I loved the game. It was great to be able to play for a couple minutes here and there. They even had a decent sale so I bought something.

I try and play today and my vault is gone. Just gone. Don't waste your time."
18514,9/11 better than league of legends

18519,Nice little addiction.

But i have one thing about it - when you dont play some hour your 'shelter' dies :/ because water/power anything didnt take independently
Dont worry if you take care of it your 'shelter' will be fine! 
I wish you GL in your 'shelter'! :D"
18523,"it seemed fine at first but things get out of hand quick and when it can wipe out your entire colony at level 25 with a few mole rats in one go leaves me fumeing at the fact it had taken me a few days to get there and then the game gives you the middle finger like that then they wont get any money from me.

Starts as fun but gets frustrating very quick. 

Dont waste your money."
18524,The only thing that sucks about this game is your chance to rush production of any room. It might tell you that you have only a 24% chance to fail but no matter what percentage it says you really have a 90% chance to fail. That seems to be true for any game on steam though.
18525,The Dark Souls of ant farms.
18526,"This game is so great, I actually begun to replay Fallout 3 (I don't have 4 yet). :)

A great vault simulator with a funny, cartoon-like gameplay, which is worth the series. It feels a bit slow at the beginning, but try to play it until you can build an overseer room and go to quests. Also try to craft some weapons. With these, the game gets more depth, and is really enjoyable.

I made everybody pregnant in my vault. 13 out of 14 woman. I ran around crazy to get the last one. Then I realized, that it was a kid. :) Then, after birth, I have sent the best moms on wasteland journeys with high caliber guns and the dads. :)

It's really free. You don't need to spend money to enjoy it."

even tho this game should be only on OS/Android i still like the PC version
now as a lot of people said here ealier some of the mechanics are not the best for mouse and keyboard actions.
but still a very fun little game specially for those who played the fallout series like me. 
its pretty much playing the regular mobile version on a bigger screen and faster loading screens.

but i definitely recommand this game more on mobile then the pc version"
18533,"[i] Vault-Tec. We'll be there! [/i]

Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play base/resource management spinoff from the critically acclaimed 'Fallout' franchise by Bethesda Game Studios, and runs on the now-familiar Unity engine. The game originally released on mobile devices (iOS, Android, etc) in 2015, but has been recently ported to and released on Steam at the beginning of April 2017.

Fallout Shelter places the player into the role of Overseer of a Vault, and has to build rooms, manage resources, keep attackers and threats out, and keep their Dwellers happy by assigning them to the workplace that suits them best depending on their S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats. A Dweller with high Strength performs best in a Power Generator, a high Perception works best in a Water Treatment Center, and so on. As well as workplaces, Dwellers can also be assigned to Residences (where Male and Female Dwellers can... *ahem* , leading to the birth of a new Dweller), Weapon/Outfit Workshops, Radio Stations, and many other rooms that I have yet to unlock.

As well as managing your Vault, you can also send out Dwellers into the Wasteland to find items, weapons and other items, or on Quests, which yield harder challanges, but greater rewards. Daily reports are also handed in each day, measuring up the average happiness of your Vault and rewarding you depending on the level of happiness. 

Life in the Vault is not all a bunch of flowers, however. Your Dwellers will find themselves in danger from threats both inside and outside of the Vault they live in: From minor workplace incidents such as fires and Radroach infestations, to bigger dangers such as Raider attacks and Deathclaw assaults. Without adequate weapon power and protective armor, Dwellers will face little to no chance of survival against those which threaten them on a daily basis.

Gameplay-wise, Fallout Shelter is designed to be a game that you have to come back to at least once every day for half an hour or more, as to cater to any uncollected resources, any new Dwellers who are seeking to move in, and constantly shuffling around and managing storage space and assigning new jobs to everyone. Another reason is travel/return times when a group of Dwellers travel to a quest location, which can vary from half an hour to over a day's time - much like the kind of gameplay you see in mobile games. Which kind of makes sense, considering this was originally a mobile game.

Following the tradition of obtainable 'premium' resources in mobile games, Fallout Shelter provides an in-game store where players can buy Lunchboxes (Containing random items and outfits), pets which can give major buffs to individual Dwellers, and Nuka-Cola Quantum, which instantly ends the cooldown period of any time-based activity. In most mobile games, 'premium' resources are a major curse to the games fun factor, which usually harasses players to cough up real-life money just so they can avoid waiting 48+ hours just for a weapon to finish upgrading, or something else which follows the same principal. However, Fallout Shelter gets the big thumbs-up from me by giving the player FAR more than just a few chances to obtain Lunchboxes and Nuka-Cola Quantum: In one minor Quest, I recieved 5 Nuka-Cola just by looting cabinets, and then a further 3 Nuka-Cola and a Lunchbox as Quest rewards. And this was only the first quest in the storyline chain!

The games graphics are a big change to what most Fallout players are used to in the main games. While Fallout 3 and 4 have realistic graphics and big open-world enviromments, Fallout Shelter ditches this for 2D cartoon graphics and toned down violence, making the franchise accessible to younger players and those who lack beefy PC specs. The games sound effects and music sound great too.

The only bad things I have to say about Fallout Shelter are perhaps the combat animations which lack dynamic elements (Imagine this: 2 Dwellers and 2 Raiders running about in a room, the Raiders are armed, they fire off 2 shots, then just stay in a standing animation for a few seconds before firing again), and the fact that the game doesn't really have too much of an endgame goal: Sure, completing all of the Quests, filling up your Vault to max Dweller capacity and unlocking all of the rooms, weapons, outfits and pets will certainly take a very long time indeed, but there's no big endgame boss or encounter to fulfill.

9/10. [b] By avoiding the problems which plague most mobile games, Fallout Shelter manages to be a brilliant base management game which entices the player into caring about their Vault and Dwellers for a very long time indeed. The fact that the game is completely free too only adds to the games appeal factor. Very highly recommended. [/b] ^.^"

18535,If the sims and fallout had a baby
18536,"Oh how i love fallout games.
This one is not an exeption.
Simply fun.
In this game you are Overseer of one of the Vault.
You have to take care of its dwellers- supply them with jobs, food, water, electricyty.
Sometimes you will send them to wastelands for stuff, sometimes there are quest to complete.
On quests or in the wastelands your dwellers will kill ghouls, radscorpions or other creatures.
There is great amout of loot to collect- weapons, outfits, parts for crafting, pets.
And remember - dwellers need a room for... other activities to ;P

Some said that it is poor port from mobiles. Well this was a mobile game few years ago but it is safe to say it have evolved. There is tons of new content since original release.

Still it is a simple.... mayby even casual game.
If you think you stumbel upon strategy game in world of fallout... think again.
It's simple time killer. But it is good!"
18537,Better quest's than most of FO4's
18538,"I like the art style, pretty cool. Game feels smooth and fun. Good idea for a game! ;)"
18539,"it's a good game, hope they deaf friendly"
18540,"TL;DR - Don't spend money on this game, especially if you play on multiple devices, or care about your save data syncing correctly.

Fallout Shelter is worth checking out for the first time, or returning to if you haven't played since it initially launched on mobile (lots of interesting new depth with crafting and quests).

The fun just ended for me, though. Lost a week's worth of progress due to Steam Cloud Save shenanigans (booted up a laptop I'd left the game running on over a week ago). The game generates 1 backup save that I found after digging for a while, but it was overwritten before I realized what had happened. Lost over a week's worth of progress.

Syncing is destructive with no regard for time spent in game. There's no confirmation/indication that you're stomping local saves with cloud saves.

I've written cloud save integration, for Unity games even. I know the Steam Cloud API is garbage, but you work around it by building redundancy into your local saves, then sync the whole lot of those, and implement your own UI to guide users through reconciling cloud vs. local data.

I'm flabbergasted that you're taking money from people with such a terrible cloud save solution in the game. Especially where redeemed purchases can be affected."
18541,"I did not like this game.  It is irritating.  Also too small to see anything.  
Good idea but not very playable."
18542,Mobile bunker game
18543,it is a fun fallout themed base builder i think it is a overall good game. it is such a unique game that you really don't play but more watch it is kind of a virtual ant farm it kind of just expands without you really doing anything
18544,"One of those games to entertain you for about an hour or two a day, Enjoyable. Down fall that occured to me though, I right clicked on a ""Build"" button and it Bluescreened my computer, upon attempting to relaunch the game a few hours later, after an obvious restart, All of my Saved Data is now gone."
18545,its fun for awhile but just another pay to win .
18546,Fun and addicting. They found a balance between playing for an hour and also coming back to check up on things.  I turn this on every morning and before bed to check out my shelter. One draw back is the instore goodies are saved bound not account.
18547,"I hated the phone app, but the pc version is very fun to play."
18548,"fun GAME but this game cant safe your game properly. dont waste your time and money buy item lunch box pet robot and playing this game you will gona crazy later when your vault gone ""NOT MORE EXIST IN SAVE VAULT"" without reason. bethesda didnt care your feling they just care your steam wallet."
18549,"I fricking hate the Radscorpions



Other than that i love this game!"
18550,"this game is so cool
"
18551,"I've played a bit in the past 2 weeks and it is a game you may like if you're just looking for a casual game you can play once in a while. I was logging in every 5 hours or so for maybe 30ish mins and soon enough, my saved file got corrupted and my vault was gone. :) Good game considering its free."
18552,It's a good game for 'free to play'
18553,"It is a very enjoyable building game.  If you decide to be destructive, it is very difficult to kill them off entirely.  Still, what goes down must come up so the Dwellers come out of the vault on quests.  There are a lot of puns and pokes at society.  I enjoy the humor throughout."
18554,"Very fun, especially once you unlock the Overseer's office. I love the references to the original Fallout games and the characters you actually see in game. This is more of a stategy game, I guess. I mean, not really, you just can't expand your vault too fast. But other than that, I love it - and it's a plus for those who can't get it on their mobile!"
18555,"Great Post-apocalyptic, survival game."

18557,nice game
18558,"this game is great, i first got it on my phone and its been super addicting with every update. but i think this game would be the best if it had a co op or even a multiplayer mode. i would love to be able to play this game with my friends, and have someone be able to look after the vault with me and do quests and stuff. it probably wont be added anytime soon but something like that in fallout shelter would be awesome."
18559,"i had this on my phone and now i have it on PC, i love this game"
18560,"A great and truly Free To Play game.  It plays both like an idle, and an active game, where you get more action and fun for watching the game play, but can also do a few things and close the game, letting things happen why you are away.  You can get everything you can buy, if you just play patiently and enjoy the game.

It has some rules for when it is not maximized that I don't quite understand.  I think you are supposed to be able to idle it in the background while playing other things and be alright, but I've had harmful incidents occur while idling that could have been disasterous if I wasn't better set up.  So I try to either play active, or exit the game if I'm not ready to watch over it closer.

Also, there are some issues if you play to expand too quickly, and more harmful enemies might come before you are ready for them... the moral, take your time, and be prepared (possibly look up some guides as well)

The game plays so well without having to pay, that I'm actually having a hard time trying to find something to spend a little money on, because I feel the game deserves it, but I can't find anything to buy that I won't get for free with a little patience anyway."
18561,So much better on Steam than mobile.
18562,much easier to control your vault than on phone i do recommend this game
18563,"Just some grind game, without buying those Vault Lunch Boxes you won't get far. And you can't go a day without playing otherwise your food and stuff won't get refilled. This ain't my type of game. I rather start playing Fallout 4 or Fallout New Vegas again. 

I don't recommend this game."
18564,"Its Pretty fun and addicting
"
18565,"First off: it's hard to not recommend you at least try something that is free. Go out there and see if you like it. The game is definitely better than it was on launch. There are quest lines, silly ""dialogues"", random locations when exploring the wasteland, and more.

That aside, there are some major issues with the design of this game. Or, rather, lack of its re-design for PC. And I am not talking about the timers present everywhere. The game was originally designed for tablets, where one ""button"" and dragging can do everything. This doesn't exactly translate well to PC though.

Steering. Both left and right mouse buttons can be used to move your view around the vault. They are also used to move dwellers around. Both done in a click and drag fashion. As the time goes, you will have your entire screen consisting of rooms filled with dwellers. Guess how many times you will drag the wrong thing around. Spoiler: quite often. At least you can also pan the view via edges of the screen. Then there's the problem that when you drag the dwellers around. The active zones for each rooms are probably their back walls, because the further away from the centre of the screen you are, the less sense it makes as to where you need to drag a person to drop them in a target room. Far enough up or down that zone is literally outside the room you are aiming at. Which brings us the a vide spread problem with this game...

Precision. Precision is something that this game does not require, but sadly also does not exactly let us participate in either. Rooms are three dimensional, with sprites of our dwellers and the enemies moving between front and back. This helps the immersion, but also causes a lot of problems of clicking on the correct thing. If there's a lootable object or corpse behind your characters, you will have to play around with the camera to hopefully see it, and only then click it. Health bars of the enemies also love to be layered one on top of another, so that you can't see the effect of your shots unless you are attacking the enemy most towards the foreground. Targeting specific enemies can also be a nightmare.

Same precision issues go for automatic prompts for using stimpacks and radaways. Radiation damage can reduce your dweller's healthbar down to 50% at most. Stimpacks heal 50% health. It would be logical to remove radiation before applying healing if you have full radiation poisoning. Prompts will usually have you heal dwellers first, then use radaway. It takes them quite some time to realize that it's time for a radaway before stims. ""Well let's do it manually"", you'd say. Great idea! Except you need to select your dwellers by sniping their legs, because clicking too high will apply the prompt above their heads. Guess hitting that prompt was too precise for tablets, so its hitbox is massive to compensate.

Then there are some utterly weird design choices like doing a critical hit automatically applying all stimpak and radaway prompts. Why? I couldn't tell you if my life depended on it. To hell with efficiency. Applying a stimpak on a fully irradiated person before radaway so that it heals maybe 2/3 of what it could is a great idea! The game knows better, shut up.

Then there are minor things like the mysterious stranger mechanic. He will randomly appear around the vault along with a sound que. You then have a limited time to find and click him for caps reward. Except the game just loves to drown that que sound with other sounds (so that you don't even know it's happening) or, better yet, give you the que and then immediately proceed to start a random event (e.g. raider attack) and take over your camera to shove said event in your face. Have fun having only half of the very short time to find the mysterious stranger. That is, after you use half of that to get the camera back to where it was.

This game has issues that could've been easily avoided. It's still playable though. And free. So give it a shot and decide for yourselves."
18566,at first i wanted to download clash of clans but that game sucks so i got fallout shelter.
18567,"Good game, lots of fun, free to play done right. 
can't move rooms. Totally shafted on trying to reconfigure your vault."
18568,Good game!
18569,Best free play game

- - - Always the same.. you are just earn the energy water or food (""kind of Stuid game"" press the button when it blinks) sorry but that makes it unplayable"
18573,it like playing sim tower but that tower is going down deeper instead of taller
18574,"DO not recommend this game at all, bug that was there in the mobile version, where saved vaults juts disappear if your pc or phone crashes, is still there, I lost all my items I had purchased, despite having steam cloud enabled, do not buy.. Bethesda have been totally negligent with fixing a bug that has been there since the game was first released.."
18575,"Can only use steam wallet for purchases.
Full of bugs."
18576,"I was enjoying it so much that I actually spent money on it, logged on today and my whole vault has just disappeared and I can't even get a refund for the money I wasted on a vault that no longer exists.

I tried to get in contact with support and they palmed me off to a FAQ that doesn't mention anything about losing your vault.

I'd suggest not spending any money on this game."
18577,"Having tried to get into the game over the weekend, I finally said ""screw it"" and uninstalled. I think I'd enjoy it if there was a casual mode where I could play around with the systems without things being ruined by an RNG-driven failure cascade, but it's incredibly unsatisfying to see a Vault representing a significant span of time ruined because you failed six dice rolls in a row.

On the plus side, the game's handling of offline time is far better than my last game of this sort, State of Decay. Here the game's representation of what went on while you were away feels fair, as opposed to that game's ridiculously punitive penalties for spending even one second with the game closed."
18578,"Quite addicting, and incredibly fun. However it can sometimes be a bit tedious, it all depends on how many resources you have!"
18579,"A Post-Apocalyptic Paradise

Faloout Shelter is one of my favorite free to play games of all time, I can play this game anywhere thanks to its multiple platforms , on the couch , in bed , while im eating , and anywhere else i can think of , it may not be like the other fallout Rpg or Shooter games where you get to roam the wasteland but instead you get to simulate overseeing your own vault of dwellersamd build the greatest vault the wasteland will ever see,

and if you get bored after playing for 30 hours or unlocked everything in the vault with max number of dwellers and semi max special just destroy your vault and make another one , thats what i did after playing for a week and ive been playing for 110+ hours now"
18580,Nice setup in my opinion it is better than the Xbox version and IOS
18581,its a fun game but hard to keep in good condition
18582,"normal mode - everything is pretty fine goes well just like regular fallout games
survival mode - OH GOD EVERYTHING IS ONFIRE AND THERE ARE BANDITS ATTACKING q~q halp~

Great Game <3"
18583,"It is a very good game, well balanced in survival and strategy.
I do recommend this game because; It's pretty fun to play/ 
a good time waster, and it's free to play. 
Get The Game!!!
"
18584,"i think anyone should play this game! its fun, but... they need to make it where you can auto-collect your lunch boxes, mr.handys,etc"
18585,I can't believe I actually like this game.
18586,"It's fun, a good time waster, and good way to waste 10 bucks every week because of lunch boxes and pet carriers. :)"
18587,"its awsome as long as your on it 247
"
18588,I LOVE THIS ITS THE BEST (Btw get the starter pack it helps soooo much)
18589,"Incredible ""free to play"" value. Base building/mangement game with lots of replay after multiple updates have added additional things to do (quests).

Played this a bit on Android but now it is available on Steam with achievements. It does have ingame purchases but you can get anything in the game via playing, given enough time. Can easily pick up and play for 5 minutes or a few hours."
18590,"FOOD SUPLY LOW!
RUSH!
FAIL!
OH WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT! THERE'S A FUCKING FIRE!
THAT'S ALL THIS GAME IS!"
18591,"Two words, Amazing game, this game is the perfect combonation of survival and tycoon! You'll never find a tycoon that is as exilerating as this one! Highly reccomened for the begginers of the Fallout saga!"
18592,"Played about 10 hours. Game was mostly fun, but randomly crashed and was unable to get it to run again. Completely crashes on startup, no matter what I do. Was not impressed."
18593,"A lot like candy crush. It is ¬®free¬® if you have a lot of patience and dont mind waiting for hours and hours. If you are willing to pay for not waiting hours maybe you will get some fun, If not, like me, you will get bored really soon."
18594,"Me: Time to check on my vault dwellers!
*loads game*
*Death claw encounter*

Me: Ehh, maybe another time.
*X's out of game

10/10"
18595,"Noice game, luv it"
18596,"I really like the game not going to lie, and come to think of it I don't really have anything nagative to say about it. I think."
18597,"Great game to pass the time as you build a shelter for the surviors of a nuclear war.  You do not only have to build a shelter but use ballanced stratagies for your resorces to deal with raiders, fires and other issues as the arrise. You must do all this while keeping your settlers happy.   Do not worry about building too fast as new parts of the shelter come available.  Worry about making sure your resources are strong and can withstand misfortunes as they arrise.  You will also be able to, as the game developes, use exploration parties tp gain resources in the  waste land."
18598,Good game but dont buy any lunchboxes or starter packs cos it is per vault and there is easier ways to get them for free so dont but a worth while game.
18599,"Good, smooth, and a really great game overall! I really recomend Fallout Shelter.#this game is awesome

18600,Radscorpions ruined this game.
18601,Windows Only for a Unity game ?

A strategy game in which we manage our own crypt.
We give orders to the residents and build other necessary rooms.
In our crypt we must take care of contentment, drink and food.
Our base is exposed to attacks by bandits and monsters. That is why it is worth equipping every inhabitant with a weapon and a good armor.
We can send our residents on various trips in which we can find many useful things.
To facilitate or speed up the game, lunch books and Nuka-Cola bottles were added.
For me 6.5/10."
18606,nice to see bethesda going out of their comfort zone. 10/10 minus the unecessary microtransactions.
18607,"Very Nice
"
18608,worst crossover ever!!!!!!
18609,CAN'T AFFORD FALLOUT4
18610,"LOTS of bugs.  Suffers (sometimes severe) stuttering at some point in the growth of the game depending on the power of your device (have a platform that is pretty close to bleeding edge or be prepared to limit growth substantially).  Controls are imprecise and create errors in game play (moving Dwellers instead of the vault view, etc...).  The game has an auto zoom that is not optional and forces a redisplay at the most inopportune of moments.  Overlapping events make game play difficult, especially when the auto zoom feature decides to enact itself.  The cost of packages is too high (just because you CAN get that price doesn't mean that you SHOULD).  Important Dweller info is scattered over multiple menus making it difficult to evaluate moving or changing resources (weapons and armor).  Great concept, fun to play (and I DO still play it, for the moment.  But, I am getting more and more frustrated), but loaded with annoying little things that make what could be a great game into something much less than it could be.   I'd give it a middle reccomendation if it existed, but since my choice is only Yes or No, it will have to be a No."
18611,"I don't undrstand why people like this game. Its like staring at an ant farm waiting for something exciting to happen. Aside from the deafening boredom, many core mechaninc are not explained. Like how to deliver a baby. Spoiler alert: log off and wait 3 hours. I mean wow.. breath taking game play there guys."
18612,.
18613,Good
18614,"Iv'e Played 5 Hours overnight , getting sick and quiting for 1-3 days...
Then when i came back i had to reduce/control my time on the game

If you enjoy life-simulation games you will love this or at least enjoy it. Its worth a try.
Its free to play, but pay to get the full experience. And i can't wait to spend some 10$s for pets & lunchboxes !

I've Played it for 7.2 hours for the last two weeks/on record. And i did not expect this much content in one game. The timer part of the game makes things more real but also longer than you would imagine to do normal stuff, but even if you play the game with never paying anything - aparently its not too expensive in the beginning. 

I rate 10/10 as of 4/16/2017, I dont expect it to be perfect as anything, but it definitly will hook people like me. 

My recommendation is to make a timer for 1-2 hours when you play so you dont get too into a ""overseer"" 4 lyfe mode (If that makes sense)."
18615,"It's OK to play. 
It's free but you will end up spending $20 on lunchboxes to get past the 30-50 person part.
One thing I hated was that every time I clicked on the next vault person their stats would go away and/or it would automatically zoom in. I think that's a result of it being a touch screen port."
18616,"Many people will probably tell you how great this game is as a time waster. Well, whatever you think about gaming - wasting time is not one of its purposes. It is perhaps one of the reasons why I cannot recommend this game. It promises more than it really delivers, gameplay is long and boring (for most of the time all you can do is sit and wait for something to happen...), graphics are not what one would expect from Fallout and, overall, apart from the postapo flavour it has, ""Fallout Shelter"" is not a good game.
Pros:
+ Fallout!
+ Fallout!!
+ Expeditions and quests

Cons:
- Boredom
- Not much you can really do
- Some elements are poorly done (raiders' attacks, accidents, infestations)
- Other elements make you wait for ages for the result (expeditions, pregnancies)
- Graphics!"
18617,"I played this game when it is still in mobile version, droped it for a while but find it quite different to the mobile version of it.
Anyway, I hope this game will develop more because there is not many things to do once you reach the population over 100."
18618,I don't know why but this game is fun and addictively to me
18619,"I have played Fallout Shelter on PC using Bethesda Launcher (without spending money) for some time and now on Steam for short amount of time (spent about 10‚Ç¨) and here's my thoughts.

I think some people are overreacting when it comes to Fallout Shelter in my opinion. Yes, it's free-to-play game with microtransactions, yes it's mobile game port, and yes it is sorta cash-grab game, but some people ignore the fact that you can manage without using real money to buy lunchboxes, nuka-cola quantum etc. Since this is a spin-off game, I don't mind that it doesn't have anything else to do with Fallout other than the setup, characters and equipment. It isn't a canon, so just having characters like Three-Dog in your vault is actually a bit funny and it doesn't take away from the main series.

I might be greedy capitalist for saying this, but I don't mind the microtransactions in this game. It's a free-to-play game, so Bethesda needs to get money from somewhere and thats OK in my book. You can manage your vault without spending money if you don't build too quickly and take a lot stimpaks for quests, while also saving some of them incase of accidents and raids. In fact, you can get lunchboxes and other stuff (that can be bought with real money from shop) from challenges and quests. In-app purchases mainly boosts your speed in gameplay. While it is technicaly a pay-to-win, I should mention that this isn't a multiplayer game, so it shouldn't be that bad. If there is something to complain about MT's in Fallout Shelter it's the fact that you lose every lunchbox when you lose the game. It doesn't transfer your items to other vaults even if you wanted that, so money would not be wasted. If I'm wrong on this issue, please correct me.
It's purely your choice if you want to spend your money on Fallout Shelter. Find out what they do, what you could get and are you willing to spend money on them? 

But what about the game itself? I'll make this short, because I'm lazy.

GOOD:
+Art style is typical Fallout and vault dwellers' look is based on Fallout vault boys/girls
+Though limited at early stages, you can customize your vault dwellers and your vault
+Legendary characters and items from Fallout 3 and 4 (No New Vegas unfortunately :( )
+Quests and random encounters offer something to do and you usually get good rewards.
+Simple gameplay, simple fun
+Free updates that usually add something new (quests are in my opinion the best one so far) to game and aren't just bug fixes
+It's free and a good time waster. Nothing too serious

NEUTRAL:
*It's up to you if spending money on in-app purchases are worth it. They speed up the game, but it's not mandatory to survive
*Since this is a mobile game, it's about doing something for 5-10 minutes and most of the time is about waiting
*Obviously this game isn't for everyone and it might be boring to some people. Understandably so

BAD:
-At later stages, the enemies are bullet sponges and that includes radroaches too (seriously?!!!)
-Some enemies have BS abilties (like teleporting) and weird enemy spawns (raider place with mole rats at front entrance), though understandably for gameplay reasons
-While microtransactions aren't that bad, however you don't want to lose since you lose everything when it happens
-Lacks the global inventory for your bought items

If there is a better mobile game, please tell me in the comments and also let me know if I missed something important or if my review has mistakes. For now, I think this is one of the better mobile game in the market."
18620,i love this game to peices but i have one problam.  i would like if we couldhava a steam market for items where we could buy and sell your items like weapons suits junk and pets if you could implement this my evvperiance would improve greatly but if you dont i wont mind but still a 10/10 game
18621,A very awesome game i recommend this to everyone even people who dont play fallout at all though water food and power sometimes go down way too quick and easy everything is else  amazing and is a very good game
18622,"Honest Opinion of this Game:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like the cartonnish style, its quite nioce. 
The vault designs are awsome, alotugh quite fuking expensive.
You can make a Literaly porn viedo with the amount of incest you can do.
FUKING RADEROACHES EVERYTIME.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And that Concludes my Opinion.
OH!
Almost forgot;
WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT WASTLAND STRANGER. I CANT FUKING SEE THE DAMN BUGGER. I LOSE HIM LIKE 15 TIMES A DAY. 
FCUK."
18623,"Great game, very fun, you dont even need to buy stuff in the inner shop to enjoy it. Only logic sometimes is a bit wrong here comparing to fall out series. But it is still lots of fun."
18624,"First week: Love it! It`s like theDon't starve but in fallout universe and 2D. Also F2P with microtransactions that doesn't hold a freebie from any content.

After playing it for 30 hours: Challenges got reset back to 0 then the game deleted my Shelter all by itself.

Great game. But no cloud for saves. And that`s a deal breaker."
18625,"You want a free game that is worth for your time?
Then you absolutely want this! The one and only Fallout Shelter.

The game have microtransactions? Yes. And it's just for speeding up the game progress. It's a waiting game afterall.
And oh shit i have to finish this review quickly, a group of deathclaws are invading the home base of my high-tech oldskool cavemen"
18626,Just look at the Metacritic review...
18627,"Check out my review for the game!

https://youtu.be/2Es92H4nS7k"
18628,"Windows 10:

Date and time settings -> Disable set time automatically -> Roll 7 days from this date. For instance if today's date is April 15, roll it up to April 22. -> Go to rewards -> Claim your lunch box .
It also works perfectly when you send your dwellers on wasteland expedition. Roll time a day up, and return them back in less than a minute. 

Iphone:
Similar process."
18629,Cash grab.
18630,Gonna be sooo good
18631,"Great game! Really free to play but also pay to get everything 10 times faster... So if you are up to the challenge and if you like the post-apocalyptic, retro-style of the franchise, don't hesitate!"
18632,Addictive. Yet if you do not know how to play the game or how the game works it is very very difficult!
18633,Fuck Radroaches
18634,Good game.
18635,xd
18636,"The combat system in this game is stupid... The visuals are not representative of what is actually determining the outcome of the combat.
It is just time based like everything else in this game... 

Here is an example... If you have 2 people shooting at 3 radroaches the roaches will die at random times even when your people are not shooting at them... And your people will suffer damage overtime by the enemies just being in the room with them... The equipment and weapons you stick on your people just improve these times but there is no real combat even going on in this game.

And this was what i thought the meat of the game could have been... But everything in this game is just timers timers timers... Nothing at all else... Not the combat or the exploration... building or relationships between your people... It is all just timers and randomness.

Its lazy game design.
"
18637,"A great Free to Play time waster of a game.
My only complaint is that the game uses typical F2P tutorials to make you wanna buy their microtransactions.

The game is 10/10 best Free to play game on mobile if you have the cash to spend

I'd give this game a 8.5/10 if you plan on not spending any money."
18638,"I lost my no.1 vault....game crashed,  error screen popped up and caused a hard reboot of my computer. when i got back into game, my vault had been deleted. anyone know how to get back a game-deleted vault? otherwise, i'm glad i spent zero on this bugged game...."

18640,pretty fun game
18641,Doesn't take much processing power. I like to keep it in the background while playing Hearthstone or somethin
18642,"Screen resolution error when trying to launch right from the install.

Verified game files
Latest drivers
Tried multiple resolutions

"
18643,"What I feel like playing Fallout Shelter ""so, I'm basically trying to have all my dwellers fuck, so I can make my vault more populated"" 
Overall it's a decent game, I keep coming back to play more of it."
18644,"I liked the game, until i got sent back to my vault the whole time when i tried to enter the quest. That means, i can not start a new quest and just lost my best weapons and armors because this piece of crap thinks its funny to load the vault instead of the quest."
18645,There are a lot of performance bugs in the game
18646,"Honestly, its just good fun."
18647,"Downloaded the game and also purchased a pack of 40 lunch boxes. The game ran fine and I played for around an hour using 10 or so of the lunchboxes. I saved the game and shutdown my computer like I always do. When I turned my machine back on in the morning, my vault and all my lunchbox purchases were missing. $9.99 down the tube on the pack. The game is free, but this is a bad sign. I've reached out to Bethesda on the matter, and we will see what they do to make it right. For now, it's a no for me.

**Update**

Automated response that sent me to Bethesda. Basically a big middle finger to your issue. I'll continue to message them to fix their broken game because it seems like I'm not the only one they robbed."
18648,Such an amazing game! I love all the other fallout games that there are out there. Played them all.
18649,"The game is good if it's something you play in the background while doing other things on your computer. Not as convenient as playing on a tablet, but it does require a lot of attention since the resources run down quickly and emergencies happen frequently. Also, because of the nature of the save file system, I lost a save that was pretty far along on both the computer and the Steam cloud. I'm guessing the initial save was corrupted on my save and exit and then uploaded and overrode the one in the cloud making both corrupt and unrecognizable. Because it doesn't use multiple slots per game because of its Mobile game origins, I've completely lost that vault forever :(. Ah well, c'est la vie. If I had actually spent money on it, then that would've been a tragedy.

TL;DR: Game requires a lot of attention, but isn't very exciting on PC. Also, glitches happen to make you lose your game and all your progress."
18650,"You dont have to bother with microtransactions, just go the nexus and download stuff on there in order to progress the game or to experiment with it :))))"
18651,"Defenetly must play, especially if you played any other fallout series games. Game is fun challenging and has a big variety of clothes, weapons animals and of course dwellers. Love it !"
18652,"Got lucky with my 2 legendary dwellers that I got and now I'm ripping through quests like there's no tomorrow.

Also, the microtransactions are super unintrusive. Love it. :)"
18653,Not sure why I've played 3 hours or even find this game enjoyable but I do
18654,"was the best RTS for smartphone and also just the best game for a smartphone ever but of cause it's waitting game so do something ingame and then do something other/playing other games/Youtuber/music/watch movie's also it's more then just RTS, it's also a RPG and you can build everything in this game from Fallout aka all outfits and all weapons, well give it a try, it's alright fun and really good if you want to burn sometime wtih mini nuke's
also forget yea you be a idiot and use real money on the game but why? i got everything on the smartphone version aka i got all buildings you can build and never use money on the game also way hard and more fun wtihout using real money on it, if you use real money on a game like this then why even played it? you did buy your way out of the hard fun parts"
18655,"can't recommend, it has horrible game design flaws and the port from mobile to pc made it worse.
- crucial tips like ""the special endurance increases the dwellers hp each time they level up."" have to be seen at random during 1 secong long loading times or by going through wikis / reading guides.
- even worse the room to increase endurance is only unlocked after your vault increased drasticly in size. So resulting in dwellers that have little to no hp and radiation resitance (VERY IMPORTANT STATS)
- so you name dwellers after friends and families and what ever you fancy and then realise that they half way to max level and have next to no hp. So the game encourages making vaults with dwellers you care about but then fucks you over by not giving you crucial information and ruining their stats in the long term.
- those stats become ever more important, if your vault increases in size stronger monsters attack and so far the worst is the radscrorpion, he teleports / digs from room to room, radiates and kills ever dweller in the room and more than once even a full room of highly equiped dwellers can't kill him AND WORSE HE SIPHONS ENERGY, ONE SINGEL RADSCROPION CAN BRING YOU FROM 4000 ENERGY TO 500. It's mindblowingly stupid 

So you might think now ""hey just don't level your characters up until they have endurance maxed"" which is what i thought but then you come to realise that the port is utter shit because the game more often then not interprets your ""i click in the VERY FAR CORNER of this room to harvest the energy and not click on a dweller."" to HE MUST WANT TO LEVEL UP THE DWELLER.

sorry for all the caps, save your time, don't even start this -.-"
18656,"Literally unplayable. Unable to set a custom vault id, moving the mouse resets the id to the random one chosen. Xbox button overlay. Screen flickers when mouse is moved. Worst game I've never played."
18657,10/10  Harold is with fatman is best guard.
18658,"The controls are Not Good. Selecting people and moving them is made for touch controls and not mouse. 
Completely RNG based game that relies more on rng as you play and late game is just horrible because you can roll rad scorpion multiple times in a row and just lose the game"
18659,"All was fun until my vault gets virtually raped by consecutive incidents of deathclaws, mole rats, feral ghouls, and fire.  

When I'm about to recover mole rats infested a vacant room and spread quickly, effectively wiping out my entire vault due to shortage of stimpaks after surviving the incidents mentioned above.

I did the ultimate resolution by rage quitting my vault.  

R.I.P. Vault 259.  You'll be missed."
18660,"This can be a very addictive game because it combines the best of the beloved [i]Fallout[/i] lore and characters with the game mechanics of [i]Sim Tower[/i]. The main (perhaps only) downside to this free-to-play game is that exists for a single reason: to make cash money (for the developers) for perks purchased in the game. For this reason, the wait-to-complete resource gathering can be very tedious in the beginning stages of the game, and you (like me) might find yourself ALT+TABbing out of the game to do other things while these timers run out. If you can weather these bits, expanding your underground empire can actually be quite satisfying."
18661,"Actually love this little game, keep finding myself going back to it every time I have a spare ten minutes or so. I had played it on mobile before but quickly found it unplayable due to lag and battery drainage. So pleased it's now available on pc, I can build a huge vault and not worry :)"
18662,You just kind of wait and do nothing.... then click... this must be what Godus was like.
18663,Well when I accidentally duplicated a Dweller by watching YT and playing this game APPARENTLY crashes it and caused my Dweller to be duped...Then the next few weeks...I got sent a EULA. XD
18664,"Fun free game to play, better on pc than phone in my opinion as easier to navigate and make the most of it."
18665,"I'm really surprised with this one. There are quite a few free to play games based on popular series, which aren't free and are made only to milk some money from fans. How is Fallout Shelter? It's not pay to win. Sure, you can spend some money and have some things done faster, but that's everything. I played (while making this review) this game for almost 13 hours in total and there wasn't a single moment when I thought that I need to spend real money for something. Maybe the beggining of the game is kind of slow and boring, but once you get quests and build something more than few basic rooms, that's when it starts to get really fun. And it's all for free. Try it out yourself and see if you will like it."
18666,"Hello, I have played this game for 5 hours. First of all, It's cool for people who does not have a job (jobless) , always try to look at the game screen to click and click to collect power, water and food and waste time in life emuation evacuation bunke. 
From my point of view, the most interesting is about to read journal log from explorer who has been assigned to go to wasteland. 

For people who like me, want to have funt but not waste my precious time , you should not play this game. 
Bye bye this game. 

Positive point, I am kind of interesting the life of explorer in wasteland and I have not played Fallout ordinary version. I would like to try and buy it."
18667,if's free so why not but don't waste money on this
18668,"A pretty decent time-waster with tons of content to unlock and regular updates. Steam Cloud support is much appreciated. Like most F2P games, it can get a bit old after about a month or so, but it's a month of free gameplay. Recommended."
18669,"If you love the begining part of Fallout 4 in the vault and you want to be incharge of one? Well, this is your game! Highly recommend this game. 

Pro's:
-Great time consumer
-Fun to play
-Stragedgy
-Game is free
-Its on your phone
-And Much much more!

Con's
-I personally think this game would be even more cool if it was in 3d and you get to run the vault.
-Boring somtimes"
18670,"Great game, Got a man out of a lunchbox that had great stats, he had children with every woman in the vault. The children grew up..He had children with them as well. The cycle continues. My Dwellers stats are getting better with every generation. 
10/10 would reccomend!"
18671,"Great game, super addictive."
18672,"There are some things I like about this game, but every game has its cons as well, but overall, an amazing game."
18673,I realy like this game i have this on my phone and i always play on it.
18674,I like it but you cant beet fallout nv
18675,"Somehow ""Death Claw"", an enemies that so Strong, so powerfull and Fast in fallout series is weaker that a ""radroach"" in a Quest that needed Dwellers level 20+


9,8/10 - So Great i can play it in my PC"
18676,"This is one of the best free to play games on Steam.

Play if you like games where you manage resourses in order to achieve goals.
You play the role of an omnipresent overseer in a vault, and you must try to make it grow and succeed in your objectives.

Fun game! And you don¬¥t need to play for hours to advance, since you can set things up, close the game, and come back later to see the results.

-----------------------------------------------------

I dont recommend this game anymore.

My saved game just disappeared for no reason, so I just lost my progress and my time."
18677,"Very addicting and interactive, time just flies by especially when waiting on that mysterious guy to pop up or go into a quest vault.
But do something about radscorpian attacks, i should not be prefering deathclaw attacks to ONE radscorpian."
18678,Download for Free! and spend your $10000! for lunchBox!
18679,very fun side game to run between dota/seige matches.
18680,Amazing But Crashes often
18681,Oh its not as bad as everyone says. It's a time killer but you don't have to spend money to enjoy it. Though you probably won't unlock everything unless you do (lots of RNG in rewards in game). And it has better controls than the mobile version imo.
18682,Keeps deleting proogress from a certain point where i only had like 13 fucking dewllers.
18683, Very dissapointing ... Spent around 2 hours playing out of that around an hour trying to figure out weather this is supposed to be an idle game or not ... It is just that boring (and I like idle games...) another 30 minutes staring at the screen checking the timers to go on ... Overall - not worth your effort
18684,Awsome game
18685,"Excellent game but is not worth any money you waste on it, its not a pay to win."
18686,Very bad drag and drop that makes it frustrating at times.
18687,its fun
18688,gud game
18689,"kool game, better for mobile device"
18690,"it's better then fallout 4

it's a good game, it's a good mobile game, IT'S A GAME WHERE THE MICROTRANSACTIONS ARN'T BULLSHIT AND ARE UNEEDED REALLY, and it's a whole lot better then fallout 4"
18691,Was one of my favorite mobile games and I plan on playing it for a while on PC as well!
18692,"The game is good for what it is and there are many elements to like.  However, you should not spend any money on this game until they get the save corruption bug fixed.   I lost almost 40 hours of play because the game locked up and corrupted my save and backup save at the same time.  

It is free and since you are on the PC you don't have to pay for any of the packs, but still the time loss is something to consider.

If they fix the save corruption bug, then it is a 5/10 type of game not terrible, but only as a filler between other games.

They also need to fix an interface bug which causes the vault screen to shoot to the left and all you can see is blank rocks.

Finally achievements do not reliably pop with this game."
18693,Fun game to pass the time with
18694,"Great game, way better than the mobile version in my opinion. My only problem is that every single time I launch the game and get the Dweller from the Radio room, I get a Deathclaw attack. This happens about 3 times a day. Complete bullshit. Kills just about everyone on the upper floors of my vault."
18695,"pretty fun game almost as much fun as fallout 4, minus the traveling all over the place"
18696,"I did try and tire of Fallout Shelter back in 2015 when it came out for Android. As a Fallout fanboy I of course clicked again when I saw the Steam debut. Two years ago I got bored of the micromanagement right quick and called it a day, this time around I found the game (now) has quests and quests I have been doing for almost the entirety of my 19 hours.

The game's been designed to make you buy power-ups, but as things such as VAC bans are hardly an issue here, I Cheat Engined myself 99999 Nuka Cola Quantums and skipped any and all countdowns. Some of them would have been a real pain - 11 days just to craft 1 theme to get 1/8 of an achievement, for example. Did manage to get all but 3 achievements - 100 objectives, 50 raider attacks and 20 legendary dwellers are too much of a grind even for someone as pedantic as myself. Human lifespans do have a limit to them.

This'll hopefully be the only Fallout game I'll ever give a negative review to. Although Shelter does get you hooked very well from the start, quests are mildy funny and it feels good to score phat loot, without hacking you wouldn't even have that. So unless you're a vampire and don't mind waiting for 14 hours for your dweller to get back - there are better Fallouts, there are better micromanagement games."
18697,"Game sucks

Pros:

- Quest part is most and only exciting part of the game

Cons:

- Time consuming
- Some quests are taking 17hrs to send and return will be half of it , total time is 25.5 hrs. Of course you should use nuke coke to speed up , you should buy it with real money (game sometimes give nuke coke free from quests so rare) 
- You should check your units every 3-4 mins 
- Bug and mole!!! incidents are very damaging
- Incidents spread so quick to next rooms , maybe 2-3 secs, to stop spreading at least one person should be in the room if there is noboby in the room, be ready it will ruin everything (last mole attack killed my 4 guys and spent 21 injections out of 35 , 2 hrs lost)
- Addictive but you wont enjoy
- Rush production (I believe) it is broken ( 7 time failed in a row, it means 7 times incidents) 
- Power generation has bug, my power production is 30 , consumption is 20 , it passed 2 hrs , still I m in red ( there was no incidents in my power reactors)"
18698,good game. i burnt my hands while playing this game!! :D
18699,Fallout lets my girls get it on. Why do girls only talk in this game? It's just not realistic.
18700,Do not play this game if you're prone to gambling addiction. Game's full of microtransactions and loot boxes.
18701,"Exactly like the mobile version but ported to PC.
About time, since I can't see clearly with how small the screen on my phone is.

Everything I like about the original is still here.
Except the f*cking radscorpion attacks.
F*ck radscorpion attacks."
18702,ever since the update it wont let me play the game anymore
18703,"[JUST AN INTERACTIVE SCREENSAVER]

I have played 18+ hrs and I really wanted to like it ... but I failed.
The reason is, that [b]this is more of an interactive screensaver than a real game.[/b]

PROS:
+ Fallout lore
+ it's free

CONS:
- everything else

Most of the gameplay time you just CLICK CLICK CLICK on the rooms to collect power/water/food. 
The combat is totally LAME and random. And for the rest of the time you just stare at few rooms of your Vault and wait to CLICK CLICK CLICK to collect resources.

The ""game"" gets somehow better with quests and item crafting, but that forces you to buy NukaCola for REAL CASH to speed up travelling and crafting. Otherwise you have to wait REAL HOURS for your team to reach the quest destination (and eventuelly get their asses kicked hard in stupid combat). 

If you are OK with this, just play the game.
If you want an interesting micro-management game with strategic combat, then avoid Fallout Shelter."

It was a lot of fun, reached high tier rooms, weapon/armor crafts, also dwellers.

You don't really have to spend some cash if you're going casual like me. Free Boxes (Rares items and dwellers) and Nuka colas are plenty from quest and objectives. 

Guess the only things as a f2p i haven't touched are pets and mr. handy. So far, 8 hours of gameplay and already unlocked 80% of rooms and easily cheesing quest and wastelands with 4 of my rare dwellers from free boxes."

18711,"Seems fun and look stylish. Controls are still terrible. Moving camera or drag'n'dropping inhabitants seems to be really clumsy. specially, if you need to do it fast and accurate, like on survival mode. when you try move camera fast you drag accidentaly inhabitants easily. And when you try to drag inhabintant fast you only end up messing the camera very easy. It is really really annoying, specially when you cant save the game and end messing whole work with these problems. Game it self is really fun and simple. Still recommend this. Just have to have nerves of steel. the game itself has worked well without a problems."

You can't go wrong.

It's more of a mobile/background game than anything else though. It was developed as a mobile game (meant to be played in short bursts), and it's totally a 10/10 at that."
18722,So many raiders. So many attacks.

18724,"[h1]Post-Apocalyptic Human Resource Manager + Landlord simulator!!![/h1]

Yes, this is one of those ""PAY ME, I'M A MOBILE GAME"" games and no, I'm not a fan of the [i]Fallout[/i] series.  Though I've seen many people boot up [i]Fallout Shelter[/i] and thought to boot it up.  Needless to say, [i]Fallout Shelter[/i] is a non-canon spinoff of the original series.

Essentially, you get to play the ""Human Resource Manager"" and a ""Landlord"" in a vault filled with post-apocalyptic survivors.  Make them make your base thrive by generating food, electricity, and water.  Additionally, you can have your survivors make medicine and health kits as you build more and more rooms.  Of course, you're going to need in-game money too, which you earn by sending survivors on quests (or into the wasteland...they pick up resources you can use as well), leveling up survivors, daily bonuses for happy survivors, rushing survivors to complete tasks (risky since incidents may occur), or by spotting the ""mysterious stranger"" who appears in your base at times...good luck finding him in bigger bases, though...

The look and feel of this game may feel familiar to a few Nintendo RPG fans as the aesthetic feels almost exactly like [i]Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door[/i].  2D characters with similar animations while moving about in a 3D world.  I don't know if people who worked on that game worked on this one, but I feel like it was a good call to make this game feel more casual.

Overall, you give survivors a shelter in exchange for them becoming your slaves to push around.  I'm actually surprised that Bethesda is just giving this game away for free given the quality of it.  Yes, there are microtransactions, but I think you'll get along just fine without them.  Only sink money into this game if you really loved how Bethesda presented it or if you want to excel further into this game.  Sadly, after a while, this game does end up feeling dull.  Play in short bursts for higher satisfaction.

8.5/10  Try this game out, slave!  You live in MY vault and that's how you'll compensate for your stay in it!!!!"
18725,I can't even play without spending money...
18726,sometimes if I close my eyes and pretend the rad roaches arent there it makes me want to actually die less
18727,"Amazing, this game is really awesome about the fact that it‚Äôs not a RPG survival but a strategy perspective to a RPG survival. You actually control everyone rather than someone. Although the game is free to play still it is not perfect for PC I‚Äôd highly suggest getting this on your smartphone as it needs a lot of attention and working now and then. You have open the game repeatedly or keep it open. Unless you‚Äôre someone who is always around you PC the phone version would be a better choice also the fact that it was released on Android/iOs long ago it is suited for it.

Long story short get it on your phone"
18728,One of the best yet addictive building/management games. Especially loves the pun :p
18729,10/10 would go blind looking for the mysterious stranger again. but seriously i think all these phone fags are giving this game a bad rep i have no prob logging on every few hours  the games very fun havent bought anything so far and i dont see you needing to buy anything so all those bitchers complaining about it being a pay to win are completely wrong. all i can really complain about is 3 things. children should be able to train. the combats pretty naf and WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH THOSE PERCENTAGES like you have a 20% chance on a rush but it fails like wtf are the chances? let alone the fact that it fails multiple times in different rooms so ither my lucks very low or the chances are wrong.
18730,I love the game. I play this on my phone but got tired of playing on such a small screen so here I am playing on a bigger screen and its wonderful.
18731,"im 30 hours into the game with 81 dwellers and so i go to load it up now and the game will show the initial ""fallout shelter"" screen then when it goes to the loading screen where it will show tips at the bottom its just blank and then to game closes its self. i was hoping to buy some lunch boxes when 50% off but i guess thats not happening. I SWEAR TO GOD IF MY VAULT IS GONE I DONT KNOW WHAT ILL DO. PLEASE IM DESPERATE I LOVE THE GAME AND GOT SOME OF MY FRIENDS HOOKED TOO. DONT DISAPOINT ME. ill try again a few more times and hopfully it will work maybe tomorrow. PLEASE FIX"
18732,"This is a fun game. I would of play it ever now and then. Creating and looking after a vault is very fun. It is more fun to me, because I know it takes place within the world of fallout. I would happly recommand that other people give this game a shot. It is free so there is nothing to lose."
18733,Really fun time waster. 10/10
18734,Great little time wasting free game :)
18735,"So I was super excited for this game, played it on mobile a little bit and liked it but I never really can get into mobile games so when this came out on here I was more than happy to try it. I played for a bit on a test vault to get the feel of it and then made a new vault and deleted the old one. I spent almost an entire days time working on this vault (spread out over a few days; not one continuos session) and then one day I get on and my vault is gone! Almost 20 hours of work and $5 in in-game purchases gone. I contacted them about this by email and basically said here's my issue, I would like it if you could recover my vault if that's possible but if not I think I should get my money back. The closest thing to a reply I got was a general email with a list of forums (that I got almost immediately as if they only have the email to send out this auto-reply) which didn't help me at all. I don't think I will be getting any help as it has been a while now since I emailed them so I'm out $5 and a good bit of my time because of this. I don't recommend this game because even though it's a fun game this bug just completely ruins it..."
18736,"Just shy of 20 hours into the game and suddenly my save file no longer loads.

Done with this."
18737,"You need $99999999 money OR 999999 years of time OR to cheat the game. It is like typical mobile game that lead you to pay. The graphic and the concept are very awesome, but why Bethesda ruin the balance and lead me to pay? If this game is well balanced without in-game purchase, it would be worth to buy the game for $20~$40. So sad."
18738,"[i]Somebody's going to tell me about microtransactions again, and I will shoot him with Railgun. Really guys, nobody says, that you have to pay microtransactions. It's like free mobile phone's game. At the beginning - small commercial, that you can pay for additional help, but you [b]DON'T HAVE TO[/b]. Vault-Tec boxes you gain by making quests or making Vasteland Quests. The same with Mr. Handy or Animals. It takes a little longer, but isn't impossible to get.[/i]

[h1]It's really great game. Really. I may even make the thing that others do. Dividing it's cons and pros.[/h1]

1. You can change your dwellers names.
2. You can rule your dwellers into worst sh*t and they will still love you.
3. You can turn off game's music and listen some '80 songs, like I do. Or not.
4. You get Vault-Tec boxes, Nuka-Cola, Animals, Rare or Legendary Weapons and Outfits by finding them in Vasteland.
5. You don't have to buy anything.
6. Your dwellers love you as you could be their god. And you are.
7. You can make yourself there and be the best over dwellers.
8. Attacks on your Vault are easy, when you equip every dweller with gun. Also attacks are only when you're watching, no attacks while you're not in your Vault. Raiders are only three in group. And they all give caps.

[b]Cons[/b]
1. Start can be a bit painful.
2. You need to be patient. Because otherwise time will be your worst enemy.
3. To upgrade Workshops you need more dwellers. Problem can happen, when you need them, but radio is working slowly and dwellers in living quarters not really want to sex with each other. (radio is better imo)
4. Sometimes reward for Vasteland Quest sucks, so prepare for few bad rewards. But it's rare.

It's really good game. You've got Chiro's recommendation! If something's going to work badly... then you need to try again with a smile on your face. Like your dwellers do. Always. Until you die. Or even in grave."

18740,"I don't know why people are hating on this game! This is a great game that adapted from the mobile version. The game lags less and you can see the screen much better! Though it is not portable (except on laptops). Get this game and you will not regret it! Also it is not a ""Pay to Win"" game. I have so many caps and pets because of doing the right stuff. I also got lucky on a lunchbox, but anyways i think you should get this game!"
18741,its a good game
18742,good
18743,"It's not a game. There is no challenge to overcome. The way to progress through the ""game"" is to wait. That's it. The core gameplay is waiting. Not for me."

18749,Soo nice is a cool game!
18750,Nice!
18751,"Pro's:
+Free
+Great time waster
+ Satisfiying progression

Con's:
-Somewhat hidden game mechanics
-Can't keep it running in danger of too many random incidents killing your dwellers

Awesome free game. Great to boot up and play for a few minutes in between doing other stuff. 
My favorite time waster and the progression feels great. You have to wait for a lot of things but this gives a steady sense of progression. I'm glad it came to PC.
Do not buy any (loot) boxes, it ruins the game. You can get everything for free with quests and objectives. They don't really rub it in you face. 

Only real downside for me is the lack of easy accessible info on what specials do, quest difficulty, fighting mechanics on quests vs vault, ..."
18752,very good game! addicting and free!
18753,"Its fun, but it has appaling business model imo. This game is pay al lot or wait a lot."
18754,"Was fun on the Android when it first came out, but after maxing out several vaults, I had stopped. Now playing on Steam, and I'm enjoying the improvements all around. Nice that I can play in 10-15 minute increments. A welcome break from games that want to demand my attention for hours."
18755,Home builder in mountains xD
18756,i love the game i was waiting for a while for this to make it on steam
18757,love it great game 8/10 raiting put tons of hours in it in only a few days theyve added so much since the game 1st released. always on point like Bethesda always is
18758,amazing game works more smooth on pc than it does on mobile
18759,Awsome game but for some resene it wouldnt let me on fo i uninstalled then reinstallrd
18760,It would be nice if you could log in with your google account.
18761,GG
18762,"finally on steam with steam achievements, can use steam vallet to buy extras, was sick of the Bethesda launcher"
18763,"I thought it was a good game but i was wrong. i try to get up to 18 peeps and those dam bugs
 show up and killed all my guys and today the weapons  and other stuff dont show up on my displayed and now  after 3 bugs attack 3 times in a row  non-stop lost 10 guys in 2 room are
 dead and now the game just crashed on me ,dont spend money on this game just buy

18764,This game is meant for mobile. Even then It's a basic point and click game. Nothing to do except waste your life away.
18765,"I only wish people today were that happy, even though they aren't living underground."
18766,"Simple and Relaxing game, 
still buggy and this game need more battle and community features such as visit friend shelter and work together, trading, etc"
18767,incest isn't allowed unless their cousins... this the future nuclear holocaust not alabama.
18768,The fact that it's on PC makes microtransactions completely pointless. Good time-spender though.
18769,"A wonderfully addicting turn based game, ive spent hours playing, and ive only owned it for hours ^_^ for a free game this is a can't miss."
18770,This game is simple but complex at the same time you need to get resorces to build rooms for your fellow dewlers to get there hands dirty and make your valut a succsesful place for dewlers of all kinds to make there beloved home here.
18771,"I enjoy it, it's an easy game that doesn't really need much involvement, just have it on your second monitor. However, don't buy microtransactions, not only are they a waste but they also are only for your save. If you get your save corrupted/you die, you lose everything you spent real money for."
18772,"Pretty Boring game honestly.
I've played Idle games that were more engaging than this."
18773,Dank.
18774,"Optimised for PC, but not tablet.

Works great with a mouse and keyboard, but disappointed with the touch-screen interface: I play this on an Android tablet so I know the game can work well with touch-screen, but (at the time of writing) some of that functionality has been removed from this version.

If you intend to play this on a Windows tablet you're better off downloading AMIDuOS and running the Android version.

[The game itself is brilliant btw!]"
18775,Cute Game
18776,"Fun Fallout spin off. It has microtransactions, but if you have a modicum of patience you should be fine. I like the weapons, outfits, settlers, pets, jobs and the mixing and matching of it all. The missions really helped the game turn the corner by giving it something interactive to do while you wait for your dwellers to improve their attributes or craft or harvest resources. It's not perfect, but it's free. I'm cheap, I'll take that tradeoff. I enjoy it."
18777,Unable to get past tutorial.  Seems to be a bad port of a controller based game.  Not able to change it nor do I have a controller to play with.  Moving the mouse causes the game to strobe.  Hope it gets fixed but for no its a hard pass on Steam
18778,"This is really a fun game, and its faster on PC, and you can use W,A,S,D for faster scroll & Q,E for faster zoom
while draging a dweller,


there is also a draw back on switching to desktop and game, it sometimes hangs the game for a while when switching back to game
and the achievements, when i created a vault and like 15 achiv, and i wanted to create a new one, and deleted the said vault no other vault created, the achive, reseted to 0 / no achiv gained.


but 200 dwellers is really not enough to fill the 25 floor (basement) vault, with full protection, like you have to have a no merged room strategy to do make that work

ex: (1 floor has 8 room tile)
[food][water][power] [EL] [food][water][power][med][lab] [EL]
know why is like that? so that not so many (rad)roach/mole/scorpion will spawn like just 1 or 2 in a small room
if you have 3 rooms merged 
[food food food] [EL] [food][water][power][med][lab] [EL]
2-3 rads will spawn here, so make sure you have strong dwellers to put in 3 merged rooms
and depending on the max dweller count that is where rads enemy will get stronger
but the separe room strat is for mostly AFKs who are that busy"
18779,"Can't stop playing

It's better than Fallout 4"

18785,well its a good game. is it great no. it has its probelms but its a free game its not like you paid something to get it. so i do recommend this game
18786,"Cash grab added on steam, to milk money from gullible players. They didn't even bother to scale down the UI, its exact copy from the mobile version and its huge, but they sure invested time in the API to add microtrasanctions.

Cute game but lacks complexity. Its just a cash grab on the Fallout name. Still, better than Fallout 4 :)))"
18787,"This has hapend to me twice now. I have gotten very far in the game, finished bottle and cappy quest got some legendary items and some rare dewllers and I have to reinstall the game for some reson. If you know how to fix this issue or to tell a creator plz contact me asap. Even though the problems I'd still recomend this game."

18796,"This is a very good game

Pros- addicting, fun to play, mostly good graphics

Cons- very glitchy, crashes and black screens when you get far enough into the game

"
18797,This game is fun and enjoyable for those who love fallout. There for I rate this game 9/10 would always play again.
18798,"The developer needs to eliminate the gender-based sexism which allows only female characters to wear the Waitress Uniform, but cannot wear the Mayor's Outfit.    

C'mon guys.  Stop being lazy with the art modeling.  This is 2017; all outfits on all character genders.  I don't want to explain to my daughter that I won't let her play Fallout Shelter, because of the misogynistic messaging.

Edit:  To the douchetastic bigot gamerboys; unless your balls have dropped and you've had kids, you aren't qualified to judge.  If the game would only let women wear pants, and men could only wear dresses and be the catcher in a relationship, you'd lose your privledged MAGA shit.    Clearly you need to grow up, so stfu."
18799,Its is by far the best overviewer game of 2017 to me and alot of people. I really admire the NPC's and the animations present in this game. With the ability to control what each dweller does (as in a job assingned to them) and build whatever structures that are available in the game you desire. Other juicy stuff such as quests are amaizing and you get great loot each time you send a dweller to explore the wasteland or doing a quest. I strongly recommend this game to you the veiwer.
18800,crawl out to the fallout baby
18801,You like nukelear war survaiving and making a family this is for you. This game you need to spend allot of time into to make progress.
18802,"[h1] Note: [/h1]
[u]PC port and Bluetsacks (Android on PC) [/u]

Playing with mouse kind of ok (though there are hotkeys available). The best way to experience this game, is to play on a Mobile device such as iOS or Android 

[h1]Worth a try: [/h1] [list]
[*]Latest addition of this game is Quest, that gives extra reward and loot for your Vault

[*]Gunplay or Gameplay-style, it feels a bit like Real-time turn based/ combat-movement that has similarities to Final Fantasy (cant remember which one) or Kingdom Hearts but more simple style

[*]Like The Sims and Sim City, you have to keep your Dwellers happy. You can customize your Dweller's appearance, and outfit. Outfit gives you Bonus stats. 

[*]Like Sim City, your resource plays a big role, without food, water or electricity, it will give effect to your Vault and Dweller.
[/list]
This game is worth a try, if you are willing to put whole hrs into this game."
18803,"Pretty good game, some issues though. 7.9/10

Since I'm really bad at planning ahead on the spot, I've spent a lot of caps just moving rooms around. (Which is mostly my fault) I recommend looking at the IGN beginner's walkthrough to get a better grasp of the game, instead of me giving a few pointers. They have it all there.

The problems I've had were that it's sometimes really frustrating to click some people on one room to assign them to a problem area or whathaveyou. On the top floors are fine, but you'd think that if you hover your Dweller dead center or around a room it'd go to it, but it skews it a lil' bit above the room the further down the floors you go. 

When problems occur, you have to send your dwellers after the problem. Whether it'd be deathclaws or fires. The game expects you to have all of your dwellers to have good weapons to take care of whatever problem that's happening. The thing I just wish is that if there was an option to select a room and send the nearest dwellers there, or if a radscorpion to pop up it'd send my big guns people. (of course the smaller the rooms the weaker they are, so it should be fine if everyone in that room has a gun)

All in all, my opinion of this game is positive. I mark it 7.9 since the room hitbox issue is really annoying, but hey, it's better than most Free 2 Play games of this nature. 

P.S. Rip Vault 566. Pretty sure they're all dead since I've started working for a week now and haven't paid much attention. 

P.S.S Just make sure that the Minimum for your resource bars is no more than a 3rd if you're going to be busy all day. It should be fine for about 12hrs off-game."
18804,"Everything is great, just the same as on the mobile and all 
but as I already said about the mobile version:
PLEASE REMOVE THE ZOOM IN WHEN ANYTHING HAPPENS
the whole zoom in + dweller's slow movement makes the whole responses to situations extremely slow"
18805,"TLDR: get it on your phone instead, this is a straight mobile port and makes for a terrible PC gaming experience.

I spent hundreds of hours playing this game as an interesting/ fun diversion on my phone, however it doesn't translate to the PC well at all. 

The mechanics are based around the idea that you can pick it up for a couple of minutes every few hours, but not really intended for anything more than a few clicks here and there; which doesn't hold up on an actual gaming machine.

They could have done something very interesting with the gameplay, perhaps making the quests from the overseer offices more in depth (with mouse and keyboard controls, why continue to limit the controls/mechanics to ""drag character to next room"" ""drag to target enemy""), or they could have had interesting turn-based/strategic elements; but instead it seems like no effort has been put into making this game anything other than a mobile port and another opportunity to double down on the micro-transaction income.

I really hope they invest some time and effort on making this a more interesting experience on the PC. 
I've got to say the ratings on Steam seem to be for the phone version of this game, putting little effort into evaluating the PC version."
18806,"I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!
but, i have one problem, i buyed the mr handy and its shows up in my steam inventory but not in game.why?
please help! (T_T)
"
18807,"Great fun and relaxing game, first it was for the mobile phone so that is why is easy to play but it is fun none the less. If you want to spend little time having little fun and remembering how the Fallout games work, give this a try. Not to forget that the price you can not beat :)"
18808,"you can apparently make babies by making out
10/10
i really learned a lot from this game"
18809,Really fun game. I st have a couple problems. The first is sometimes hen I click on a dweller then go to click another it's stuck on the first deller I click on. Sometimes instead of it clicking the dweller it gets stuck with the room. Doesn't matter how much I zoom in. My other problem is I ish raids ere timed better. Because there's nothing like getting raided when you just finished cleaning from the first. :/
18810,AMAZING
18811,"yes,this game is very fun for me,building my own place,that's it."

18814,nice one
18815,I played a lot of Fallout Shelter on the ipad and I got really good at it. It was fun. The game being on PC just makes it better for me.
18816,"Great game, I played this for a long time on my tablet and enjoyed it, over the moon that its now on pc. There is a 'buy stuff' shop but in all my time playing this I have never once used it, just manage the time and it's a great game. Very good for passing time or when you just do not want to play anything 'complicated' anyway it gets a hermit thumbs up, hermit out."

-Get everything on track again
-Repeat

But seriously, i like this game quite a lot, even when my vault dewellers are a bunch of babies who cant do anything alone.

18820,Good game 10/10
18821,Randomly uninstalled itself deleting my vault. otherwise good
18822,"Having invested 150+ hours into the Android game, switching to PC makes me want far more depth than what Fallout Shelter offers. It's a fun diversion, but it's mostly a diversion I've played with when I'm away from my PC. If you've never tried the game on mobile devices, it might hold your interest for a bit, but like many F2P games with micro-transactions, there's a lot of waiting involved. Personally, I'd rather be playing Fallout 4, but at least this one is free."
18823,Radscorpions are cancer ...
18824,"This game is blatantly pay to win, otherwise you are wasting your time. This game is crap/"
18825,"TL;DR:

+ Great time waster
+ Well polished
+ Fun if you like to micromanage
+ Respectable F2P setup
+ It's free! Try it!

While playing Fallout Shelter, I am very aware that I am wasting my time. I can never quite rationalize [i]why[/i] I am giving the game my full attention. However, there's something there. Is it the art design? The RNG loot to collect? I'm not quite sure, but [i]something[/i] is keeping me interested, and playing, hour after hour.

What I definitely do enjoy, is thinking about how I can optimally layout the vault, and distribute the dwellers, so that I am keeping incidents to a minimum, and efficiency close to maximum. The quests are a fun addition since the 1.0 version, and I do appreciate that it's not completely pay-to-win (in that you can get everything without paying, if you were so inclined).

So far, with a maxed out vault in mobile, and 24 hours on the PC version, [b]I haven't spent a single cent on this game[/b]. But I think I will. Not cause I am a victim of a devious F2P scheme, but because I've enjoyed this game enough that the developers and publishers actually deserve it - which is a rarity with F2P titles.

If you are going to play a F2P game, make it Fallout Shelter."
18826,"I can't find a way to link my steam vault to my mobile vault , if that were possible ? I would continue the vault through out the day too. Overall it's a rather addictive game n all ;)
"
18827,"This game is fun and addictive at first when you are first building your vault and trying to establish it. 

Then it becomes a game you can't play much at all as you try to increase the number of your vault dwellers, it takes 3 hours for a woman to give birth and then 3 more hours for a child to grow up and be able to work as children in this game are useless and can't do anything.

So you just check your game every 3 hours and play other games. Though I often would leave the game running when trying to get achievements and do some art. As just sitting there watching a slow paced game is quite boring.

Then once you have reached the amount of dwellers you want in your vault, it's even less time playing as you train them which can take over 8 hours to gain 1 point in a stat and then make better guns which takes around 12 hours for every gun made. And the quests are quite fun, but yet again it takes 3 hours or more for them to travel to the quest location.

But you can skip most of the waiting if you cheat, but I refuse to or spend money on nuka cola to speed up time. You can find nuka cola sometimes but the amount you find is never enough and you can't speed up birth time or child growing up, unless you change your clock on your PC or use some save edit program. But I don't like to mess with things or cheat.

I'd class this game as alright, fun at first and then it's just a waiting game, made to encourage people to spend money all the time and I don't want to as I don't think the game is good enough as there is no end or you can't really win or complete the game. It's not something that you can play to pass time or boredom as it's more than likely to cause boredom as there is so much waiting.

I recommend as you can play it now and then and I play it as I love the Fallout world and the feeling of running my own vault. But that said it's a rather boring job being a overseer.

I'd rate the game 6/10 alright.

18834,"I'm definitely having a better time playing this on PC than I did on my Galaxy Note phone (bigger screen but not enough). You should definitely try to make things interesting by playing podcast or something in the background. I sometimes have this on while coding, and wait for the mysterious stranger."
18835,"Don't like the micro-management it requires, as it's a originally for mobile. If a few tweaks were to be made to timers and such for players on PC it would be a great time passer. 
Won't recommend it at this point, but hopeful future updates will change my mind."
18836,"It's a really good game if you either:
 a) feel like spending extraneous money on speeding things up so you don't have to wait 10 hours for something
 b) spend every waking (and sleeping) hour of your day staring at your computer.
It's fun and has much better dialogue options than Fallout 4 but DAMN it gets aggrivating really fast. Timeline of events: 
Leveled up a ton of stuff, things looking great
Ok, finally spent all of my caps on upgrading rooms, time to play some quests
Send favorite dweller out before I go to sleep
Wake up, dweller dies on me
Have to pay 600 caps? Hell no
Pays it anyways
Running low on all resources after not clicking them once
Molerat infestation when no one has a decent weapon, half of dweller population dies
Quits game

It has achievements though, so I'll probably continue to play and hate myself"
18837,"Addicting. Very good time sink. I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to see a tab on the Vault Dweller overview showing weapons and outfits. Would make keeping track of 200 dwellers easier. Speaking of 200, how about raising that cap?"
18838,This has to be the best free to play game I have seen in awhile. I just wish they would add more items and stuff to it.
18839,"I've played for a bit and have to say, that for a free-to-play it's really awesome. If you like the world of Fallout and building strategies/ simulators, this is a game for you. One problem is that once you've build all the training rooms and completed some quests, you're pretty much done and from this point the game will get quite boring quite fast. Nevertheless, I have like 25 hours of pure game time (and maybe gonna revisit some time) and I think it really wasn't bad."

18845,Boi dis game.............
18846,"Waste of time PTW, like the old skool wait to earn a turn FB games."
18847,"This is a good game... on a mobile device.

But port it to a PC, and that is where it falls apart. When I play games at my PC, I want to be engaged for hours. This game makes you wait for hours (unless you want to pay tons of money or cheat.) Even though there are ""events"" every few minutes, you still sit there and wait for those. 

Also this game is very bad to have in a window to the side. If you have multiple monitors, it keeps jumping back to the main monitor if you change the size of it at all. And because it requires your attention every few minutes, it's hard to do something in another window.

Unless you want a game that you play for 5 minutes once or twice a day, I don't recommend this game. And I don't recommend buying their in game items. If you lose your save for any reason, you lose it all."
18848,"I suppose the big question on everybodies mind is: This is a waiting game with microtransactions. Are they intrusive?

[i]Absolutely not[/i]. You can pay if you want to and they will accelerate you're progression in the game. That's what they're there for. But that being said I have never felt even once that I [i]needed[/i] to buy them to progress. Even completely destitute of them you can still find lunchboxes ((microtransaction random item drop; may include legendary dwellers or weapons. Also may not)) naturally in the game. You can get them from quests and random daily objectives from time to time. I also got one from a loot chest once.

And it's never like you need those legendary weapons or dwellers, as your (normal) dwellers work they level up to gain a little bit more health and when you actually progress you unlock training rooms to increase their stats. Does it take a long time? Yes. Can you speed it up with microtransactions? Yes. But even a dweller going up from 9 to 10 (max stat) in any category I don't think it was ever over 16 hours. I may need to check that. And it sounds like a long time. Guess what? It's a waiting game. Go to sleep and check it in the morning. The game progresses training and everything else even while closed and your computer is shut off. This isn't something you micromanage.

But of course: Is it fun? Yes. It can genuinely be entertaining to see your Vault expand like most any other waiting and/or strategy game. But what really makes this is how even though it departs from normal Fallout gameplay it VERY much feels like Fallout. Obviously the setting but even down to the character interactions. [u]This little gem actually happened[/u]:

""My birthday is coming up. What are you going to get me?""
""A one-way ticket to the Wasteland.""

The punchline? That was her father! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! ...reminds me of my childhood."
18849,"I've probably played over 300+ hours of this game on the phone version and also a good few hours on Bethesda's PC version. I'm delighted that it's on steam because I like the achievement system and all. 

This is hands down the best free game i've ever played and the best thing is that you can play this game without any hassle without making any purchases. Though it is slightly slow till you reach about 30 dwellers, that requires a bit patience, but after that its flawless and there's so much to do."
18850,its a good game when you have noting to do.
18851,"its an mobilephone game that you can play on steam
its an ok game to spend some time on but i dont think it belongs here on steam
but steam i guess have degraded themselfs by letting mobile games come into steam
for some wierd reason.
But like i  said above its an ok game just to waste some time on but it gets pretty boring after a while."
18852,"Pros: free to play, quite captivating time-killer, easy to jump in and get your vault running, while still offering a more in-depth level if you decide to delve into optimising your vault at all costs.

Cons: a mobile waiting simulator ported to PC with zero improvements, offering little bursts of dopamine designed to encourage you to cash out for more little bursts of dopamine.

Get it if you don't have an addictive personality and enjoy waiting."
18853,good game
18854,Excellent game. Will keep you busy for hours.
18855,Tupa grind
18856,"I have 2 dicks from radiation, what do I do ?!"
18857,"this game is great, easy to play and deep in nostalgia. agian....great game"
18858,"I enjoy this game quite a bit, it is nice to pass some time here and there and I like the aesthetic design choice for this game."
18859,"This game IS NOT meant to played continuouusly it is supposed to be played in short bursts otherwise you will get bored especially in trhe beginning as you do have to grind at the start in order to get the better rooms which will give you more to do. I advise saving up the caps and getting the overseers office as it allows you to do quests which make the game far more interesting 

Pros
- Easy to learn
- Fun in short bursts
- FREE!

Cons
- Quest wait times are just a trick to try and make you buy nuka cola, wait times should be reduced or make it easier to get nuka cola
- It can become boring if you play it for to long

Overall its a good game which can be played every now and again to pass a few hours not to mention its free so what have you got to lose?"
18860,"I've only played for about an hour so far and It's really fun once you understand how stuff works. 

I do have a feeling that at some point I will rage/quit when I get to a high level and something destroys my base..."
18861,Noice
18862,"i this game unvalaiblein my platform !?
i was spend my money to much in this game :("
18863,"[b] + [/b] About 100+ hours of fun. Simple but incredible.
[b] + [/b] Plenty of quests for you to complete
[b] + [/b] It's basically FREE!

No negatives here.

A [i] charming [/i] little game you can spend many an hour playing. 

A fan will likely be tempted to reinstall his/her favourite chapter of the series. 
I couldn't resist reinstalling Fallout 3, personally.

If you've yet to experience the awesome world of Fallout. . . Well, this game right here [i] might [/i] just be your stepping stone into one helluva adventure.

What more can I say?       

[h1] 10/10 [/h1]"
18864,"nice game :3 love to play , last played on android :v"
18865,"This game was incredible when I played it on the phone.  The only frustrating thing...?  Having to restart your vault when you got a new phone....

Well NO longer!  Now you, too, can have all the wonders of Bethesda's awesome mobile game, on your very own computer!  This kind of pre-war technology is incredible to behold, and truly enjoyable.

Running at a solid 60FPS on pretty much any computer, you'd be crazy to not give Fallout Shelter a try.  Now with Steam Achievements, there's never been a better time to get your Vault on!"
18866,"a cute little mobile game that has been ported to PC.
I'm not sure if I understand why though, playing this for 5 mins on a bus or train I get, but why would you play this on a laptop/desktop? I'd rather be playing New Vegas under those conditions...

however I can't not recommend this game. try it on your mobile device though."
18867,"it's a fun game, although it requires a lot of patience.
makes me want to buy fallout 4 :p"
18868,"I remember being so excited waiting for this game on android, now that its on the PC i'm even more excited. This game is so much fun. It has a very simple concept but as you progress later into the game, you'll realise that it isnt as easy as you first thought. Give this game a go, if its not your thing then fair enough but you fallout fans will enjoy this game a lot!"
18869,GG But I hate the wait time
18870,"Was an alright game, got a bit repetitive after a while."
18871,"i must say i realy like this littel game , simple but in the same time not :)"
18872,Some good shit
18873,My shitty laptop can run this game
18874,good game if u like bad games
18875,"Maybe I'm just a sucker for the cutesy rendition of Fallout, but I like this game.

One of your basic click and wait games, nothign really special there, but it's great for someone who can manage their time, take ten or fifteen minutes to set something up and then go and do something else for a few hours or the rest of the day, then come back and set tings up all over.

Once I feel confident enough, I'm going to be trying a Survival run to see how I like the extra challenge.

Haven't spent a cent on this and I could not be happier thus far."
18876,cool game
18877,"Now I don't need to misclick on things with my chubby buttery fingers on my greasy phone. 

I can elegently click like a true PC master race god."
18878,Make babies
18879,"Love it!  So f*cking addicting, like wow :)  Kind of a Disney verison of This War of Mine.   10/10 soley because you can just pick the most qualified people to keep breeding......shush morales.  Just add alot of C so that you can get the D and you are set :)"
18880,A better RPG than Fallout 4
18881,Best game. i have 114 vault de=wellers
18882,"oh god why.... 61 hrs on steam and more than 200 hours in android 
vault - tec must be proud of me"
18883,It can be very fun and sometimes addicting and even when I put it down for awhile I usually come back to it.
18884,"this is a really awesome game glad i played it i never thought i would like this game because i love first person shooters but i love this game so much! 



Thanks Betesda for making this awesome game free."
18885,"I hope the game play and aspects get better and updated
"
18886,i made kids online
18887,i got the Vault starter pack and after a while playing and a pc crash my complete save file is gone the vault is gone and my vault starter pack is wasted
18888,Great FTP game! Does a good job of offering premium content without making the player feel like it's absolutely necessary to enjoy the game. Fun upkeep game.
18889,"Really Bethesda... why. I was going to run this on my laptop, witch i keep to the side. But no it only runs in 64x systems. Who in there right mind would play this on a desktop. Its ment for tablet PCs, witch are all 32 bit. Bad move Bethesda. Its bad enough you port a moblile micro-manage ""game"" on to pc. Bit your really stupid to not support 86x systems."
18890,"Fallout Shelter is a fun game. It's one of those games where you need to play for a few minutes and come back to some time later. Would recommend if you need something to play with a few spare minutes, but not for hours and hours."
18891,"Not a fun game if you don't play 24/7.  Your people eat all the resources, and if your resourses are not all on the same level the autobot, (Mr Handy) does not collect them and they go without.  As the game plays in the background, your people can  run into difficulty, and if you are not there, they will die off.  Lost one in the wasteland.

If resourses were picked up automatically when not playing, it would be better. Mr handy only collects them on his level not on the other levels.

Uninstalled the game - Mole Rats the most powerfull force on earth as they wiped out an entire room of ARMED High Level dwellers with very little damage to the mole rats.  

This is not a fun game to play, not unless you like to be defeated.  15 Stim paks is all you can store, not enough against these rats.  Best advise - DO NOT PLAY!"
18892,"Addictive, great for playing for a bit before work or in general when you don't have a lot of time, but you can also put in more time if you so choose. Nuka-cola (premium currency) is available enough that you don't have to buy any if you don't want to. I'd still recommend buying the starter pack. Played it on the tablet version a year ago, playing it on the pc now, great game, great port."
18893,I love Fallout Shelter but it appears that the PC version has it's own issues. I was playing between two computers so I know there was a cloud save. One PC crashed. I reloaded and saw the entire vault was gone. The other 2 vaults were untouched but it wiped out the vault I already spent 2 days worth of real time. CAVEAT EMPTOR and save your caps for other games.
18894,"5 steps of wealth : 1. 1 Dweller with lvl 10+ SPECIAL stat 
                               2. Make Power Armor
                               3. Make Plasma Rifle
                               4. Take a Pet
                               5. Go to the Wasteland
And watch those CAPS fall from the sky !!!
Note : I actually have played this game for 100+ hours (offline)"
18895,"Don't bother. Apparently losing saved games is a known issue so unless you want the task of making a copy, or firing up one of the cheats, you stand to lose all your progress. If game devs can't make an effort to prevent such a catastrophe why bother supporting them. Save yourself the frustration and give this game a pass."
18896,"Raiders came and murdered my entire vault.

I highly recommend this game.
"
18897,"This is a survival sim that's part base builder, and part tower defense. I'm 50+ hours in and I still feel rewarded when I unlock a new piece of gear/weapon/junk. Designing your Vault requires as much skill as you want to invest, but the true beauty of this game is in it's variable ways to play (I have seen some seriously bizaare Youtube builds). 
While Fallout Shelter may not be challenging, it has depth beneath it's cute exterior. 
Yes, it is a Mobile port with mission timers designed for casual play (login, check on dwellers, logout etc.) -but that shouldn't be a problem unless this is the only game in your library. 
Breeding a family can be a lot of fun if you're willing to RP, there's loads of things to find for collectionists, and all the easter eggs/ 'nods' /cookies for those familiar with the source material. 

all that aside..

this game can be uncomfortably grindcentric
the mission timers often feel unforgiving
your efforts are rewarded with junk for crafting items, caps to buy more junk, dwellers to equip, pets to help dwellers
it's a circuitous loop without end. <<<that's right! Does this game have an ending? NO. It's a Free To Play ... FOREVER!!
also
the ""Pay to Win"" nonsense, is just that.. there is no winning and the microtransactions are completely optional. So, if you're willing to invest time, and you're not allergic to grinding, Fallout Shelter will warm your feel-goods.

impatient crybabies need not apply."
18898,"It's my favorite clicker of all time; however, the temptation to cheat by altering my system clock to progress more quickly limits my ability to feel submersed.  I would like this game to be ran off dedicated servers, and that would help Bethesda make the game more profitable."
18899,"Pretty cool, better than I thought it was going to be."
18900,Much less of a let down than Fallout 4.
18901,It was a good game up untill that point were there was a radroach investstion while the radroaches werd unable to die for soms reason so i lost 8 dwellers and no it wasn't on survival
18902,Yes!
18903,"The fact that a phone app is better than some other fallout games is hilarious. Fantastic game.

(Blast From the Past achievement is bullshit hard to get though)

"
18904,"So ... I guess they ported it to PC because people whined for it?
But let‚Äôs face it, that game even on mobile is shit, even compared to other idle games, because that‚Äôs what that game is, an Idle game.

You‚Äôll have a starting shelter with no building and a handful of survivor, the only thing to do is then to build a couple of each of the very limited type of buildings you have access too, then make sure ALL the women in your base are pregnant (since in order to unlock more building you‚Äôll need more population) and then‚Ä¶. You wait.

Apparently your women will stay pregnant for 9 irl month of something, so your progression just ‚Ä¶ stops.

So time you got a random new comer that knock at your door, but they are very few and far between, from time to time a random even like a fire or an attack of giant blat will occur and autoresolve without any difficulty or consequences.
You can also send guys outside to explore, but they don‚Äôt give you anything interesting most of the timen and the stuff they‚Äôll find will just serve to send them again outside‚Ä¶ yay ?

Ho and of course every 5 minutes you‚Äôll have to click on your buildings to gather the resource they produce like in the good old time of the Zinga Skinner boxes games, otherwise your shelter will slowly go down‚Ä¶

And why the hell exploring give way less xp than staying in a room in the shelter ? Wtf is that ?
It's not like if leveling up mattered that much tbh, but it's just a strange thing that bother me.

So yeah‚Ä¶ even on mobile I don‚Äôt see how anyone could find that game interesting, even as an idle game."
18905,cum
18906,think most people here forget there on a computer and can by pass paying for the nuka colas
18907,"Fallout Shelter is a free to play side-scrolling City Building RTS game.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.  Now ported to PC from the mobile versions that the Devs made first.  You can move your mobile saves to the PC version.  Game is completely themed with artwork and lore from the Fallout series of games.  Gameplay is a fast paced resource gathering and base building with increasing wait timers.  Has many quests you can complete and random goals to fullfill. 

Has a tutorial and help tips but still leaves some mystery that you have to figure out from reading someone online wiki or trial and error.  Challenging game, especially if you don't know what you are doing or not paying attention. But can get boring once you completely built out your vault and finished all quests. Suggest you find out more info from videos and guides.  You can increase the difficulty of your normal game by several ways and has a Survival mode.  Might be better to play the PC version versa the mobile versions.

You have to actively play the game or you might miss loot or lose money.  Production takes time and you have to click to collect or your people will be idle. People level up, you have to click on them to gather money.  Room disasters pop at random and can spread to other rooms and causing damage if you not attending to it.  A mystery man pops up at random in your base rooms for 10 seconds, you find and click him, you get money.  Cappy and Bottle visits, you have to click on them when they wave or dance.  Pick up base raider bodies for loot. When you save and exit game, everything freezes in base except babies timers, children timers, crafting timers, wasteland exploring and quests travel.  

You get some lunchboxes, Mr Handys, Pets, Nucka Cola for quest rewards and 1 lunchbox every 7ish days of play.  Mr Handy is not very usefull or game changing with certain base builds.  Buying these in the store is not worth the money.  The other stuff you get from lunchboxes are not worth buying lunchboxes with real money in the store.

Has 35 Steam achievements, some easy. Has full controller support, can be played with one hand on mouse.

CONS:
-  Game has RNG loot boxes and events, so Lady Lucky might hate you.
-  Some Gameplay take extremely long amounts of real time to reach.
- Has a bug of corrupting save files which destroys your vault, and Devs have not addressed this problem or not supporting losses,  according to many negative reviews.
- Once you build a good base and have nothing to worry about, game gets boring and a grind. Endgame is to finish the in-game and steam achievements, and to finish the quest chains. 

Try it out you might like it.

18908,"TLDR: Awesome way to waste time, for free.

The thing to remember about this game is that it was designed for mobile.  

Having said that, it is free to play, and you will never NEED to spend a dime.  Not to win, not to progress, not at all unless you just want to.  You may want to, because instant gratification is an illness, and that's fine.  For those unwilling to wait for quests to finish, or who want an item right now instead of working for it (which takes time), fortunately there's a way to buy such things. 

This game is about time and resource management.  It's not exceptionally in-depth, nor is it particularly grim.  If you're looking for a light-hearted time-killer, this is a good one.  If you're a Fallout fan, this game seems primarily based on Fallout 3, featuring familiar faces, weapons, locations, etc.

It is extremely polished for what it is, and without doubt is a finished product.  The gameplay is described as ""slow"" by many a negative reviewer, and this is unfortunately less than accurate.  There is a good bit of downtime, and that's intentional in a casual game, however, when incidents occur, the pace is quickened considerably as you scramble to organize your dwellers into something resembling preparedness.  

The true joy of a game like this is what you do with it.  It can be a casual experience, a somewhat immersive roleplaying experience, something you're dedicated to checking frequently or once a week.  You can design and develop your vault and the dwellers within as you see fit, though there are advantages to employing some strategy here.  For example, this game is not difficult, though if you build thoughtlessly, you will find it difficult to work with what you have designed.  This game is easy, it is fun, but it is not mindless."
18909,Is Quite funny

18912,"I like the idea but I was not expecting something THAT BAD and I am taking some time to prevent others for wasting their time...

Bye"
18913,"""Basic fun little Fallout-themed shelter management game"" Cit. is exactly what it is , very cute and free !"
18914,"i love this game..even i dont play any fallout before..since i play this game in mobile i love all about fallout, but my pc not enought strong to play that LOL SAD.. and fallout shelter playable in pc..i play it when im rest of my another game (dota)
i always wish to have game fallout4 for free..maybe i will upgrade my pc in last year,,haha
i hope this game can link in mobile in steam background"
18915,"I gotta say, It's fun.

But this could be Bethesda's baby steps to becoming EA. Mobile-like microtransactions? I get it, it's free, microtransaction is how they make money. 

But, I'd rather pay some 10$-20$ instead of being swayed to buy nuka quantum or lunchboxes.

But also, thank you Bethesda for making both the nuka quantum and lunchboxes obtainable without spending money.

Just play other games while you wait for quests or explorations."
18916,Thanks to the devs for making this available on Steam.  It's much better than the phone version (hate touch screens) and you can actually see your vault clearly.  The only people complaining are impatient brats as the game is totally free unless you want to pay to speed things up.  Nice job Bethesda!
18917,"Althogh it could seriously use some paused activities in some reading intensive screens( Yo! Devs! ), this game is delightful .
As a huge fan of the Fallout series, this Overseer- light perspective is intruiging and cute. I've already recommended it to other PostApoc players!"
18918,help me
18919,"I'm not sure If I should recommend it or not. But, Im sure it needs new content.
I've played this game for 9 months on mobile. You need to give a birth, new content people. 
All my dwellers got destroyed by radroaches, mole rats, scorpions, many times. Even tho i had power armors, gatling laser, miniguns, fatman(MIRV). Raiders arent even a problem. Death Claws cant kill all of the dwellers because they are not strong enough againts Power Armor and Gatling Laser etc. But those little MOLE RATS and Scorpions?! They've destroyed my vault many times. They are even more powerful than deathclaws wtf man? And upgrading your fortified vault door for nothing? You could add turrets, robots, new menu and content to that! Like you can customize it? Turrets, spikes, buff to the dwellers inside, getting money from putting a trader inside the vault door and stuff I dunno. Or decreasing the chances of enemy raid. It is still the same game after the long time except explorers now can get into some ""cool"" secret places. Where you will get killed mostly if you dont give enough stimpacks like me. Full em up mates because you wont be able to kill some radroaches, mole rats and feral ghouls in those ""cool"" secret places while your explorer can kill death claws, Centaurs, Feral ghoul reaver, Fire ant soldier and scorpions exploring!

Anyway, If any of the developers are reading this(and I think they wont), add some new content to the vault like turrets, robots and stuff. Upgrading your door is just useless. It feels so empty. And having radscorpions attack 6 times in a row? That is nasty you know. Fix your animation bug on the fitness too. What the hell mates they are glitching like a prop in garry's mod! Jeez. Its a small little game with small animation. Even I can make a game like that mates(Hire me ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)). And If you think about it.. Maybe I will! Hooray!"
18920,"Pros: Immersive vault experience for Fallout series fans, the F2P aspect is actually really well done and doesn't require you to spend a bunch of money if you don't want to.

Cons: Quests can quickly become repetitve and there's a lot of grinding if you're going for a strict F2P experience."
18921,"Good game but it fucking sucks you can't disable the xbox 360 controller, IDK who thought we wanted controller support for this game but it's fucking annoying that you can't turn it off so you just need to unplug the controller, fucking trash.
Also on another note, if your game crashes and your data gets corrupted somehow and you bought something on the game, say goodbye to your money because Bethesda and Steam only care about you paying the money, they don't mind if the goods are gone or failed to deliver due to faulty product, another reason to believe the Fallout franchise is dead,"
18922,"Basically just a straight port of the mobile version, with little to no PC improvements.

As for the game there is no meaningful progression and develops into incredibly long and boring grinds (which feels very unrewarding) that can only have the edge taken off by spending money on randomised lunchboxes.

Still better than Fallout 4 though"
18923,"This is a great game I mostly recommend to both the casual and hardcore gamer.  It is nearly unique among free games in that you CAN actually play itin a reasonable fashion for free.  While of course having a couple Mr. Handys roaming your base helping it self-automate is enormously useful, it is not strictly necessary.  The game drops a fair amount of super-loot (pets, Handys, and lunchboxes) that you are not forced to buy them. It is however, handicapped by some truly atrocious controls and a certain kind of unavoidable teleporting enemy that ruins a great deal of the enjoyment of the endgame.

3/5 stars, 5/5 among free games."

18925,Very bland.  It's one of those sit and wait for something to happen type games.
18926,Good fun but repetitive and designed to sell advances.  For free its OK but I would not buy it.
18927,"it's alright
just don't buy any microtransactions, you'll likely to be screwed over by corrupt saves or steam deleting your save and it's a one time use only aswell which is pretty bad"
18928,"It's highly repetitive, the quests are always the same and its a waste of time. Got bored quite quick...

And why the ... it stops @ 200 dwellers? Thanks a lot for this crap!"
18929,"Yes, they finally brought this crap to Steam. You now have possibility to give money to bethesda, and raise your blood pressure by watching single radscorpion knock out your vault. I still have to play this game, since they made it pretty darn gosh addicting. Macromanage this, build that, then close the game and come back few hours later to see what is going on. repeat. repeat. repeat. Did i mention we are talking about mobile game? So, yeah, really not built for PC."
18930,"a ""fine"" fallout related game,not bad though"
18931,Better than fallout 4
18932,"I love the game but upon opening the pet carrier, it crashed and won't reopen, so mind that."
18933,<3
18934,"This game was a ton of fun at first when I was able to devote a couple hours to it and just sit down and play. A base building game with characters and a neat character aesthetic design. However, that being said, I have one game-breaking design flaw that I very much dislike: There is no opportunity to pause. I play this on my computer (not a mobile device) so if I have to use the bathroom or go to something like work, I am almost guarenteed to lose all my dwellers in the wasteland, as well and some of my supplies. 

The better rewards in the wasteland exist farther out which requires more time, but if I can't devote the hours needed for them to get out there before recalling them because I have other things to do, such as work or school, it's barely worth sending them out there at all because I need to recall them fairly quickly. 

The addition of a simple pause feature would be hugely helpful and would draw me back into the game very quickly."
18935,"First off, I wouldn't consider this a proper game, and I wouldn't give it a score out of 10. It's a distraction, and a fun one in that. Judging from other reviews, it seems alot of users have issue with it being a mobile game, being expected to wait hours to do anything, microtransactions and boring 'gameplay'. Just because it's a mobile game on PC, doesn't mean you're expected to play it like a PC game! I think the progression so far is really fun (I have amassed about 60 dwellers at around level 25, I reckon I'm halfway through the standard progression chain), as your vault and dwellers change aesthetically and in size. You get new features as you play, like the Overseers Office that let you dispatch your dwellers on quests (AKA stimpack simulator) and a wealth of weaponry and other customisation options which fits the universe.

It's a fun experience to boot up before bed or during a revision break to do quests or queue something up for the next time you boot it up. If you're looking for anything more, there're 5 other Fallout games available. I've spent ¬£4.99 on the games starter pack in my initial hours, and have no intention of spending anymore than that, the game doesn't feel pay to win."
18936,"Finally! 

A game in which I can trap a bunch of humans with the promise of a better life. Then enforce racial segregation and breed blacks for heavy duty labour and white people for inteligence and hispanics for strenght and defense. AND force people to breed with whoever I want by locking them inside a room for hours, even days until they get pregnant with the perfect baby which will be put into an education program which fits my racial expectations!!! - I've waited for something like this for sooo long!!

(something is definitely wrong with me)

(this whole thing was a joke. Calm your tits.)"
18937,"Hello and today im writing my review in this game. The graphics are cool i love the cartoony stylan and goofy style of the dwellers but they are also very detailed. The gameplay is so fun the leveling getting new guns more cases all of it is exciting and wants u to push foward. Now yes there are some glitches but i have not experienced crashes. So all in all 7/10 (o.p. enemies, bugs, slow span rate of dwellers all minus a point)"
18938,"At first, I noticed this was phone based as I kept seeing everyone playing it. I though to myself - looks rubbish, won't get it.

It was a mistake - and so was loading it up for the first time. Now I can't seem to remove it from my Steam Library as my mental abilities won't let me."
18939,"nice
"
18940,"This a fun game but poorly planned out. 

Combat is poor as you will be chasing down rad scorpions only for your warriors to arrive justy as the enemy leaves. 
Fires burn to the point that while you swap out 1 vault dweller the fire increases.
You cant freeze the game and picking up vault dwellers so micromanaging is hard. 

Fun but poorly designed."
18941,"Played it in my mobile and was excited to play it in my pc.
But the PC version has a lot of moments when the game stops responding especially at times when rushing rooms or choosing quests..besides these problems the game itself is fun...."
18942,great game to play while you have the steam store open on second monitor looking for a better game to play.
18943,"Very nice game.

The quickest way to ruin it for yourself is changing the time of your computer a day ahead each time to skip al the waiting around =)

10/10 got super vault dwellers - wouldn't play again"
18944,"great game, Very simple game to play that passes the time."
18945,"Good for the most part and it makes you want to check on it every second, sadly though the combat is absoluletly game breaking. Your character in power armor and fatman can't kill a radroach without 5 stimpacks. It is extremely annoying seeing vault dwellers die armed with good gear but it takes them 20 seconds to fucking shoot."
18946,This game is great!
18947,"It's not a bad game, especially since it's free.
You don't even need to purchase them items.
All achievements can be unlocked in the end.
You don't need to waste your money, it's nice.
And if you like playing, you can buy the stuff.
It's the only way of supporting the developers.
They gave us this pretty decent game for free.
And it's entirely up to you if you buy the stuff.
I have to give the base game a positive review.
Look at that playtime, I think it was enjoyable.
As far as free to play games go, it's amazing.
You should definitely check it out if you want.
It's a really nice game to chill and relax with."
18948,VeeeRYYY GOOOOOooooddDDD
18949,bing bing bong RAIDED
18950,This game is probably more lore friendly than Fallout 4
18951,nice
18952,"Build agreat vault that takes you lots of hours... and then get raided, burned down and fucking cockroaches kills your people...

ANYWAY 10/10"
18953,"Grate Game, Same as on the mobile but now With Steam acheavments  :D"
18954,"Microtransactions. 

Yes the game uses them  - but you can also *totally ignore them* - with no real penalty. 

If you're looking for fast paced then this game isn't it. It's a bit of a grind and many actions take hours - so don't expect to sit down and play for half the day and see any quick wins. Things take time. 

I've been treating this game as something to pop on to for 15 / 20 minutes at a stretch, do a few things and then put down again, only to repeat a few hours later if I fancy it. 

In that, it's really pretty fun and while it's not exactly deep or complex - it does allow you to quickly build up a 'vault' and muck about some more in the Fallout universe. 

Considering it's free - that gets my recommendation. 

That said if they plan on doing a sequel I'd strongly recommend greater depth and control, more missions and events and so on... it's a shallow game made for mobile and it does come across as such. Don't treat it like an in depth PC title and you'll be fine. 

"
18955,"I recommend this game
"
18956,"Well, I'm actually saving my money to buy Fallout 4. That's when I ran across Fallout Shelter. I figure I could sedate my want to play Fallout 4 with this game to pass the time while I save money. Fallout Shelter is a for sure builder game that also knows how to terrorize the people within each unique vault. All in all, I'm actually enjoying the game for what it was made for, which was more as a life sim beneath the ground if that had been the path Fallout had taken. It's fun keeping them alive, no matter how difficult and unbalanced things get. I recommend and want myself for the first few characters in the vault specialize in one of three rooms. Electric, food, and water. I need those most and at a constant all game long."
18957,"Great casual game and it's FREE!
Tho it would be better if there is a list showing all the dwellers outfits and weapons equiped instead of having to click them one by one"
18958,Click the nuke symble on the page where it shows settings and your user id there is a secret (i dont know if there is any way to get it correct i failed on my first attempt) dont awnser any wrong or the page will rewrite its self so you cant do it again if you fail it will give you a msg saying Oops Access Denied. I like the game
18959,so awesome game =D
18960,I honestly had more fun playing this game than when I played Fallout 4... Yes it's a port but it's just so much more engaging.
18961,It's a pretty good time waster
18962,Wow! It's like SIMS could've been since it's start...  but only better.. Antfarm of post-apocolyptics stressed-out occupants in a fallout shelter is the safest thing we can wish for after the Big Ones hit! Thanks Bethesda!  (i played a bunch of fallout 3 & enjoy this product).
18963,"I don't spend money on these types of games, more or less because they usely give in and give me things locked behind the paywall anyway. 

Even so, as a mobile port, it's not half bad. [The reason for micro-transactions are because it is a mobile port, and the app stores aren't too kind with giving money.] Side note: I have been told that they are vault exclusive so just don't buy into it.

Useing the mouse instead of a touch pad feels nice, not to cramped or off putting. Camera movment with wasd or the mouse isn't bad ether.  Quests are a neat little distraction from vault-sitting. Also the small conversations between the delers are enteraining of you happen to look at them.

If you love fallout or don't have any money to spend, Playing this will be fine.

Also careful keeping the game open, you WILL be attacked or your vault with be affected by things.
And if your vault Id isn't 666 or 420 then you are missing out my friend."
18964,"It's a good time killer, and enjoyable"
18965,"I like this game, but I wouldn't recommend it on the PC for a few reasons. 

PROS 
*this games improves some bugs that were on the mobile version (maybe that or I haven't run into anything)
*the graphics and animations are a lot smoother.
*basically the same game that we liked when it first came out

CONS
*there are microtransactions in this game (and a PC game too)
*everything is harder to get to compared to the mobile version
Those are the only cons I have but it's still an alright port. But to be honest, I'd rather stick to playing my iPad than my PC for this one 
7/10"
18966,A game wich makes you wait and click for resources.
18967,I was having alot of fun until save and backup save got corrupted.
18968,"Oh, my brain... 

I think i just recovered from a 4 day binge on this game! 
Now when Im not playing it, i still hear the low pitched Tune (You know the one where the spy looking guy rocks up)
...anyway, I had to force myself to stop playing this at 3am this morning when i realised Im no longer doing anything else and also that i keep hearing that sound in my brain...

I think this game has some strong psychadelic or otherwise hypnitic mind twisting shit...... I gotta Delete it Quick.."
18969,"It's... okay.

It fits solidly in the catagory of being a waiting game with options to pay to get things done quicker. Nothing is impossible to get without paying for it though. And - if complaints made in the discussion threads are true - paying for things is risky since it's completely possible it'll just take your money and not give you what you paid for. But again there's no reason to pay for it. The game is pretty generous on giving you ample lunchboxes (chests of rare loot) and Nuka Colas (items used to speed up wait times) for free on quests and for accomplishing achievements.

The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats are not what they are in other games. When it comes to combat the endurance (HP) and agility (attack rate) stats are the only factors. Combat is pretty much a [i]""watch the characters do all the work automatically""[/i] thing while you give them a stimpack or radaway when needed. The closest thing you get to any tactical decisions is whether or not you'll use a charged-up critical attack now or save it for later in case it's needed. [i]That's it.[/i]

As a Fallout franchise fan myself I wanted to dabble with it a little. It pokes at my nostalgia. I see a lot of familier weapons and armors from the games. It feels like someone that didn't actually play much of Fallout made it. They may have peeked at the wiki, looked at some screenshots, talked to the devs, ect but they weren't likely actual fans of the series themselves. There were just too many ""thats not how it works"" moments. Which brings me to...


[h1]Lore Nitpicks[/h1]
[list]
[*]Vaults, in fallout Shelter, send out radio signals to add to their population. In any other Fallout game vaults are pretty xenophobic. Other vaults seem much more happy to see your dwellers visit than they ought to as well. To put this into the realistic light: In fallout 1 you are sent out of your vault to find a water chip. You save your vault eventually - as well as potentially other places depending how you play. But the overseer abandons you because you've been outside of the vault too long and are deemed an outsider for that alone. Your character is left outside to what the overseer can only assume will be your death. Fallout 3's Overseer was even worse.

[*]Deathclaws appear in packs similar to molerats or radroaches. In any other version of this series when you get a whiff of a single deathclaw you're on high alert. In this case however you brawl through 10 of them to get through a room. This game failed [i]so hard[/i] on what makes a deathclaw a deathclaw.

[*]In some quests feral ghouls talk to the vault dwellers. [u]Feral[/u] ghouls; the ones that have rotted out minds and are completely senseless zombies that just scream and growl and attack anything with flesh.

[*]The vault door - the big iconic cog-shaped door - responsible for holding off the explosion of a nuclear bomb and protect the residents from outside danger falls apart during raider attacks as though it's made of paper mache. Typically about 3 hits with a sword tears a hole right through it - I don't mean they knock the door down. I [i]mean[/i] they rip right through it.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
It's oddly addictive. It's free even if it's an obvious cash grab. It's okay as a time killer or as a game that you might play on the side while doing something else - like reading or youtube. It's nothing great though. Even the guys that made this game probably don't like it enough to play or update it."
18970,bad game
18971,"Ya know, I was really enjoying this game for a while. In many ways, it's a time-based free-to-play done right. 
Going in the game's favor are a lot of things:
1) There's no competition from competitive whales. 
2) The game has numerous ways to expand and grow across your dwellers, their items, and the base itself. 
3) It has some fun and semi-engaging gameplay in the form of quests. 
4) The aesthetics are fun and offer a nice tie-in to Bethesda's Fallout universe.
5) And its free-to-play model is generous in a number of ways, providing means to earn lunchboxes and having Nuka Cola Quantums be a pretty regular item drop in quest locations.
But. It's still just not worth it.
There is still very little gameplay here. Yes, it's much more engaging, kinder, and better looking than your average ""collect the resources, reset the timer"" free to play game. The big problem is, though, that's still all it is. I think that it honestly is about the best iteration this video game subgenre is ever going to get. But it's still a shitty subgenre, and the game suffers because of it.
Why would you ever want to play a game who's main gameplay element is watching timers reset when, instead, there are literally thousands of other games a few clicks away with FAR more exciting things to do? This game is still out to break your will and get your money instead of providing a fun gameplay experience up front.
What broke my will was having three incidents in a row deplete all of my stimpacks, then all of my vault resources, and then all of my dwellers. It was literally gameover. Unless, I felt like dropping some money to revive my 60+ dwellers and then grinding my way back until the vault was back in shape. That's a steep penalty that even some of the laziest and most aggressively monetized free-to-plays don't saddle a player with.
Or. I could say ""fuck this"" and realize I was wasting my time with a game that, after 30 hours, still had not had a fun payoff.
It's also got a lot freezes, frame rate drops, and audio-visual desync issues that are easy to ignore at first. But by the 100th time, you have to wonder how they never got around to fixing these issues after being out for almost two years.
Don't waste your time. Just play Fallout 4.
"
18972,"game is good. I wish microtransactions counted on all saves, so that i would get the purchases for all of my saves instead of just one. But that is what it is. I've had fun with this otherwise. Dwellers could come a little easier. EDIT: No trading cards either :("
18973,"I am a fan of fallout since the first one came out long ago. Like every game out there even fallout has its faults. Though in my opinion.. fallout has VERY few. This game here makes me want to play my fallout games like made. I enjoy building my own vault with this. Time comsuming and if you are not careful, things can get out of hand. 
Pros
-Fun playing
-Can name every dweller you get
-mad building.
-Endless play time

Cons
-Like most games the nuka quantum
-Quest times can be way to long
-If not active can miss out on dweller entering side missions while exploring wasteland.

Also you can let your dwellers go exploring wasteland then save and quit. Come back next day... explorer can still be moving or dead. Revive for some caps bring home.. he/she has all they found still. You do not lose much here and just have to be patient. I can not recomend this game enough."
18974,"For anyone who is not used to having to wait on timers this may not be the game for you but for fans of FTP/clicker/idle games this is one of the best. Special items are all attainable through regular play and you never feel forced to pay to have fun. There's lots to do with base management, crafting, loot and quests. Highly recommeded!"
18975,"Fallout Shelter is a good fun little game where you manage the development of a fallout shelter.
The cartoon-style drawings are nicely done.

The general structure of this game seems to have been well thought out.
You acquire resources to expand the size of your base, recruit people, and send out some hardy adventurers on quests.
The requirements for food, water, and power seem to be balanced.
The emergency incidents that occur have not seemed to be out of proportion to the resources at hand (so far, at least).

Fallout Shelter is essentially a management game.
However, in some ways it is almost like a clicker game, albeit quite an advanced one. You have to keep on going back and forth between production units to keep the resources flowing. And there are long waits for the completion of quests, and the production of some resources and skill levels, to encourage players to get impatient and purchase upgrades (microtransactions).

Sending Vault-dwellers out on quests can take a long time, unless you use your bottles of ""Nuka-Cola Quantum"" (which speeds up the journeying), but such bottles are few and far between  unless you feel like spending some real-life money on buying some more (yes, there's the catch).
Your questers engage in battles versus enemies in various buildings, but it's action of just a very basic nature (no first person shooting happens in the game).

The fate of those people who go out into the Wasteland, to explore, is relayed to you via lines of text; you don't actually see them in action, unless they go into a quest building (which you have to authorise).

Mostly the game is about managing the resources of your base, or ""Vault"".

I quite like Fallout Shelter. From my point of view, the pros far outweigh the cons.
Be warned that you will need a goodly store of patience to play this game (which brings to mind the old prayer, ""God grant me patience, but hurry up about it!""); so, if you aren't a patient person, you might want to let this one pass by; but, if patience is one of your virtues, then this might just be the game for you.

If you're a patient person who enjoys a bit of post-apocalyptic fun, then I recommend that you give this game a try.

*********************

P.S. People should be aware that there is a major problem with this game, although it is easily overcome.
If your game crashes, or your computer crashes, then you can lose your entire game (apparently it's something to do with it then not synchronising with the Steam cloud).
This drama has happened to many people, whereby they have lost all of their many hours of game progress.

You need to back up your game.

18976,Not bad time waster
18977,i started playing this game a couple days ago and bought 3 items from the steam store and non of the items have showed up in game. wasted $8.97 on a purchase that i have not recieved in game. i try contacting them about this through the support page but it just keeps leading me into circles. i still play the game but i am upset about my wasted purchase.
18978,good
18979,Lots of bugs and no support.
18980,Segregated my vaults and it works perfectly. I sometimes even send out the blacks to the wasteland and let them die. Very fun and cool.
18981,i think this is a nice fun little game. it is also good for slow computers seeing there is not to much action but it still is fun
18982,"After Fallout 3 I've become somewhat of a fan of the series, and although after hearing this was a mobile-to-PC port I was skeptical, even considering this was free of charge... BUT I have to admit this is a VERY nice little game that gets you hooked. 

If you ever played a Fallout game you'll feel right at home with both the visual themes, characters and music.The animations are cartoony but crisp, vibrant, well done with attention to detail and loyal to the PIP Boy theme.

Most of the game takes place in your Vault location where you, as it's Overseer, plan and expand it's structure,  assemble teams to take on quests, send out Dwellers to scour the Wasteland for resources and and attract new Dwellers via radio broadcast (or play Match Maker to get you current Dwellers to procreate). Building your Vault isn't as easy as it seems because there are may surprises and variables that influence your status and progress...

Quests let you take direct control over your chosen team to explore new locations and are often very worthwhile beacause of the potential loot found on location. This is a nice feature because it takes you away from your Vault for some much needed diversion.

If you can get this for free (or for a few bucks), and don't mind a relatively slow paced Fallout-themed building sim, don't hesitate and take it, you won't regret it!"
18983,Probably the best free to play survival game on steam.
18984,A high end free game. The game is not pay to win by there are options to pay to speed up the game. Overall a fun title that has me impressed.
18985,"After almost 11 hours I'm getting very bored. The game is extremely repetitive. The missions are pretty much just ""go from room to room and wait for the enemies to die and then collect the stuff. The base management is rather annoying due to clunky interface and lack of information.

I can't see in numbers how much health my people have. The defense part is not fun at all. Enemies come in and run into rooms randomly. Attacking enemies also seem to have much higher health compared to enemies on missions. Ghouls are very devastating and cost a lot of radaway and stimpacks to keep people alive. Outside of the defense and missions it's pretty much just waiting for timers to finish to gather ressources.

Breeding new people is also extremely random - at least it seem that way. I have used high level characters and such with high special stats and the new born are usually just terrible, meaning you will have to train them intensively.

Oh and I want to meantion that the ressource gathering is a pain. You have timers of 1-10 minutes based on your character and you buy yourself helpers to automatically gather the ressources. However they only seem to do it occasionally. This is extremly nasty once your log out for a few hours, come back and your power is deep in the red. You are then forced to rush to get the ressources back up and that is literally like playing with fire...

I don't get how this game even though it's F2P has such a high positive rating..."
18986,"Good game overall, something to past the time but nothing to amazing and it is free 
10/10"
18987,I played this game for months on my tablet. Still love it on PC. It's like building a cute little post-apocalyptic city. Underground.
18988,"Great game! It can definitely get pretty challenging at times, and you need to be strategic with the layout of your vault. But the bigger your vault gets, the more fun it will be. Because that's when you can start doing more quests, training your dwellers special stats, and crafting weapons, armor, and themes. Overall a great and addicting game, would recommend.

PS: I've seen some people complain about the microtransactions, but the truth is, you don't even need to spend a single penny to have a good vault. My vault has 100+ dwellers and I haven't bought anything."
18989,"Family members can't smash their dads.

10 outta 10"
18990,"It's fun to play everynow and then if you have the time, but don't get sucked into the hell of micro-transactions; such as the Fallout 4 lunchox!"
18991,"–°–∫—É—á–Ω–æ, —É–Ω—ã–ª–æ –∏ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ."

18993,<33 I love fallout shelter 10005032525/10
18994,"Idk, so much bitching.  Didn't find it necessary to spend money to enjoy the game, don't bother speeding things unless I have free Nuka - which has been generously supplied. Have yet to find anything that doesn't die, sincerely hoping that bug never shows up for me. It's a game I play while I do other things, so the time limits don't bother me."
18995,"My friends played this game on their phone constantly, it was in a Discord call that I found out that this game was on Steam. So I decided to get it to see why everybody liked it. I can see why, it just feels good to keep a civilisation alive after a nuclear war. Plus it takes place in the Fallout Universe. Just a relaxing game in general."
18996,Not bad for a free game :)
18997,this is a good game i played it on my phone but now i can play it on pc :D
18998,Nice strategy game! i love it <3 !
18999,"game was good, until i couldent open it, then i thoght i should delete it and redownload it and it still didn't open. Dont play this game."
19000,"Very nice game, something to play when bored!"
19001,I see alot of complaints about microtransactions. Pfft. I have 15 hours in on PC and am enjoying the game. I spent $10 on some lunch boxes and Monsieur Handys. Where else are you going to get 15 hours of enjoyment for $10? Game is enjoyable and you don't need to purchase anything if you don't want to. I never purchased anything when it was on my phone. But now I leave it open in the background and check on it every so often.
19002,"The game so far has been good. I really like the graphics, most of the gameplay, as well as the idea of the game; but it is still garbage. Three molerats will end up coming up out of the ground with your Dwellers being armed and kill every one of them. Oh its amazing. Very fun actually, just watching them never die and just using all your stimpaks (16) to try an heal up ppl fighting them an nothing every happens. SO, if you want a game that isfun for a min but wont last forever waste your time with this one. 3 Molerats shouldnt be able to take out 20 of my ppl with 14 of them having guns..."
19003,This Game is so addictive and really fun. I just find it ridiculously expensive.
19004,"Nicely made, enjoyable time waster. Simcity-like micro management apocalypse themed and Fallout S.P.E.C.I.A.L character trait based post-nuclear vault management with wasteland exploration as an added feature to help you lose the claudtrophobic vault feel. Great simple game, overall."
19005,"The game is based on a nice idea. Sadly that idea and conception were handled miserably.
I would not call it pay to win but a boring game with less features than expected. 
Also the AI of humans living in the vault is pretty bad.
Only good thing to point out is the F2P part but yeah, does not work like that"
19006,Best F2P game.
19007,"Click, Wait, Repeat. 
"
19008,"Still a better RPG than Fallout 4

I've played the mobile version when it came out until Bethesda finally got smart and put it out for PC on their ""launcher"". Still an enjoyable game throughout.  Most of the negative reviews are about microtransactions, which is funny because this game has had that since day one, the game itself is free and the items available for purchase aren't even essential, and there have been several ways to edit the files thus far. I'm honestly surprised I've seen nothing about how even at 30% most rushes fail lol.

The only problem I have with this game is the wait time for missions and the interaction with the characters. Originally it was a mobile game so people weren't usually on it 24/7 like they will be now. Then again I'm going to guess there's probably not that many missions if you knock them out back-to-back either. Assigning the characters can get annoying too sometimes. I've seen several times I'll drag them over an area to go and they don't, or the camera will dash around when you're trying to navigate the menu. Other than that, it's pretty much the same as it has been."
19009,Fun game
19010,"This game is meant for mobile. I understand it runs better, and has a higher resolution (Not including the textures and models), but if I wanted to playmobile games, I would just play them on my phone. I didn't buy my computer to play phone games.
Also, it appears I have 0.1 hours or something like that, but I played on the bethesda launcher when it first came out. I played about 3-5 hours on that but that's becuase I got tired of working back at what I had on my phone. 
+1 for performance and resolution.
Unfortunately I can't recommend it because it has micro-transactions, and it's a phone app."
19011,Pretty fun if you just want to have something up when you watch YouTube or similar.
19012,"This game is a stripped down version of the modern Fallout games.  I've played for a few weeks on ther version from the Windows store, and the Steam version has just a bit more menu options compared to that (stress on ""a bit"").

What I like about it:

1.  Fallout vintage vibe to look and sounds
2.  Levelling up of dwellers
3.  Earning caps, crafting, and exploring like the other fallout games
4.  Sending Dwellers on missions, etc.

And now for what sucks....

1.  You are limited to one vault with a maximum of 200 dwellers
2.  it takes Dwellers ages to return back to the vault...unless you want to use up (or pay for) Nuka Colas to speed that along.
2.  You have to click on each dweller when they are ready to be leveled up - no ""master button"" for doing all at once.
3.  You have to click on each room when it finished collecting it's given resource (water, food, whatever) - no master button for that either.  Adding a Mr Handy can help there, but you pretty much have to buy those with real money
4.  It's too easy to accidentally drag dwellers to the wrong place when scanning around the vault.
3.  Children are completely usesless until they grow up.  Why not be able to assign them to the classroom and have a random SPECIAL attribute be higher than the rest?
4.  Microtransactions - get rid of them and just allow a one time payment for the game
5.  Allow for turrets to be posted by the vault door to help fight off attackers, and allow them to be upgradable.  The Vault door can be breached even after 3 upgrades and you can only post 2 dwellers there which is pretty useless when the Deathclaws start attacking.
6.  Need to be able to better swap weapons between dwellers or at least be able to better find the ones with key equipment so you can send them on missions
7.  The rushes on rooms gets tedious, and there should be more variations as to what happens when they fail - fires and critter infestations get boring quickly
8.  There should be more things for the dwellers to do besides work, train, fight, or f*ck.  No resting or sleeping?
9.  Add more variety to the Mysterious Stranger character.  Right now, he is the ""Where's Waldo""of the game and gets nearly impossible to find later on.
10.  Dwellers should be able to either auto heal/remove rads or allow for a one click button to do it to all of them (do you see a theme here?)
11.  The game really has no end - after you reach 200 dwellers and do the missions....ehh, then what?

I'll recommend it because it's in the Fallout world, but it needs some tweaking to make it very good."
19013,OK!
19014,Gets boring pretty quickly...
19015,p2w
19016,Lots of fun. better than the mobile version!
19017,i actually like it besides the point that it's hard to get suplies i like it.
19018,Amazing game. Could use some updates to allow you to upgrade easier but overall a great game.
19019,"I played this on my phone a year or two ago and enjoyed my time with it, and it's the same here. Microtransactions aren't needed nor really shoved in your face, it's incredibly fun to play and check in with if you know what you're doing. 

Only thing I don't remember as much as the GODDAMN DEATHCLAW ATTACKS HAPPENING EVERY 5 MINUTES!"
19020,interesting game.
19021,"                                                !! Caution !!
THIS GAME IS AN ADDICTIVE POINT AND CLICK RPG ADVENTURE.
!! After leveling up, you are able to purchase the overseer's office you can explore other areas !!"
19022,The game truly starts once you make the Overseer's Office.
19023,Fallout shelter is a great game that is fun to have playing in the background. In game purchasing can be very tempting but with persistence it becomes futile. Also haven't played it in a while due to my Vault being overpowered and way too much good things going well for it.
19024,It's a fun game to kill some time. It's free try it out.
19025,"I used to play this game on my phone wirh 20 fps, it was still good. this game for pc? a dream come true .
You can earn everything in this game by yourself and no need to spend a dime unless you want a boost .
i wish they make this online one day."
19026,"[list]
    [*]very good flash game
    [*]any platform download
    [*]and free game

19027,"I recommend this game if you want to have grat fun for some 20-40 hours, be slightly disappointed for the next 10 and frustrated after that. Still a great game, compared to 90% of the stuff available these days! And it's free!

+++This would be the ultimate game for micromanagers! Guns, Stats, Clothes, Missions, Rooms, Upgrades, Resources + Guns with stats, Clothes with stats... stats with stats! Pure evil genius.

+++Fallout world, characters & items!! Did I mention stats?

---Lack of pause, so you can't micromanage your 100+ dwellers, because another break-in happens - you'll end up frustrated and bored after the n-th attack on your vault

---Timers (wait 9h56m for the rest of this review...

after waiting all that time you just found another set of the same stuff  <-- this actually made me stop playing and write this review

-- Poor end game mechanics

-- Big vaults are awkward to manage because of the port from a tiny cell phone UI style - try managing your stock of weapons or clothes when you have 50 and the scroll bar only shows 3 and is non customizable 

PS. A haircut costs crazy money!"
19028,OMG I love this game so much. I had this game on my IPad but I eneded up selling my IPad cause I didnt really have a need for it. They only thing I regret is selling the IPad and not having Fallout Shelter to play on a regular basis. Then it finally came to Steam :-0 I downloaded it stright away and already have 17 hrs gameplay. I AM SOOOO BLOODY ADDICTED TO THIS GAME and never knowing what you are going to find in the wasteland or in lunchboxes really keeps it exciting. 10/10 Highly Recommended.
19029,Great wast of time!! and no you dont need to spend money at all.
19030,So addicting
19031,"Having sunk countless hours into Fallout Shelter, I can say with confidence that the best possible outcome would have been for Fallout 4 to directly port over the mechanics of this game for settlements and, to a certain extent, equiment.  For example, it makes sense that the institute laser rifles would be more powerful than standard ones - they've had centuries to perfect the old tech that most wastelanders can only get through salvage.  Having happiness and settler attributes directly tied to output for various posts would have made the settlements in FO4 so much more dynamic.  There's a lot to like about the design decisions made in Fallout Shelter, and the game has been updated even though the game it's a tie-in for has been out for at least a year, so it's worth more than the price of admission in my humble opinion.

The addition of playable quests, item creation, and side-quests to wasteland exploration has extended the shelf life of this game significantly.  While the action can become repetitive as you reach the upper population limit of your vault (which, in my opinion, should be raised in light of the number of different positions and quest slots for your limited number of dwellers to occupy), there's a 'fish bowl' quality to FS that makes it something easy to waste time on.  The conversations the dwellers have are occasionally amusing - no one expects the Belethor refference the first time - and little nuggets of the classic Fallout black humor bleed through the cartooniness.

 If I had one complaint about Fallout Shelter, it would be stability issues.  While the computer port has resolved a number of them, there remain a few times when the game has crashed on my otherwise high-end PC without warning or explaination.   Some optimization, stability fixes, and tweaks to the drag-and-drop mechanic to make it more accurate would be nice.  I'd also like to see some sort of accounting for familial relationships between dwellers added to the game, such a family tree, both because it can get quite confusing  figuring out who will breed with who (relatives can't) and because it always struck me as odd that a retro-futuristic send-up of 50's American society would effectively be comprised entirely of open relationships without any refferences to drama when, say, a dweller cheats on the other parent of their child, even though there are gossipy refferences to this kind of thing in dialogue.  Then again, that might be overthinking the mechanics of a casual game, so your mileage may vary.

Overall, I rate Fallout Shelter a 7/10 - not groundbreaking, but a satisfying time-sink with forgiveable flaws."
19032,i play on tablet and computar at same time rip.
19033,"Found a unkillable mole rat.
Shot at it with 6 people.
Nothing happing.
Death everywhere.
Freaked out.
Saved and quit.
Came back and the one mole rat turned to 10.
I'm Screwed.
Saw they were killable.
Avenged my dwellers.
Revived them. 
Welcome To Fallout Shelter."
19034,"Made by Bethesda. Need I say more?

Yet another brilliant game by the Bethesda crew, who can do no wrong. Game is deceivingly simple, but in fact has lots of depth. Obviously part of the Fallout universe, it's a must play for any Bethesda or Fallout fan. Pretty sure this is the best and most popular mobile game port ever already."
19035,"It's bad... Apologies, Bethesta, but you're great at open world games, not... this."
19036,"Game has excellent graphics, music, sound effects and that's it. There is no story behind all this. This game looks pretty good at the beginning but after an hour it gets boring because of waiting time - you need to wait for anything: production, exploring, babies, new dwellers etc. In short, the game play looks something like this: open game, play it for 10 minutes the close it, wait till the next day, open it, play it for 10 minutes..... unless you want constantly pay real money for speeding up timers."
19037,"I had this game since it first came out. I love this game so much. Sometimes it's hard but when you get the right things, it's really fun."
19038,i cant stop playing this.....PLEASE HALP !!!!!
19039,"I've played this game since the Android release, and I'm still having SO MUCH FUN. Can't get enought of the Fallout series? Then this ought to soothe your wasteland nerves. Build your own vault, and oversee everything from resource production to baby production (bonus is, you even get to control their S.P.E.C.I.A.L. genetics)."
19040,"Really fun game and ive only played 6 hours and im writing a reveiw now thats somthing right? but yes i recomend it best game and I like the quests and how you are there for them so your not looking at dewellers in a vault the whole time its free but you know that already, some in game purchases, but you should get it."
19041,I like this a lot and you can't beat FREE.. lol! I haven't spent a penny on it yet and still enjoying it! :D
19042,"Fun and enjoyable game , where you can design your own base and find your own team to fight with the Nuclear Disaster . 10/10 :)) Love this game sooo much"
19043,"A radscorpion can appear anywhere in your vault at any time, do massive radiation damage over time to everyone in the room with it, then run away after a few moments of slaughtering your low-level in-training units and 'protected' non-combatants before the guards you've manually dispatched to fight it can get there. Then the radscorpion will teleport to a new room anywhere else in your base, with full health restored, and proceed to do the same thing again. And again. And again. While magically draining your vault's power the entire time so that all the lights turn off and you have to try and visually scan rooms in the dark to find where the radscorpion is now so you can futilely send your guys with the flamethrowers and the gauss rifles to arrive at the new room it was in and get off maybe two shots before it runs away again to go instantly teleport somewhere else and instantly slaughter another room full of doctors or cafeteria workers or freshly adulted children.

Did you just absolutely love the Creepers in Minecraft that could appear anywhere and then unavoidably blow up your stuff? Well then you're in luck, because that's basically what these radscorpions are.

I don't know why this enemy is in the game. Bethesda isn't even asking me to pay them to make it go away! I would pay to make it go away, it's that infuriating! It's just... a death-thing that shows up over and over and kills everything and suddenly ruins your little underground town when everything was going fine. Why even *have* a vault, anyway, if it's just going to be totally porous to anything that wants to walk in?

I can play other town management games, Bethesda. I recommend you other people do as well."
19044,Pretty dumb. It doesnt teach you about proper room placement which is important since some combine and some wont. Stupid p2w game.
19045,dis good game X'D
19046,"Hate the fact That Events happen So frequently. i wish there was a ""PLZ SPARE MEH"" thing But other than that it is a good game. just be be sure to have lots of Weapons."
19047,owowowow
19048,Addicting
19049,"It's free, that's all"
19050,"10/10
It is a great mobile knock off of Fallout. BUT! if you think you can just come in this game and click buttons and win your wrong. At times it can be exceptionally hard. I played it on mobile for almost 50 hours but I have now tried it on pc and it not only runs smother but is just easier to traverse."
19051,"You know there is a Vault DLC for Fallout 4 right? Just get that if you want the experience of running a Vault. Yeah im only 2 hours in, but most of that time was spent clicking on my facilities, pretty much no agency required. On a phone this game is probably fine, but here it makes no sense to get and spend a lot of time (or money) on."
19052,"This is nothing but a cash cow! Almost all your dwellers get killed by moles when you've invested enough time in the game just to screw you over. It happens every time. Oh... but not if you buy a lot of in game stuff for real money, then you're good to go. What a rip-off!

NOT RECOMMENDED! Don't waste your time!"
19053,"Just as good as the app game in the app store, but easier to use because I can use a mouse"
19054,"I really like this game. I've liked it since it was orignally released. I still like it. But there is one HUGE issue with this game. It's not a design flaw, it's a bug. And i'm not talking about a glitch, i'm talking about an ACTUAL BUG. The radroachs have a wierd issue where one ends up invincible. I lost at LEAST 10 people to one Roach because it wouldn't die. I had five dwellers in the same room ALL WITH GUNS and they couldn't kill it. When it finally left, I figured it would be over, but NO. There was ANOTHER invincible radroach that almost got me, but I just closed the game; And apparently, this has been a problem since 2015! It's ridiculous! 







Still recommend the game though, it's pretty fun."
19055,10/10 no hammer
19056,Please add Korean language.
19057,Meh
19058,"I would love to recommend this game because I am enjoying it.   Its a simple time and resource management game that is quirky and fun.  One problem though, if you, like myself, occasionally dabble in microtransactions, do NOT do it for this game.  Some people think microtransactions are evil, but I've always felt that the people that made the game dont work for free, and I really dont mind enhancing my game experience for a nominal fee of 4.99.  So I attempted to buy the 4.99 starter pack for one vault.  My money disappeared, no starter pack.  Steam wont refund because ""Its been consumed.""  The only thing that was consumed was the money, because the one time only purchase is still available on the game account.  Bethsheda wont refund because they never got the money.   Its very frustrating because neither party gives a crap.  Bethsheda did send me a survey after they closed the issue though, Ha."
19059,Love the game.. but too bad it does not sync my vaults from my Android device. I had to copy them manual.
19060,"Being a port from mobile I was highly skeptical.  However it's not only a challenging game, but there's plenty of cool interesting little things that can keep one interested.  I like it, worth playing esp for the price."
19061,"Kanye West becomes a Dweller. Puts him in the radio room and no one comes to my vault. Makes my vault as repulsive as his music.

10/10"
19062,"Okay, So I can see the reason why some people don't like this abomination:

- You have to wait incredibly long for quests unless if you like spending your money
- Once you lose your vault and spend money on it, that money you spent is gone forever
- When the fucking creatures like mole rats or Radroaches attack, They multiply like fucking rats
- When your vault dwellers are fighting, they run around half of the time, not doing shit
- You have to stay on your screen 24/7, otherwise, you're low on resources
- When the creatures invade your vault, your vault dwellers eat your stimpacks up like a fucking African child that sees a fat ass with a cheeseburger
-Your vault dwellers are slow af
- Finally, when you think you're doing good, BAM! The game says ""Fuck you, I'm going to invade your vault with fucking enemies that will rape your shit!""

Overall, this game has spat on my face. Fuck this game. If you want a good Fallout experience, don't bother your time with this one. It's fun and all, but in the end, you will lose everything you've been working for.

P.S., Yes, I am salty as fuck, because of the time I've spent on this game and the amount of work I've put up for this game."
19063,love it just wish you could transver your game from google play
19064,Addictive >.<
19065,"It's just another port because Bethesda's drug bunker is getting low again.

Just play this while playing non-steam games like Overwatch, WoW etc, otherwise no point bringing a mobile game to pc as a pure port."
19066,"Purely a P2W (pay-to-win) game. At first it feels like there are things to do but after a little while it became clear that all the ""game"" involves is waiting to be able to click on something that then makes you wait some more. Oh, but you can pay real money to speed things up.

I really tried to give this game a chance since I love the original two fallout games but this is one to avoid."
19067,Very fun but it can be difficult because resources's are scarce
19068,"I started playing it, recommended it to others in my family, and now we're a bunch of lazy idiots who sit around all day checking on our vault dwellers.
I wouldn't recomend playing it if you have an addictive personality, you won't be very productive after playing this game. The further you get into it, the longer it takes you to just swoop in for a little check up."
19069,"it is bugged for me wen i start it it just keep saying ""preparing to lauch the game"" i let it try for 8 hours and still notting pls fixe it i dont wanne start over  again"
19070,"The game itself is excellent, but it is still an average Android port with some technical problems. 

First off, the game ""hangs"" in the background if you exit through the main menu. The only way to bypass that is by only playing in windowed mode and exiting by closing the window (not through the main menu)
Second most anoying problem, is controls. You can accidentally send a dweller to another room while clicking on resources, or you may use a stimpak during battle, when you actually want to select a player and use radaway and then stimpak (which happens a lot on higher levels). Sometimes labels are misplaced in the tracking window.

What's not really an issue, is microtransactions. It is not forced upon you, like in many other mobile games, there are no annoying popups, and overall the game looks fairly clean from the aesthetic perspective.

Regardless of bugs and glitches, I still do recommend it."
19071,"Game gets boing fast, unless you buy Nuka Cola.. Big NO, becouse I lost my Vaults two times now, screw this buggy game."
19072,this is a very good game
19073,BAd review over 6 dollars .. purchased a MR handy and 5 lunch boxes out of game they went to my steam inventory and just vanished! Learned my lession on this game over only 6 bucks thankfully.
19074,"Idle Game
If you don't like long term rewards (Several Hours to days to accomplish a simple thing). Then this game's not for you. You need patience or money. This is a game you play on your 2. screen while doing something, or to relax, or to just check once in a while."
19075,"a pregnant woman can trains her strength by sit up for several hours straight

would do abortion again 10/10"
19076,Finally I could uninstall this game on my phone and play it on steam instead.
19077,"So look, the thing about Fallout Shelter is that it was originally a free-to-play mobile game. Like it or lump it, that's typically how these games make their money. They're designed for a very specific kind of player in the mobile market, and that was never going to translate to PC in a way that didn't leave a bad taste in some people's mouths.

I'm not typically into mobile gaming, I don't much care for the free-to-play model, but I am enjoying Fallout Shelter. When I first began, I spent about an hour running a vault and getting a feel for the way the game would play, then I started a new vault and spent $10 on a starter pack, some lunch boxes, a couple of Mr. Handy robots, and a pet. That $10 dollar investment has seen me through nearly 11 hours game play in the same vault, with the same dwellers I've been building since the beginning, and the same two Mr. Handy robots that I originally purchased.

I like micro-management games, and while I'd rather have a game that I can sit and play for hours without having quick progression locked behind a Nuka-Cola Quantum pay wall, I'm perfectly happy to spend 10 to 20 minutes at a time managing my Dwellers, running a quest, sending Dwellers out into the wasteland, setting Dwellers up to breed, and so on. Then I move on to other games for a while and can check back in on Fallout Shelter when I feel the need to break up my play time in other, more substantial games.

Know what you're getting into before you download this game -- or decided to drop any money into it. I feel like I've gotten my $10 worth out of the game, and so long as my vault continues to steadily develop, that feeling isn't liable to change."
19078,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 
VERY EARLY ON IF YOU BUY A STARTER PACK AND THEN TRIGGER THE OVERSEER YOU CAN EASILY LOSE THE USD$5 BECAUSE IT LOCKS YOU UP THEN WHEN YOU X OUT AND RESTART TO GET AROUND THIS BUG YOU SUDDENLY HAVE 3 PEOPLE OUT ON A QUEST AND YOU CAN NEVER GET THEM BACK. I HAD THIS HAPPEN 2X BEFORE I FIGURED OUT HOW TO WORK AROUND IT. I HAD 22/28 AND I HAD SENT THE BEST PEOPLE TO GO OUT ON THIS QUEST AND NOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THEM BACK. I DELETED TEH VAULT THINKING THE STARTER PACK I BOUGHT THROUGH STEAM WOULD BE RESET BUT NO SUCH THING. 
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

I just bought a strater pack and then bought an overseer office. I then had to make 3 of them go on a wasteland quest. It seemed to lock my game up, I could not zoom back out to get to the menu bar. I clicked the X to cancel the app. I come back in the overseer office is gone but I have the items from the starter pack EXCEPT for the special character!!!! Please help! Oh and when I bought the overseer office again I sent 3 out to the wasteland (sans the special character!) and now I'm stuck again! HELP."
19079,Yes great game I love playing it.
19080,Deathclaw attack in every 15-20 minutes and game lost some of my already found blueprints... 10/10
19081,free game what more can you ask ?
19082,This game is fun for the whole family. I started yesterday and have 3.5 hours of very fun waiting. This game is so simple but at the same time the best game i have ever played
19083,"When close the game ,and reopen it likes 12 hours or more , the process still continue and some of the vault die because of food not succiefient."
19084,"If a f2p-game catches me for longer than 10-20h, i will buy something from the store. Just to support the developers. In this case it was a box of 70 Nuke-Colas.

That said, the game is fun. Yes, it is very simple, yes, it is only fallout-themed and yes, it is a typical wait-or-pay mobile-game. But what gives? It is cute and has some funny ideas.

If you are an ADHD-Kid that needs to have everything right now - leave it be or bring a lot of your money...

At the start of the game you will invest a bit more time. You can watch a movie while the game runs in a small window on your 2nd screen. Every 30sec. to 5 min. it wants something. Click-click-click - wait for 2min. Click-click-click and so on.
If your shelter is a bit more advanced and the timers take longer, you will visit your shelter only once or twice a day.

You can use the WASD keys to scroll around. The game can run in a small window or it can be maximized (helpful to find the mysterious stranger).


"
19085," It's your typical cell phone game . Game takes for ever to let you collect needed caps unless you want to fork over 5$-100$ to speed things up .
  Really disappointed that steam even allows this kind of pay to play game in store."
19086,Love it
19087,Fun and Fair!
19088,"FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT 

even more perfect for background gaming"
19089,"nice game , i enjoyed play this game 











but this game waste your money :)"
19090,lovely
19091,GOOD GAME FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????
19092,Build da Vault's!
19093,"There are so many bugs that provoke my resentment, which results in uninstallation of this game :(

Not only the user interface is unfriendly, but also I felt this game very foolish.

It's just constructing facilities in your giant glory hole, and wastes your precious time.
You won't use any brain.... only placing rooms and assigning 2D characters is necessary."
19094,"it's a good game. if u see those negative review, just think that as hoax. 'coz before i also thinking about that negative one, but the proof after i play it is better  than that. just play it like u're playing THE SIMS. What u need is patience, without it u can not endure to play the game. u don't need to spend some real money to enjoy the game. Currently is me 2nd vault, coz the 1st one is a failure because i just try it. for quantum cola in the game, after u spend some of it, make sure u take on quest that give quantum cola as rewards. just don;t spend it too much, coz u'll be need it later on, especially before u build overseer office. As for gaining more citizen, just do a match making, it'll take some time, but u get it for free.

Note:
o> just equip a weapons n clothes to everyone
o> make sure to build power plant and keep maintaining it so u can get the poer resource.
o> One think the most important is, don't forget to save the game before u leave the game or after u accomplish something."
19095,"I've already sunk in this many hours into a port of a moble game, so it must be good, right?"
19096,No cloud save transfer from Android. Pretty pointless to consider starting from the bottom again.
19097,"I really tired to give this game a chance. 
I don't think is bad but i think needs to fix it self up. This not made for a pc game. More like a mobble game. You have to keep track of it all the time. Leave your vault for 5 minutes, my dwellers were hungry and ect. I love how it's base off fallout's vault tec's vault."
19098,Incredibly good game! :3
19099,"For now players wont need any simulators, third party launcher, and else to play it, who is like me, and likes steam. :)

Nothing changed, its awesome, as always it was!
10/5 stars!"
19100,Freemium phone app. Made to make you pay to speed up the game.
19101,My advice is to play this game on mobile if able. As far as I see there is basicly no difference between PC and Mobile.
19102,A good time killer but quickly becomes repetitive.
19103,The only game where you can kill preston
19104,my fallout shelter crashes directly when i start it please help
19105,"I used to play this game in iOS  a few months back. Back then i really used to enjoy playing this game. Then I decided to stop playing as my exams were coming up.

a week back after losing yet another CS:GO session (what? I'm a noob, sue me) I decided to take a break and that's when I found out that Fallout Shelter has been released on Steam for free. Excited, I quickly added it to my library and started playing it. I really enjoy it but there are a couple of things that need to be fixed imo;
1. Nerf Deathclaw : it is incredibly frustrating to keep dealing with back-to-back waves of Deathclaw attacks without casualities. Fortunately none of my dwellers have succumbed yet to these attacks, but that's not the case for most of the other players. it would be much better if deathclaw attack frequency was lower aand their strength be nerfed a bit
2. UI changes: there needs to be a different UI during attacks and battles as the normal mouse controls keep interfering and selecting the wrong rooms and all the like. That should be fixed too.

oher that that there is little i can fault with in the game.

7/10"
19106,"I Played This Game On Mobile Like More Hours And I Like this game.Now,Release On Steam.Try To Play it On PC. The Feels Is Same. Recommended For you never play this game."
19107,The game has a multitude of microtransactions but is the only game I can tolerate thoroughly without wishing to vomit due to the microtransactions. This game is an amazing game and I'll most likely keep playing from now until I find something new and more impressing. This game will keep most entertained. I say 'most' because not everyone can tolerate the constant baggering for buying more 'this' and more 'that'. It is still a lovely game with great features nonetheless.
19108,gg for a free game
19109,"Do not need to say much at all, it is just simply an awesome game. 



PS: To those who say its a moblie game should not be on pc blah blah, please go f*** yourself thank you! :)"
19110,"Nice way to pass time, quite addicting. Played this on my phone, but much better on PC."
19111,"well... as it's not designed for pc! it's normal to get a thumb down from pc players! it's too slow to play on pc! it's a mobile game!

Steam! please stop accepting such titles on here!

WTF!"
19112,AWESSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19113,Im playng this game on 5 different devices...
19114,"Played 50+ hours trying to build something great, failed horribly by the amount of mobs.
Used a cheat, built everything and now it's hard time to manage everything.
Now either achievement hunting and doing quests.

Okay game to play, but definitely a grinder."
19115,"Not bad, hopefully more legendary weapons and dwellers from previous games will appear in this game."
19116,While it may not be the best management game out there Fallout Shelter will keep the fans of the franchise coming back for more. 8/10
19117,"They need to do a little rethink on the travel times, this is in Real time not game time. 20 real hours to get somewhere in the game is just way way to long. This is the PC version i'm talking about. To much on the cost to shorten that time problem.

Some other bugs:

Have had enemys that are in God mode nothings kills them. And they just wipe out a Vault. Ruin's the Game and the experiance

Fires nearly every 5 min's in the Vault.
Radroach attacks same as fires.
Rad scorpian attacks the same as the fires, and unkillable. 

Armour is useless.

Fix the Mysterious stranger to. He's there about 1 second. And also appeares in the elevators with the door closed. you can't even click on him there. ( I no longer even look for him due to the buggyness )

Making weapons, takes way to long in the game.

Animals Perks don't do as the game advertising says. ( Just don't work )

Coming back from a mission the items you scored, just disappear and don't go into storage. So mission was a bust for supplys you  need. ( This goes for Weapons, Armour's and Supply's )

NPC's get damage across the room from attacks from rad roaches, and unarmed enemys. If one NPC gets damaged they all do, 

Very limited storage,

Some tips in the game you can't shut down. Like the tips for the Overseerers Module and it just shoves you into a mission and uses your Nuka Colas to speed you along. No way out of it just because you built the Overseers office.

No way to fix or repair the Mr Handy till he's destroyed. there should have been at least a repaur bay for the robotic's in the game.

Have reinstalled the game times and still has the same bugs. I've played it about 8 hours each time except the first time i played it 26 hours. when i got to about 45 NPC's in my Vault it was constant attacks and fires. Game became unplayable and unsastainable at that point. 

I don't normally do side scroller games. But loved the idea and the managment of the game and it is Fallout. I have all the fallouts and have played them all. This one really was a let down due to some of the bugs and the monitizing way they are using. They really Do need to do a rethink on the way they are getting money here. Cheapen it down some. This is on PC, Fix the Bugs. Clean it up a bit. Widen the map to just a little. You would get a whole lot more Good reveiws and players that won't just shelve it. Or not get it when they read the reveiws.

Other wise i like the game, i play games 8 to 12 hours or more at a stretch, I Beta test games and have been playing games since before there was a Home Computer. Use to play on Corperate computers during backups hehehe.

I would recommend the game except it needs to be fixed not just set up for PC and thrown out there."
19118,is gud
19119,fun game to kill time with and if theres nothing else better to play
19120,love the game concept would love missions that come to you tho like a random misssion that knocks on your door like a person with a map or a seige is coming evan a feral stampeade
19121,"7.5-8.5/10 

Fallout shelter is a fun little game that you play for five to ten minutes at a time that can get pretty challenging at times. A lot will complain about it being a 'pay to win' game, but it isn't; if you're impatient or make stupid decisions, like send your dwellers out into the wasteland with no stimpaks or horde your weapons instead of equipping people, then you'll be tempted to buy lunchboxes and other items. But that's why this is a 5-10 minute session game: you check your vault(s) in the morning, at lunch, after dinner, or whenever you have a few free minutes with nothing to do, fiddle around, and go about your day, including playing other games. There's no need to spend money on this game in order to enjoy it. 

There are a few issues that do prevent me from giving this game a better score and will irritate you: 
-The cursor isn't precise in some situations, the most common one being needing to place dwellers on the ceiling of the room you assign them instead of in the room itself. 
-When combat takes place in some of the rooms, dwellers will stack and stand behind each other, preventing you from clicking on the right person to heal them. This happens rarely, but when it does, you will need to pay to resurrect your dweller what feels unnecessarily. 
-About a third of the Mysterious Stranger's spawn locations, namely those with forebround and background areas, are cheap; as in, he's behind a wall or one of your dwellers and unless you dramatically change the angle of your view, you won't see him, even if that room is the only thing you see. You'll get sick of this fast and is something that, like the dwellers stacking in rare combat instances, needs to be patch-fixed so it's less cheatsy BS. 
-Click and draging to change perspective is not recommended. Accidentally click on a dweller and you'll end up sending them somewhere you don't want or just unasign them. Also, double-clicking while doing this causes the camera to focus on the person or room you double-clicked, fighting against your manual controls and require you to double-click and let the camera do what it wants before you get control back or else you'll be camera-locked in that one dweller or room. 

These are all minor annoyances and irritations that could due to be patch-fixed out or are just part of the game's mechanics and need to be kept in mind when playing. Playing for short lengths of time will keep you from being bothered by them too much or feel tempted to buy anything. 

Recommended if you spend a lot of time on your computer, but the iOS version is more convenient and enjoyable."
19122,great game
19123,"This is really a neat little game. The fighting could be a bit better but it is what it is. The only thing I would really like to see improve is when you go through your dweller list and stop on one to fix him/her up and/or re-outfit them then when you go back to the list it starts all over again. I wish you could ""pause"" the list so to speak and return where you left off after you do something with someone on it."

19131,"I love this game but it's needing new changes and update recently I have been playing another game ""American Dad apocalypse soon"" and they have stuff that this game does not like trading resources, clans, base raids, and honestly a decent campaign and tournaments and what would be great would be to do what 76 did in a sense by making a base above ground that's just me. Because as of recently I have not been playing for reasons because there has not been much to do since then

7/10 Would build a real life Fallout shelter."
19132,"Bought the us$5 ""vault-tec starter pack"", the pack never went to my inventory, lost the money, bethesda is doing nothing to compesate this major error, happened to  a lot of guys, several threads being created from people that happened the same to me, guys who spend more money than i. No official response about this. Is a shame but im not risking money again.

If you dont buy things the game is suuuper slow, and i dont recommend to risk on buying things to this game."
19133,Great game!
19134,pretty boring
19135,"Decided to play on Survival mode,
Had a Mole rat attack and no stimulators in the vault 
26 people died from 4 rats (in case what 2 of them were killed in 15 sec)
Nice game 10/10"
19136,"I would have paid $10-$20 for this game to be free of microtransactions.
But it's still an incredibly fun game, and you never have to pay a dime.
I would highly recommend never paying any money, because all the transactions are per-save. 
So if it crashes, or corrupts, you loose your money.
"
19137,perty gud
19138,I just Love it :D
19139,"FINALLY ON STEAM!  ...without cross-platform sync.

If you spent a lot of time building a vault on another platform (ex Android/iOS) then get ready for disappointment.  (Unless you want to manually transfer your vault without regular sync.)

If you are new to the game and don't have a touch screen, you might want to avoid this desktop version and try it on another platform.  This game was designed for touch, and it's a bit janky with a mouse.

If they ever redesign the UI for keyboard/gamepad and/or enable sync with other platforms this might be worth revisiting.  

As of today: avoid."
19140,"Very fun despite its microtransaction nature. Although it is always a gamble of the wheel.Whether or not you get a good vault but you can at least get the premium currency. So even if you get not the best vault you're not completely lost.
And you can have up to 3 vault's which allow you to experiment on what to do.
You can see with part of my play through to see what I mean.
Money just excels the game progress. But does not Beat It.
Best to be played as an idle game.One other thing if you do buy something it only sticks on that vault playthrough so keep in mind.

Holo and Wolf out.

19141,"It's good for a phone game, but it's pointless to play as a pc game because it's nothing more than a waiting simulator if you wanna play in 'sessions'. Especially the fact that you have to wait hours before you can start a quest, and then another bunch of hours before you can finish it killed it for me."

Good game"
19150,"It's a waiting/eugenics simulator. It's free. It's a lot of fun at the beginning but quickly loses steam as things seriously slow down during middle game, and picks up again as you're entering late game. You do not need to pay to win in this game, and there really isn't a winning condition to begin with. You mostly spend cash to speed through the game, which I wouldn't personally recommend. It is far more satisfying to earn your way to the top.

The graphics and sounds are minimalistic but charming, and the game is really good at rewarding your actions. The only real downside to FOS is that it has no multiplayer component, not the micro-transactions, which I think is a huge oversight and would have added far more re-playability to the game. There are also some questionable gameplay decisions, and there are frustrations when dealing with dweller combat in the vault and some disasters (radscorpions), but it's nothing you won't be able to deal with if you're adequately prepared.

Many players find enjoyment by conducting social experiments. For example, is your vault only populated by women and all the men are sent into the wasteland? Or maybe your vault has everyone named Jerry? Maybe all the kids born into the vault have to go through a rite of passage in the wasteland or die trying? You can decide all of that, and I highly recommend that you do. FOS is all about making your own fun, so be creative. For added bonus, try survival mode. It's actually pretty easy if you know what you're doing, even if you're completely new to FOS.

A few tips right off the bat: The game is based around several key concepts, and if you don't want to get completely destroyed by rad roaches or fires, make sure you aren't upgrading your rooms unless your dwellers are all armed and in their 30s. This is critically important by the time radscorpions start showing up (60 and 35 population for normal and survival). Keep you overall dweller level down if you don't want to be minced by deathclaws (60 and 35 pop). SPECIAL stats only matter for manning rooms and exploring the wasteland, and questing to a lesser extent.

Endurance should be your number one priority, since health in FOS is only determined at level up and does not work retroactively with endurance. Endurance does stack past 10, so you want to level up with the best endurance gear you have to get the most health possible.

As a bonus tip for survival mode, you can avoid disasters by isolating rooms in a checkerboard-like pattern, since everything but radscorpions cannot travel past dirt tiles. This won't work past 35, when the radscorpions show up, so I suggest being well-armed and well-trained after that point, and then hitting nuclear reactors as fast as possible. The rest you can read about online, if you desire to know more about the inner workings of the game."
19151,"This is a quality example of how build-your-own-base style games NEED to be! No pressure to buy lunchboxes, pet crates or Mr. Handy's! It's a fast-paced start and the tutorial isn't as repetitive as most other games. Quality port to PC too."
19152,I don't really know why I love it so much as I do and can't explain it either
19153,"Do NOT buy anything from them. 

I stupidly bought the ""Starter Pack"" for 4.99

19155,"An otherwise lovely charming mostly relaxing game utterly ruined by the elusive rad scorpions that will annoy the hell out of you long before you have the equipment and population to deal with them. Then when you finally do have the population to fill EVERY room with adequate weapon weilding dwellers the only thing that annoys you is the alarm itself as the scorpion dies within moments.........

Its free and everything you can buy in the shop can be obtained in game so the micro transactions are just a choice if you want to speed the game along or not."
19156,"This game is nice. ive been playing this game even before the pc release and it was good on my phone. now that they ported it on pc, its even better. its a free game so there are microtransactions. definitely recommend. and oh, dont mind my english. :P"

These problems are such as to play you have to give up your job, family, and become a hermit to keep your people alive
Unlike the Sims, they can't think for themselves.

Secondly the 'auto-collecting' mr.handy only collects on the floor he is placed on and as far as 'collecting caps in the wasteland' yes it is all he collects is caps, but he doesn't collect many as in 2 hours gets about 60 caps.

Its a fun game, but unless you want to give up everthing to collect/protect, If you want to try it go ahead, but if you step away for an hour all your people will be dead before you can say 'helpful mr.handy'"

19191,"Nice little game with a nice feel for the Fallout games. Build a Vault, fill it with residents and keep them happy and occupied, train them, feed them, armor them and upgrade their weaponry.  Send them on quests or let them explore. I found out it's not realy an easy little game . If you go too fast you'll face bigger treats. You'll have to keep an eye on several things to keep everything going nice and smooth. I made a lot of mistakes the first few tries but my 4th Vault seems to do allright for the time being. 

The first few days you'll have to check in regulary to keep an eye on things but when things are running smoothly you can leave your dwellers alone for days. Just don't forget to stock your explorers with enough Stims and Rad-aways and train them for long walks and fights. And plan your quests. Some of them will take more than 10 hours to get there. Send your troops out before you go to bed. The next day you can do the quest and send them back home (and if you found some Nuka-cola you can have them home in no time). 

Some other nice Fallout touches in-game that Fallout players will recognize and appreciate. Made for Mobile and now for pc gamers. I like it a lot for a casual game."

19199,"First thing you should know, ignore the comments that say this game is P2W and you cant progress without paying, or its very slow to progress without paying. That's a lie. I actually began progressing so quickly when i figured out the game that i almost ran out of resources because of quickly i was growing. I had to slow down my growth, focus on resources just not to overpopulate. 

Now

Onto the review. 

Amazing game, nice graphics. Music is good and fits the game.  Kills time, can be very focused, or an afk game, depending on how you choose to play it.

DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME!!!

Money is spent gives you items per 1 save file. If you delate it, everything you bought is gone. If file gets corrupted its gone, and imo the rewards are not worth it unless you're some rich saudi/uae/kuwaiti prince or some rich dude from china."
19200,Very adivtive fun mobile game!

After many, many saves at different intervals, I load up the game to find my main vault wiped from exsistance. After reloading the game several times and verifying cache, it's still gone. Free to play? Yeah you got it. I'll never play another F2P again. What a load of shit."
19207,"The game is really enjoyable
"
19208,crashes
19209,"Good game, I love this game on PC than on Mobile"
19210,time killing fun
19211,"Pros: 
Fun cartoony Pip-Boy take on the Fallout universe.
Worth the price of free
Amusing humor

Cons:
Poorly adapted from mobile. Or more accurately; Not adapted. Change up the pacing and make the controls more PC is not asking a lot.

But my main con is this: I spent the past couple of weeks playing this game pretty consistently and I dropped $6 on it. (Starter pack and a Mr. Handy). Then it unexpectedly shut down. Upon restarting, my vault save file had disappeared along with my $6 dollars and all the time I had spent on it. I tried contacting Bethesda for technical support or a refund. Only get automated answers.  

After this happened I delved into the reviews. I'm not the first that this is happened. Be forewarned, you could lose any save file you make. That includes the time you put into building an awesome vault and any money you spent.
"
19212,"TL:DR

Good game, nice features, get it, don't buy stuff for RL Money, how can you shoot in this game?!





This game is first of all for free available within some buyable features, well, there are ways to avoid this 'I need stuff and have to pay for it', but I don't give a damn about it, coz the game is just great.

For the people who spent money on the game: I'm sorry, but if your SAV file went kaputt or anything like that, your own fault to be honest, use a website to make yourself up there where you used to be and don't even spend money on it, otherwise you're seriously a dumbnut if you buy the features once again.

I haven't found personally any negative points, besides some small one which doesn't even have to be listed.

The positive sites of the game is:

- It's free
- If you've builded yourself up to an amazing complex you become slowly addicted
- The Wasteland Mission's are well-made, thumbs up
- You can re-name dwellers to that what you want
- You can create that kind of complex you want to have (Personally, I have an Underhell-Kind-Of-Base)
- You can send out dwellers with fat armor and the best gun within x25 stimpaks & x25 rad-x to the wasteland for a couple of days
- You can kick out dwellers you don't need / want to have / etc.
- You can speed up processes, exampling Armor-Creation Process, S.P.E.C.I.A.L Processes and all that stuff.
- You can pretty much do quests with the highest level'ed dwellers and a maximum of x25 stims & x25 rad-x's 
- And in my opinion, alot of more stuff, only sad thing is that the maximum dwellers number exists, but well, if there's a family, just kick thus out and you got more space.

One of the best F2P's out there for real, for people who think elsewhere, here some usefull hints:

- Don't buy anything which involves real life money use a website to edit it for free instead of wasting money on stuff.
- Don't scream around if a dweller dies
- Use a Website to modify your stuff to have some features and 24/7 entertainment, going back on Point 1.

If these hints shouldn't have helped, then you should stop playing the game and play a game for 60.00‚Ç¨ (Where is the diffrence there anyway?)"
19213,It's one of the best free to play games I've played. It's a great casual game with awesome graphics!
19214,"This game would be absolutely awesome, if it weren't free, I mean pay to win. Then, they wouldn't attempt to make it totally impossible to play, without buying things in-game continually. While I never gave them a penny, unless you have utterly stellar willpower, I would recommend just skipping this game. Too bad, because I would have happily bought this game, had it been an actual game, instead of a lame attempt to buy disposable things, the way pay-to-win games such as this are designed. Now I'm off to uninstall it, sadly."
19215,"Get it. Be warned, though; You may never see your family again. The world may melt around you and all that you will see is the game. You may forget to pay the bills... or shower. Highly recommended."
19216,my computer crashed and i couldn¬¥t acces my save anymore so i lost everything i had.
19217,it a good game
19218,gg
19219,!
19220,Dont listen to the salty people about spending money and crying about dumb stuff. just play it and enjoy it. its free and amazing
19221,Boring and trash.
19222,"So far I've really enjoyed it more than I should. It's quite simple, a phone game ported to PC but there is something quite addictive about it. Up until now it's been a great casual game, play a little bit once or twice every day (or a little more) and no you don't have to buy anything as long as you accept it as a casual game.

That said I might change my mind as I continue because thins are getting tougher now. It's still not tough, but definitely tougher and they could do a lot of quality of life additions when you're browsing through your list of dwellers trying to find who's got a certain weapon, outfit, dog etc. Sometimes dragging and dropping a dweller at the right place just doesn't really seem to work properly so being able to change room in the list and other minor things like that would greatly benefit the game experience. Just adding a little extra touch instad of just porting it straight over would've made a huge difference.

Oh... And playing this with my steam link (with mouse/kbd) is the ultimate couch potato slacker casual gamer experience. Strangely addictive for no good reason.

Edit: Some notes after a lot of game time.
- You will go nuts fighting the controls. You can use both mouse and keyboard, but when you try to use them at the same time - zooming out with the mouse and moving up with the keyboard, or the reverse etc - the game ""snaps"" you back resulting in lost time and killed dwellers during incidents (like deathclaw attacks that get a lot more frequent).
- You also go bonkers when dwellers trade places with you because the game thinks you double clicked or dragged a dweller to the floor below when you actually just tried to click the dweller. Even dropping dwellers is very inaccurate resulting in dwellers dropping on a floor lower than you expected. Suddenly your STRONG dweller is trainging Perception and a Perception dweller is working on you nuclear plant.

And the only real way to solve that crap is to have an empty room in the middle of ""hot spots"" where you can drop a dweller temporary to reassign them.

- Around 100 dwellers the game sort of either comes to a grind/halt or you get very busy managing explorers while waiting for the caps to invest in legendary weapons and outfits etc.

That said, for a free game, this is fantastic fun and so much better than playing it on a small screen. (I'm really to old for the phone version. Played plenty of hours on my SGS6 but.. I have no clue what the text says, just click and hope for the best or screen mirror the phone screen to my TV)."
19223,"Great eugenics simulator.

Iplayed this game when it was released in 2015 and it got boring quick, but the adition of Quest really improved that."
19224,good game
19225,Very addictive and fun to build your very own vault!
19226,"Although it is a direct port of a mobile phone game, it is still quite fun for a casual gamer. Although you can't sync with the saves in Android version, you can port them easily by copying the saves into the PC folder. Meant for people who likes simple, ant farm like, mouse clicking simulator, this is it. It's not Fallout New Vegas, people."
19227,love it takes alittle time to get it going but once you do lots of fun
19228,"Meh! Another click, wait, earn type of game. This is for Facebook not for Steam."
19229,it is awsome survival/apocalips game ever
19230,"P2W garbage
a disgrace to the fallout name"
19231,I've played alot of idle games....and this is the best hands down.
19232,"Not for PC. This game is still a free phone game (for both iOS and Android) if you really want it. It plays far too slowly to be a PC game and is definately a game where you do something in it, then come back maybe an hour later (even HOURS later, the longer you play and upgrade stuff, etc). 

It's a good phone game, but not a good PC game, unless you plan to leave it running in the background while you do something else."
19233,i mod FO4 so hard that my laptop only processing  12 fps. so alternatively i played this (if this game is mod available i'm sure gonna have fun time doing it)
19234,"[b]Almost Great, But Poorly Ported From Mobile Platform[/b]
---------------------------------------------------------------

I've put a good amount of time into this game and, for a free-to-play game, this is actually fairly decent and I won't bash it for it's business strategy in order to make the game pay for itself - at least Bethesda isn't releasing the game in a series of DLC's (yet?); but the game suffers from not being very PC-friendy in a number of ways.  These issues could be remedied by making a few very simple tweaks and here are my suggestions:

[olist]
[*] [b]No Drag-to-Select[/b] - Because the players on this PC-port of the game will generally use mouse and keyboard, the game should have been more well-adapted to this.  Being able to select multiple dwellers, then moving them all at once, should be a basic feature in a game such as this.  Adding click-and-drag selection (and perhaps even a feature where double-clicking a vault dweller selects all dwellers in the same room) would go a long way toward making this a more PC-friendly port.

[*] [b]No Right-Click[/b] - Right-clicking has hardly been incorporated into the game.  Mostly, the player drags-and-drops the dwellers to move them.  Lack of an aforementioned multiple-selection feature coupled with no right-clicking suggests that Bethesda hadn't put a whole lot of effort into porting this game over and must not think that a proper port might make them a bit more profit.

[*] [b]Long Quest Timers[/b] - On a mobile platform, players can carry their devices everywhere they go, then take it out in the waiting room at the doctors' office or when work is slow and the boss isn't looking.  PC's aren't nearly as mobile-friendly (or discreet) as smart phones and tablets, so coming back to the vault during lunch break to roleplay as the Overseer isn't too feasible for the typical PC-user.  PC-users want more eventful gameplay.  Honestly, I get that Bethesda wants to use the typical free-to-play business strategy popular on mobile platforms and I'm fine with it; but on PC, 12 hours is a bit too long to wait for my dwellers to arrive at a quest.

[*] [b]Not Enough Radio[/b] - Fallout 3 spoiled me with it's fantastic radio and was one of the things that kept me hooked on the game.  I would like an option to hear more radio after making a radio room without having to zoom in to the radio room.  It would also be nice if Bethesda could add a little more music to add to the atmosphere of the game.
[/olist]

In short, I believe that if Bethesda added multiple-selection, right-clicking, cut their quest timers by at least half, and added more music this would become a far more enjoyable (and profitable) game for them.  For now, I'm giving a thumbs down; but I'll give the game a thumbs up after Bethesda, [i]at the least[/i], makes the game more PC-friendly by adding improved selection and right-click features.

19240,"1 week into the game, it corrupts and deletes your save file... if you dont want any grief dont even attempt to downlaod it theres currently no fix and that just sucks for me"
19241,"Hurray for Fallout Shelter having -absolutely ridiculous- scaling based on how many dwellers you have. Oh, you need more dwellers to man important stations like power plants and diners? Just breed for them! Oops, you have too many dwellers time to send DEATHCLAWS AND RADSCORPIONS AT YOU.
After a single radscorpion attack I can't even heal all my dwellers quick enough to prepare for -anything else-. It's just one incident after another and it all spirals out of control with no way of recovery. They don't give you a breather at all.
Went from ""hey, my vault looks really nice and is coming along really well with little difficulty"" to ""hey your entire vault is fucking destroyed"" instantly. This isn't fun, this is soul crushingly frustrating to the point where I instantly quit playing the game entirely.
I regret spending any amount of money on this."
19242,"If your a fan of the mobile one, than this will dissapoint you.

Pros:
Seems just as the mobile but on a computer
Some explotiable glitches still exist

Cons
Buggy interface
Sometimes Characters won't move into another room
Icons and Character potraits dissapears
Freezes when saving

The icon dissapearing actually ruing my first playthrough.  The build icon was missing.  My advice is to not spend a single cent until these bugs are fix.
"
19243,"Great Game For FREE!
simple and easy point click time clock based, can be boring after many hours of play. played many hours on mobile before steam compatability.
microtransactions not a problem, all items can be earned in game but through some patience.
many references and tributes to traditional fallout games"
19244,"I've played this game for a bit now but i've ran into a bug that makes a mole rat indestructible and it killed almost all my dwellers (level 15-25) even tho it was getting pumped with led from all angles, later I just avoided the room with the few servivors i had left but the mole rat stayed in the same room doing nothing but making more molerat ""spawnings"" happen around my base...... in short one indestructible molerat caused more molerats to spawn in and it didnt stop...."
19245,I only played with it a few minutes but i'm love in with it.
19246,"NOT WORTH PLAYING!

This game is not good at all, its more a fanfiction thing than a real game. Only Fanboys/-girls will aprove this game.
You have absolute nothing to do besides waiting. the collection thing would be fine if there is more to do after clearing the mission, the room upgrades are absolute borring (and mostly useless), the ""surprising"" events are so lame that even the second event is anoying. the mission/quests are absolute borring written. the ""managment"" of the vault is idiotic, therefor the game push you to use this system is more anoying. when you hit the 100 the game is nearly unplayable. No filters, no indicator no searching... what a waste. The whole control is a big mess. scroll some out and you nearly always target the wrong thing."
19247,Decent game to be played while relaxing ! 10/10 Best !
19248,"most annoying trailer, and best fallout story. Wish it was merged into fallout 4."
19249,"Every time i wanna play it, after 5seconds it shuts down  :("
19250,If you're a whore for steam achievements like me then any free game with achievements is worth it. Game itself is aight.
19251,This game is amazing. Lots of Fallout easter eggs.
19252,"More of a ""bored"" game that you play in between others, but it's probably the best kind of bored game you're going to get on PC. Sure, you could just use your phone, but if you hate using a touch screen as much as I do, you'll appreciate the ability to have this running maybe in the background sometimes, even just as something to idly do instead of blankly stare at your game library wondering what to do."
19253,"so much fun and not boring at all
"
19254,"Yes, the game has microtransactions. Yes, they would make the game a breeze to play through.  Is it playable without them? Yes, but it takes a little time to get started.  The trick to playing this game without paying is to get your base sufficient enough and with the nukacolas you start with and the rewards alone, you can kind of play the system for a while.  Do only quests that reward nukacolas and continue to replenish your supply.  I finished around 30 quests this way that otherwise wouldve taken days or at least $20+.  That being said, the game is fun, but it is an idle play game so dont expect different."
19255,i love how they're having sex.
19256,"WARNING ~ HIGHLY ADDICTIVE

A very fun and well presented RTS harkng back to the golden age of games done well.

Even better you can play this fun time consumer totally free. It doesn't try to nickle and dime you at every stage, it lets you know where to get any RMT boost if you so desire without ramming it down your throat.

No bad points really so at a stretch sometimes, not very often, you click a character and it sends them to a random room above or below the one they are in, easily solved by replacing them in the original room."
19257,Excellent PC port of fallout shelter from mobile. I am impressed and love it.
19258,"Really fun, especially when you just start it. It gets a little more boring as you increase the size of your vault."
19259,Much better than the mobile app so far!
19260,"Played around 15 hours without noticing at all ( Though sometimes kind of leaving it in the background ), then got bored and killed everyone in the vault. There now are around 50 dead bodies scattered in my vault.

It's an alright game, though not really designed to be played on PC. It's made to be a mobile game to kill time for 5 to 10 minutes while in public transports or just waiting around. On PC, games are usually meant to be played for extented periods of time. If you try to do that, you often end up actually waiting around for stuff to happen. Not exactly fascinating.

Can be worth a try if you like the Fallout franchise, just don't buy microtransactions, that would be idiotic."
19261,"Ignore the Negative Reviews, they didn't realize it's an ""Antfarm Game"" and isnt to be taken seriously like the original Fallout games. 

This is a great game to be playing when you are busying doing something else like school work, college work, artwork, etc.

Based on the Mobile Phone game; it's much more stable, fun, and the new ""Quest"" function gives the game a more action feel.

PROS:
- Good filler game when busy with life
- Satisfying pace of Vault developement
- Customize any and all dwellers to fit your needs
- Quests feel rewarding
- Small rewards here and there in your own vault
- Caps are easy to come by, specially with the ""Catch the Spy"" chance game
- Gear is never a problem
- Nuka-Cola Quantums make questing super fast, and enjoyably more fun

CONS:
- Combat Speed is very slow in the beginning, until you reach Blue-Grade Weapons
- Levels dont increase dweller Health, only your Endurance Points
- Leveling dwellers feels pointless when you reach Blue-Grade weapons and armor
- Mister Handy is extremely pointless in purchasing. Cant farm gear in the Wastes, only collects caps, and easy to break.
- Lunchboxes became pointless when Schematics came into play, so you can craft whatever you want
- Pets are also pointless, unless you got the pets that increase +% Caps Found
- The overall Micro-Transactions are pointless, except for the Nuka-Cola Quantum to speed up quests

SCORE:
I give this game a solid 7/10

Currently the problems with the game revolve around the game being TO rewarding, and TO easy to craft the high-tier weapons and armor, so you end up with a lot of them; making the game easy. But Some people like this cause of busy-styled lives. But to play this game as an ""actual"" game is not the point. It's an antfarm supposed to sit on your dresser and occasionally be tended to, so shaking said antfarm doesnt make it more fun."
19262,"[h1] Game good, medium bad. [/h1]

This game is good. Like, really good. I often find myself glued to the screen for more than an hour just working to increase the efficiency and productivity of my vault. It is addictive. VERY addictive. However, I cannot, in good heart, recommend this game for anyone who is limited to a PC and cannot play the game on a mobile device. It is not MEANT to be played on a computer. The game requires you to check in every thirty minutes or so, and that means that if you're not on your computer all day - like most people - you are going to get fucked in the ass. See, in the game, you need to keep three meters stable so that your vault can survive. These are electricity, water, and food. If your electricity meter gets low, rooms will start to lose power and the entire vault will begin losing functionality. If your water meter gets low, the people in your vault, your ""dwellers,"" will start losing health, and that lost health will be replaced with radioactive illness, which you need RadAway to get rid of. If your food meter gets low, your dwellers' happiness will drastically fall, which you want to keep up so that you get a good daily grade so that you can get a lot of money. It also means that your dwellers will start losing health and other S.P.E.C.I.A.L (strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck) characteristics, which you need up so that your dwellers can fight raid attacks and radroaches. If one is low, it's pretty easy to get back up. If two are down, it usually takes a good chunk of time to get back up as it is costly. If all three are down, exit the game, reload it, delete your save, and start a new game, because no matter how hard you try, you are not getting those fuckers fixed - they are dead for good. Because it is so important to check in and keep your vault stable, you need a quick, easy way to access your save file. The game on mobile does really well, but it is absolutely dreadful on PC. On mobile, you just open your phone, click on the app, do what you need to do, and then back to real life it is. On the COMPUTER, you need to login to your Steam, go to your game library, find Fallout Shelter, start running the game, wait for the game to load, open your save, wait for THAT to load, do what you need to do, then ""X"" out of the game, and log out of your Steam. It does not work on PC, period. If you must play this game on the PC, so fucking be it - but please realize there are better options that make this game one-hundred and seven percent more enjoyable! It really is a great game, and I don't want your first experience with it to be... [i] this. [/i]"
19263,"Really fun game played when it first came out. I was really happy when it came out on steam thanks:)
"
19264,"There's a lot of hate for the game on Steam, so I thought I'd chime in.

I played the original Fallout Shelter on Android when it was released, it was a novel and fun take on the fallout universe that you could play on the go and enjoy. On release it felt a bit one dimensional, and after a few sessions I got bored of it.

Playing the PC port feels nice. The game has been updated in the past couple of years and has a lot more content, which gives it a lot more purpose in my opinion. The introduction of quests at a certain progression level amps up the entire gameplay loop. You receive a ton of rewards per successful mission and can loot nuka currency (which you would ""need"" to buy otherwise).

Let me repeat that last part: you DO NOT need to purchase anything, in any microtransaction to enjoy this game. I use nuka currency to speed up traveling to/from the wasteland and loot more nuka than I use by doing quests. There are also various miscellanous ways to earn caps which you can find out for yourself by playing.

This is not a big time-sink RPG. It's a really nice game to play for short periods of time. If you really want to play a long session you can easily do so by questing, which gives it more of a singleplayer Fallout vibe and disproportionally positive rewards compared to the start activities.

HAVING SAID THAT, the PC port itself is very basic. Mouse control is finnicky, and I often find myself not being able to click and drag properly. To some people this will be a very big deal, so it's worth mentioning."
19265,"the mobile app is very enjoyable, and i've had it since it was released on IOS, puting it on PC was all i've ever wanted from it, and so far it's held up and is enjoyable to start all over again. My biggest gripe is with selecting people could be a bit better, sometimes it just doesn't select a dweller. But still very enjoyable to manage my own vault."
19266,When the game crush you lose all your progress and shit .. and it's the 4th time that happens 0/10
19267,Can't even open in a window. Garbage. Thank god it's free. I'll just keep playing on my android I guess.
19268,pretty fun
19269,"A game you'll spend hours at.
Lots of stuff to do if you construct the right ''buildings''... The quests are actually fun (some of them).
A good game to play if you're bored or if you're doing something and you just keep this game turned on in the background in the meanwhile.

Ten outta' ten - IGN."
19270,its good ...
19271,"Fallout Shelter is a waiting game/simulation game based on the Fallout verse. You are the overseer of a vault, and it is your job to build up your vault and its population, looking after them and protecting them from the dangers of the world around them.

This seems really neat. And honestly, it is a really cool idea, and it is fun for a while. But eventually you realize that the game is an enormous addiction engine, and underneath that addiction, there‚Äôs actually not all that much game.

The game seemingly centers itself around your vault ‚Äì you can build various rooms for various purposes, but the big three are power stations (which provide your rooms with power), water stations (which provide water for everyone), and food stations (which provide food for everyone). You assign vault residents to these rooms in order to produce resources, which are consumed over time. When you log out of the game, these continue to accrue somewhat, though there‚Äôs a limit on how much you can accure. You can also rush production in these rooms to gain the benefit immediately, but at the risk of an ‚Äúincident‚Äù occurring.

You start out the game with 8-12 people who wander up to your vault,  and you can produce more people via three main methods ‚Äì sending people out to wander the wasteland looking for survivors, building radio stations in your vault to call out to people outside‚Ä¶ or, your residents can make babies with each other. If you send a man and a woman to quarters, after a while the woman will end up pregnant; four hours later, she pops out a baby, and four hours after that, the baby becomes an adult. The game doesn‚Äôt allow inbreeding, so you have to figure out how to manage your family lines a little, though honestly it wasn‚Äôt much of an issue.

Each vault dweller has a set of seven stats ‚Äì the same SPECIAL stats from Fallout ‚Äì Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. Sadly, the game doesn‚Äôt really explain what these stats do at all; while it is obvious that they are tied to the function of rooms (making them produce faster), beyond that it is pretty mysterious what they do, doubly so as most of your vault residents will have low stats. As it turns out, they do have some influence on combat and other things.

While I said that the game seemingly revolves around your vault, what it actually revolves around after a while is quests ‚Äì you can send someone out on a quest into the wasteland, and after waiting X amount of time, they‚Äôll go encounter some place. You move them from room to room, with them auto-attacking anything inside, and them auto-attacking back ‚Äì it isn‚Äôt very interactive, though you can use stim packs to boost your health (something you can produce in your vault, and which I quickly maxed out on ‚Äì turns out, they‚Äôre really useful to be able to spam endlessly). As you explore these places, you find stuff lying around you can bring back to your base.

You can also just send someone out to wander around the wasteland aimlessly, hoping to find stuff; this is kind of marginal, but it gradually does accumulate stuff (especially if you have high luck).

The problem, ultimately, is that the game‚Äôs interaction ends up almost entirely becoming busywork. While building up your vault is sort of interesting, after a while it becomes obvious that there‚Äôs a fairly simple optimal strategy to it, and after that point, it sort of becomes rote. While rushing stuff in the early game is an easy way to quickly build up xp, later on you start encountering worse disasters from it which discourages it a bit ‚Äì which is probably a good thing, because it ultimately becomes a lot of busywork. But the problem is that most of the game consists on clicking on rooms to gather resources from them and otherwise engaging in a lot of micromanagement as you move around people to make babies or set up equipment on them or whatever else.

Once you realize that the cute veneer is just a layer over a pretty Pavlovian addiction engine, it frankly loses its charm. I really liked the idea of this game, but ultimately it is the mechanics of it which killed it for me.

Which is interesting, because a lot of people complained about microtransactions, but I never saw much value in them. Seems like it would sort of defeat the point of the game.

All in all, this is pretty, but ephemeral; you might enjoy messing around with it for a bit, but after you‚Äôve done a few quests, there‚Äôs really nothing more to see here.
"
19272,"Not bad for free, but I would expect more from Bethesda.
This game has been on smart phones for some time, however the full version is full of little bugs
https://gyazo.com/a95141c7448c4fe80521efe174f8f65c
Whether playing windowed or full screen, the buttons often disappear.  My zoom is also currently stuck, and there is a mission/quest objective taking up a good part of my screen that I can't clear; mostly because the button is gone.

Game is a good waste of time.  Game itself is rather slow paced and easy, if the operating issues aren't frustrating you."
19273,"Ridiculous. 10-15 mins into the game, after the tutorial is completed, you basically can do nothing. To build any new building you need bottle caps which are produced at a crawl speed. New dwellers arrive rarely. Should one just sit and watch, clicking to collect a produced resource once in a few minutes? Where is the game here? I guess they want me to quit the game and come back to it later? No, I don't want to play like this. I have 2-3 hours this evening, I want to enjoy them, and I don't know when I will have a similar evening for gaming again. So, whatever they want me to do with this game, I can't.
Don't bother. It's a port from mobile. There is nothing more to say."
19274,"The game is Good, But please for the love of God, fix this bug where the game just crashes on start up until i exit steam and go on it again"
19275,"spend 10 hours playing. Spent $5. Got a random BSOD which deleted my save file and in turn, the entire vault and all my time and effort. Don't bother wasting time on this game when it will do something so stupid."
19276,"This game is addictive as hell and it can be frustrating, in game purchases but not needed, and regular content updates, not to mention its fallout - Two Thumbs Up!!!"
19277,This game is simply awesome. Not really into these micro managing games and even i'm hooked.
19278,it doesnt like to load up very well it crashes alot
19279,"It's... not the best of games.

It is literally EXACTLY the same game as the mobile version, except it has savegames, and mouse controls. I mean, It's not what I expected it to be. I expected Fallout Shelter to be way more indepth, and without any of that pay2win bullshit. I mean c'mon Bethesda, you guys are an established games studio. You should be better than those low-level pay2win companies shitting out generic mobile crap."
19280,So much fun!!
19281,"Very poorly executed. The major draws of the Fallout universe (humor and attention to detail) are utterly lacking here, and there's very little verisimimlitude."
19282,"gets raided every 5 minutes, rad roaches are way to strong, took out 5 dwellers with wepons ranging from 3 damage to 7. other then that, game is great"
19283,"More Fallout Shelter, now i can have battery on my phone!"
19284,"Some other people said it and they were so right.  If this game had simply cost $10-15 one time, cut down the wait times to a tenth and fleshed out the exploring scavaging system then it could have been an entertaining game with the Fallout franchise to carry it.  Instead it gets bogged down in microtransactions ($6.99CAN to buy a lunchbox with helpful items!?!).  I'm always suspicious of games that are free and I'm proven once again that my skepticism hit the bullseye.  Avoid this one, this is a money grab."
19285,Top meme. Only love.
19286,this game is so fun tell a friend about this game
19287,Just a smartphone's port to PC. Better to play it on phone at any place not at  your home's PC.
19288,Welcome to the Ant Farm of the Wasteland!
19289,"I played this game first on my mobile phone. Eventually I needed space and it got removed. When it first came to PC, I played it on their official PC thing for a bit, but I am a die hard steam fan and if its not on Steam, I don't tend to play it. It just gets forgotten. When I found out it was on here, I quickly downloaded it. People say that it sucks for PC, its best for phone, I disagree. I have a small phone, so clicking on stuff, dragging people around is really hard to do. On PC I can see everything much more clearly and it is easier to control. I like to run the game in the background while designing in blender, painting minatures or running around doing house work. I can click what I need to click and continue on my way. Other times I sit and pay attention and play it for a bit. It isn't a full idle game because it does need your attention, but I still love it and enjoy it :)"
19290," Seeing this game on Steam is the best day of my life. A mobile game I play when waiting in the doctor lobby, at the bank, or at a restraunt, can now be played in my main time, my game time, and my FALLOUT time."
19291,"Waste of a download. Other than the cutesy Fallout characters, this is an affront to the franchise. 
It's a tedious, choice limiting, extremely simple and grindy tablet-flavoured time sinkhole. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in micro transactions."
19292,If you liking taking charge of peoples lives and giving them odd jobs to do then this is the game for you.
19293,"Nice game. I like so much this serial. It's an enjoyment to play it!
& it also runns great on X3230, which a generation slower than X3360 / Q9550 proc. ;)"
19294,"Its really good!

Even though i have the first 3 fallout games i really enjoy it"
19295,"When it was First Released:

This game is shit. Sure its fun at first but then you realize something, all the people you have are idiots. give them a gun and they run away from raiders with swords. Combine that with making it so most of the time 99% that is when you unequip something you cant re equip it or put it on anyone else for a VERY long ass time, if that is you can do it all. This game is nothing more than a golden turd. It looks very fancy cause of the gold, but once you poke into it its nothing but crap.

Now:

It appears that they took a look into it and fixed some of the issues, at least from what I can see, your vault dwellers No long flee from Raiders, and if you unequip a weapon / clothing, you can put it on someone else straight away, as long as it matches (weapons are universal along with some clothing, but some clothing is gender specific).
  When it first launched I would NOT have reccomended this game... but now, sure why not?"
19296,Great game plus its freee!!
19297,"Yea a red sheep in a blue sea. Problems starts in the same order as when you catch a cold in the middle of summer and the first thing is the runny nose and watery eyes, when you know you'll be fine only in the penultimate day? 

- Got the game for free expecting microtransactions at some point in the middle. But a minute after naming my vault to number 10 (to keep with their hocus-pocus tradition) the game was minimized without my authorization and my browser went up straight to the store and to Fallout 4 web page. Couldn't you even wait greedy-boy?

- I was learning the basics, then this tutor-boy with a bipolar temperament that should be helping me eventually became very annoying. Even after turning him off he just couldn't cease to interrupt my game by blocking the screen to ask for paper. Curiously enough, ''B'' on Joystick is always meant for ''NO'', but there it was meant for ''YES''.

Don't click-bait my @ss so soon without seducing me first.

- At first, playing with a mouse was the proper way to go but after fighting with the screen edge I decided to use the joystick. But then after fighting with the dwellers selection I got confused. I saw myself in the embarrassing situation of playing with both controls at the same time. One couldn't fulfill the role of the other.

- Suddenly the zooming and the camera proved to be pretty clumsy, hud often disappears and you need that all the time. There is a command to show that but it just not practical without some sort of observation camera or neutral point. But as Kurt would say, whatever. Nevermind.

- The lack of comfort regarding general gameplay made me leave the game. I feel more content awaits, but not for me.

Maybe they didn't bothered in making this thing looking more like a PC game. Maybe I'm talking s#it, maybe this was probably meant to be more interesting with a g0ddamn cellphone to help selling Fallout 4 - Bethesda charges 229 bucks for it here when A¬≥ games are around 100 - maybe they think its that much worth. 

So no I can't see this as a PC game, I would rather PAY to have fun so microtransactions could be an option. Its just another money grab and another opportune advertising to push you into. I'll give them that."
19298,"If you think you are wasting too much time in life, wait until you start playing this game."
19299,"Waste of money.
Bought IN-GAME purchase (Vault Tec Starter Pack) and didn't get it in game.
My refund request was denied because purchase was activated.
But I didn't activate it and didn't get anything.

Same issues are reported on Bethesda forums but support ignores it and doesn't answer support tickets.

Thanks Valve. Thanks Bethesda."
19300,"Where's Waldo - Fallout edition, except Waldo is now the mysterious stranger and you have 10 seconds to find him.

In general it's a typical mobile game ported to steam, perfect for afk pressing stuff when you're busy with something else. There's not a lot of content (or there is depending what kind of person you are), but it's free with optional microtransactions."

19311,"I have an Xbox controller conencted to my PC, but I'd like to play the game using mouse and keyboard. I also have a few sim-related peripherals (joystick/throttle/rudder-pedals) connected.

1: Moving the mouse around make a lot of in-game noise (as if spamming pressing some button).
2: The Xbox controller is vibrating constantly (and hard).
3: The view is constantly being pulled to the right, and I am barely able to counteract it with the Xbox controller (forget trying to do it with the mouse and keyboard).

This is the second attempt I make at playing this game, and I'm just disappointed... I tried playing it on the phone when it was released there, but there it was just massively draining on the battery and nagging me every two minutes even though I though I had exited the game. Now, on the PC, it just feels like the QA team took a vacation and said ""it's probably going to be just fine!"""

19319,"[i]Fallout Shelter[/i] is much more casual than anything else you will have experienced in the Fallout franchise. This is mostly due to its mobile origins but even as a PC version, with its added features such as quests and boss battles, is still remains a very relaxed experience for the most part. At its best it can be a wonderfully addictive game, especially for those who like management games, and at its worst it‚Äôs nothing more than something moderately interesting to stare at. As a game it firmly stands on its own two feet but a lot of its success has to do with the nostalgia and popularity it lends from the [i]Fallout[/i] franchise

19322,"I don't like the time you need to have, in order to play this game. Even though it's free, can be fun but at some point a pain in the a** in other reasons. I don't recommend this to anyone who doesn't have the time. Still not going to recommend it just because you constently have to stop playing a game just to see if you've been attacked, need more water or food supplies. I will keep playing this from time to time but I'll never understand how to play the game in a fun way because i don't think there is.


I don't recommend this."
19323,"like 2 years late but its a good game and very good at

19324,"It's a great game to waste time or just micromanage a shelter time to time.

19325,"Always wanted to play this game, but my cellphone is an old shoebox and I can't play pretty much anything on it. But that s–Ωi—Ç is still working, so, yeah... I keep using it. 

Anyway, I got carried away a bit. Thanks to modern times, the devs and steam... Now this game is on steam. The game itself, it's good. It's a managment sim of a sort. You make your own vault, you build rooms in it, take care of problems, make random people dance in living room and populate your shelter and stuff. Also, you can send your guys outside to collect stuff or do quests. That's pretty dope too. And s–Ωi—Ç is reaaally addictive and free. Just like candy the strangers used to give me when I was little. There is a donations sistem of course, as in most FTP games. But it does not feel that invasive as in most of the free to play games. You can play the game well enough without giving a cent to the devs. I encourage to do the oposite, though... They seems nice enough and they got this game on steam."
19326,"This is a fun little game, I am a big fan of Fallout and was quite gutted when my tablet/phone wasn't quite powerful enough to run this. So when steam announce that they had this as there new game and it was Free to Play, I was all over it.

Of course you can tell it was meant to be played on Phone/Tablets, with how long you have to wait for things/quests/etc to finish actually working. But for me personally that makes it good, it means I can drop in and out of the game in between doing other things on the computer, I'll set up someone to go on a quest and go do a load of laundry or play a different game. So it works in my favour. 

Obviously if you are looking for something that you want to stare the screen for however many hours a day this won't be a satisfying game and there are games out there that would do that for you. 

Am really glad that Steam have got it, I won't be spending money to buy anything, but I do enjoy coming back to this game every day. It breaks the day up a bit for me, when I know I should go back and see how my little Vault Dwellers are doing."
19327,"Fallout Shelter, the other Fallout game. 

Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play mobile platform game, released by Bethesda Softworks in 2015, just before the release of Fallout 4, as a sort of teaser for things to come. In 2017, the mobile game was released on Steam.

One of the fundamentals of a Fallout game, is the music; where would we be wandering without some classic tunes? In the menu, you can hear some jazzy music playing in the background. There is no music playing in the background while you actually play though; however, in any menu tab you open, you will be greeted with some jazzy music. Slightly disappointing, not being able to listen to the ingame music while you actually play.

There are no accusation to be made in the graphics department of the game. For a mobile game, the graphics are great, casual, pleasant to look at. Comparing the graphics to games on PC, well, there are certainly worse graphics than what Fallout Shelter offers. Even on the PC platform, the graphics still meet a satisfactory standard with no crime punishable.

Originally, being a mobile game, the game itself needs to be easy to enjoy. No confusions with controls or gameplay, no need to look up on the internet how to do this or that. Passing its mobile game criteria of being an easy, casual game is also eligible on the PC platform. No one likes a game with difficult controls. With Fallout Shelter, there is no controls, only your mouse which would‚Äôve exchanged your thumbs if you were to be playing this game on a mobile device. Fallout Shelter is now one of the many other ‚Äúclicker‚Äù games, needing only a mouse to do everything.

But can Fallout Shelter offer a persisting amount of entertainment on a PC?

As a mobile game, it has distinguished itself a worthwhile title. But moving a mobile game to a PC platform is moving an U/10 into an U/20‚Äôs match. It may have skills in its area, it may even be able to show them skills in the new field, but it just can‚Äôt compete compared to the games, specifically designed for the PC.

You turn your computer on, you get into the game, you click on your vault rooms to collect what resources and profit they have made to make your vault and the dwellers inside sustained, and then you're finished.

It‚Äôs fine on a mobile platform, where you only need to pull the device out of your pocket, but for the demands of the game, you need to turn your computer on. Wait for everything to load and startup. Enter the game. Click on everything that needs clicking. And then you‚Äôre done. That‚Äôs all you need to do.

All you do in it, is click on a few rooms to gather resources and supplies like power, water, medical supplies etc. Maybe send someone outside your safe haven to gather some pre war materials, clothing and defensive weaponry. That‚Äôs all you do. It‚Äôs a repeated cycle of doing those things. Every Time you get into the game, that‚Äôs all you can do. And on a PC, that gets quite boring after awhile.

It lacks a required depth, storyline, mission. It‚Äôs too small for the PC platform. You enter the game, and you‚Äôve already done everything that the game has to offer in a matter of no time at all. After you‚Äôve done everything, you‚Äôre simply just playing the game to meet your vaults mundane requirements, and all that is, is clicking on maybe five-six things. After that initial playthrough, the game loses its charm, its creativity; you‚Äôre not playing the game for any purpose, except to perform some mundane task to keep your vaults dwellers happy.

Concluding this review, the game is great on the mobile platform, for something casual to play while you're waiting or are bored somewhere. But on a PC platform, the game is too small, it lacks depth and a persisting entertainment. After five minutes of game time, you‚Äôve pretty much done everything, and everything after that is doing the same thing."
19328,"recommended because i like the rush sfx music
tretetetetet  tett teet teet"
19329,need to fix some issues
19330,"This one may be the best that mobile games have to offer, but ultimately, it is too shallow to stay entertaining and the frustration over all the little issues like mild lag on a powerful system and unprecise room borders while dragging and dropping gets annoyingly overwhelming.

Once you set up a health and rad-away production line, you are ultimately going to boot this up for like 5 to 10 minutes every other hour, but you will soon lose the reason to do even that.

In the end, this is a very elaborate PR gag that even stands on its own two legs, but you should only bother if you have a day to waste until the excitement wears down, or if you positively have nothing else to play.

I'd vote 'thumb sideways', if that would be an option."
19331,The game is fun at first then becomes frustrating.  It's a pay to win game.  It's very hard to get by without buying a pack of something.   Mr Handy is the laziest SOB ever. I have two roaming around and they never collect my stuff. So I turn the game on the next day and everyone is starving. (and he has collecting on). My vault dwellers level up but can be killed by one cockroach.  The success rate is just completely random.  I will have a 90% chance of success and it fails.  Every single time.  My vault dwellers are little piggies. I never have any food! They keep stuffing their gobs with it.  I dunno. I mean its a really good idea for the game.  But maybe instead of making it free with in purchases they should have just made it a regular game. I would have paid for a regular game and not have to wait to go on quests or crap like that. I wish there was an unsure button about recommending this game because I am on the fence. So I will say go for it because its free

19333,"DO U HAVE WOODEN PC BUT STILL WANNA PLAY 'NEW' FALLOUT GAMES?
DO U HAVE NOTHING TO DO??

PLAY THIS!

F R E E DUDE, BE PATIENT AND IGNORE THE MICROTRANSACTION, STILL FUN ENOUGH"
19334,"For a port, the most basic functionality seems lost.  Everything seems fine on load.  Check settings, all is normal. head to select vault.  This is where the problems start.

  Of the 3 digital vault number, the first one always snaps back to 0.  online people report selecting numbers like 369 and so forth.  My choices are limited to 000-099.  This may be tied to the next problem.

Upon actually trying to select a vault number, everytime I move my mouse, I get this incessant clicking sound.  I assume it is the 'mouse over' sound one gets.  Stop moving mouse, sound stops.  I pick a vault number just to see further into the tutorial.

Build a generator: tells me to press Y - does nothing.  try to check settings but I can't  as I'm locked into tutorial.
End Task - load, settings,  No key bind settings. must be my YYYYYYY key is broken only in this game.

create vault again under same conditions reach the build generator tutorial phase again.

Again moving mouse always leads to a click sound at the rate of about 1 every 10th of a second never stops unless I don't move the mouse.  Mouse must be broken in this game only.

I notice while moving the mouse, a little hammer appears by the press Y recomendation.  Move the mouse, the hammer flashes (and yes constant clicking sound). build the generator.

Phase 2 dwellers show up in tutorial.  view stats - no description what  S P E C I A L means.  My Guess: Such Peculiar Engineering Cheap Interface Always Loses

Tells me to assign first one to generator.  Oh boy another problem.  it's off screen  trying to use mouse  to pan is pointless, can only get it to pan as far as elevator.  You can sometimes succeed  if you click drag the dweller as far as he goes, and at the same time use the arrow keys to pan the map, and let go of the dweller.

Assign 2nd dweller to the generator: attempting the same work around as above led to the game locking up as soon as I let go.

If this  is how their games work I'm glad I stopped with fallout 2. and after this experience I won't be quick to waste time with their other titles.

Needless to say I've seen much smaller companies do better.  Heck even Hello Games with  NMS managed to get a working interface on both console and PC at the same time.

Bethesda:  If you can't even manage to port a simple onscreen cursor from Xbox to PC with out inscessant clicking sounds, failed functionality to the point of causing lockups, pick one or the other and leave the porting to the professionals."
19335,very fun and hard but it is a bit boring whan you like bulid more buildings the game gets hareder so it gets boreing but meh its fun and its fallout so its fun i'am not relly a fallout fan boy but i like this game and fallout 4 and vegas but shelter is not better but still fun.
19336,"Great free game, better than most pay to win games. I recommend for the fans of Fallout and for the ones that are not.... :)"
19337,Good mobile game. not bad PC game. simple! It is good to spend time. Good for fallout fan-boys and Those who like games like 'this war of mine' 8/10.
19338,If you operate outside of an xbox controller do not play.  ps4 controller can't even make it past the first entrants into the shelter...
19339,"You'd think porting it to Steam would mean they will improve the interface so it doesn't look like mobile crap but no, apparently not, the game is clearly designed for mobile and nothing was done to change the PC version, it's the same crappy interface. If something for instance catches fire the camera will zoom right in, why? This is a PC not a crappy mobile, you don't need to zoom in for me, I have a nice 24""inch monitor I can clearly see it, stop controlling the game for me, I'm the player not you, another example of poor interface is scrolling, why do I need to scroll? Listen developer, we have larger screens on PC, you can fit everything on the screen you don't need to make us scroll.

The interface is pretty much the only issue with the PC version, everything plays just like the mobile version so if you've played that then you know exactly what to expect here. My major gripe with the game besides the interface is that if you want to gather resources or level up a dweller you have to click them, you'd think they would just do it by themselves but apparently not, this is designed to keep you active but honestly it's just stupid, they should've designed it differently to avoid pointless micromanaging.


Pros:

- Good time killer
- Simple, also has a hard mode incase you want a challenge
- Looks and feels like a Fallout game

Cons:

- Bad interface
- Same stupid microtransactions that the mobile version has
- Because of the microtransactions expect slow progress unless you spend money (Don't give them a single cent)
- Leveling up a dweller or gathering resources requires you to click the dweller/room, pointless micromanaging 
- Some odd design choices here and there

I recommend modding the game to make the experience better, if you don't mod it well, it's still good, ill be using it as a time killer myself, also don't be fooled by my little game time, played several hours of the mobile version and have played the PC version without Steam, now I use Steam for it."
19340,"Despite all the complaints people have with this game, It's still fun. Just don't expect anything amazing."
19341,"Many people will complain that this game is pay to win. While expediting is something you can pay for via 5 dollar purchases of lunchboxes, the entire game as it is can be accessed with a sufficient time investment, and since it is not multiplayer, ""pay to win"" is a pointless complaint. At best you're paying for instant gratification, not the actual possibility of winning.

A better complaint would be a lack of options for improving graphics or for the core repetitiveness. Much of the value in the game is in pushing your base forward to become an engine for sending groups of followers out into the wasteland, where a lot of the true action and any storytelling the game does offer is placed."
19342,"This is not a PC game. It wasn't good on mobile, and it's even worse on PC. 

If this game was redesigned as a proper game (ie. without the waiting mechanics and IAPs), it might be worth to buy. But as it is, it's just a waste of time."
19343,Such an amazing game! Just like oxygen not included but a bit more simpler! I deffinately reconmmend this game to everyone!
19344,"Wew, boy. This game came out a loong time ago, it's been what, a year? Two? Anyways, a quick TL;DR is in order: a game I wouldn't call fun or interesting, or even good, but a good time-filler. Perhaps it would benefit from a few changes and improvements, but nothing is going to make this game interesting. 

Fallout shelter was probably the bane of my existence for the week or so I initially played it. Everytime I clicked that notification was immediately followed by the thought of ""why am I playing this again?"", before tapping here and there. I have several complaints and suggestions, all ranging from very minor to barely above mediocre. We'll start with complaints, finish with a load of suggestions, and a summary.

[h1]COMPLAINTS[/h1]:
I'm just going to let my inner grandpa out here, and complain about small issues for a paragraph.

For some reason, the game will auto collect certain rooms. This is one of those minor issues. For some reason, when I'm in the vault, I will randomly collect water from the purifiers. Can't really explain this one, but not even menus can stop these auto-harvests. It's odd to have multiple legendaries, say Preston Garvey, running around, managing the same power plant. Nothing game breaking, but certainly an odd thing to see happen. Perhaps a limitation on the amount of legendaries appearing is in order? Sometimes small dialogue errors sneak through the usually chuckle worthy dialouge. ""Just what I'm looking for""? Where's the period? Obviously this game isn't worth playing now. In that same vein of miscellaneous complaints, what is an NPC in the ""A little off the top"" achievement description? I know it means dwellers, because you can't customize anyone else, but this seems like a really weird mistake to make. Using WASD or the arrow keys while scrolling does this weird lock on thing that frustrates me, mostly because I can't stop doing it on accident.

Alright, onto more greivous concerns. First off, the calibration for picking up and dropping survivors(a system that obviously came from being a mobile port, and makes little sense to have in a PC management game) has a very odd displacement. Recalibration is in order. It's pretty annoying to drag someone in the middle of a raider attack to have to drag the same person to the same tile multiple times. Why not have a ""pursuers"" mechanic? At the least, have the 2 slots available at the vault door chase down invaders. I think that's what Mr. Handys are for, but I honestly can't think of any purpose for them: you have 3 choices: send them into the wasteland, only to have them come back a full day later with caps in the hundreds, which, for comparison, in the same time frame, a dweller with a ton of stimpaks and enough radaway will bring back thousands of caps. Or, you can have them take permanent damage when they fight invaders, to be revived for a cost in the thousands, apparently, since everytime there was a fight I just dragged them into the lowest floor in my vault. Or, last option, have them ""collect things""? I can't even remember what they're supposed to do while floating around on a floor, I've never actually seen them do anything besides float around and crack a joke once in a while. Seriously, what are these things even supposed to do? Can't send them to fight, too expensive. Can't let them collect things, because I've literally never seen them do one, and the other is just a waste of time.

I originally thought Endurance was the dump stat to end dump stats, but apparently it effects the HP gained upon level up, which I'll take at face value. But I don't think it does anything else, besides run the Nuka Cola bottler, the only room that does that, not like you'd know that until you had 80 (or 100, I forgot) dwellers, because the dumb game doesn't let you know. Seriously, what's the benefit in hiding this stuff? Let me know all the numbers. I'm just going to go on the wiki to look at the numbers myself if you don't let me peek behind the curtains.

Speaking of stats and applications, what do stats do in combat/quests? All from hearsay and wiki browsing, Strength increases melee damagae, Perception increases gun damage, Luck increases loot, I mean, christ man, some transparency would be nice. I'd like to know what the best person to send into the quest is, or if there even is a difference between them. Quests are SO boring. I don't think I've ever done anything but yawn on them, except for the first one, because ""hey, this is different than farmville"" was the quests' singular selling point, but then I went on the second one, and I realized they were all pretty much the same; Go into room. Kill baddies. Click shinies. Repeat until entire area cleared. Do again with slightly different layout. But, I found it hilarious when the first quest was cleared by a single dweller holding the worst gun in my inventory(2-4 damage). Other quests with similarly equipped dwellers resulted in death. Nothing of value was lost though, since my other dweller came back from his 2 day trek into the wasteland with enough caps to fill a room, probably. Last point about quests- when a party all have crits ready, it's hard to tell who's crit I'm clicking when there's one target. A face or some other indicator next to the marker would be nice here.

I might make it sound like this is an utterly broken game, but it's not. It's just really boring. Mostly because it was designed to be played on your phone for 5 minutes at a time, and I'd rather be doing pretty much anything else than waiting at the vault for my Preston clones to crank out more power for the Piper harem to cleanse more water.

[h1]SUGGESTIONS[/h1]:
Here's just a ton of things I think would make the game better, either because it's now on PC, or because it just would, in my eyes.

Can we get a dropdown tab? Like, please? I seriously loathe dressing my dwellers up in their suits, because each time I switch to a different room, I gotta cycle all the way from P to E to C to ... to L to ""abilities"" to S. A form of mobile and desktop sync would be nice, but it might be too hard to implement, I don't know. I'm not a game desginer. Please, for the love of all that is holy, make a mass unequip button. If I get another quest asking to kill 9 deathclaws with my bare hands, and I have to actually make sure no one uses their guns, I might just do something drastic, like not play this game I dislike. Something that would help since the game is now on PC, and presumably with a mouse with two buttons, can we use right click as a cancel? And while I'm at it, the inventory menu should have a 3rd option for equippables: equip, where you choose it on a weapon, then choose a dweller to assign the equippable to. I can't tell whose cat that is, I can't tell which dress the pregnant lady is wearing under her latex strech shirt (what the hell is that thing), and I definitely can't tell what gun anyone is using, because if they aren't shooting, they holster it into the black hole they carry around in their back pocket. A for gun safety guys, but that is a living hell for me to manage. Also: [b]WHY ARE PREGNANT LADIES ALLOWED TO BE GIVEN GUNS OH MY GOD[/b]. They can't use them, why even have the option?

It deletes your save then makes a new one, making it so that you can lose all your progress if you crash or have power interrupted  on a loading screen (my computer is unstable). It happened to me twice."
19355,"It's Positively Excellent! The way you build a vault, it's like every builder's dream"
19356,Games very fun you should try it!
19357,Addictive...
19358,"This game eats your time, Its really fun and does entertain those who like building. The idea is amazing. If you want to mess around on a level head to my youtube channel (Pafiro) and youll find a video on how to get 9999 free lunchboxes, I use it on my second level just for fun. Enjoy ;)"
19359,Very addicting and awesome!!!!
19360,"This game is BEGGING to be an idle game where you manage very little and things like the waterplant, powerplant, and foodplant (er, diner) just do there thing automatically with no need for you to tap on them every 3 minutes. Seriously, you're ""buffer zone"" between being capped out on 'resources' (food, water, power) and being in critical condition is ~8 minutes. That's right. If you're not on top of things all the time constantly you'll stop having enough power/food/water to keep things chugging along happily.  All because the dwellers can't move the produced 'resources' from the generator to storage on their own.

On top of that, those resources aren't meaningful. They really should be ""supply/demand"" ratios. You build more rooms, your total power usage goes up and your capacity stays the same. Build a powerplant, your capacity goes up. Done.  Your only REAL resource is bottlecaps, which you primarily get from....achievements and lunch boxes (which you ALSO get from achievements, I meant objectives).

And everything else you can do is basically devoid of entertainment value. Build rooms, upgrade rooms, give people pets. Woo."
19361,"Ok so i have played the mobile version, tried the PC version. 

1: Great graphics for what it is. And if your familier with fall out at all. it will bring some nostalgia.
2: Its a good simulator if somewhat hard.
3: Dont rush your buildings. 

ps: On the dont rush your buildings. I think im the only person in the world who can fail 23 rushes in a row even with 15%
chance to fail."
19362,"There is a huge problem with the saving system, everytime there is a power outage or a blue screen the save file and backup save file get completely ruined, worst thing is that it syncronices with the cloud and ruins that one too,  there are many complaints everywhere about this issue and it looks like they are not even trying to fix it, allmost every negative review I've read in steam is about this issue, otherwise the game is good, casual and fun but untill they fix this I won't be playing it again."
19363,I can't believe how addicting this game is. I find myself coming back to check the vault status all the time. A little boring until I got the overseers office. Then the real action started. Love the simple not overly complicated game play. Just enough story in the quests to keep me interested. Remember... Keep the vault dwellers happy.
19364,cant even use caps to buy a robot
19365,Great game. no pay to win fetures lots of loot to find. you could play for hours :)
19366,I've been playing for 4 hours straight I just love this game! It's so creative and I think you should get it!
19367,Cool. Great. IDEK.
19368,balls to the wall.
19369,Very fun time waster.
19370,"EDIT: 

I think the freezing is on my end.

Anyway I would recommend the game mostly because using a mouse is a bit easier than using a finger. Also, if you haven't played it on mobile, this game is the same as that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My entire PC freezes and makes a beeping sound after several minutes of playing this game.

I will change my review when they fix this problem."
19371,Fun game to play while you ain't got nothing else to do.
19372,ITS GOOD BUT ITS HARD WEN AVER YOU START TO GET YOU PLACE BIGGER IT BECOME HARDER AND HADER BUT ITS GOOD YEAH {GOOD} =D
19373,addictive
19374,"This game is ver enjoyable, it just requires stratergy, too many retards making review explaining how hard it is lmao. Very very enjoyable"
19375,"So I played this game on my iPhone and the PC version is just as fun. This game does start out slow in the beginning, but once you keep playing, more starts to happen and the game gets more fun. And the fact that this game is completely free is what makes this a game that you have to play because if you don't like it, you can uninstall and feel like you haven't wasted any of your money. Unless you buy the in-game products... oops. Just give it a shot because you may or may not like it."
19376,"I don't mind microtransactions but holy hell, this game requires you to pay money to expedite processes or otherwise you tend to be just sitting and waitnig for things to happen for long periods of time.

This game reminds me of the Clash of Clans pricing model which is just a terrible way to do business (in my opinion).  I found that this game rips off a lot of what the PC game ""Sheltered"" tried to do and whil it is more polished, the microtransactions really kills it for me.

I do not recommend this game."
19377,"Fun and addicting game to pass time by.

1 flaw though. You aren't able to link your Bethesda account to any of the mobile (Android/IOS), Bethesda's game client or Windows 10 game versions to have your vault on both mobile and PC. Bethesda living in the stone ages?

What does this mean? That means your save from the mobile app, etc can't be played on Steam. You can't transfer it or port it over.

Because of this reason, I will be sticking to the Windows 10 version since you can play it on both Windows 10 and Xbox One without having to worry about your save (oddly enough, Microsoft is smarter than Bethesda, who knew).

If I could, I would put my recommendation of the game ""neutral."" Only until they add this feature, which they probably won't since it's almost been a year since the release of this game (E3 2016)."
19378,Great game
19379,OMG this game is so so sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun omg i played it for a little while and its so fun this is one of the best free to play games i have played. U should play this game now its worth the download i can tell u that.
19380,todd howard
19381,Best free Game. I love my pip-boy.
19382,This is a mobile game. Don't waste your time. There is also no way to stop time when you leave or pause.
19383,"I generally recomend this game. For a free-to-play mobile port, it's of a pretty high quality. There are some frame rate issues, and it doesn't work as well as it would've on mobile, but I still had some fun with it, and I'd definetly recommend it, especially considering that it's free."
19384,This game is one of my favorites. Most of the reviews are people who don't understand how the game works. Mircotransaction is not what this game is about. There are quest you can do that happen quite often that give you the items you can buy with real money.
19385,"Piece of shit, despite it's price."
19386,"Actually Liking this game alot.  Playing on PC (Hate smart phone, refuse to create a 3rd bethesda account in 10 years) so glad it's on steam.  Trick is to play long enough to get your stuff done, then save and exit until you need to go back in (Hit your training rooms, Quest group arives at destination, crafting completed, etc.)  That way you are'nt watching the kettle boil.

I would actually like to see this gameplay in the Fallout 4 Engine and think it would have made a better game then Fallout 4's Main Story (But that is a whole nother discussion.  

It's probley not for everyone, but if you have time to kill there are worse ways to spend time.  Haven't spent any money (may in the future just to recomp the fun I had, then again I may take it in Liue of Fallout 4's lackluster story and stunted roleplay)."
19387,"It's an okay game, and it's free.  The free part is the most important part; it's worth a try because it is free.  You might like it.  However, give it a few hours and the limited scope, frequency of annoying emergencies, accidental reassignment of dwellers, lack of useful equipment, lack of useful dweller stats, and overall wonkiness will start to wear on you.  It is definitely a good mobile game, but it's a bit mundane for PC.  5/10"
19388,Need urgent help. How do I stop playing this game?
19389,gets stale fast
19390,"Its very much a mobile style game, and it has microtransactions, but you don't need to purchase anything to have fun. In fact the depth and options in this game put a lot of these self-described triple-A games to shame. 

It may not be right for you, but its free to try. Quick learning curve. If you like strategy, puzzles, RPG, sims, theme parks and 4X builders, you will find something in here to enjoy. I'm runnning win 10 with no issues on a top end rig. 

Pleasant surprise, five of five guys"
19391,GOOD GAME :)
19392,"Okay Fallout 4 was the best bethsda game at least in my eyes, well until this game came. Sure it is a microtransaction pay to win like thing thats also found for your cellphone. But in all fairness this game is actually very fun, if you like resource management and the Vault boy/girl character found on perks in the Fallout series. when it was first released it didnt have the quests and mini dungeons that it now has, and it has really improved.

Well worth playing."
19393,"It is a mobile game. So that means it is a ""game"" you ""play""

shitty controls.
no gameplay.
disrespects your time.
disrespects your wallet.
disrespects your brain."
19394,"
‚ÄúFallout Shelter is simple to play and addictive as hell‚ÄùBest Free Game Out There, Love :)"
19395,"Fuck the fallout series! Whoo!

May no one who is a fan survive to be apart of such a reality! Yeah!"
19396,"Very addictive gameplay that makes me come back several times a day, definitely would recommend this game to any fans of farming/ grinding games"
19397,"Played this on my phone for a long time, got it when it ported over.
It has it moments but anyone saying its Pay to win clearly can't figure out the rewards you get for free. I've never spent a dime on this game ( not even on my phone ) and I find it rather enjoyable and obtain quite a few lunchboxes, pets, mr handy's all along the way. It really is rather simple if you pay attention and try to complete things. 
Overall I would recommend this game to those who have patience, and to those who do other things, this is not a game you play for 6-8 hours straight at one time. Get on, get some stuff done, build up the shelter, and then take a break."
19398,"This game looks like it has a LOT of potential. I downloaded it two weeks ago and have suffered through 25 minutes of playing. It is designed for a game controller, which makes it a great choice for game consoles. I, however, have a PC. I eventually had to unplug the flight stick, pedals, and throttle quadrant to have any control over the game. No menu exists for choosing anything other than the default gamepad. Even with all those controls unplugged (from the back of my crowded PC) I still have trouble selecting and viewing characters. I can't drag them to the various rooms because the game drags them to the lower right corner of the screen. It also doesn't let me select different rooms to work with. Maybe there's a workaround or a wiki that addresses all of these issues but I have not seen it.  Other than not being playable without a controller, I think it's well worth the price. It is FREE after all. Once I see a few updates to make it at least a little more user friendly I'll play it again. Until the authors put some work into the interface though, I'm content to just look at the icon on my screen and say, ""Relax, Pip boy; your code monkeys will address this soon enough if they seriously want people to spend money in the game""."
19399,"Pros:

Fun game. Good sense of humor. Lovely design.

Cons:

The difficulty spike around mid game is too much. I felt like I was losing everything to simple enemies like roaches."
19400,Requires almost no thought process and almost none of the lategame stuff can be gotten withought paying or cheating. So for your own sanity I wouldn't advise starting in the first place.

19403,"Eh, I hoped for something better and overhauled from the iPhone / Android version but it's the same crap just on a PC.
If you're a fan of sitting around for an hour simply clicking on diners, water facilities and power plants this is for you I guess.
However, if you're looking for a game to enjoy on your computer find something else, this is just a useless port with absolutely no changes whatsoever."
19404,"This is a pretty decent port and i think it actually works better on the PC

Good Job Bethesda"
19405,"I had to write a review, but I refused to do so.
Good Game."
19406,This game is good because I got the best weapon for free. 10/10
19407,simple but gooooooooood
19408,"Had this game on my cellphone, had many hours of fun.

The pc edition is great, to me it is nice to have a better overview than on my phone."
19409,"It's hard game,Really challenging, there were some parts that I did not quite understand what to do, but once you understand more it's more fun and easier when you're more understand ... or you just buy a billion boxes and ... yeah"
19410,"when i realised this game was on steam i was quite surprised.
i heard a lot of good things about this game when it was on phone (althrough i never played the phone version before)
the problem with this game is that its not a game that is supposed to be played while sitting behind a computer.
unlike the mobile version which you can simply put your phone in your pocket or simply switch to another app while waiting for your resources (water,power,ect), you can't.
atleast for me, its not fun to look at a screen waiting for things to happen. i have nothing else to do in the game while waiting anyway.
in my opinion this is a way for bethesda to take money from its users through steam.
2 / 10 , quite dissapointing ( thats what she said... wait)"
19411,good
19412,"haven't played the game in a long time (used to play it on my mobile) and there is a lot of new content - im impressed.
good idlegame"
19413,"Fallout Shelter is meant to be a game you Play when you are on the bus,car etc. It is not meant to be played On a PC. You click a few things and build a few rooms but the thign is with this game you need to be off the game to progress. Log on level up your dwellers do a few other things and come back many hours later. 

Good Game but should not be on Steam"
19414,"The missions take too long to do.
The combat is *****.
The AI take too long to attack the enemy.
You have to wait for dwellers to level up to get caps.
In my view, this game need to be remade.
"
19415,It's good ... but it needs improvements ... a lot of them ...
19416,awwh yeahh
19417,"This game is great! But one thing could be added to pc version: Renaming your dwellers (all of them and not just newborns). This would allow for interesting/entertaining twitch streams. P.s i'm not a streamer, but this kind of idea for this game could do wonders to increas this game's popularity even more on steam at least (since on mobile this game is popular already). So yeah 8.5/10 from me aka a random person from the internet."
19418,"I really like this game but after having to reinstall the game AGAIN I woke up to find my 5 hr + save gone. simply gone. So pissed of, if this is a bug fix it. until then nobody play this."
19419,This game is very addictive. :-)
19420,"It was fun at first. Though, if the game doesn't survive it's for some obvious reasons, the in-game purchasing is very slow and never confirms whether it worked or not. You have to check if you have it yourself.

And two, given this is a strategy/management game, the instant you build an overseer's office it automatically(i hate this crap in games. stop coddling the idiots) put me into a quest without any way to outfit or whether I wanted to do the quest right then or there, it was simply automatic and forced me to use the quantum cola to stick ahead and back which I did not want to do.

Just about a deal breaker. It's a management game. Let the player manage. Automatic nonsense is very irritating and makes me not want to play if I can't outfit/manage(duh) the game the way I want."
19421,"An interesting spin-off for the Fallout franchise that puts you in control of your very own vault. It's your job to build it, grow it, and keep the inhabitants happy. Things like crafting, collecting supplies, and sending your vault dwellers out on quests really capture the feel of the Fallout universe.

The free-to-play nature of it is handled incredibly well. You really can do everything and not spend any money. The microtransactions are barely noticeable. You can still feel like you are making progress while waiting on the timers.

Various updates have removed the need for almost constant attention the game required before. Now you can take some time off and not have to worry about your vault being in horrible shape when you return. They finally fixed it where you can pick up play it whenever you feel like rather than having your time with it being dominated by the game's needy nature.

It's a completely free-to-play spin-off that feels completely part of the Fallout universe. Building and managing your very own vault can be a blast. The pick up and play at your own leisure nature of it makes it worth a look for any Fallout fan. It's also worth a look for those who enjoy these kinds of building sims and don't want to feel like it's constantly shaking you down for money."
19422,"Most fun I've had for free in a while.
Charming graphics, decent background music, fun resource management.
The difficulty steadily follows your progression and stays challenging, though never becomes completely overwhelming (unless you've planned your vault defenses poorly).

A tip I would have liked to know when I started is to place your power rooms at the very top and outfit the dwellers with the best weapons, as this will ensure strong and well-levelled defenders when the deathclaws start rolling in.

Although it is very tempting to buy resources and goodies, the game is more than perfectly enjoyable without them and luch boxes are given out so seldomly that they really feel like you've earned them."
19423,Great little sim game but don't spend money on this game as if it crashes you will lose your vault completely and everything you've spent on it.
19424,"I hate the Fallout series, and that's because of two reasons: It's too boring, and too grindheavy.
...but I still kinda like this game, mostly because I don't have to pay anything for it.

This game started out as a mobile game before being ported to PC, so the only controls are pointing and left-clicking, but they still managed to get a lot of gameplay out of that mechanic.
I hear that there's still plenty of bugs, though - even SAVE BREAKING bugs! ...but while I've noticed plenty of graphics not showing up, so far the game hasn't crashed on me personally.
Yes, you can buy equipment for real money if you want to, but from what I can see, you can get that equipment anyway with a bit of patience, so this is NOT a Pay-to-Win game. I've never felt the need to spend money on this game.
However, like the rest of Fallout, this game is kind of repetitive and grindy too. However, this is a game that you play by checking in on every once in a while during the day, while it plays itself ""in the background"", so you won't motice it that much: If you send your guys out on a mission at 8 o clock IRL time, they will arrive at 8:00 + 14 hour travel = 22:00 when you go to bed.
...so if I need to fill your empty days with something, then this is a ""good"" time waster.

Update:
Warning: There is quite a notable difficulty spike when you get 50 dwellers, because that's when the radscorpions show up. They can show up as random encounters every five minutes, or if you fail a rush, and they will slaughter you. If you are fully stocked on stimpacks and radaways, you can withstand one or two attacks with some skill, but after that you will just die. Your base will just go bye-bye. You will be the overseer over a bunch of corpses, that you can revive until your money runs out.
...but the game was fun up until that point."
19425,I love this game!
19426,"+It's fun.
+It not very time consuming (unless you're rushing for resources).
-It's non canon. A player is appointed to be a VT Overseer? Long after bombs fell? And the vault is recruiting members from the Wasteland? And they're using caps 4 currency? It's just ridiculous.
-It's freemium. Go see some South Park show about this and some Canadian Devil. I don't remember what season and episode but if you dig you'll find.
-Vault Tech music starts to annoy after a time."
19427,Great game !
19428,"The game is the best in its genre. People need to understand the mentality of its gameplay, you are not suppose to open and play it for hours. Its a side game, a multi task game, a coffee game to spend that 10 minutes and look forward for the next day to send more dwellers into the wasteland, build more facilities, breed and expand. Its gonna be slow, its gonna take time but it is worth it, because this is YOUR Vault with YOUR people.

Some notes for new players. 

-The game is free but extremely fair. You can cheat some premium items without any repercussions. I would personally recommend it.

-This is a casual game as you don't need to worry too much if you make some mistakes. But it has great depth and interesting mechanics to research and improve your vault and make better decisions.

With that being said it not without its flaws. The managing of your dwellers can become  a huge chore later on. The UI doesn't help since it's build for mobiles. But that is my single complain. I wish they make some improvements there but I don't see that happens especially since its exactly the same game everywhere, iOS, Android, Bathesda PC client, Windows 10 and steam versions.

Unfortunately for those wondering, you can't auto sync your game with the mobile version, even though all the platforms share the same kind of save file. That means that the game doesn't support autosync but you can easily manually take your save files and use them in any other platform. 

**I played on different platform so I don't yet have a lot of time f to display here, but steam has achievements so yay!**

"
19429,Very interesting and addictive~
19430,"[u] Free and minimal requiremens	[/u]
Nice!"
19431,"I rather like how this game goes, people complaining about having to be glued to your screen. Not true! just simply save and exit your game and you can come back in 19 hours and it will only have depleted alittle and you can gather all your stuff! i really love this game!"
19432,Crashes....every time
19433,"It will be very hard to review this while being polite. I only downloaded and played this to post a coment, but I played it a while on mobile. I could immediately tell that the rewards come faster than on mobile, but playing this on windows is a whole other thing then on a smartphone, so they had to increase rewards...slightly

Pro:
The graphics are nice...and the sounds are kind of nice but repetitive. 
It has Fallout written on it

Con:
This ""game"" is a real shame!
If it was a straigt up 5-10‚Ç¨ game it might be OK.Even if you claim you can achieve everything without microtransaction, you still need hundreds of hours to get that. Do the same in any moba or E-sport title and you might end up a pro gamer.

Remember, this is not some Indie title, but a revenue generator for a major Corporation that owns ""game-historical"" brands like ID and Interplay(who made some little known game called ""fallout"").

If you liked X-com for the base-building and hated doing tactical battles for rewards, and rather have your ressources generated by waiting idly and/or roll on it, than this game might be yours. But then you might consider any pen&paper RPG, those guys really need some revenue(maybe D&D doesn't I don't honestly know). And sorry for talking smack about P&Ps they don't deserve this.

If you want some kind of mindless clicker, just buy any of the Idle/Clicker newgrounds ""ports"" like ""Time Clickers"" or whatever it's called. 

if you want a mobile port buy Hitman GO, it is a really nice game in my opinion.

Packages reach from a rounded 4‚Ç¨ to a rounded up 20‚Ç¨ 

With 4‚Ç¨ you can get up to 10 low budget Indie titles at least in a sale. I once bought Bully:SE(not an Indie title of course) here for 2 ‚Ç¨. Even in 20 years Bully will be a better game.

with 20 ‚Ç¨ you can get almost any pre Fallout 4 Fallout title, some even as ""complete editions"" I think in a major sale you could get ALL pre Fallout 4 titles at once for 20 ‚Ç¨

for 30 ‚Ç¨ you can get GTA5(while on sale), wich in my opinion is the best open world title right now, and probably will be, until Rockstar brings out Red dead redemption 2 or GTA 6.
I am also not an afiliate of Rockstar! It is not my fault that they do so many things well. if fallout now was more like Fallout 1&2 I couldn't even compare Fallout titles to rockstar titles!

I think for customer fairness, free to plays should always be required to post how much they will cost on average, and how much more time/work it takes to compensate an average spenders advantage. If you counter with""but then they would go bankrupt because everybody would immediatly see the futility"" then you enforced my point about this. 

And without having read a study, but simply by seeing how other people play, I can tell that those games have an addictive quality to them. Paired with the f2p moniker it is just like the stereotypical drug dealer giving out ""the first taste for free"". Or it is at lesat like a casino giving out ""free starter chips"" with you admission.

I really dislike having this on steam.  And I hate the existence of this game as a fallout fan."
19434,"bugs ,bugs bugs"
19435,"It's very cool to play.
The game have a fun gameplay.
Sometimes it is frustrating with the attacks and problems in the Vault, but nothing like a good new game to try to play better.
I loved it :D"
19436,"it's good for a indie game
"
19437,"the game deleted itself and deleted my world
"
19438,"fun phone game ported to windows, but... why just windows since it was originally android?"
19439,Fallout is love Vault-Tec is life
19440,Only playable if you want your life and even your sleep to revolve around it.
19441,"It is a good game, but if it can be ported to macOS and SteamOS/Linux, it will be better."
19442,"I'd like to give this a neutral review but since that's not an option, i'll give a slight recommendation.

first, i'd like to address the elephant in the room. this game was originally developed for tablet, which, as you should know, means that if you expect a real game, you're gonna be disappointed. if you want a real game that you can play for at least two to five hours without taking a break or getting bored, you may wanna take a look at Sheltered or something similar. generally, it's a good idea to stay away from f2p or tablet games if you want a real game. also, obviously, the controls are mediocre at best and annoying at worst, it really shows that it wasn't originally designed for pc.

ok, now that that's out of the way, let's get to the actual review part. the core gameplay mechanics seem pretty generic, as it can be expected from a f2p game. that's not really a bad thing though since it's basically a waiting game which means it is expected to deal with pretty basic mechanics. click on things to collect resources and items, click on people to let them level up, and so on. if you want to loose, you have to try very hard (if it's even possible to let everyone in your vault die, unless you play on survival), if you want to ""win"" you have to spend money or play for a very long time (what i mean by ""winning"" is having built everything that you want to build). nothing new.

the game will continue to run if you are logged out, and obviously while you're not online, you won't be able to collect anything. that is also not really bad though because after a short while, the resource consumption will be halted. so you will have a little less resources when you log back in but they won't be completely depleted.

generally, if you don't want to spend money on it, it seems to be a good idea to just log in every couple of hours, collect everything, send some people on quests, start a new weapon/armor production, maybe use speed-mode a couple of times to get a few caps and fill your resource-storage faster and once everything seems good, you can log out again. just don't forget to check your statistics-screen every once in a while, to make sure that your production per minute is still higher than your consumption per minute.

also, there are a couple bugs, crashes and other issues. if you decide to play this game, maybe you have already played some early access titles where the developers simply stopped to care and never fixed any bugs or anything? this game will remind you of that. there is absolutely no communication from the developer, certain bugs have been known for years but no one cared enough to fix them. after a simple look at the discussions you will also probably find that you shouldn't get too attatched to your vault and definitely shouldn't spend any money on it. almost every day i looked, there has been at least one thread on front page complaining about the game being unplayable due to crashes/freezes/etc or the save file being corrupted/disappeared. so it definitely is a bit of a gamble.

if everything works and you are lucky enough to not run into any game breaking bugs it can be fun but that is definitely not guaranteed. so if you like waiting games you can definitely give it a try but i would strongly suggest to not support the developer by buying anything in this game until they start to care a little bit more and fix bugs and other problems."
19443,after playing the game on computer and on phone i think its not worth downloading it on ur computer and its way enjoyable on ur phone but thats what i am suggesting.
19444,"Fun Addictive Game, better on phone for traveling.
"
19445,"I would give this a Thumbs Up if my game I played on my phone/tablet that is stored in the Cloud was able to be transferred to this platform as well.  It is really nice having a giant screen to play the game on, but it really isn't worth it to sit at my computer and occasionally click a mouse button when most of the time it is just sitting and watching, waiting for something to happen."
19446,"Great game with all the Fallout spirit within.
Fun Fun :)"
19447,Yeah it's pretty fun if you want to just chill at your computer and watch all your little dwellers run about in your vault and do stuff.
19448,Very good
19449,"i love this game have been following it from the begining all i hope they add is 3 things  

1 i wish for mods

2 i wish for character control i know we kinda have that but like wasd and spascebar and mouse to shoot

3 i wish for god menu/debug so you can give yourself money or spawn a raider attack
but anyway love this 9.2/10   
 10/10 if my requests are met"
19450,Now I can feel what it's like to milk money from obedient drones just like Bethesda does with the Fallout fanbase!
19451,"Probably one of the best free-to-play type 'mobile' games currently available. It isn't freemium by any stretch, you're not pressured to buy currency with real money around every corner. You can buy 'Nuka Cola Quantums' to speed up certain actions that would normally take a lot of time, but the nice thing is that these Nuka Cola Quantums can also be obtained by simply playing the game. And in decent numbers too (I currently have 27 of them without spending a dime). The waiting times aren't really all that bothersome anyway. Time keeps ticking when you're not playing so you can just come back later.

This game has come a long way since it was first introduced on iOS and Android. Bethesda keeps adding new content and mechanics. Going questing with your dwellers is a fun getaway from building and managing your vault.

Overall this is the type of game you check in on every few hours or so. It doesn't nag you for money (much) and is engaging and sometimes challenging to play."
19452,"Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play game ported from mobile to steam. Cause it is brand new to steam, there is the odd visual problem but that's it. I don't know why people are complainig about why it takes so long for a mission to finish, it's a mobile game. Your only supposed to play like 10 minutes, then go on with your life until 8 hours when the mission is done. Why change the one whole portion of the game just so you can finish the game without waiting for anything and taking the realism out of doing a quest. Even if people are bothered by these long waiting times, it's a free game, why even give a negative review for a free game. I would only do it if the game is genuinely bad. Fallout Shelter is fun and addictive and only has few problems that don't bother me."
19453,"GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
"
19454,"reading the reviews for this game and players are leaving neagitve reviews becuase they cant fend of a mole rat? honestly learn to play this game before leaving terrible comments. this game doesnt hold your hand like every other game does. 

i made 4 vaults before i finally got the just of how to do it. i now have 152 dwellers 45 rooms, 3 mr handy 2 pets and running 3 quests a day. this game is total addictive. give it time and dont thow a poor review after 5 minutes. granted i have been playing this on the windows 10 version not steam. only played to write this comment :D 

complaining about mole rats? wait till you get death claws :D"
19455,"Clicking and dragging without repeatedly zooming in and out gets incredibly frustrating, no option to tune down visual effects, and microtransactions to wait around less. =/"
19456,Fallout Shelter PC !
19457,"I am a HUGE fallout fan! I love Fallout 3, New Vegas, and Fallout 4. After playing these games and having them rank in the top favorite games of all time I had to try this. Now first off I did not know this was a phone based game to start with that was ported of to PC until after I started playing it for a bit.

The game is very addicting and fun however I do agree with many reviews that the time it takes to do things (without nuke bottles to speed you up) can take FOREVER to get anything done. I mean litterally it says it will take several hours to reach a quest and then several more to return to the vault unless you use nuke bottles to fast forward and get to your objectives instantly, That being said it can end up being a major cash grab if your one that can't wait.

Other than the obvious profit design of the game it can be quite fun to play and really helps pass the time when you got nothing else to do at the time!

MAKE SURE YOU USE CLOUD TO BACKUP YOUR VAULTS!! If you purchase items from the ingame store you can loose them if you loose your saves or your PC crashes!"
19458,Reallymadhobo is very gay
19459,Fun passive game.
19460,Good free game would bang no battery issues 10/10 fak todd
19461,SHIT
19462,"So, you know the good kind of free-to-play game, the kind that's basically just a normal game, except you don't have to pay money for it? Yeah, this isn't one of those games. This is the kind of free-to-play game that I like to call ""faux-to-play"" (I don't really. I don't know why I said that. Just go with it). That is, a game that lets you play for about 2 minutes, and then charges you (inordinately large amounts of) real money to keep playing.

Actually, that's not quite right. Let me take you through my gameplay experience so far with this game (bearing in mind that I've only played 20 minutes, and don't intend to play more).

1: Do the tutorial.

2: Sit and wait.

3: Get a tutorial message (it calls itself a tip, but from what I could see, the tips were just telling you basic things that should have been in the tutorial)

4: A new dweller arrives. Take a minute to put them to work.

5: Sit and wait.

6: Get another ""tip.""

7: Repeat steps 4-6 until you have 12 dwellers (this took me about 20 minutes, mostly of sitting and waiting, with the occasional ""tip"")

8: Get a new room, which allows you to store more weapons and armour for your dwellers (incidentally, weapons and armour won't actually be unlocked for at least another half hour of playing (correction: another half hour of ""playing"").

9: Sit and wait some more.

TL;DR: This ""game"" is a mobile port at it's very finest. The best this about it is the 2.5D graphics.

Incidentally, it's also a perfect example of something I've never understood; why do free-to-play mobile games always get such good reviews? The only thing I can think of is that the people ""playing"" them have nothing better to do."
19463,"[u]About the game:[/u]
Fallout Shelter is primarily about [b]creating, organizing, and developing a Vault.[/b]

[u]So:[/u][list]
[*]The graphic is nice to look at
[*]Gaming performance has no any serious errors
[*]In general a nice change[/list]
[u]What I find personally irritating:[/u][list]
[*]is the regular, non-optimal movement of residents from A to B
[*]People outside of the Vault are not the brightest - [spoiler]apparently, it is too difficult or demanding to use the meds you give them.[/spoiler]
[*]Even after carefully planning the breeding combination of females and males, I mostly had children with an increased charisma value - [i]maybe I'm too stupid.[/i][/list]
Some players mention that Bethesda is pushy (offers for cash and frequent ads), which I can't relate to; of course, you're not bombarded with items, but you can earn them without spending money - only slower, as in other games.

[u]Conclusion:[/u] For in between and on a long-term it definitely fulfils its purpose - and it's free for God's sake."
19464,good game)
19465,"So goood!!! same as ios. But good to have it on the PC. whatttt Freeeee? i would have paid a small amount for it. legends!!
awesome game recomend it!!!!!"
19466,if you dont like the game dont play it. EZ
19467,Simple and nice game
19468,It has a particular attraction if you're OCD. I like it. I don't spend money to play faster. I bide my time and multitask while waiting for quests to complete and babies to grow up...* <XD
19469,"Being a Fallout fan since the first game (which I still consider the best), I couldn't ignore Shelter for long. Ironically, in many ways it resembles World of Tanks (damn you, potato-heads in WG!). It's FtP, it's not donate-abusive, it follows the great ""easy to learn - hard to master"" rule... However, there is one huuuuge difference - in Fallout Shelter, you're do NOT have to deal with 14 imbeciles trying their best to ruin the match. ) And once you learn all the basic principles of vault building, loot finding, and baby making, the game becomes quite satisfying. Solid 10 out of 10, considering it's not a major AAA-title.

Oh, and it's very hardware-friendly, so you can even play at work! )"
19470,"So much better than the app for Android and IOS.
9/10 would play again IGN."
19471,I would rather pay a price up front to get a fair way to access all the best content rather than pay a lot of money for a chance to get some of the best content. I could see myself giving this game a thumbs up if it were played that way.
19472,"If your going to play this game and spend money in it, be sure to back up your files to cloud, 

My computer crashed yesterday after 11 hrs and $6.99 for the starter pack. Go to sign in today and my save is gone, try to report it to the tech support on the site and it wont accept my email.

0/10 of feeling robbed and is not happy. Too bad because i was enjoying it and was addicted.

What a shame"
19473,"I'm personally enjoying this game very much at the moment as it has certainly proven itself to be much more amusing than I had originally anticipated. I see the bulk of the negative responses to Fallout Shelter appear to be based upon people's dislike of microtransactions/DLC. I can fully understand this in regards to a game that a person has purchased. God knows Company of Heroes 2 infuriated me when I learned that Relic had basically decided to release only two-thirds of the game and then essentially just tacked price tags on the last third and called it ""DLC"", but Fallout Shelter is a FREE game. The only way they are going to turn a profit is through microtransactions. I've personally spent about $9.00 on it, and I have no problem doing that because I'm really enjoying it and I'm fine with paying for a game that I enjoy. If you don't enjoy it, or don't like the fact that you have to pay money for some of the better items in the game, just delete it and go about your business. It's a free game, you haven't really lost anything."
19474,"Love this game, Origonaly released on Android"
19475,"Fun and casual-like, no problems encountered only patience is needed, not pay to win so don't worry but if you want to speed things up might as well spend some cash I  just think you'll profit more in TF2 than this game or CSGO."
19476,"Six hours in....

It's a good thing this game is free, because Fallout Shelter is the very definition of a grind: inconsequential clicking and long waits with the sole purpose of making small numbers grow into bigger ones. 

There is actually very little to do. If it wasn't necessary to click on your vault dwellers when they level up or give birth, or click on rooms to collect resources, the game would probably play itself just fine. Raider attacks and radroach infestations are a joke, as your dwellers will easily overcome them without your input. You can equip them with weapons, outfits and pets to make them more effective, but they don't seem to matter much. Their attributes (the SPECIAL stats that Fallout fans will be very familiar with) seem to dictate how well they do certain jobs, and their level seems to have a major influence on survivability; however, despite the wealth of tips that pop up, it's unclear exactly why or in what way these things matter. Is a vault dweller with high Perception better with a pistol than a vault dweller with low Perception? Fallout lore would say yes, but in Fallout Shelter it doesn't seem to make much difference.

You can send your people into the Wasteland to explore, where they randomly gain XP, caps and items as well as slowly have their health whittled down by enemies. They can be recalled at any time; the longer they are out, however, the longer it takes for them to return, meaning even more waiting. Once you have the Overseer's Office room, you can also send groups on quests that consistently turn up much, much better loot but again have irritatingly long travel times to and from the destination. The gameplay when they get there is a huge disappointment; click on a room to explore, click on an object to loot it, wait as combat happens automatically, click on the End Quest button when it's all over. Again, with a little automation, this rather boring questing could take care of itself while the player concentrated on more interesting activities - of which, sadly, there are none to speak of.

It occured to me at about this point (right before I decided FS wasn't worth any more of my time) that Bethesda missed a golden opportunity with this game. The Vaults in Fallout were each the site of some kind of social experiment. Why on earth did this not carry over to Fallout Shelter? Couldn't we have built the Overseer's Office and then, having built the foundation of a stable Vault, been randomly assigned some crazy end goal to give the player a purpose?

Ultimately, though, that purpose is to send Bethesda a steady trickle of your hard-earned cash via microtransactions. The wait times can be skipped or shortened with Nuka-Cola, and random loot boxes - with caps, vault dwellers, pets, weapons, outfits and crafting materials inside - can help expand on your collection of practically useless equipment, and both can be bought from the store. However, it's just money tossed on the fire to push you more quickly to an endgame that may or may not exist. 

Then there are the little things that make the game....less like a game. For instance, your Vault Dwellers will level up over time, but they stop gaining XP until you click on them to acknowledge that fact. Unless you buy the feature from the store to get around that. Which, if I'm reading this right, means that you can pay Bethesda to remove activities from a game that's pretty anaemic when it comes to gameplay already. I mean, I can see the point (money), but I can't see why Bethesda don't even try to hide it.

I think we're hitting microtransaction critical mass these days, in which gamers are so accustomed to pointless cash purposes that devs don't care whether we notice them fleecing us or not. That probably describes Fallout Shelter in a nutshell, so let's get this review over with.

Summary: A freemium game with the life and soul of Fallout sucked out of it and a microtransaction system that will make you weep with it's pointlessness. There may be some goal worth working towards later in the game, but after six hours I've seen no evidence of it and have lost all motivation to keep looking. It gets a point for the Fallout aesthetic, but everything else falls flat. Watch paint dry instead - at least you won't be tempted to pay someone to accelerate the process.

1/10, a complete waste of time."
19477,TOTALLY WASTE MY TIME.DO NOT PLAY IT
19478,"it's a nice port..no bugs encountered and stable fps, etc...however, the game seems to be built on mobile gaming in mind, and quickly shows that..some elements kinda really depends on notifications and always on/the gadget always with you kind of stuff..when you do a quest or exploring for say 1-3 hours, with a phone or tablet, you can quickly check notifications if your guy have arrived or ready to do quest..with a pc, there's no notification if you close the game..so you need to sit down on your pc a lot and run the game while at it..

if you have a decent phone,then just play it on a phone instead..unless you have a chance to sit all day on your pc"
19479,"Fallout Shelter on Steam with achievements! :)
Too bad Bethesda doesn't know what Trading Cards are.

This is good little management game especially if you are a Fallout fan.
Mobile game ports don't get much better than this.

Important note: Microtransactions are not needed to progress in this game.
I'm sure they can make the game easier but you can enjoy it without them.
Thumbs up to Bethesda."
19480,"I cant put it down... I didnt want or need to put any money into the game, but I did... I played Fallout Shelter on ipad when it first launched, the game has come a long way since then.  I kinda like the handheld version more, gives me something to do when im away from my PC... now I sit at my desktop playing this, when I could be playing DS3 or X-plane 11...  honestly I look forward to seeing what they add in the future, reminds me of old school Fallout and makes me wanna go play some Fallout 4 again."
19481,hello
19482,Better than Fallout 4
19483,"Game is great but DONT BUY ANYTING IN THE GAME. They will take you money but will not send you any Pack.
If you will try to Refound - Steam will send you to Betesda and Betesda will send you to Steam.
Very disapointing...

till they fix the problem I DONT RECOMEND THE GAME"
19484,"all and all this is a pretty good game. its another mobil timer based game that you play for 15 min at a time every few hrs. its not p2w, theres nothing u cant earn in game that u can pay for. its more of an rpg then fallout 4. it is made by bugthesda so there are bugs here or there, u know how they never test there games and take a year to fix them if they choose to even do so, but nothing game breaking. its free, give it a try"
19485,"I love this, and don't even really know why...haha. It's kinda like when everybody had Firbie's, or when everybody had those digital pet things back in the 90s. I guess the combination of micromanaging resources, as well as inventory management, quests, and dweller training/management keeps it fun enough for me to want to check back in a few times a day for like 30-40 minutes to do random crap. I played this in Beta through Bethesda's launcher alot more than I have through Steam, but back then it was missing alot of the cooler features it has now, like the branching quests and stuff. I thought that was a great addition, and several of the dialogue options i had when stumbling accross a random quest in the wasteland were actually better than dialogue options in FO4. At least, that's what I thought, but hey, I'm just some random-ass dood who doesn't know crap about that kinda stuff.

This game is awesome up until your base gets rekt by Deathclaws, and all your dwellers are dead, and you dont have enough caps to revive them.  At that point, I think its pretty normal to ragequit, and promise yourself you'll never play this stupid-ass addictive game again as long as you still have breath, only to return the next day and do it all over again. 

Don't ever, ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever, pay for the lunchboxes. The wonders of PC gaming make it so lunch boxes are still accessible without paying a dime, IF that's how you want to play. Some people may find it more interesting to get everything the hard way, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Just have fun, and don't spend your hard earned cash on micro-transactions that are completely superfluous."
19486,"Its a game, Its free, And its good get it, like now."
19487,"Three times better, richer, determinant and meaningful conversations than Fallout 4's."
19488,My computer got turned off and I lost my vault.
19489,Always boost failed but nice game la
19490,"Not paid (nor will I) for any powerup - and haven't needed them. Basic fun little Fallout-themed management game. Quests are important - get those going ASAP and everything works out quite well. It plays best when you set up your quests, do your builds, assign some training and then save and quit. You're really not meant to stay staring at it."
19491,There are so many layers and a lot of depth to this game. So far I've only scratched the surface.

19497,PC blue screened. Vault is gone. Glad I didn't pay money to play this POS. I recommend to those that insist on playing to back up thier saves to protect themselves. It seems other players have had this issue with no clear solution in sight.
19498,Alot of fun.
19499,"I really wanted to like this game. Really. But it has too many bugs amd crashes too many times. Crashes on Steam and crashes on my Android phone. I've played for hours and lost everything to a stupid bug.  Fallout 4 is my favourite game but I'll never play Fallout Shelter again. It's just too disappointing. My saves have been inexplicably deleted, the game just hangs and crashes, and I keep losing too much progress. No more, sorry."
19500,"I got to play this game for a bit on a friend's ipad back when it was first released and i was pretty intrigued. I really liked the idea of running my own vault and I'm glad i finally get the chance to try it again. It's changed a fair amount since I first played and I like the pets, robots, and quests that you can use to help level up your dwellers and make more caps. It's a much more engaging game than it used to be. It's still a waiting game, for sure, but I find that there's a lot more to do than just collect resources and caps and wait-over and over. The quests and locations let you pretty directly control your dwellers while exploring locations. There are plenty of quests with a decent amount of story to them and I like that they give you dialogue options and bring the charm and fun of Fallout's world and lore to this style of game. I like that you can get robots now that will collect your resources while you're away. Being able to find, scrap, or use the junk and salvage from the wasteland to make outfits and weapons for your dwellers. I don't see any features for trading supplies with other vaults or friendly settlements, but I hope a feature like that gets added as it would give even more moneymaking options and give more uses for the junk, weapons, and outfits you find. Being able to buy weapons, outfits, pets, robots, and the like from other settlements would take this game over the top. And it's already such a good game already. I like that you can train all of your dwellers in all of their special stats to help them be more efficient at their various jobs. Plus pretty much every dweller can mate with any other dweller (so long as they're not related). It makes increasing your population fairly easy. You can just use a few males and get all the women pregnant and have new babies and adults every hour or so if you time it right and have enough resrouces stockpiled. Utilizing your dwellers' SPECIAL stats becomes more and more important as the vault expands, it seems. 
In all, I would recommend this if you are looking for a nice casual game to play. It's not the best if you're looking to be fully engaged for a whole day, but none of these kinds of game really are. It's why they're usually free to play like this one is. 
(Also, it gets annoying trying to control your dwellers manually with the mouse. It is very obviously designed for touch screen controls and it gets frustrating during infestions and raider attacks to control your tiny dwellers as they are frantically running all around getting killed. Pregnant women won't engage in combat either, so make sure you space them out in case of an animal or raider attack as they are useless in combat but sometimes seem to get stuck in a room during a crisis and take up a slot in the room that forces you to manually remove them so you can manually move someone else in there to help out with whatever the situation is.)


Edit: the deathclaw attacks and radscorpion attacks are getting more and more tediious the higher level my dwellers reach. each one nearly wipes out out my stockpile of resources and all my stimpaks and radaway. why are they so overpowered? this is insane. since i wrote my reeview i've noticed i'm spending all my time dreading the next deathclaw or radscorpion attack as i know they'll deplete everything i have. why is it setup this way? this is not fun.


Edit: changed my review to a negative one as i can no longer enjoy/really play the game. every time i come back, i have 10 seconds or so before i get stuck with yet another deathclaw attack. my resources are gone and my vault is in shambles because of these relentless attacks. i'm not even playing anymore-i'm just trying to survive deathclaw attacks. what did you do to this game, bethesda? is this intentional? because i have no idea how you rationalize deathclaws busting down a door designed to withstand a nuclear blast. not only can they not do that, but there's no reason for them to. i am fine with all the other aspects of this game-the raider attacks, the radscorpion, radroach, and mole rat outbreaks. but these deathclaws are too much-it's literally unplayable as you can't rush rooms, build rooms, breed dwellers, or do pretty much anything until the deathclaw attack is over. so glad i didn't waste money on this. please fix this so i can play the game-because it really was fun until that got out of hand."
19501,This game is awesome !
19502,"I have over a 100+ hours on this on my Ipad. Here's a full review, including the ""late game"" experience.

In short: Cute little game that has its flaws, but is fun if you are patient and can adapt to its special way of doing things. However it's a bit of an odd package, because it doesn't fit either the ""hands off, mining while I am away"" nor the ""active game, give me things to do and micromanage"" mold. It's somewhere in between and most problems come from that aspect.

PROS

- Fallout universe, experience what it can be like to be an overseer and managing your own vault
- Great design, simple yet efficient and fitting the universe and graphic design set by the other fallout games
- Relaxing! It's not about stress or micro management, it's about patience, resource accumulation, and seeing your vault grow.
- Once your vault grows a bit and you have around 80-100+ dweller, things are more fun. You will have a lot of explorers (max is 25 on ipad, not sure if there is a limit on PC) who will find stuff for you. You will have multiple crafting rooms to make weapons, outfits, themes, etc. You will train your dwellers and make them better. You will also be running up to 3 quests at the same time (sending dwellers out for specific tasks that have micro stories and better outcomes than exploration)
- A good way to start your day, check on your dwellers in bed while you are waking up a bit, and then check on them again in bed before sleep. Twice a way is enough to keep this game going.

CONS

- Resources don't accumulate while you are offline, except for your explorers finding stuff (which might be enough)
- Forces you to do some stuff you don't want to do, misplaced micromanagement. For instance, each time someone levels up, you have to click him to acknowledge it or else he will stop getting experience. 
- Same thing with training dwellers, if you put someone on strength training, you have to be there to approve each of his level up or else they will gain 1 stat then stop and wait for you... for this reason you can't just leave a dweller in a strength training room for a couple of weeks then come back and find him with maximum strength... you have to validate each level up. It's annoying but not game breaking, since this is the kind of game that requires you to check on it a couple of times per day at least, else don't bother playing.
- Very slow start. It pickups mid to late game and has more things for you to do when you get 100+ dwellers, but when you start it is very boring to watch resources accumulate. The early game needs more gameplay to make it more interesting. My advice is to NOT play this game actively at the start. Make babies, leave, check a few hours later to check on kids, then leave again and come back to see those new adults and put them to work. Don't play it too actively at the start because you will get bored. 

REVIEW

This game is about having a relaxing time building your vault and accumulating loot. It starts off slow with only half a dozen dwellers and everything yet to be built. You start producing food, water, and power, and focusing on growing the number of dwellers, either through attracting some from the wilds (building a radio station, which attracts dwellers but also attacks from raiders and other monsters), or through mating your dwellers and making babies. 

Midgame as the number of dwellers grow, you unlock more buildings and more possibilities for gameplay. This includes the ""overseer office"" that lets you start quests, which are like little adventures in the wild that you micromanage. Training rooms so you can enhance the SPECIAL attributes of all your dwellers and make them better at their jobs. Production rooms to make stimpacks (healing) and radaway, and also rooms that let you make weapons, outfits and armors, themes (different designs for your rooms inspired by the institute, rail road, minute men, etc.), and better production rooms such as more powerful power / water / food production facilities. There is also the barbershop that will let you customize the look of every dweller, chancing their hair, face features, and accessories.

You will surely also chase the steam achievements obviously, and it is fairly possible to get them all by late game.

The late game is mostly about getting your dwellers perfected with great stats, running 3 different teams on the quests to try to finish as many quest chains as possible for the rewards, perfecting your vault layout (at that point you will have used every available space and have to think more about what you want to keep and delete), and finally a bit of roleplay as you give your dwellers specific names and customized looks inspired by your favorite characters, and finally sending them very far into the wild to get better loot (the farther they go the better loot they find, every SPECIAL stat gives them an edge, also their weapons, outfits, and quantity of stimpacks and radaways). At this stage in the game, you are mostly a collector, trying to get every recipe and blueprint, making guns and outfits, and just enjoying having a great fully functional vault and pushing it to perfection.

MICRO TRANSACTION, PAY TO WIN OR NOT?

It is not. I played on my Ipad without spending anything, and i eventually gotten all the things that you can purchase with money. I got the legendary dwellers, i got the legendary weapons and outfits, i got all the caps i need and more, and my explorers regularly bring nuka cola (it lets you speed up things like travel time or train time) if i am actively playing to collect them, and i even got enough Mr Handy (they collect the resources from dwellers for you so you don't have to click them), and i even got a lot of pets from exploration. No need to spend anything! If you spend it will be because you want to advance faster or be more comfortable, which is your decision to make.

That being said, here's some advice if you want to spend your money and what is the best way to do so :
1. If you buy something, start with Mr Handy... it will reduce the micro management and let you focus on other things
2. The starter pack is nice ONLY because it gives you a pet that lets you return faster (4 times faster which is quite a lot, most pets you will find will give you 1.25x speed to 2x speed, a 4x times speed boost is very rare and valuable) from exploration and missions, the Mr Handy is also nice. 
3. Avoid the lunch boxes, they guarantee a rare but is often a rare salvage and rarely a weapon or outfit, meaning it is often a waste of money (crafting a legendary weapon takes about 9 legendary salvage, so even in the off chance you get one legendary salvage from a box it is quite insignificant). You will get lunch boxes from quests and active exploration, and it is too much hit and miss to be worth the money.
4. Pets are rare enough and powerful enough that they might be worth buying, but again not necessary. Some of the most valuable ones are travel time, damage resistance, added damage, and crafting time reduction.
5. Nuka cola speeds up things, especially travel times to quests. But the issue is, you'd need a lot of it and it can be very expensive (1 nuka cola saves you about 2 hours of wait time). I would not bother, just practice patience as you will be playing this game over weeks and months, and speeding a few hours or even days at a time is a very tiny advantage over the long run.
"
19503,Awkwardly addicting; also for mobile. But as quick as it pulls you in you become bored quickly. It's good to play in off time or in the background.  To much money grabbing/time investing. (You basically babysit the game)
19504,It Just Works
19505,"Tried it out on IOS when it came out and it wouldn't work after I had an ex number of dwellers. So when I saw this on the  steam store while it was advertising this, I downloaded it right away. So now I can finally play this game and i'm having a blast. A little slow with getting things and etc but then again it was or is a mobile game. I'd give it a  8.5/10"
19506,lmao
19507,Damn it!  Why is this game so addicting?  LOL  Awesome game tho!
19508,"Its as the kids say ""lit"""
19509,Good on PC and mobile devices!! +rep
19510,microtransactions
19511,"I like it. HOWEVER. I find it annoying that no matter how much you cheat on it, or how hard you work at it to keep your dwellers happy and healthy, the random ghoul/deathclaw/enemy attacks on your vault will drain your resources and the more you fight to stop them, the more time you waste. Speaking from experience, your dwellers may as well be dead before they even enter. 
yea that's some good stuff"
19512,"- didn't play any single of fallout series.
- FREE
- bla bla bla bla

as long as this game free then i always in interest."
19513,we need a creative MOD!
19514,"had this on my phone when i was waiting for FO4.. its simple fun and good time killer...
alot of new struff has been added.. such as quests etc etc.,.. feels odd playing on pc but it opens the game up to some things :D
its worth a try BUT if u have a habit of spending money on mobile games STAY AWAY... it makes this game sooo easy.and they made damn sure u will want to spend money.. Redonkuless amounts too. i am atm playing a money free run and its not a problem at all.. ((keep in mind)) if u spend loads of or some   money on your vault and start a new one its gon. all of it. u will not get what u spent money on over to a new vault."
19515,"Shit. IF you don't babysit it constantly ever 5 minutes you're going to have a really bad time. You don't need microtransactions like people say, but man is it hard without it - especially when you don't have an infinite anount of time to play."
19516,its a pretty good game though its like other realtime tycoons but it is free so ill give it that
19517,He is killing a radroach with a Fat-Man. Wow.
19518,"Need an option to kill children, otherwise the resource managment is a bit unpredictable"
19519,WoW..... I'm playing it on phone and can't bring my saved game from it to PC????? NO THANKS..............
19520,"really fun to all saying its trash get gud its a mobile game and its now on steam what do you expect only way ive seen people starv / die from any sorts of things while not playing  is not playing for more than lets say 5 days if you go on once a day your people will live perfectly 
things i love quest loot and other things
things people hate it takes alot of time to do things 
my answer its the same as any onther mobile game there is stop compaining what do you expect for a mobile fallout game

Over all 70/100"
19521,vey nise i lik
19522,freemium shit
19523,"[h1]What is it?[/h1]
Fallout Shelter is a simple game that takes simple exploration and RPG elements of Fallout (of course) and combines these with base-building from games such as Sim Tower or Project Highrise.  You don't need to have played any of the Fallout games to play.  Your task is a simple one: build a vault that will provide food, water and power for vault dwellers who have survived a nuclear attack, and assign them to the most suitable rooms in the vault, defend the vault against various forms of attack and send some intrepid explorers on adventures to loot buildings, help people and tackle typical Fallout enemies such as ghouls, raiders and deathclaws.

And to address the elephant in the room: it's a freemium game that does try to encourage you to part with your cash, BUT this is not intrusive and allows you to play and enjoy the game regardless (you don't have to spend ANY money to enjoy the game in full).  As is typical in mobile freemium games, this one allows you to play for a little bit, and then you need to wait in real time for a few hours before things happen at first.  This improves though as your vault begins to fill out, and you'll then be able to play pretty much constantly with up to three vaults simultaneously.



[h1]What's good about it?[/h1]
It's fun!  After the initial hours where you play a little then have to wait for a lot of time, there is plenty to do.  Additionally, Bethesda incorporated exploration and missions to the game that aim to emulate those in the proper Fallout game, and these have been done brilliantly.  Freemium mechanics weigh in by making you wait several real-time hours before your chosen explorers arrive at their mission (and will try to sell you upgrades to fast-forward this waiting-time) but you can just leave that vault and play another, or just let the game run its course overnight.  Once your vault has a good number of people in it, you'll find you're kept much more busy and waiting-time isn't so noticeable.  Every vault dweller has their S.P.E.C.I.A.L Fallout traits that can be improved with training (for people new to Fallout, these stats reflect strength, perception and such).  Combat is simple and based largely on whether your people or the enemy have more points of strength.  There is also a simple crafting system where you can weaponise and armour your vault dwellers.  Finally, the in-game introduction tutorial is superb, ensuring players unfamiliar with Fallout will be able to play too.


[h1]Anything not so good?[/h1]
The worst aspect of the game lies again in its freemium nature: any pack you purchase is only usable just once.  Should you start a new vault, the pack will NOT transfer.  Whether or not this will trouble you will depend on whether you intend to spend.  It IS tempting and the game will try to sell you one-time introductory packs periodically, but you CAN ignore them and play without spending anything whatsoever (you don't get less of a game - you just have to be more patient and wait for things to happen).  

And the waiting-time (in real hours) can be very frustrating at first - but as said already, this becomes less of a problem the bigger your vault becomes.


[h1]Recommended![/h1]
You can ignore the prompts to spend real money if you want without sacrificing any aspect of the game.  While at first you will be waiting around for things to happen, there will soon be plenty for you to do as your vault expands.  This is a worthy game to download and huge kudos to Bethesda for not limiting gameplay for people who don't want to spend their cash on upgrades."
19524,"This seems like a game suitable for mobile platform. However I found mobile version tedious. Tried PC version and got addicted for no reason. Graphics are so much better.
It would be great if mobile platform can share progress with PC version.
Worth arround 7~8 hours fun. Wear off after that."
19525,"To do it more easy send to explore characters with ""espcial"" LUCK. 

Try to buil in blocks of 3 and upgrade it will be better than 1 or 2.

When you go to sleep put characters at gym, school XD 

Interesting, with a lot of posibilities, lots of levels.

PS: If you buy the pack of pets and robots it will be more fun and easy and you only will log less time."
19526,Fun :)
19527,"I downloaded this game back when it first released on mobile‚Ä¶ then I uninstalled it after all my vault dwellers got stuck in the lift during my first raider attack. So, then I waited awhile and got it on steam instead, I really wanted to like this game‚Ä¶ I really did but the constant grind to do anything is so damn tedious, doing the simplest task takes like 4 hours unless you purchase the ‚ÄúObligatory Freemium Special Money‚Äù that make things go faster. They had to squeeze in a dirty microtransaction everywhere they could. However, I did enjoy equipping my dwellers with gear to go on quests when it wasn‚Äôt trying to force ¬£5 outta me. So, in conclusion its more freemium cancer and you‚Äôll probably enjoy it for 10 minutes before uninstalling it."
19528,"the top reviews are shit.
This is best game 2k17!
IT's a pretty damn fun base builder. 
Simple and addictive.
If you like base building elements like in Xcom or such you'll enjoy this. A great background game which you can just leave running while you're on a lecture or something. That's what I've been doing"
19529,Specacularly boring game.
19530,It's a free fallout game.. what else do i gotta say bro
19531,"What I can say,a great fallout simulator!"
19532,"I read a lot of complaints about this game, that make little to no sense if you ask me.
People complain about micro payments, you dont need to buy anything, the wasteland and quests provide for everything you want to find/own, so paying for things, is optional.
Others claim this game forces you to come back every 5 minutes because of the resource gather system, this too isnt correct thinking, when you are not in the game, the power/water/food supply, does not drop under the minimum required amount of said goods. So, your dwellers wont starve if you have not played for 2 days, it would not make sense if it was the case now, would it?
And yet others complain that their dwellers die of lack of water or food, and that too is ridiculous, just make sure you got enough dwellers working the cafeteria(s), water refineree(s) and most importantly, the generator rooms, without power, other important rooms may stop functioning, and you can run out of water/food that way. 
Also, make sure you add dwellers to jobs, that they are meant for, look at a dweller's stats before you assign him or her to a room, for example, if you have a dweller with 1 S(trenght) and 4 P(erception), you dont want that dweller to work in the generator rooms because those demand S(trenght) so instead, you send that dweller to the water refinery because that room demands P(erception), the higher the skill level of a dweller, the better he or she is suited for tasks that demand those skills, it speeds up the process of said rooms.

Ok review time, is this an amazing game? hmm, i guess that would be pushing it, but it sure is a fun game, looks good, has a million references to current and previous fallout games, with patience you can get all those items and dwellers from grinding the game itself, no cash needed.
Unlike what some people try to claim, this game is perfect for casual play, but also for constant play.
Questing is fun to do, exploring yields a lot of nice goodies as well, especially the longer you let a dweller explore the wastelands, the trick to do this succesfully is to make sure they go out there with a high damage weapon, and at least 25 stimpacks + say 10 or so, radaway, get them an outfit that gives them a bonus on strenght, perception, endurance and/or luck (there are a great variety of outfits, some with 1 added bonus, others with 2 or more) and also make sure the dweller you send, has decent levels of these skills, then you're set, and can send a dweller out for days at a time (actual days).
Do keep in mind, that whenever there is a fight (raiders invading, radroaches, molrats, gouls, deathclaws) that you dont need to do the fighting yourself, the dwellers will do this (if they have weapons) but you will have to apply stimpacks and radaway to keep the dwellers alive during a fight (same in quests), an icon will appear above the dweller when low on health, click it and he/she will use a stimpack or radaway, just make sure they have good weapons and gear.
But all in all, this game demands patience, and some people dont like to wait, thats 80% of the negative reactions on here i guess ;)

enjoy the game, its free you know hehehe  (and not made by amateurs)"
19533,This is just a mobile port so why waste you time just buy Fallout4....
19534,I like game on all platforms and really enjoy playing it.
19535,"This game is pretty fun. A lot of the reviews say you need to pay to do anything, but that's not the case. You can get the things you pay for through quests, wastleland quests (little quests found while exploring), and objectives. I get on the game usually once per day to collect resources, level people and skills up, send people on quests and into the wasteland, and collect supplies from people returning. I usually turn on this game and collect things while I read. There is a bit of waiting with training and people going to explore and get to quest objectives but it's a nice thing to keep up in the background while reading."
19536,fun game but my radiostation keeps resetting the timer so i dont get new peeps in my vault
19537,"Had a vault of 40 dwellers all around level 24 and 30, then a pack of mole rats just spawns in one room and kills everyone, just two fucking rats out of five wouldn't die whatsoever. 

Everyone in the vault has weapons dealing a max to 6 damage and yet two rats wouldn't die, I even had a level 48 with a laser that couldn't kill either of them, in the end the rats ate through all 30 of my stempaks and 10k of my money spent on reviving all 40 dwellers to just have them all die over again. 

 Edit2: Will test it out again to see if the same bug occurs and will record it taking place

Edit1: Exact same issue I had as this guy, the rats just wouldn't die https://community.bethesda.net/thread/53816?start=0&tstart=0"

way too much situations where you get tricked into spend money
this game is waiting and clicking there is no strategy just sit and click and you will succsess

repeat repeat repeat"
19543,"It is a nice Sims type game adapted to the Fallout series. It requires a different attention than normal pc games as this was designed for mobile. I will keep it windowed from time to time while Im watching other stuffs in my pc.
Even though it is free, it has their microtransactions to play it faster and easier. I spent the $5 starter pack and it was worth it get you faster to the optimal game but it cames less challenging sooner.

19544,great casual gaming experiance legit top kek #pray4kekistan
19545,"enjoyable, but buggy, cash grabber, when i finaly got to be able to build an overseer office, the game bugs out and wont let me access my menu items to play anymore or anything, kinda pissed about that. pretty much unplayable if you're not spending cash on the game."
19546,This is a great and a very time consuming game! Be carefull :)
19547,Thumbs up!
19548,"I am not sure I would bother. It's an ""okay"" game if you just have it running in the background while you are doing something else, but later on in the game the tables just turn to the absurd. I have failed like 7/8 rushes in a row when they had a 30% or lower failure rate. This happened because radroaches spawned inside and started siphoning off all my energy, and mole rats for some reason at higher levels siphon energy extremely fast also. Everything siphons energy when you get above 60 people in your vault. The game just spikes in difficulty when you get to 40 and to 60 people so I think the smart way to play the game would be to just sit on your hands and try and pump up all your characters below 39 people and then play the game afterwards. 

Even so, the mechanics are stupid. If someone breaks into your vault and nobody is in a room (which happens it seems 90% of the time they go for an empty room) you have to send people from another area, then they inevitably get there too late and the invader burrows to another room, so eventually all your people are running everywhere and you can't keep track of which character has a good gun to actually fight off this invasion. All the while everyones taking radiation damage and physical damage, and they're siphoning off your energy--which in turn shuts down the majority of your vault buildings. Its great. So then you have to temporarily pull people off of every other duty they were doing when your vault was humming like a swiss watch and put them onto energy production then you have to manage to remember to put everyone back where they were before hand--a near impossible task. Its just an annoyance. A huge annoyance.

Then if you're ""lucky"" you spend the rest of the time just clicking on status updates, like gathering energy, or gathering food, or the rare opportunity that you are able to to level someones stats up. I think this game would be a lot better if the endurance stat did not exist. Apparently the only way to really level up your heroes health a lot is to pump up their endurance. So you have to put all your low levels on endurance training for like 4 real time days to pump up their endurance. Only then can you really make use of them in other capacities if you really want to maximize their experience. 

It's pretty dumb. The whole game feels like a waste of time sadly. I just don't have much else to play so I am doing it. I swear though, the first time someone comes in and wipes my vault I am done with this game forever. 

Its really a micro transaction game about gambling with the lunchboxes they give you early on. Because lunchboxes (that you have to buy with real money to get in any regularity) contain cards which can help you when you are struggling. But they can also just give you useless legendary materials that 99% of people will never be able to use because they'll quit the game before they can make the stuff. Its stupid. Even then manufacturing a rare weapon took ~16 real hours. I can only imagine a legendary one would take 5 days or something,

So in short. Stay away. It just is not fun enough over the long term...the only real fun I have is going out on quests and even those require you to wait hours and hours unless you buy some nuka cola (yes, real money again) to speed things up. It's just a way to siphon money and its too nakedly obvious to want to even do it. Generally games like this have you provide you with a fun experience along the way, but this one just feels 100% designed to siphon money."
19549,"Another boring waiting game, expecting you to sit and watch and wait and wait and sometimes click on something. Another spit on Fallout franchise from Bethesda."
19550,"Got to population 50 and my game crashed, my vault was then wiped like it had never been there."
19551,Great Free Game. Fun yet challenging
19552,gets boring after the first 5 minutes.
19553,I understand this is a ported over phone game.. but needing to wait 8-9hours for certain missions is too much..
19554,Phone games on pc.How does that sound?
19555,Keeps crashing on loading my vault. At least it started doing that before it started to push microtransactions in my face.
19556,Best fookin game evah!! :D
19557,"It's a great game to play while you're doing other things, and the quest system adds much feeling of reward to the gameplay. I'm weirded out by the 'make women pregnant as much as possible' aspect to increasing vault dweller numbers, but it's a great game for what it is."
19558,"Its all right for a while, i had some fun playing it but the repetitiveness kinda kills it so... im 50/50"
19559,Still better than Fallout 4...
19560,Wait until you unlock quests
19561,i really like it
19562,Nice Game
19563,loved it on mobile amd ipad but on computer?. nah i still like it and will probably play a while but i like more on modile/ipad  6/10
19564,"The game is a very simple game, as it was made for Smart Phones originally but I can say it is a  bit of fun though I would recommend playing it on your Smart Phone for the best experience."
19565,A swarm of invincible Molerats killed half of my vault.
19566,i have beeen playing this game for some time now and i like it but the flipping deathclaw attack is to lethal man plz reduce the power i cannot play anymore like this. i have failed every deathclaw attack. and lost so many people. Plz fix it.
19567,"Survival mode is the only setting the game was ment to be played at, yet major flaws exsist that greatly hinder the player's progress, even if you bought in-game items to help.

The disasters spread too fast. I had a fire start in an empty room but with a dweller on the other side of the freakin bulkhead, say- five steps. Yet It took less then two seconds for the fire to cover three rooms! This is because they want you to pay for toons/items that specifically deal with the flaws they purposefully throw in the game.

Secnd problem is the horrific U.I. Where do I start? You can't tell if a female is preggo because the level up icon takes up all the room. Moving dwellers from one room to another is pain staking. The outlined box you hover the dweller over is way to small and out of place completely, when viewing from a slightly higher or lower perspective. This is also true for when you need to view a dwellers stats but don't want to level him or her up, even clicking below their torso still triggers a level up. The dwellers will stack on one another to fight making it impossible to check their condition.

Most the pets suck. Mr. Handy WILL MOVE IN FRONT OF YOUR TOONS! You can't be away from the game if you send your dwellers out for more then 24hrs. Endurance is useless. The difficulty stops increasing around population of 45. (Deathclaws are not as bad as fires, believe it or not.)

Ive also played this on my phone. Samsung galaxy 7? 9? I forget, but it runs like molasse after 120 people. God help you if you spent cash on this trash. (me included, heh just the starter pack.) you've tricked me this time Bethesda! 5/10 stars.

I still haven't touched your shitty MMO though! Hah!"

19574,This game has taught me so much about dancing
19575,"msg bethesda's email to add multiplayer to raid other peoples vaults and send people supplies and items
cause i feel like its missing multiplayer
other than that itsa good game"
19576,"On mobile this game seems good, but on PC it doesn't fit; the game requires you to pick it up multiple times a day and only needs your attention for short periods of time, so I found myself easily bored.

One thing I give this game credit for is how much it made me laugh in the short time I played it.  To gain additional vault dwellers you either accept outsiders or mate your existing inhabitants.  There was 1 man, of whom become known as Stud McQueen, whos designated post was the living quarters (aka the insemination chamber).  This sexual beast of a man became the father of every child born in the vault.  Unfortunately, the children all came to term at the same time when I checked up on them last evening and panic ensued.  Six babies were delivered with no medical assistance onto the living room carpet, those stains will never come out.  The resulting population boom saw a period of shortages of food and water, the vault's inhabitants began to suffer.... everyone except Stud McQueen, who was perpetually at 100% happiness... the cvnt..........   One mother even came to term in the chaos, however there were no more beds to house her baby as the overseer didn't pick up enough bottle caps from his mate's stag do last week to construct a new birthing pit and hovel combo for said mother;  she just had to hold it in...  the baby is now a grown man and has even landed a job, he works from home, of course, concidering the mother needs to be wheeled to the power plant everyday and her umbillical cord doesn't streatch that far.

In short, the game is designed to be used on mobile devices, maybe you can play it on PC while on facebook or doing some typing, that way you can check up on the game every now and then as you need to wait real time untill you can interact with it again."
19577,Cool Game.
19578,gud
19579,"first on mobile

19580,its ok
19581,"Its good, admit it"
19582,"This game comes 1:1 from the mobile version and there are no desktop improvements.

- Only 1-Button actions from your mouse is supported
- No better overview in the menues, no adjusted icons
- very slow zoom acceleration, unnecessary auto focus when zoomed out
- Mobile game mechanics like waiting over hours or days for resources or pay for microtransactions
- You have to gather manually, because the game focus to stay online all the time. The problem: After 5-10 minutes, there is nothing to do anymore except to gather with a mouse click all 3 minutes.
- Controller is goinging mad InGame, you have to disconnect him every time.

The game has potential, but that was obviously given away."
19583,"Bethesda, you should really add a multiplayer option to this game because it can get rough sometimes, I don't mean you should make it easier but there has to be a multiplayer option, but both players still have their own vault but just across each other because if it goes rough on the one side than the other side can help. So please do add a multiplayer option, or if you don't want to add a multiplayer option just have a 'extra' on Steam that players can download to play multiplayer."

19586,"[h1] I see a lot of misunderstanding and misinterpretations when it comes to Fallout Shelter. Please let me help you out![/h1] 

[b] THE GAME IS BETTER ON PC THAN PHONE: [/b] 
You can open this game on PC and let it run for hours. No phone can do that. Mainly due to battery life and pause-screens. This game is easily manageable from PC while you watch television, browse Imgur or watch some chick series on Netflix.
Besides, controlling the game on PC is a joy compared to navigating fat fingers on a 5"" phone screen. There's just so much more room on a PC screen. 

[b] YOUR SAVE GAMES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER DEVICES - BACKWARD AND FORWARD COMPABILITY! [/b] 
I used to move save games between my phone to a PC running BlueStacks. 
Now I'm moving those same old save games between phone and PC. And you know what? It works!
It's so easy a 5 year old child could do it. Just copy the vaultx file between the devices you want. 
I even expect the cloud sync function might actually work betwen phone and PC. (unconfirmed - haven't tested).

[b] SPEND MONEY ON INGAME PURCHASE? [/b] 
Well, just copy and paste that save game to a save location. Or copy the vault where you've spend your real-life-cash and paste it in twice more, to have a total of THREE vaults with ALL the benefits of a paid vault. You've already paid, so why not harvest those benefits thrice over?

[h1]Thumbs up![/h1] 
100+ hours on a free game?! Yessir!"
19587,"Game without end. For fans it's few hours of fun and playing on cell add some time but on PC it's repetitive and boring after a while. Good for killing some time. 
[spoiler] Using trainer from megagames will cut nearly all microtransactions ;)[/spoiler]"
19588,Why is this game on steam? You can't really lose and there are wait timers and no real money to manage. Its fallout themed but that is it. It has microtransactions as well that makes it shit. Mobile games have to stay off steam
19589,"I love that game (played on smartphone about 300h and finally its on pc <3 ), but there should be a mode between normal and survival mode, because the normal mode is to easy and the survival mode is too frustrating if u can`t revive people ( and everyone know HOW hard it is to get a legendary and if u lose him thats just frustrating.

U guys should make it harder to get caps on normal mode because its too ez if u have the money to upgrade rooms to max before u have unlocked them.

Have one problem my game file got deleted  and i dont know why.... the same happend about 3 times on smartphone, hope the problem dont is still on the game.

(edit:)  I think the game have the same problem like on mobile version,  again my safe file got deleted -.-  had again 30k+ caps and many rare iteam... all lost"
19590,"My new favorite time waster game. I actually bought the starter package since the game is free and it was worth it. I don't see me needing to spend any more as it gave me some nice cards. I love games like this, level my dwellers, give them new babies names of the people i know IRL and send them out on missions that gives me phat lewt !

People say you have to micro manage by logging in every 5 minutes. That's bull... My bunker runs just fine while i'm away. I'll surely be entertained by this game for quite a while still :)"
19591,Brilliant to play in the background while watching ww2 in colour.
19592,This game is a great time waster and would recommend to anyone who likes fallout
19593,"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
[b]Fallout Shelter[/b] is a great Vault management sim! for the first hour.  Then pacing falls off a cliff, and it becomes a generically non-interactive mobile game, that you can poke for about 5 seconds once per day.  Still, its free, and has decent features, and arts, and Fallout flavor.

+ Fallout Theme
+ Lite management sim
+ Story text for dwellers sent to the wasteland

- Very limited playtime per session
- Can't freely move rooms once built
- The map is stupidly setup so you can only build 3x3x2 rooms, instead of 3x3x3.  
- Having a controller plugged in, breaks the game, and doesn't seem to be a viable input method to begin with.
- The quest system is... a thing.  Its combat system is horrible, it isn't entertaining to watch, and has literaly no gameplay/input involved.  The timer to begin and end a quest is pay-walled.  And basic inputs while on quests are combat locked and buggy."
19594,Really fun But! I wish you can bring this game from the cloud into your phone or I wish I knew how to
19595,very recommended for those fallout fans!
19596,"Probably one of the best ftp games on steam. Simple .Small . Addictive. Playable without paying.! Well i fuckin love this game and its the reason i am gonna start playin fallout series cause i have played none of them. The game is so intresting with so much stuff to do i am very suprised that its free actually....Btw its a bit buggy with clicks on pc , the flamethrower does not even work on incidents (the dwellers who have it just run around doin nothing , melee weapons dont work too. For me its a 9/10 i hope the keep updating by adding new rooms and functinalities. I would recommend this game to anyone. HF."
19597,"Fun game, I wouldn't exactly call it free because you can get and do so much more if you spend money on this game, unlock special characters, pets, weapons, the works. And it will also benefit you more, it can become hard to make a decent amount of caps to upgrade and build new rooms. I love that you can have pets, but once again, if you don't spend a certain amount of money, don't get too excited when it comes to having a nice collection of pets. The dwellers are easy to gather as you can impregnate female dwellers with male dwellers, this will require more food and if you have a large base, your energy will run out very quickly unless you play every 5 minutes. It is also extremely hard to get lunch boxes, but very easy to send a dweller to the wasteland to get more weapons and outfits. I like the game, I just wish they would make it easier to get more caps and lunch boxes. Perhaps throw in a pet carrier when you log in every day for a whole week, or so. I would definitely recommend this game, though. I guess they have to earn money, somehow..

UPDATE
I just went on my first quest and earned a lunch box! I'm still a newbie so bear with me :)
Day 7 of playing this game, or something. And I earned a lunch box after my 7 day consecutive log in xD"
19598,"So much potential, so close to being a fantastic game, but all is meaningless since the combat system sucks. The residents have a habit of running around like maniacs in combat, making it extremely hard and frustrating to click and drag them around. And when seconds count, this can be disasterous. Also, the random negative events in shelter like radroaches and completely rediculous fire outbraks (sometimes 5 in one day!) can wipe out a whole floor of residents in the time it takes to have a bathroom break. Making those previous hours and days a complete waste of time.

Could have been much better.   4/10"
19599,"Tried to get the 100% in this one, but after 200 hours still only 5/20 Legendary Dwellers. Don't even waste your time or worse money on completion.

19603,VERY FUN. LOOK FORWARD TO HOURS TO PLAYING IT
19604,Biasa
19605,Good game just annoying that I couldn't move progress from bethesda.net
19606,"The concept is cool enough, but this is a cash grab. Very boring unless you wanna spend a substantial amount of money on it. And it's not good enough to justify it."
19607,"The gameplay is fun and interesting, but having it revolve around microtransactions ruins the experience."
19608,"This is my first experience with a mobile-themed game. After sinking $65 in and having nothing to show for it, the only conclusion I can draw is that the mobile gaming market is a scheme to devalue the returns on microtransactions over time. 

This game starts you off in a small vault of digestable scale. You're having fun figuring out how to make it ""just work."" Stick the guy they give you in a restaurant or a power plant and before you know it you're king of the castle. Everything is coming together quickly until you realize that you have to maintain any growth by backtracking to grow and staff these resource centers. That's alright, you can sit back and click on mysterious stranger to earn the caps and upgrade your plant. Wait, you have to upgrade it again if you want to leave basics? Well that next upgrade is expensive, so you'll try out this quest. After a 3 hour timer?!

3 hours later and you're ready to enter the dungeon. Finally, this feels like a Fallout game! For a brief moment, you battle rad-creatures and raiders to earn some decent rewards. You now have enough caps and materials to get caught up. That is, after a 3-hour trek back. You dump your reward into whatever resource room allows you to expand, but now you don't have the caps to expand. This is precisely the moment when the impatience sets in and you become desperate to believe you are playing a game. You buy that big, glowing starter pack that pops up when the game predicts it has you hooked. And what a return you get on that $5.

A Mr. Handy to put out fires or collect resources. Isn't that lovely to have a passive, invincible wasteland roamer collecting caps for you? 
A pet. Who doesn't like adding some flair to their lemmings, especially when they have passive bonuses themselves?
A bunch of resources... Enough to build the first tier of your next room without having to wait and wait and wait.
A good number of quantum colas? Now I can get this show on the road!
A legendary dweller?! ALISTAIR TENPENNY?! NOW you're excited. An established, beloved Fallout character is now under your command. Oh, the adventures you'll have! From Knob Creek to Hodgenville you'll roam. 

You send your Mr. Handy into the wastes and after 3 days he has 1400 caps. Not much of a return, so you call him back and keep him on fire duty. As fires break out, he rushes to treat them and suffers damage quickly. Can't seem to heal him either. This robot has a death wish. Eventually some raiders come in and Mr. Handy decides to take them on himself. He rushes in and dies almost immediately. There is an option to revive him for 2000 caps. It costs more to revive this thing than it gathered from the wasteland! So you forget about it and move on, acknowledging that you paid for this drain on resources.

Your pet is cute, but its effect is unnoticeable. -7% crafting time or something. Well, there's nothing worth crafting unless you're ready to wait a year to get 80000 caps. 

With the fast resources you earned and the quests you blazed through with quantum, you build more stuff. The quests are broken down into as many as 15 pieces to force you to choose between buying quantum and waiting 20 hours up to 30 times before they're truly done. Those wait times are increasing, and so are the prices for rooms. The currency in this single-player game is inflating to prevent you from achieving growth without investing in Todd Howard's next sports car. 

Even if the resource game is rigged, you still have Tenpenny. Good ol' Tenpenny. Until you realize he has none of the personality that made him prejudiced, petty, but ultimately memorable. He's the same as your other dwellers; The only difference is that he has a couple of equipped items that can be unequipped and added to another character to turn THEM into Tenpenny. These empty ""legendary dwellers"" are the main attraction, and 20 out of 23 are from Fallout 3. The other 3 are followers from Fallout 4. Bethesda is as likely to acknowledge New Vegas as Vince McMahon would be to induct Chris Benoit into the WWE Hall of Fame. 

As a closing statement, I'd like to point out that Bethesda knows how hard they're ripping you off because there's an option to buy $99.99 worth of quantum. That's $40 more than Fallout 4 was and that was most definitely a game. This is not a game."
19609,"I had played this game in my Android long ago,and the first time,I played it,I screwed everything.I lost many dwellers.And then ,I deleted that vault,played again.And this time,it was superb.
Just some time back,I got to see this game while browsing for Fallout 4.I thought to give it a try.Guess what,I ended up enjoying more than the Android version.The big screen,better to control and moreover,absolutely free.They just surged the price of Fallout 4 DLCs without giving equivalent contents,I think,they compensated a bit with this one..Having fun with this game.

THE ONLY PROBLEM:-
YOU WILL NEED TO WASTE A LOT OF TIME IN THIS GAME.BECAUSE,YOUR RESOURCES WILL START GETTING EXHAUSTED THE MOMENT YOU CLOSE THIS GAME.THAT ISONE OF THE FEW DRAWBACKS OF THE GAME."
19610,"Honestly one of the best games I've ever played, and its simple too. It's even better having it on PC because it runs faster than the mobile version."
19611,"Just started playing this game. I wanted to test a comic strip I saw A few months ago.

Well at least this game does not get boring after a while"
19614,"A nice management game if you're into those. Personally, I'd like to be able to port my saves from different Operating Systems through the cloud. For example, from my Android Cell Phone to my Windows 7 PC."
19615,A fun game to pass the time. A good way to practice managing and strategy. However the only thing it could use is a damn family tree button or tracker because in the game the easiest way to get a larger population is to create families and have your dwellers have kids. The problem is that it's difficult to remember who had a kid with who unless you change their last names. But even then it gets a little confusing because then you can't recall who's a child and who married into the family.
19616,"It's very boring, like watching paint dry. Dozens of minutes pass where nothing happens and you have nothing to do, this is the p2w system. Any ways if you think this might be boring, it infact is."
19617,Awesomeness!!
19618,"The PC port of the idle/exploration/simulation fusion Fallout Shelter is a near ideal version of the mobile game, incorporating all the mobile game's expansions while adding a few other improvements of its own.  It fixes two of the biggest problems of the mobile version:

1)  On mobile, you are effectively unable to control the camera.  On PC, WASD+Q/E control the camera and make it simple to get to exactly where you're going, rather than having to edge your phone's touchscreen to get it to the right point.

2)  On mobile, you quickly have nowhere to go.  On PC, in addition to the Quest system, which you unlock shortly after you've got your vault self-sufficient, you have several rooms that allow you to craft items directly, which you unlock shortly after you've got your Quests underway, and at ratios that are more forgiving than the microtransaction-heavy mobile port.

Curiously, this makes microtransactions even less attractive than usual - the same junk system that lets you craft gear also competes for storage space with your initial bequeathed weapons and armor, so microtransaction purchases could go to waste.  Acting against this, the creators added a new microtransaction currency, Quantum...  but there's more than enough free quantum from quests, daily quests, weekly quests, and randomly available from challenges, the Mysterious Stranger, and the wasteland.

There are some bugs - but largely ones that also existed on mobile (such as trying to drag characters from one room to another needing to hit an unlabelled 'drag zone' to complete).  But few are really troublesome.

In short, this is the definitive version of Fallout Shelter.  Get this if you're looking for an idle game that offers you more in-depth challenges than ""buy the next upgrade"" when you start it up."
19619,"My advice playing this game:
1. Download a FREE trainer or save editor
2. Give yourself those quality of life items that are hidden behind a paywall
3. Enjoy not spending hundreds of dollars for mechanics in the game"
19620,"Yes, me and this game have definitely clicked."
19621,Fun but the tips forceing you to use your VERY rare Cola bottles have made it imposible for me to do certain things.  If I wish to buiuld certain rooms I am then forced to do some steps that end in me spending all off my hard earned bottles.  It also prevents me from playing the game if I don't spend them.  It is stupid B.S and FORCEs me to give a Neg.
19622,"     After playing this game for a couple of days, I have found that the following is true.  One: after the first game, if you don't know what you are doing, you will fail the first time. Two, there are a lot of stastics, percentages, and luck with the system to get a positive outcome. Example: You can upgrade all of the rooms and connect them together; however, in doing this, you actually cut probability in half or thirds depending on the amount of people, upgrades, people levels in that catergory, and just strait out luck! Three, you have to rush rooms or find the secret agent to make money. The level ups make money, but the real money makers are the risk-taking room rushes! And the secret agents are a good find! Four, you have to make love! The levels are really based on having kids or attracting random people through the upgraded radio room. These increase your level more than missions. Also, you kids grow up within a day and give you money to build as they level up! Five, you can upgrade your people in upgrade rooms! You can train people! Six: you can gain experience with quests, as well as , gain helpful objects! 
    I guess I do not see as many problems with the game. Yes, there are  times where Radroaches kill characters, but you can paid to revive them. You can move people from other rooms to combat them and other foes. Also, you can always leave your men/women unequiped with a  weapon and pawn  weapons oftens as needed in different rooms! In other words, there are loop holes you can exploit in the game. 
    My only objections in this game are the raiders who have the abilty to break into a ""nuclear volt"" with swords! Yes, swords! Other than that, this is a fun addictive game if you do not have as much spare time on your hands.  Just enjoy it as a relaxed gaming experience!
"
19623,"This is a mobile game port over to PC. So, as expected its a waiting simulator, with some Time saving purchase options. Its like farmville from facebook meets Fallout.  Interesting little time wasting game

That being said, its well done, well coded, and mildly entertaining. 
Go into this game knowing its a waste of time and pretty basic and you'll probably enjoy it.

5/10 free PC game
8/10 for a mobile game."
19624,"Played for 6 hours when suddenly everything crashes and I come back to see my vault has been erased. No backups, no saves anywhere. Some bs. Consider: buying special items and then getting it thrown in a snap. Not worth it."
19625,Most of the problems the negetive people are facing are just because they suck. I am doing great and have had no issues with waiting for things.
19626,"[h1]‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not a good Fallout game and it‚Äôs not a good mobile game either.""[/h1]

[h1]Plot [2/10][/h1]
If you come into this game expecting gameplay choices like you do in Fallout, prepare to be disappointed. Keeping in mind that this was originally a mobile game (a medium that traditionally lacks the ability to dive into lore), there‚Äôs very little to learn about the world of Fallout. Interactions with outside characters are thrown in amongst hours of tedium and impacts on the world are longlasting. This game will leave you wondering, ‚Äúwhy the hell do I care about this Vault again?‚Äù Also there‚Äôs no end-goal, so you‚Äôre just grinding for the sake of grinding.

[h1]Gameplay [4/10][/h1]
Starting from a mobile game and porting to PC, there was so much opportunity to improve on the basic formula. Many of the menus are *very* clunky and leave you clicking in and out. My biggest grievance ‚Äî the bigger your vault gets, the more you have to scroll out to manage your dwellers at the macro level. Unfortunately, the hitbox or clickable area for almost all clickable objects in the game might not line up with the sprite. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôll end up having a lot of wasted clicks that pile up as minor annoyances into a gargantuan garbage heap. A big improvement would have been menus or buttons for auto-assigning dwellers. Actually, no, my BIGGEST grievance is when your vault gets attacked: you can only assign 2 dwellers to guard the door, and the invaders will run right past them! The rest of your dwellers just walk along or twiddle their thumbs while the vault is being torn to shit! And you can‚Äôt get dwellers, even the ones assigned to the entrance, to follow the invaders around! (Also, during the duration of that event, you cannot let in new dwellers or get your old ones back from the wasteland. Very irritating.)

[h1]Graphics [7/10][/h1]
It did start as a mobile game, and in keeping with the medium, the style is cartoon-like and keeps with the quintessential spirit of Fallout with all of its anachronisms and art influences. It can be difficult to differentiate dwellers unless you assign standard outfits (which will take a long time to collect) to specific rooms. Ex., all of the dwellers working in the hospital wearing labcoats, dwellers working out wearing fatigues, etc. As a result of many-generational breeding in my vault, almost everyone has dark skin and dark hair. They are *very* difficult to tell apart and due to the menu system sucking, it leads to a lot of confusion. The graphics aren‚Äôt great, but I suppose they could be worse.

[h1]Soundtrack [0/10][/h1]
I don‚Äôt actually remember music playing during the game except small cues when I accomplished something. Could be a bug, I suppose. The jazzy, classic soundtrack of Fallout 3 and 4? Forget it; you‚Äôre not getting any of that here. Also, points off for having blaring alarms while your vault is being attacked. It‚Äôs annoying after the first two minutes, and you will be hearing it a lot over the course of the game.

[h1]Replayability [0/10][/h1]
I haven‚Äôt completed this game. While I do have all of the rooms unlocked and built, I find the progression to be very empty. It‚Äôs not rewarding and a lot of mechanics that should have been addictive fall flat because of the aforementioned awful menu system. There‚Äôs a lot of micromanaging involved and with 100+ dwellers, it just becomes a massive pain in the ass.

[h1]Overall [2/10][/h1]
I enjoyed this game for the first hour that I played it, and kept playing out of a love for Bethesda. This isn‚Äôt a good Fallout game and it isn‚Äôt a good mobile game either. Also, though my computer is a bit outdated (I have a GTX 260 in my box), I figured a mobile game should run very quickly. Not true; there are still decently long loading screens when exploring the wasteland and making changes to the vault. I would expect a game with such simplistic graphics, programming, and mechanics to run much faster, even on old machine. 

[h1]Game-Specific Comments[/h1]
In the short-term, you might enjoy this game, but in the long-term, you will probably experience frustrations with the menus, hitboxes/clickable areas, and loading times. If you want to support Bethesda, put money into one of their games that has more than an hour of play in it.

Hope you enjoyed my review of Fallout Shelter! If you liked it, please upvote. :)"
19627,"I love this type of game, and I love Fallout, but this game is absolute garbage. It was obviously created entirely to bilk money from whales, and the gameplay is awful. I really wish it didn't have the Fallout name. Bethesda is really killing the Fallout brand.

There's nothing fun about it. It's literally just a game of maintenance. There are no fun exploration aspects. When you send people out to explore, it's just text about what they're doing, and all you can do is recall them or tell them to continue exploring. There is a ""Rush"" mechanic to make your workers produce faster that sometimes fails and causes fires or nonsensical radroach invasions. There are loot boxes and every other manner of pay-2-win-style mechanics. I can't actually think of a single fun aspect of the game. I think it was literally designed just to psychologically manipulate people in to paying for their microtransactions. I wouldn't even call this a game.

It's a disgrace that damages the Fallout brand. Gross."
19628,Just another microtransaction 'game' ported to PC. =\
19629,Although very different than the mobile version this game is very addictive and fun. I love the art style and the game mechanics. Even though waiting for 1 hour+ is alittle over the top with a pc i was able to get alot of stuff done just withen that time. I strongly recommend to Fallout players and even new pc gamers. Dont worry if you work hard enough you might not even need to pay any moeny since everything is achievable in game for free!
19630,"It is time I rewrite this review, unfortunately, I am still leaving it as a negative review.

[b] Gist of game [/b]

Positives: A simple clicking game you can enjoy occasionally
Negatives:  May seem redundant and boring if played too much, after awhile, you begin to say, what's the point? I don't feel like i need to talk about the microtransactions either, because that is just self explanatory as a bad way to ""speed things up"" when it feels pretty slow during the game. Also, the more you upgrade, the game punishes you (spawning in deathclaws into your base and mole rats that kill your men quickly).


I would like to begin with the style of this game: [u]management.[/u]

Long story short, this game is boring.
At first when you start off with the beginning of the game, where upgrading rooms and building new rooms made you feel like you are accomplishing something. However, the more rooms you add, it's just a boring clicking simulator.

I am a fallout fan, and I love management games, (such as city skylines and Basement) although, this game is a boring clicking and gathering game. You can send your people on quests and that's pretty much it, but all you do is just click and gather. With most management games, there are challenges, such as using your BRAIN to solve issues rather than spamming the rush button, logging off, and checking your base next weekend.

A person in the comments pointed out that this game is meant to be played in increments. That might be the best way to play this game because unlike him, I played this game 7 hours straight and I got really bored fast. Let's pretend that this isn't a Fallout titled game, and it's just a clicker game where you rush materials, wait a long period of time, and then eventually send people on quests (wait a long time for them to start and a long time to return). It wouldn't be as good of a game, wouldn't it? 

In conclusion, if you're into clicking simple management games, I would recommend you play this one occasionally. But I cannot recommend this game to people who want to play more ""complex"" management games, because simply, you will get very bored :/


I needed to rewrite this review because my last review seemed very noobish and ignorant, so here is my new one. Thank you guys for reading, and have a nice day."
19631,A game that is better on the phone then pc? well i be damed ive seen it all...
19632,Half the people who wrote the review probably got raided on the first day :)
19633,"I came into this game knowing what it would be like since I have played it on mobile. This game is well polished. It has great sounds, animations and art. Why am I not recommending this game? It is perfect for mobile, but on the PC it just doesn't fit. This is a game that is built to check at different time intervals throughout the day. It is not something that can be actively played. I'm not able to sit down in a 1 hour session and get anything useful done since most things have immense time limits.

My advice to the developers is to curate more content for the PC version. Instead of Free to Play, slap a price on it. I won't be buying in game packs simply because it's not worth it. I'll be playing other games. This is just a cash grab on the desktop."
19634,great game it's really fun and addicting you make things how you want
19635,"k look at my profile pic yes i love fallout
 and this game was my favorite mobile game ever its the bessssst


"
19636,"This game is fun, cute, and engaging.  It is a waiting game, but there tends to be enough going on that you aren't bored very often.  Design-wise, it pretty much nails it.

The big problem is the clunky, difficult, impossibly frustrating bugs and control issues.  Mouse clicks don't always register where they should.  When emergencies happen, you need to act fast, but it's difficult to click on your people because they run around too much.

This is a very bad port.  I hope it works well on touch devices, because the mouse and keyboard simply aren't cutting it.

I'm really getting sick of game developers that don't bother playing or testing their own games before launch.  I hope the interface issues get fixed.  I can't recommend this game until they are, even though I'm addicated.  It's hard to have fun with poor controls."
19637,"Play for 5 minutes, then get cheats, don't spend any cash in this game. You can find a savegame editor on google, look for fallout vault savegame editor. Have fun!"
19638,awesome
19639,yes
19640,so far so gud... just alot of bad luck hppn to me when playing this game cant even survive a day... always rushing to get more dweller but cant manage to stock more supply xp
19641,It's sometimes pay to win when you become unlucky on the free lunchboxes you get from completing quests but it's a very smart idea and a good game to play when you're bored.
19642,10/10 Would Play Again
19643,"Since I had this on mobile before and am playing it for nostalgia, I'm going to make a vow not to spend ANY money on it again.


*2 minutes and 150 dollars later*

Shit what happened"
19644,"I think that this game is better than the mobile version of Fallout Shelter. But, in the mobile version you are allowed to pause the game unlike this version. It is still a great game and i recommend that you get it. [spoiler] Great Game	[/spoiler]"
19645,";,; tfw a pack of death claws raid your vault, you run out of stimpacks keeping your people alive, kill the death claws with every one at 25% hp, then a fucking radscorpion raids your base and kills everyone, and you have no caps left to res your people, so you are forced to start a new game..........................."
19646,"review changed to positive,"
19647,This game is fun in its strategic ways. Addicting and feels very accomplishing. Take your dwellers on quest and send them out to get goodies. Outfits to wear and weapons to have.
19648,to slow
19649,great game nice system.
19650,Love This Game!
19651,"Great game, so happy that they ported it to steam!!"
19652,"The first few hours of game play were BORING.  Done again, I would buy the 5dollar starter in-game DLC through Steam overlay.  Game gets progressively more fun the longer I play.  Also, I, not being a regular phone gamer, did not know that the in game event timers continue when the game is not being played.  This is a game designed to be revisited for an hour a day."
19653,"After about a week of play, I am changing my review to be more positive.  I still dislike the combat within my vault but since I have a higher population now, I do not need to move people around as much and everyone has a gun!    I am past the overseer ""bug"" and the additional quests add an extra dimension to the game which I am enjoying.    I have added rooms to increase my dweller stats and that is also a big help.    I started playing this game when I was sick with a cold and the simple ""click on stuff"" interface made it pretty easy to play without having to pay too much attention.  Overall, I am finding it to be much more enjoyable now that I have about 45 people."
19654,My computer bluescreened and my save file got deleted apparently. Only game where this has ever happened (my computer blue screens often)
19655,This...game...is....AWESOME!!!   Really recommend this game for any Fallout fans out there.  The only thing I don't like about this game is is you can't pause the game.  But this game is really addicting lol.  LOVE IT!  Go get it!  Its free!  What do you have to lose?
19656,"So my Fallout Shelter keeps getting deleted for God-knows what reason. When I reinstall it, my vaults disappear (even though I saved them). Please fix this. For now, I'll be giving this a thumbs down."
19657,Dwellers can have babies
19658,"like the app, only faster."
19659,"while I give this game a would recommend I still have a complaint. I absolutley love this game it could have been more to it besides the tedium of sitting for horus on end just waiting for something new to happen. I know that is the purpose of the game but still. overall though, great games"
19660,"Besides pretty graphics, very pointless game.

Huge nasty corrupt moral issue as it encourges you to do polygamy as you will want one high stat male to impregnate every other female in the vault... then close-relatives will start doing each other...

This game should be banned.



"
19661,"I previously played this on mobile when it first came out, but it started to lag once you made a bigger vault. It's really smooth on pc, a little addictive and it has nice little properties."
19662,"note: the 24th May 2017 update seems to completely fuck up the mouse pointer and keyboard drivers of my Lenovo Win10 laptop after exitting the game, only the touchscreen works fine. The machine needs to be restarted to work normally again. The initial release before had no such - if any - issues on my machine.


PROS:

+++ The visual representation is bloody awesome. You command a herd of Pip Boys in Pip Boy wasteland as their overseer. How cool is that, for a die-hard Fallout fan?

+++ The audio is amazing, both FX and music bits.

+++ The Overseer missions are fun. These exploration minigames were the most enjoyable to me. Well, apart from waiting for my squad 5 hours real-time to reach the area of an interesting mission and additional 3 hours to return.

+++ Because of the game concept (later) it has a different game pace from your average Joe Fallout. You give the commands quickly and check back many hours later for the results when you have a couple of minutes again. It works well for players who are busy with their lives I guess.

+++ The overall game design / concept is so great that it is fun to play despite it's a freemium waiting simulator in the core.


CONS:

--- The game has a freemium business model: the base game is free but you have to pay for having a faster game pace and some fine goodies. Fact is, I'd absolutely buy a full game of this for a fixed price, and I greatly dislike that it's freemium that aims kids who spend the money of their parents using their iPhones. NO WAY.

--- It is a waiting simulator in the core like C&C Tiberium Alliances. I can understand that this game style fits many players. Well, despite that I'm a fan of turn-based strategies that tend to have a slower pace, I am not THAT patient. I had to take RadAways to remain patient while playing this one.

--- Combat system management is quite awkward. I'd prefer having them turn-based, with fewer rolls and bigger hits. C'mon Bethesda guys there is an AWESOME set of combat rule models in Fallout: Tactics, if we are already in the same franchise...

In a nutshell, it is a great, seriously addictive and forgivably annoying game. I dearly hope that one day a fix price version will come out. I'm a fan of the series and this is a good game concept, I'd definitely buy a complete version.

EDIT: I was sort of wrong about the game mechanics. After th initial idle periods it revs up and there is always something to do as the game progresses. This is a good game in my book."
19663,"What to say about this game ? Played the mobile version and it's better than this version, unless you don't care about your ""sims"" to die when you are out of the game or disconnected. It's impossible to manage the game 24H. So, they will be unhappy, will start dying, will catch radiation, will be robbed and maybe violated.

The good:
 Rrepresents very well the world of Fallout. It has many options and you can even assign dwellers to do specific missions while exploring, finding money, earn new weapons, new exp versus enemies in buildings.


The bad: 
The rest. Can't do other things in life than clicking in dwellers and in the rooms, so they can produce electricity, food, water treatment. You are not allowed to disconnect the game or to sleep. If you want to beat this game, you have to die first of hungry, thirsty and tireness, you see the similar things ?


FINAL SCORE: 4/10

PS:Bandits attacked my base while I was reviewing and killed all my dwellers. I'm gonna sleep well tonight. YES"
19664,Just love it!
19665,completely unplayable without a gamepad or controller.
19666,20 of my dwellers died from 1 radroach 10/10
19667,"If you need to work at the computer and need a distraction every so often, it's perfect. Otherwise it can be pretty boring: there are long pauses admist the gameplay, so you need to have patience, or, like I said, do other things :)  I really enjoy it nontheless!"
19668,It's a really fun game. It really makes time go faster
19669,fucking... death claws...
19670,"I have been playing fallout shelter and have been mildly enjoying it, I haven't gone anywhere near micro transactions and haven't felt like i needed too so far. Anyway how i have been playing it is i have been watching a youtube video or some anime, and i have fallout shelter open in the corner to click around on, just for that little something extra to do, i do exactly the same with adventure capitalist too. Out of the two games i prefer shelter, just for the little things you can do. In shelter for instance I found a Dweller with a really suspicious porn mustache, i gave him the name Hans Screwberck and now he is in charge of getting all the women pregnant, also i give him the coolest gear, he is the man. Another funny thing happened once as well, i sent someone out the vault equipped only with their fists, they got charged down by a Yau Guai and they killed it with their fists, taking only 1 damage like a mother f***ing badass...
A few minutes later they ran away screaming from a mole rat because it bit through their shoe.

Its a pretty bad game with some amusing bits here and there so if you want something to click on while watching something else its pretty good, otherwise its shit. 

So if you here for a proper game its bad, go somewhere else."

19672,"Tedious, not very challanging"
19673,"The perfect minigame for killing some time, if you manage not to get lost and suddenly have hours of gameplay.

Fallout Shelter was originaly released as app for Android and iOS a few month before the Fallout 4 launch. Since then a lot of extras have been added.

If you like Fallout, then no question, this is for you. 
If you don't like Fallout might as well try it! 


"
19674,"TL;DR: Maybe it is because it got updated for Steam or maybe it is because so much time passed and so much was added to the core game since its launch... Either way, for a true Fallout fan like me, this game is fleshed enough to be a good stand alone game. And if you are worried about the microtransactions, which are still possible in the PC version, know that there is no incentive whatsoever to buy anything. This is NOT a pay to win game.

Long version:

I remember when this game came out. It was some kind of promotional stunt alongside the developer wanting to jump on the microtransaction wandbagon... But the game itself always interested me since I'm a Fallout fan. Never played it since it wasn't available for PC and I was quite salty about it... Until now!

In a nutshell, this is a Facebook game about building a Fallout shelter in the Fallout universe. However, unlike the very vast majority of Facebook games nowaday, this one is actually quite decent and well made. It shows that a lot of thought have been put in this project and that it has not been put together in a few days only to cash in on microtransactions.

The mechanics of the game are quite polished and the game itself shows the mark of gem games: very easy to play with and start on but hard to master. There is quite a few unexplained quirks going on in this game that you slowly catch on as you get more experienced and if you are the kind of person who want to know right away without waiting then you can simply go on the game wiki which, while kind of bland, is quite complete. Another nice touch is that the game timers continue to tick down when you are not actively playing the game either because you get bored or more likely because real life get in the way, which mean that once you have established your vault you can decide to simply leave and come back later while still progressing on your goals.

The strongest downside of the game is that its interface leave a lot to be desired. This is unfortunately completely expected since this is a direct port from a version aiming for mobile users. There is no way around the fact that the game is built with touchscreen in mind and thus the controls completely suck to the point of being frustrating for a keyboard and mouse user. On the upside, you could play one vault on your PC in the comfort of your home and play the same game on your phone with another vault. Many guides also offer insight on how to copy one specific vault from one medium to another so technically it would also be possible to play a single vault if you are willing to cope with the extra work. This drawback can thus be either a curse or a nice addition to your playing experience depending of the direction you wish to take.

The nice thing about this game is that it is completely free. You just click install on the Steam store page and start playing. There is a tutorial for new players which gift you all what you need to start with alongside a decent amount of Nuka Cola, the ""higher end"" currency of the game. If you are intelligent about your spendings you can stretch that starting amount a long way and I have found that there is plenty to be found in the wasteland if you are patient enough for your explorers to find the stuff, which add to the ""microtransaction available but you don't absolutely have to without being screwed"" feeling. Meaning that yeah, if you go and buy a bunch of stuff you'll get going very fast and be ""successful"" very fast... But then again it is completely possible to play the game without it. And to be frank... The whole idea of the game is to be the overseer in charge of a vault. Waiting is part of the experience. If you're not willing to wait a tad then you probably already know this game is not for you and I'm left wondering why you are even reading this.

Good luck in the wasteland, overseer!"
19675,Good game fun to play.
19676,"First this is just a fun waste of time, and isn't that what we want in our games?  

It's a simple management game based around the Fallout universe.  It's got good controls although there it seems that the mouse is misaligned at times.  

The missions you send your people on are enjoyable.  Also be care to have enough caps to rez them if they died in the wilds.  It has a nice progression that doesn't require you to spend any money.

I would give this warning though.  This is a gateway drug that will lead you to wanting to play Fallout 4.  

Regards for the price of free you should get hours of enjoyable out if this.  It's a fun break from other games or just life in general.  Now excuse me I need to go buy Falloout 4."
19677,This game is amazing and is very fun. I used to play it on my phone( sadly I had to get a new one and lost my progress). I would truly recommend it to anyone who is patient( unlike the people who post negative comments on this game) and loves the Fallout franchise.
19678,"Like many negative feedback writers, not so good for PC ... requires a lot of 'real' money to make the game enjoyable. items should be in the quarters price range, not dollars."
19679,"A great game, both on mobile and PC! Sadly not many fallout new vegas stuff, but plenty of fallout 4 and 3 stuff though..."
19680,Really good.
19681,"GREAT GAME 10/10
"
19682,Definitely worth the try guys!
19683,1 ROACH KILLED 15 DWELLERS! Possibly worst game oif my life. 0/10 IGN
19684,"This game might look like it's a bad game but it's not. It's a good game actually. If you don't have nothing to do or you're in Q in League Of Legends or something like that, and you're waiting for that one thing to open or find whatever you're waiting for, this is a good game to play, there's a lot of things you can do in it too. It's based on ""Fallout 4"" which makes it more cool. Try it you won't regret it!"
19685,i love fallout i love fallout shelter and my onley problem with this game is that it belongs only on phone and i dont 100% think it fits on  pc unless if you make things go faster because on phone you can check on your vault througnout the day on pc though you haft to sit there and wait
19686,"Microtransactions and timers actively stop you from enjoying the game. 

There is something fun hidden deep inside here but not until you open your wallet or waste way too much of your time."
19687,just got started but loving it so far.
19688,6.5/10
19689,"probably the best ""Free to Play"" game that i tried :)"
19690,"For it being free, this is actually very good game. Only thing I kinda dislike is that no matter how well is your society doing when you leave, you can count on it that they mostly will be all dead or at least unhappy when you come back. I don¬¥t like that certain mechanic, since I am not in the game 24/7 to keep my people happy. I consider this very bad. It probably will be so upsetting to me, that at some point, actually, very soon, I will just give up on the game. It¬¥s shame, because other than that, it is pretty enjoyable. I give it thumbs up if you play for a little bit, later on it will be pain in ass for you.

After 50 something hours in game, yes, 50, have to say it is still not pain in ass for me. I don¬¥t know how but it is pretty addicting. I love to level up and send people to different quests. Now when I am here, I actually think it is more fun later on. Before, every deathclaw attack meant all my people dead, but now as I have lot of high leveled one it is easy and it gets easier everytime you progress, but also you get more challenges, so it is not like you are ""safe"" just because you leveled up. It¬¥s really good game, I mean, you can pay for games, and get tremendously less fun."
19691,best game EVER. highly addicting and fun
19692,"Quite a nice game...But it have quite a lot of stuff need to be improve if this game is run in pc... Therefore, better playing this game using tablet or phone rather than pc."
19693,"These time-waster themed games are okay on a mobile platform, but why the hell would anyone want one on Steam ? After 10 minutes you need to start another time-wasting game to stave off the boredom you experience in this gam. 

Its a slow base-building game, but its not slow because you have to think, its slow because you spend most of your time looking at nothing. Just people in rooms repeating actions. 

If you're someone who enjoys tabbing into a game every 20 minutes while doing work, I can recommend. But it belongs on a mobile platform."
19694,Nice
19695,"I love Fallout Shelter. I've played really far on my phone, and would definitely recommend it. On PC, however, I cannot recommend it, because it crashed to desktop the very first time I loaded it, I must've gotten insanely lucky the second time, as I was able to play for about 20 minutes before I went to bed, as now every single time I've tried to launch it, it's crashed to desktop."
19696,"A game I really want to like, but one designed around the mobile game ""hurry-up-and-wait"" philosophy. Gameplay would be great if the montezation didn't revolve around cooldown timers taking longer and longer. Since it's a mobile game port game actions end up taking longer and longer until you're waiting literal days for things to complete.

You can always pay real cash to speed up the treadmill. Sad for a game which does have some interesting concepts. 
"
19697,I like it but the fact that the game runs in the background is annoying and hard to maintain if you have school and a job
19698,When going into the vault quests after unlocking the overseers office the game zooms in and you can not click the wastelands button when it tells you to.
19699,Fun. You dont need to pay to win in this game. It just makes things a bit quicker. I like those type of F2P games.
19700,Typical mobile where you end up fighting the UI more than anything else.
19701,"Fun and works well, I guess. Definitely a better mobile app though due to it's check up nature and wait times."
19702,"Got more playtime out of this than Fallout 4. 

The only thing about this game that is outright infuriating is how you'll log on for like a solid minute to click some things and in those 60 seconds you'll get attacked and have to stare at the fucking screen and wait while it ends. It's excruciating.

Also once you get above 160 dwellers the game becomes INCREDIBLY hard to manage. There's also no way to restructure your vault without spending an impossible amount of caps to deconstruct and reconstruct everything."
19703,This game is very easy to learn and very fun to waste time
19704,"Good game, something about it keeps you coming back."
19705,i love it
19706,Ive never seen a 30% chance to fail that fails every time its completly off!  Scorpians that are unkillable kinda ruin this game its free so they make it so hard you need to pay to stay alive....
19707,Nice Game.. much better on the phone!
19708,My old tablet wasn't powerful enough to run this game after I acquired too many dwellers.  I'm glad they ported this to Steam so I can play it again!
19709,Baby making simulator
19710,"It crash in my PC
and i cant name my vault start with 9"
19711,"I liked it on the phone, but I love it on the PC."
19712,"Ignore Microtransactions. Between i think you know how to bypass them...

And... Yeah.... Microtransactions... The way to bypass the P2W has come."
19713,Yeah it is free. But it is a freemium mobile game and not a fantastic one at that.
19714,"I love this game but let me just cut to the chase. Almost everything in the game from lunchboxs , pet crates, and mr. handys
you have to buy this stuff with real money. Plus that the game is killing me because im having to send a vault dweller out in the wasteland and it annoys me cause ive got to work on my food, water, and power. The food and water are the problem and this goes out to BethesdaTM games "" DON'T MAKE A GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO BUY STUFF!!!!!! "". But other than that the game is good. I rate this game 10 out of 5 stars from me"
19715,"Had a decent shelter going with 48 dwellers. 13 hour save. Had a powercut while playing the game (not during saving). Vault was deleted, save slot just gone... Good job I didn't waste any money on the microtransactions. What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t?"
19716,"If you love fallout series, you must play this. Like strategy or simulation games? Download it! Want a great free to play game  because you don't have money on your account? Play this game!
This game is a masterpiece, wonderful gameplay, lovely graphics and nice music.
10/10"
19717,This game doesnt know what probability is. 30% chance to have an incident and it fails. 30 times in a row.
19718,"[h1]Fallout Shelter[/h1] has arrived for PC, as a [u]mobile port[/u]. It‚Äôs still a Bethesda game and it‚Äôs still Fallout, but can a mobile fallout game work on steam??

First of all the game is free to play, so yes you guessed it, it has micro-transactions in it, but I will write about that a little later.
The grafix in the game is very true to Fallout and that pleased me when I saw that, it‚Äôs very well made and you actually get the feeling that you are playing a Fallout game.

Now the game starts of as you been a manager of a Fallout shelter and you give it a name. Then you are taken through a tutorial of some of the basics and then you are set and go for the rest. The problem is though you still don‚Äôt know half of what you can do in the game, or what the game later will introduce you to. There is a help section, and I can only recommend you reading it, because it gives you valuable information on how to management your dwellers into the right places, so you get faster resources.  And this is where the problems really start in my opinion, and where it shows that it is a mobile port. The waiting time you have to wait for resources are pretty long when you really can‚Äôt do much else. 2-4 minutes to be allowed to press a button to get resources is a long time. The first 30 mins you are pretty occupied with the game because everything is new, but then it starts getting boring. There are small events that happens like animal infestations or attack on your vault but that‚Äôs pretty much it. I am missing a more eventful game, maybe earthquakes or something else than a fire that can happen because you tried to be greedy with rushing resources. 

The game has different items, armor, guns and pets in it, that makes it more interesting, and it is cool having your dwellers running around looking different. A way to increase your population is to make love and produce baby‚Äôs and that is a funny feature, again though it takes soooo long time to actually produce a new dweller and have it grow up to be able to work in your rooms. Now if you get passed the waiting time, and play it as a normal pc game, you will eventually get enough dwellers to unlock the Observere room, where the more interesting part of the game opens up. Being able to send your dwellers on quests is a nice feature, but yet again the time it takes to do something is brutally long. Ranging from 30 min to 5-6 houres for your dwellers to get to a location is something you just wont sit and wait for. This is yet again a place where the mobile part of the game shows, because you are more inclined to close down and look at it again later when you are on your mobile phone, than on a pc. You don‚Äôt want to open up a game, to play for 10 minutes to close it down again waiting for new things to do. When you actually get to play a quest, you get a new mini game where you have to kill something or answer questions about fallout. I like this part in the game, I just don‚Äôt like having to wait 1 hour plus to be able to do it.
Off course IF you use Nuca cola which is the real money currency in the game, you can get there instant, and now my rant starts. The starter pack is 4.99 Euro, which is fine, you seem to be getting a decent amount of things, but then the price goes up. 4-5 Euros for 6 Nuca-Cola when it cost maybe 8 to go instant is WAY overpriced. I am inclined to say that if you do not pay money for the game, you can‚Äôt play it as a PC game, and has to play it as a mobile wait game, and that is where I get annoyed.
 
If you port something to a specific console, you should really make sure that the game is still fun for none paying players, or ask a decent price for it and lower the time for things to finish. 
Even minimising the game to try will eventually pause the game (having it to reload when you return), and if you haven‚Äôt bought the starter pack you don‚Äôt have the handy auto loot machine running around picking up loot for you. Yet again you are losing out when you don‚Äôt pay. 

The sound in the game is standard for a mobile game, it‚Äôs not great but it‚Äôs all right, it works for Fallout Shelter. 


[h1]Should you play it?[/h1]
 
Well that depends, if you want a game where you are occupied all the time, and having to wait for things to finish is a bother for you, without paying for it, then this game might not be for you. If however you don‚Äôt mind having a game you open up from time to time, and play for 10 minutes maybe 30 if you do a quest, then this can could be just what you needed in your life. :) 
"
19719,"Hey, thats pretty good."
19720,fun game but you want to play any other fallout game if want to play this its what i want the vault tech workshop dlc to be but i stil like this most of the time i play this when i dont want to play something ells (sorry for bad english) :)
19721,"iz good, decent android port. Better than playing on my crappy samsung gs3"
19722,Impressive
19723,"Hmmm..... 

This game is good and so addictive , but it realy suck when u didnt have money to buy item in shop cuz to expensive and so need lunchbox to get more ppl.

Well i hope this game always update and make it better and make the quest more easy to get bottlecup,craft item,nuka quantum and more lunch box so it will be very addictive.

19724,"[h1]Fallout Shelter[/h1]
Pretty good game to school xD
--------------
[h1]10/10[/h1]"
19725,Combat sucks! I cant understand how a radroach can kill a fully equipped lvl 10 dweller. Maybe its beacause the dweller just stands there with its dick in its hands while the radroach has its fun killing him. The fact that you can only play for 5 minutes straight without any nuka colas also sucks. Pets are NOT lore friendly! Feels like im playing farmville with all the cute cats and dogs. The first pet i got was a fucking parakeet!!!! COME ON!
19726,"Great game to get the taste of Fallout universe. Free, fun to play and hours of content.

Pros:
+ Great game design
+ Unique gameplay
+ Lots of content to explore
+ Free to play
+ Hours of entertainment

Cons:
- Mobile game
- Moving dwellers around vault might prove challenging, especially during critical moments
- Radscorpions are one of the hardest mobs in the game, dwellers sometimes just run around aswell"
19727,"At first this seems like a good way to waste time, possibly while watching tv or something. You go through the initial moves of placing dedicated production areas and putting people to work at them and it seems like something is happening.

You do the objectives (collect 50 food resource for example) and get boxes of ""cards"" which flip and reward you with random stuff. Sometimes you get items for your people like costumes and/or weapons but most of the time you get a pinch of resource (water, power, food) or money used to buy more space for your vault making it bigger.

much of the time you get ""junk"" which is sold for chump change.

In the end you find yourself playing what devolves into a ""waiting simulator"". You have to collect a certain number of resources to get a minor reward which then opens up another task to do the same damn thing, but with a lot of waiting in between.

you can send people out of the vault but their ""adventures"" merely consist of single descriptive sentences and random minor rewards over an extended period of time, nothing more.

i restarted the game many times and found that the random drops of cards are not very helpful. obtaining weapons/costumes seems to be second only to getting a new character with comparatively enhanced statistics. most you get game currency (caps) or a smidgen of resource (water/power/food).

in the end i feel like the developers of this app purposely made the ""dead time"" way to long in an attempt to pull in more in game real money transactions. those transactions should be avoided as they are one time only and gone once applied. i have tried to save the game before flipping reward cards to no avail, the rewards remained once the card was consumed.
finally, the game is an obvious port of a very generic sim title (sim tower i believe) with downgrades to gameplay in exchange for the fallout guy theme.

i suggest trying it, i enjoyed it for a few hours. maybe i missed something? what could it hurt? its free, it didnt take long to download, and no one is obligated to keep it.

nice try guys, but this one did not hit the mark."
19728,This game is well... good its free and is fun but there are way to dear things in the store.
19729,"Nigga this game is broken as fuck i cant even use my cheat engine on it
Get the fuck outa here with your stupid hard mode its retarded hard no smart hard 
You telling me 8 fucking people in a tight fucking room cant aim at a fucking raider wearing tin cans swinging his shitty sword at them while all of the 8 fucking people were armed with pistols rifles and one sniper rifle
get the fuck off steam and go back to the shitty mobile land you belong you cock sucking cock mombling cock taking piece of shit ofa game"
19730,I like this game :D
19731,"Let pregnant women to train their strength

19735,"It's Fallout. You run your own vault.


IT'S FALLOUT! YOU RUN YOUR OWN VAULT!!"
19736,wery good game
19737,Good fps for a Bethesda game
19738,"I didn't play this game on Steam a lot yet, but I have played it for a long time on mobile.

That it got released on Steam, I personally called it ""release of the greatest f2p mobile game by-the-creators-of-fallout on Steam""

Anyways:
PROs:
+Fallout
+A lot of items
+Now on Steam
+Quests from Fallout 3/4
+Exploring of Wasteland while idle
+Vault Missions can give boxes
+Training S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
+Free to Play
+You can get special items (like Lunchboxes) not for paying for them, but playing for them
CONs:
-Only way to get dwellers after tutorial is: quests, reproduction and radio
-Takes a lot of time to do something (idle)
-If a dweller in a storage they are useless
-200 dwellers limit
-Rush Probability is broken after the tutorial
-Couldn't transfer the save file

So I definately Recommend it."
19739,"Great game overall so far
"
19740,"It's addictive, frustrating and awesome! Fallout Shelter is an amazing game. It's a blend of a strategy game and a story game.  If you like time consuming games, waiting for your doctor's appointment or just bored, PLAY THIS DAMN GAME! Also, you can see dwellers making out and having a baby. So, yeah."
19741,"Amazing. We can finally play on pc. With little or no information about this game, so I'll just start survival."
19742,Boring...
19743,"You can actually mate any two Male and Female......and i mean just any...

19744,"Fun, amusing game that keeps being a challenge"
19745,"Slow paced, couldve been a bit faster, for the rest, fun game!

"
19746,Post apocalyptic gameplay for free! Count me in.
19747,"For the low low price of free + microtransactions that speed things up (but aren't necesary), Vault Tec offers you a future governing your own vault for eternity, keeping upwards of 10 worthless individuals as you question your existence and why we haven't personally suffered a nuclear war just so we can shoot giant roaches in the head and get moneys. 

S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats are important, and for once those 'gifted' children shall be looking down on YOU, [spoiler] yes, YOU, Bob, those days in highschool, I remember them, I haven't forgiven you, I'm coming for you Bob, I'm coming... 	[/spoiler]

Do you want to know what genre of game this is? Well so do I! But I can say there is a lot you can do, part micro-management, part exploration, part actively kicking raiders arses in the wasteland through quests and random encounters you can take part in (kind of). 
"
19748,"I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about, I actually really like this game. It was designed for mobile, so you'd expect the waiting times for missions or training like in other mobile games (Clash of Clans, Game of War, so on so forth), which of course you can pay with in-game currency to surpass. I'm not planning on ever needing to buy the microtransactions, because everything you can get from buying those you can get from just playing the game. 

A time waster, like many have said, and it's very good at being a time waster. Polished, addicting, and funny in odd forms (I don't know about you, but Vault Boy randomly appearing at the corner of the screen holding a smiling baby that looks just like him makes me laugh every time)."
19749,"It's okay for a free-to-play game, a couple of hours of activity for the price of 0‚Ç¨ is not bad. There's obviously no depth to talk about, the quests are not interesting, and the ""gameplay-elements"" are clunky at best, but it's a charming little game with lot's of references to Fallout and other game-series."
19750,"Ive enjoyed this game a lot, BUT .... the fun factor is falling fast, to much demand for resources over and over.

Having to micro manage the workers to best make resources can be fun.

Having to micro mange the workers to best make resources over and over and still need more resources is NOT fun.
"
19751,"Worst game ever. Started well, then turned into shit. None of the women can handle a fucking fire extinghuisher or fight a god damn bug. And then the invasive species you don't have the tools to fight kill are your dwellers. I want my fucking time back, I hope everyone who worked on this piece of fucking shit with a passion, cause this had the potential to be great weren't it for all the attacks.
Fuck you, from the bottom of my heart I curse you to hell."
19752,"After more than a year, and watching my Girlfriend playing it, I decided to give it a try when was released in Steam.  Simply awesome, the game is superb. Addictive, funny, well designed and....Free!!. Nice port, highly recommeded."
19753,its a good game but its very buggy and it crashes often
19754,Very addictive. But i don't mind beacuse the game is fucking leathal.
19755,"I really enjoyed the game untill i purchased some items. After that i received attack after attack and because of that, i lost my purchased items. Contacted support offcourse but am still waiting(2 months now).

So, dont spend any money on the game because they will rip you off"
19756,I've played the moble version of this when it came out . Liked it but was really hard to keep up with what u had to keep ur vault running. This version keeps u playing
19757,"The game is pretty cool, BUT after 2 days of playing the save was just gone!!! I am not only one person with the same problem. Look on the Steam forum! 
The whole vault with 26 hours and dwellers level 30 are just disappeared!!!
Conclusion: DO NOT SPEND REAL MONEY FOR THIS GAME!
"
19758,"Very good game. I find this much better than the one on mobile, it seems to run a lot smoother too and works very nicely. Recommended."
19759,"more than 200 hour on phone.
Yes."

19761,"Been playing on my phone since it came out, maxed out maybe 13 vaults and i fucking love this game. Microtransactions aisde its a good game and a decent port. Its a great Free to Play and the Microtransactions dont shove it in your face. 

Great and frustrating when you have 20% on a room and you rush it and Radroaches come in and mess your shit up.

Good game and its free, dont be a whiney gamer and just enjoy it."

You can play free without microtransations.  I haven't bought anything, I just tried to complete the ""challenges"" (Goals to get prizes such as pets, weapons, credits) and you can get lucky and might get some rare items.  Also you can find good loot exploring the wasteland.  you'll also get a random ""leveled"" dweller fairly early as a new account."
19769,Micro-transactions.
19770,"I've been playing Fallout Shelter since its very first release on Apple Store and I must say it's entertaining! Although, on the PC it's another story. Don't get me wrong, this game is fun but only if you got time to waste. This is literally a waiting game. As a beginner, you will eventually wait for a room to be done producing whatever you need in the next 5 to 20 minutes depending on your Dwellers' statistics. You can always rush a room to produce anything much faster but there's always a risk. Same goes for quests. Once you unlock the Overseer's desk, going on a trip can take times. I imported my save data from my iPhone to my PC using iExplorer application so I already have tons of Nuka Cola, maximum amount of money and a Vault full of level 50 and maxed out statistics everywhere and loaded with Dragon's Maws, Plasma Rifles, Fatman and so on so doing quests wasn't challenging. The problem seems to be the trip though. It must depends on the level and the difficulty of the quest, but a trip can take up to 5 hours before your Dwellers arrive to their destination where you can finally begin your quest unless you use some Nuka Cola to skip the trip. The whole game is basically based on waiting or skipping tasks using Nuka Cola so it can be very boring as a start. Once your Vault is pretty much full of rooms and Dwellers, you definitly won't have to worry about waiting because that won't be the case. There's always going to be a room somewhere, ready for you to collect resources or caps. I don't know if that's the same thing on PC but on mobile, if I was not playing the game for a few hours and I came back to it later, my Vault was always lacking of something. either power or food or water. That was until I aquire a few robots to collect resources automatically. They manage the Vault while I'm not around but without a robot I remember how difficult it could be if I wasn't playing the game for a long time. The difficulty of the game will vary on the amount of Dwellers inside your Vault. If I remember correctly, once your Vault has 25 Dwellers, Molerats will start attacking your Vault from time to time. Otherwise you only have to deal with Raiders. Then I believe with 60 Dwellers, Deathclaws will start attacking the Vault, as for the annoying Radscorpions, I don't really know since I stopped playing after they released an update for them so I couldn't really analyze their arrival since my Vault already had 200 Dwellers. Rare/Legendary loots used to be easy. All I had to do was bring 20 Dwellers outside the Vault and after a few hours, they came back with rare scraps to craft rare weapons and armors/clothings. Now it seems to be just from quests because I don't remember collecting any rare loots from them in a long time.Quests aren't that easy. You always need a lot of Stimpacks and Radaway to deal with whatever is out there. So I got to say it's not the best way to make caps. Just send your Dwellers out in the wasteland and ignore whatever location they can find, let them travel around for more loots. Money is pretty easy, as long as you send a high level Dweller long enough in the wasteland and give them a good weapon with an outfit that gives enough Luck, your Dweller will definitly return with enough stuff for you to sell and make money. But of course you have to make a sacrifice at first. If a Dweller is low level, they will probably die outside. If they do, revive them. It cost caps but at least they're going to get stronger and stronger, and whatever they find out there should eventually bring back the money you lost. My advice is to raise your Dwellers as high as possible from the very beginning. It doesn't help at all with how many Dwellers are in the Vault, it's quite the opposite. More Dwellers always means more risk of getting your entire Vault wiped out by Molerats, Radscorpions or Deathclaws. If your Dwellers are not strong enough, it's pointless. Even if someone is carrying a Fatman or a Dragon's Maw. If your entire Vault is wiped out, it's going to be expensive to revive your Dwellers. If a Dweller dies and you don't have enough caps to revive the fallen one, just click or tap anywhere outside the window and wait until you got enough money. Although whoever is inside that room with a dead body will bring down their happiness and effectiveness. Quotes between Dwellers are pretty entertaining to read. The higher their Intelligence and Charisma, the ""smarter"" their quotes will be. Like two Dwellers flirting with each others. If two Dwellers are totally dumb, they're gonna throw some really weird stuff. lol Stats do affect a few things. Perception for instance will increase the productivity inside the water purification room. Even if the Perception is up to 10 on a Dweller, you can use an equipment to give +5 or +7 Perception and it will actually improve the productivity even more, reducing the production time as well. Same with Luck, the higher the Luck, the greater the chance to rush a room without causing any incident. The higher, the better. It might even give you a 0% failure if everyone has enough Luck and other stat for the particular room. Well, that's pretty much it. The game is fun but only if you're playing on a phone or tablet and you got nothing to do at all. Unless you're the type of person who sit at their computer without knowing what to do with their day, then that's a great way to spend the time."

19779,ood just wish for mods
19780,"Fun, fallout based game. Quotes Skyrim at one point. as others have said, DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS... if your save corrupts, you lose your stuff. $$ aside, this is a fun, fallout based idler with enough to keep diehard bethesda fans like me playing. if you dont LOVE idlers, play this on mobile."

19785,casual fallout vault management game. could use some work. highly addicting
19786,Great Game :D
19787,"Keep crashing after computer restart. Buggy ingame too (but not unplayable, like broken mousewheel etc)

But why i am really giving thum down: Whole game concept is wrong, pc is not ""keep it in your pocket & play for 30 seconds every 2 hours""."
19788,"It's a game that went from Mobile to PC and I ain't complaining, its fun to have your very own vault, build on it, upgrade and assign dwellers to the right parts of the Vault. You can also send them out to scavange for items and bottle caps, have kids and level up each individual dweller. It is a big grind I must add but if you love being rewarded with new weapons, clothes and bottle caps then this game is for you, it runs very smooth on the PC like it should as opposed to a phone and has plenty to do to keep you occupied and besides it's F2P so give it a shot"
19789,"don't buy in-game items, the game crashes and scams you out of your money."

19793,I played this games for days
19794,‚ò∫
19795,I think it should of sticked to mobile.  Its a very grindy game and requires a ton of patience.
19796,Only real problem is the food goes down to low too quickly. I also noticed it is not pay to win. I'd just say don't rush unless 33% because most likely it'll fail and you'll have a bug infestation. also the lunch boxes are easy to get. I get a lot of them. The only real downside is not much dwellers as you need takes a little long and the food is dammed short.
19797,Fun for free. But pretty repetitive and become boring later on.
19798,nice game !
19799,I've never thought I would play it for this long once I instaled it. Never spent any money on it.
19800,"How the fuck does this game have a shitty camera?

Buggy freeimum shit"
19801,NICE GAME
19802,Nice games
19803,microtransaction time wasting hellhole
19804,as a man who plays fallout 3 i like this game
19805,"Do you like Fallout? Do you like managing stuff? 

I dont care.

A good way to play Fallout Shelter but this time your friends will know about it.

10/10 -IGN"
19806,"Fun game but it is yet another version with another save file... (Android, iOS, Bethesda Launcher, Windows/Xbox and now Steam)

The problem I have is not only for saved progress which if you spent many hours on one platform is a pain to start over but also, if you bought something with real money on one of those versions it doesn't sync.

Many apps already do the sync well with a code or an external login so why not after all this time?

Now the game itself is nice with a lot to do, and they keep adding to it. You can play casual or hardcore. Hardcore in the sense that if you're not looking at the game and your guys die you cannot res them so you do have to pay attention. If you play casual mode you can pay and resurrect your people. So if you like to leave it open while you do something else play casual. If you can focus go hard it is more challenging and more rewarding.

The packs are not necessary but very useful to make life easier."
19807,Best management game! and its of Fallout! Is this real?
19808,"This is a fun game. It's just like the phone version. This game doesn't deserve the negative reviews because it's actualy a fun game. The only problem is the microtrasaction that's it. DON'T PAY FOR MICROTRANSACTIONS! All the negative reviews are dumb don't litsen to them, it's just people hateing. This is not a computer game its a mobile game you can't hold this game to the same standars as a computer game. This game takes a lot of waiting which is how it is on mobile. IT IS A GAME YOU PLAY TO PASS THE TIME, YOU PLAY IT WHILE YOUR DOING SOMETHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!!! The people who are making negative reviews don't know what they are talking about so keep that in mind, they are haters ruining the score of the game. You may say that the game actualy is bad because of the metacritic score, the problem with this is that THE CRITICS SOMEHOW THINK THIS GAME IS A COMPUTER GAME IT IS NOT ITS A MOBILE GAME. This game is amazing fun and perfect for multitasking. Don't be a stupid hater and give the game a chance. If you are a fallout fan you will like this game. I highly recommend this game."
19809,"Bandits appeared in front of my vault, and stood there for almost 1 hour, shooting the vault door down, but to no avail. :3"
19810,Its all about tha controler support have not played with my mouse yet great game
19811,"PROS
simple vault creation simulator 
it's free
microtransactions are a good deal where you can get a legendary character or weapon with money and other MISC items, devs are very generous unlike ubisoft's for honor microtransactions
you can get free lunchboxes if you complete an objective (like gather 100 food or get a baby dweller)
very little scam tricks where you must spend real life money to continue building your vault or wait a year get something
microtransactions are quite cheap since you'll get a lot of needed things
you can send out vault dwellers to the wasteland to find clothes, weapons, and caps and you can call off the expedition whenever you want
you can get free caps by finding the mysterious stranger in your vault once it's big enough, leading to a hide and seek challenge where once you find him, you'll either get from 200 caps to more than 3000 caps, enough to upgrade your buildings or bring back the dead 

CONS
whenever you rush a resource building (diner, electric plant, or water plant) you're given a low percentage that a disaster will happen, let's say 30%. you rush a building to get some quick resources and caps and it creates a fire or a radroach infestation. the numbers in the game lie, you must have a high luck skill from some vault dweller in that resource building to have some good chances at succeeding
there are some bugs and glitches that happen. for me, i built an overseers office to get some quests to get caps and a lunchboxes for the first time, assigned a vault dweller to do the quest and my camera gets stuck for no reason, so i'm not gonna build an overseers office.
the vault dwellers are sometimes dumb since they keep moving around when raiders or radroaches attack. when a vault dweller is almost dying, i tried to give him a stimpack but he keeps moving around leading to his death because he won't stop moving.
it's a pain in the A                      S                             S                    to drag a vault dweller to another location in the vault since you can drag the camera with the mouse as well wasting my time."
19812,"meh
"
19813,"Simply addicting, especially for any fans of the series!"
19814,Very fun time waster. If you're bored you can always just get on for a bit to burn some time.
19815,"really fun game
"
19816,"A simple and fun time waster, but this game is for people with patience.  The game is playable without using the cash shop, it will just take you longer to get things done."
19817,"great game, alot better than the mobile version."
19818,"Pretty Good game
-awesome mechanics
-great upgrade system
-funny love puns
-BABIES
Whats not to like about this game?"
19819,amazing game great graphics better than mobile or windows store
19820,"I was excited about this game on steam. Free to play and all, awesome. I had played this back when if was first released on my phone, and I enjoyed it. It had a short life back then, but it was good.

That being said, I still enjoy it, but with one small issue that has ruined it for me. Radscorpions. They are so op that it makes the game not as fun, and more frustrating. I end up rushing a room, and getting one of those little b*****ds. They drain my energy below sustainability, which renders my recourse rooms un-capable of producing anything. They have very hard to kill, they move randomly. I usually end up with 4-5 dead dwellers. After the attack I am usually out of Stimpaks. So I have to rush rooms just to gain back enough energy to keep my dwellers alive, and I get another d**m Radscorpion. 

Maybe introduce them later into the game, when at least all my dwellers have weapons? But as of right now, I won't be playing for awhile. I am annoyed and frustrated. 

Otherwise, I do like the updates, the missions are cool. The new rooms are fun. Being able to build weapons and outfits gives the game depth. If they made radscorpians less powerful and random, I will come back, until then adi√≥s.
"
19821,"Have it on my mobile device, and have to say its one of the best free to play games out there that one can get by without paying and still have a fun time. People who are complaining its only a mobile game are subjected to this criticism because of the format, but its still a good game. 

Honestly I hate the loading time it takes on my mobile device so its much faster on my CPU which I use more often than my mobile device, so kudos for finally brining this game to the computer, its been over a year that I have waited for this.

Still some glitches but still better to manage people from my point especially when they are near death (for those who don't know this your dwellers can die, but you can revive them for a set # of caps in non-surivor mode) so using the mouse makes this better to actually clicking the characters you need for things."
19822,boring...
19823,"Very nice game
Pros:
Graphics are nice ;)
Send dwellers out with nothing and then wasting your caps on reviving them for no reason (he only gathered 10 caps in 1 hour)
Make the dad bang the daughter and then have a baby :O
Cons:
Power runs out too quickly and slows down my reproduction in the living quarters 
10/10  seriously though this game is very good!"
19824,"Shameless p2w money grab from a shameless developer.
Not really free to play, more like pay to win (or pay to play, nothing to win here).
Even as a mobile/browser game it is simply very bad.
Does not worth any time/money you woulld invest."
19825,"it's a fun little game if you're into base management.

DON'T FUCKING BUY ANYTHING FROM IT. it's all a ripoff, cause on a free single player game, paying for gameplay benefits, fine, what the hell, its free and it's single player, no harm, no foul. EXCEPT! in this game you pay for the CHANCE of getting something useful, and believe me IT WON'T BE. other than that, it's fine. it's fun, its pretty, and most importantly, its free."
19826,Good time waster.
19827,"I have no problem with mobile games ported to Steam as long as they are good mobile games. Imho as a Fallout fan especially this seems like a decent game to play on PC (and way easier to control, I hate playing on a little phone screen!)"
19828,A very good time waster
19829,"It's a mobile game... on steam, so you know it's a cancerous piece of crap from the get go.

Still, it's great to have on in the background to fill the gaps inbetween the other dread in your life.
I've already had 30 hours of ""gameplay"" which is probably more like 3 hours. And for a free game, I still feel robbed."
19830,i enjoy it but a little slow for a steam game
19831,"Typical mobile garbage that replaces any potentially enjoyable gameplay with attempts to farm money from whales.

Also as per standard whale farm mechanics, makes you constantly tap the screen pointlessly in an effort to make you think you're actually doing something which just makes the game a repetitve, mindless grind.

This rubbish doesn't belong on PC."
19832,"[h1]Why i like it[/h1]

I like it cause its unique and has everything a fallout fan could ever want!

[b]I recommend it for all adges![/b]
I love it! And the fallout games are awesome as well!"
19833,"First off, let me just say: Do not buy anything. Its another microtransaction trap. They are over priced with only working on one save slot.  If it were modified then maybe it would be acceptable.

I cant believe this is a free game. I would have paid a couple bucks for this. It's very addicting. It's a very basic survival simulation ala this war of mine or even a Banished. Even though its basic and not that challanging, you still have a bevy of options. The random events makes things interesting even if it is the same for the first few hours of the game. I put in about three or four hours so far and its suprisingly strategic even if it is on a basic platitude. You need to manage your dwellers jobs, switch them out when new ones arrive, micro manage their performances, move them for rush failures, suprise attacks, know when to put a dweller in one area or another, when to send one out to explore, when to change equipment, what to craft and how much, where to place the rooms in your vault, what objectives to complete, what quests and so on and so on. The rewards for the objectives are very good. Getting those lunch boxes are exciting.

And ofcourse this is all Fallout themed with the pip-boy motif. Plenty of Fallout lore is put into this game and if you are an avid fan like me, it will get addicting quick. It runs on real time as well...which may be a hit or miss with people. It's a free game. Its great."
19834,If you're 10 yrs old you might actually like it.
19835,"Good game if you have short stints of time to play.  The menu is slightly different than the version on the windows store.

However I don't suggest buying items for it.  They gave a free pet carrier at the start that you can only use on one vault (you can have a max of 3 vaults).  The vault I used it on disappeared when the power to my house had a hiccup and caused my computer to turn off while playing.  I had made saves of the vault, but it still was gone.  Luckily it was only the vault that I was playing that got deleted.  If I had actually sunk money into the vault I'd have been much more annoyed."
19836,this game is amazing and has a few bugs like dragging charectersa but other than that yes very recomended if a fallout fan
19837,"Made Vault 108 
Named everyone Gary
Made a army of Garys
Killed everyone that's not named Gary
Started a war against all species in the wasteland
After all of that I came back to Vault 108 to play Fallout Shelter
Its a pretty good game"
19838,i'd reccomend this more on mobile devices more than on pc otherwise go right ahead its a fun game just dont buy the microtransactions on here
19839,NOICE!
19840,Good game to kill time.
19841,i died after 3 hours
19842,"this is good, but no different than mobile version"
19843,gg
19844,great game
19845,Awooooo! Keep fighting the good fight chiildren!
19846,Game is broken.  After the 2 minute tutorial it crashes.  No steam support.
19847,"Good game, its free, no tonly pc but mobiles too. If you like to wait and build things this is good game. Its nice and addictive."
19848,"It's ok. 

the game itself is a mobile port and a time sink management game. however, unlike the mobile game (or at least back when I played the mobile version) there's an expansion on gameplay. You can now acctually quest into the wastelands (taking you to other vaults and locations), craft weapons and clothes and collect companion pets among a few other features. 

However it's still a free to play game that wants you to invest money to speed the process up. Money which is for items and once they are used on a single save they are gone for ever. 

Personally I'd preffer it if the game was say ¬£10 and most of the timers where removed (so it was just a resource and people manangement game) OR that the iems purchased transfered across saves. Since neither of those are the case I personally feel no urge to buy anything or recommened you buy anything for this game (but of course, how you choose to spend your cash is up to you).

Fun game if you like Fallout and want something to drop in and out of between other gaming session OR you like management games. Not so fun if you get caught up wasing money on micro transactions as no amount of purchases will ever be enough."
19849,Why am I even playing this again? I already pretty much completed it on the phone and on the PC over the Bethesda launcher and I'm still playing it. I can't stop! Help me!
19850,"Pros: Everyone in vault is thicc. 

Cons: Micro-transactions. 

You know what to do."
19851,"On a phone I can see this as a great game to check in on every hour or so.
On a PC it's TEDIOUS. You just sit and watch it for ages. There's nothing to do. When you're not playing the game the clock is still ticking but you don't pick up resources, there's no way to speed up the game without spending money, it's just boring. Definitely not a game designed for PC gaming."
19852,"If you aren't in the know, the game its self...it is what it is. It's like Sim City: Fallout Edition. You micromanage a vault. This is a 1:1 copy of the mechanics from the other versions of the game. It's interesting enough but it very quickly loses it's luster once any challenge vanishes from the game later on when resources are no longer a limiting factor. To me, anyways. Your mileage may vary.

That aside, I'm not really sure what Bethesda is playing at with this. The obvious answer is for more money from microtran$action$ but anybody who wanted to play this game has already played it. Also as of now this is just a very poor port of a mobile app to Steam. Just play the mobile app or the iPad version if you haven't played the game already and want to."
19853,Totally useless. Must have been tested for all of 5 seconds. Can't make anything happen except it beeps every time my mouse moves.
19854,"Yeah so. Fallout shelter.

When it came out on mobiles I played it... I played it so frigging much. Addicting as hell to have the most perfect vault ever. Although my Samsung Galaxy S5 handled the game well, once you had a big vault and all that the game got laggy and also strained your phone. I uninstalled it right away once I heard about the PC version. No more phones heating like a cooking pot, no more laggy playing with big vaults.

I always knew somehow this game ended up on Steam and I waited for the Steam version until I started playing again. So what it is? The most fun and simple building simulator and the best part is the Fallout theme. It has a lot of content but you will grind like hell, micromanage and wait. I mostly do some stuff on my PC like editing photos and such, this game runs on the background and keeps going automatically until something needs to be done (Mr. Handy <3)

Best part of the new features are the wasteland quests and exploring some buildings in wasteland. It's fun for first 3-5 weeks but you can get bored. 

Overall this game is propably one of the best mobile games ever created. You can do just fine without paying for the starter packages and all that but who cares, I threw 5 euros for the starter package. Not a big deal. A must play for any Fallout fan."
19855,Um...I just wanna know why I hated this game on iOS but addicted to the PC version WHEN ITS THE SAME THING
19856,personally I love Bethesda games this one is a bit different from the tradtional Bethesda games but it still has some of the same feature that we all love. Fallout shelter is very adicting as well.The game itself is really fun and actually pretty tactical if you want to max out a vault with 100 dwellers. You need to think ahead and plan the layout of the vault wisely or you will be kicking your self later on in the game.
19857,A bit bugy but it's ok.
19858,7/10
19859,"Very fun at first i install and thought meh, then got into it and im actually enjoying it<
Edit* logged on today all my time wasted -_- i was up to 42 dwellers to logon with just 12 ...Saved file on the cloud must have been corrupted ........now uninstalling this  PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME!"
19860,Naisha
19861,"Why such games are created?
Is it because the developer is that much incompetent?
Is it because of laziness?
Coming from Bethesda, I'd say that it is both.

Seriously, the MMOs, the mobile gaming and the console gaming has destroyed the gaming industry.
We get crap like that instead of getting a real Fallout game, when was the last time we had a real Fallout game? Last time I checked it was in 2010.
Fallout 4? Please, that's not Fallout.
If they were competent enough, they wouldn't care about the mainstream, we could get a Fallout similar to the first one or second.
But nope, too complicated, let's make something that even a 8 years old kid could make and let's make it a game for everyone, even if they are not real gamers but just posers and fakers who only played games such as Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and all those other crappy Facebook/mobile crap that should not even exist in the first place.

I'm seriously tired of this crap, and the worse is that people seems to encourage that kind of crap.

A message to the developers and publishers; if you really want to make such low quality crap, then keep it for the consoles and the mobile gaming, I'll talk for the real PC gamers community;  we want real games, we want a true Fallout experience. Not the kind of crap that required you to be always online to play (no offline play), that has microtransactions and that looks exactly the same as those crappy games made by incompetents you can find on Facebook.

Honestly, I don't know where this is going, but crap, as a gamer, it hurts.

And to those who's gonna come and say ""you can be a real gamer even if you have only played Call of Duty or Candy Crush"".
Well, I have nothing to say to you.
Call of Duty may be is a crappy game but oh well, at least it's a game, those Facebook and mobile ""games"", what are they? You could spend more than 600$ and you'd be kind of done with the game, and if you don't pay, either it will be really slow to progress and you won't be able to get/access to everything or you just won't be able to advance at all.
Don't get me wrong, I love some grind, in games that are fun to play and that you don't have to pay with real money to speed up the process or whatever.
And as long as it is fair, I don't want to spend my life finishing one game.
We, adults have obligations and other stuff.
And even if I could be a kid for the rest of my life, I wouldn't want to waste my time on just one game, especially not a crappy one such as this one.


This game is cancer, Bethesda is cancer, this new generation of gaming industry is cancer and i'm honestly tired of this kind of crap, I'll just go live under a rock in the woods so I won't have to look at this kind of
shit anymore, seriously, it's seriously pathetic, it's sad to see where the gaming industry has come to.
I want real games, games that the developer could really be proud of, that the true gamers would really love, I'd be willing to spend more money on expansions and real content.
But nope, it almost look like they want to burn the gaming industry down.
But of course, there are kids who will ask for daddy and mommy money so they can buy in-game trash they won't even need, or a game that is just utterly crap.
Or some idiots who doesn't seems to understand what quality and content is.

If you got offended or feel like you've been aimed at by this review, then that's your problem, you know what it means.

Honestly, this game doesn't even deserves 1/10.
No effort at all, hell, I wouldn't even play this game on a tablet or a phone.
I'd prefer to play Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest or some old games that were on the consoles back when consoles were good and actually had good games.

Even if you're a mobile game lover (how?), this game is riducule, idea could be great if it was well made, AI is dumb (they can't even do stuff such a killing mole rats or anything that happen in the vault by themselves, you have to treat them like babies and do everything for them), stats, RNG, all of that, it's all bullcrap, seriously, I could go all day long on flaws and I wouldn't even be done so i'll stop it here, read other negative reviews but from people who likes mobile gaming but not this game and if they explain it well, you'll understand.
Otherwise, if you're a PC player like me, just ignore this game at all cost and go play Fallout 2 or even Fallout: New Vegas.

I want the gaming industry to work, but it just doesn't right now, I want real games, I want developers and publishers to understand that the number one rule when it comes to video games is not to try to make the most money out of it and hoping that the game is good but to put the most efforts on the game so it can be really good and to hope that it will bring you money.
Look at The Witcher 3, I use this example often because it is a great game, no Denuvo crap, no anti-piracy crap, a fair price for a great game, the best we had in the recent years, that's how it should be done.
And look at how much money they made, of course, people are happy with it, unlike a game that has Denuvo, always online drm, which punish more the player who pays than the opposite.

If you are smart enough, you should notice that developers and publishers are either brainless or that they just don't care about their fans.
Why did we get a game like this in the first place? Why did Bethesda went the mainstream way?
Why should we favor the non gamers and posers above all?


I seriously miss the video games from the 90's, sure, some few were bad, but most of the times, they tried, today, you can't say much about it.

It seriously pains me to see where the video game industry has come to.
The same could be said about music, movies, pretty much everything.
But the human race is simply stupid, what can we do about it?


Note: I am not against casual games, despise being more of an hardcore gamer, I do love some casual games some times, but the real thing you know, not the kind of crap you find on Facebook and mobile phones."
19862,I like it.
19863,"I am a big fan of this game and I even have it on my phone, but today while about to check my vault i noticed it was deleted and I wouldn‚Äôt except for me spending $40 dollars on the vault and hope that i could possible receive some compensation or a patch for the bug... :c today is a sad day."
19864,"Now look at this, the first game that came from a phone, to NOT be a piece of shit. great game. its free. get it. NOW."
19865,"Steam needs to stop accepting mobile games. This game IS a mobile game, the pacing, the graphics, the pay for speed-ups design, etc. etc. all speak to that.

Don't get me wrong, it IS pretty neat and ""Fallout-y"", but it's a mobile device game.... ported to a PC.... WHY?????"
19866,"On Bethesta Launcher, where it came first on PC... Did i have a 100% Maxed Out Vault (used 200 Hours on that Save to do it)... And i did NOT used Real Money to get anything :)

So year... It's a Awesome game, to play from time to time :D"
19867,Great game to kill time or just leave it on the background while you do something else.
19868,"Fun game, you should try it!

However version 1.11 is full of bugs, i would suggest waiting for them to be fixed before trying it out.
Drag-drop control of dwellers is abyssal, targeting when after dragging a dweller is flawed. When raiders arrive the hardest part is to actually select and move dwellers correctly, since the UI is so bad.

There is lots of potential in the game, can't wait to see how it evolves"
19869,"You know, all in all, this is not a bad game. I like it. It is a way to pass the time a stay occupied at times you need. You get full costumization of whatever you want in your vault. All I can say is, this is fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine."
19870,"Ahh the Fanboys of Fallout will be happy with their Fallout Shelter mobile app now on PC! Now they can play it on their phone and PC.This is a build micromanage game of vaults, by Fallouts Vault-Tec. With the world being a giant wasteland, house and keep dwellers happy and well fed in your vault complex that you built and protect. Build special rooms of energy, water supply and food supply for those must have needs. Then you have dozens of other rooms for weapons and stim pacs and such. Build the perfect complex for your dwellers so they stay happy and work to keep the vault alive. You also can equip the dwellers with weapons, armor and pets to help protect or perform better in their workrooms. Also questing and sending well equipped leveled dwellers out into the wastelands to quest and explore to gain loot is another micromanagement thing to do. Lots to keep track of here, Food, water, oh and your dwellers you can have breed. FUN?! It has lots of humor and all ties taken from the Fallout games. It's not missing anything and all cartooned and based on the famous Pip boy. Its rather charming. Difficult? Well, with raiders, rad roaches and fires attacking you vault complex, it can be. So manage well!"
19871,"pretty gud i guess 
"
19872,Beautiful game
19873,"Good Game! After playing it from my phone I can still keep play it...
Now...from my computer! :D"
19874,"I have a dweller Aligility 5 and shes sad in all rooms :/
"
19875,"Fallout series is a giant bomb, and I am in love with it since I remember.

Generally speaking, it's a fun time killer with not much time pressure, enjoyable postapocalyptic vault simulator where every person comes with a huge smile for some f***ed up reason. You do the same things over and over again, and the developer is always trying to update the game with stuff that will make that monotonny work better for you. And succeds! It is a game worth a recommendation.

A tip, If you stop playing for today, don't hit save and quit. It's gonna make the game still go and when you come back on the next day, your vault will be irradiated, food will be a scarce and s**t will hit the fun. Unless you hit the main menu. It's gonna stop the whole thing, except from the processes results, without taking electricity and other stuff. 

I used to play this on my phone ever since it premiered but I stopped caring, now it's on steam and it's pretty much the same thing so -  all I can say is that it's relaxing, slow paced, and have some interesting features. You employ smiling people to their death. The game get's a little more difficult as you progress and maybe the moment when you need to buy something from the store actually comes. Still, I like to play it again."
19876,I play this while watching TV. Pretty good
19877,WHY DONT MAKE THIS GAME AVAILABLE ON MAC???!
19878,Great game! no need to pay anything... but i wish that it was on windows phone too.. ;)
19879,"So I started playing this game a while back and I was quite far in it, I had lots of weapons as well as really good vault. Yesterday, I saved my game and then when I closed it to fall a sleep, I woke up this morning and my save is gone. So if you're far in the game be careful as you might actully lose your save."
19880,"I'm a big Fallout fan, but this is just despicable pay to win bullshit as far as I can see."
19881,"Such a great game on mobile but not for pc. Too much glitches and crashing even after reinstalling.
Wish i could get the achievements but cant make it past the tutorials without a problem :("
19882,"A survival simulator game with Fallout themed cartoonish characters, you can sit back and watch your dwellers live in your vault, distributing them to their jobs, have babies that grow up, build rooms, craft and collect items, weapons, armour and pets. It has microtransactions that you don't have to buy in order to progress (you get free caps and kits from daily tasks and quests), although it's a bit slower without them.
I reccomend it for the fans of Fallout."
19883,"I don't know what to say. Again, would deserve a neutral vote. Why? Because the game itself is not bad. It works has intended and it can be fun. But it was originaly a mobile game and it should've stick a mobile game. It's not the kind of game that worth to be played on PC. It's more the kind of game I'll grab my phone once in a while to play it. So it's not a bad game but it was a good mobile game. I'm less excited by its PC version. Still I wanted to try it to see if there would have anything different from mobile game and nop. It's the exact same thing. 

Why it doesnt make sense on PC? Sometime, you send your dwellers to the wastelands for hours and then you would need to get on computer just to recall them? Isn't a phone more convenient when you just want to spend 5 miuntes on the game to recall a dweller and gather ressources? So having it on PC can be ""ok"" if only it was possible to sync the PC version with the mobile version in a shared cloud so you can access the same save file from both computer and mobile but you can't. PC save file is a thing and mobile save is another thing. You must work hard to transfer file from platform to anohter.. why? A shared cloud could have make the PC version viable. You play on mobile and from time to time on PC. But a full time PC version is plain dumb in my opinion.

So overall, it's free, try it, enjoy it but you'll quickly notice that the mobile version does a better job since you'll most likely spend 5 minutes on the game once in a while. But turning computer on just for this.. nop... and if you don't, your dwellers will die in the wasteland... so nop... i'll have to give it a bad review for that reason.. again, the main reason they ported it on PC is probably more aimed at selling lunch boxes to make few bucks more than anything else. Because overall, it's not a smart move. :s"
19884,"Nice game, BUT.. I cant play because of this ANNOYING bug that blurs the game screen making all white and black. After several emails from bethesda support, i came to an conclusion that they dont know and cant fix this bug.. It started when i clicked on the Full Screen switch on the menu, the problem is with the game and the support maked me reinstal several drivers and windows package, directx, steam, the game.. And nothing... I'm angry as f*uck because i lost a lot of things in the meantime and ruined my gameplay. so THANKS BETHESDA"
19885,awsome game very good details.
19886,for some reason i loaded my save game up and my vault is in darkness i cant see a thing dont know if this is a bug or something im meant to do any help  be nice
19887,"Its something to do when your waiting for your friends to get online or just waiting for something in general... plus, its Fallout, you CANNOT deny Fallout"
19888,Bad port. Stil requires touch controls and is awkward to use with KB/M
19889,really good game i have it on mobile too
19890,You need 2 screens for this game ... 1 for porn and 1 for this game beacause its boring as hell once all you have to do is wait . Yes i have 2 screens .
19891,"One of those days out there in the Wasteland where you question why you took on survival mode? One Deathclaw too many? That glowing one that resurrected his friends and nearly killed you? Enough from Hubology or the Children of Atom radiating you?

Time to play this overly joyable Overseer in control of a Vault full of happy people, a better live undergrond! It's a well made management game with enough Fallout elements to bring even the newbie to the franchise.

No matter what Vault number you choose it's clear what kind of experiment Vault-Tec is running at your place: make sure everybody is happy, so happy they are happier than before the Great War.

PS: There's no need to micropay into this game, if you want that kind of experience, just buy a Fallout game."
19892,makes me remember fallout 4. miss them all
19893,"Pros:
-My fauvorite game from mobile now on pc
-Free to play

Cons:
-Time moves very slow while you aren't playing
-Sometimes my new 2 moths old pc will totally crash when I start it
-I don't know why but somehow this game just get deleted why I turned of PC and I came home...I really don't know why but it can not be someone from my family cause noone knows my password
-Sometimes it just crash

This game is just like on Mobile...but worse
PS: How do I look at people who are outside?"
19894,"I played this game before back when it first released on Android, made quite a progress but had to delete it because it drains so much if my phone battery, and that was way before it got major update.

So replaying this is kind of fun for me, theres a lot of stuff that I never got the chance to try when I played it on my phone such as doing quests and crafting equipments. Overall this game is really addictive once you get the hang of it, you may have a problem when starting up your vault though considering there are tons of thing that you have to learn.

The downside is  you have to check up regularly since everything in this game use a real world time, its easy when its on your phone but unless you are near your computer 24/7 I suggest plan carefully while doing things especially sending your dweller to the wasteland."
19895,Its just a straight port nothing new but it feels nicer to play on the monitor
19896,"it is very intreging after you get over seers office to do the qests it really fun !
"
19897,Just play it and leave it for some hours.
19898,game breaking bug 2 hours in.  unfortunate :(
19899,This Is Just great!
19900,The game is not fun it is pretty boring and whenever anything happens everybody just becomes and idiot and cant handle it if raiders show up and you gear everyone up they just cowar in fear. This game needs to get fixed.
19901,Game does not continue to gather resources when you are signed out of it. Bit irritating.
19902,"Awesome game. Just like the android app but 100 times better. Easier to use, faster and better quality gameplay. Tottaly recommended as it is free and it's a small size game."
19903,10/10 baby making simulator in here at vault number 54.
19904,good
19905,Guy in the picture has thumb up so do i!
19906,Phone game for PC. No fun.
19907,"I like it, so much!!!!"
19908,The controls for this game are absolutey horrible! It is so hard to move people around!
19909,"I've played for a few hours, and I'm disappointed. When I go away and come back all of my vaults needs are in the red and I don't know what to do. My rooms don't produce enough to make the vault get out of the red, so there's always a few blacked out rooms, and caps are too hard to get, so I can't upgrade them enough times to fill the needs Even if I send someone outside the time it takes him/her to get enough caps, my vault'd be destroyed by raiders before I'd get caps, plus I'd have 1 less weapon against them. The raiders constantly running around the vault is annoying, because I have to move my guards everywhere hoping the raider's will stop for more than a second so I can kill one. Yeah, I think you'd better stay to RPGs Bethesda, I love Fallout and The Elder Scrolls, but this is just bad."
19910,most people have shelter 420/069/666
19911,"The game is free, and maybe it is not that perfect but this game is fun. I like it! the graphic are not too hgh. i love characters in this game. they are cute! you are also can play it on your mobile phone. I love the idea that we can build our own vault and design by our own. About caps that use for money is not too hard to earn so you don't have to pay too much for the game if you are not take this game so serious. anyway i love this game!"
19912,"""radscorpions"""
19913,It's gud.
19914,I guess this comes in handy if you dont have a phone?
19915,gud Game
19916,"The game is, in purpose, very very slow paced. So you have to option to speed things up by buying Nuka Cola packs. Its a pay to play game.

P.S.: I have a stalion in my bunker who impregnated every single woman in my base. I never got see their babies because I was sleeping in front of the game. Nothing to do. I even tried to make him impregnant the other men but didn't work out."
19917,"This game is getting a bad rap from people who do not understand it.

It is a resource management, base building game. Plain and simple.

It is a straight port of the mobile version.

Get your head out of your butts and enjoy the falloutie goodness!"
19918,great free game worth getting and love it hadit on ipad for ages.
19919,Falloiut
19920,"Its free, why not?"
19921,Those raiders!
19922,"this game is absolutely support for PC, not for smartphone. it's really fun, worth free game in steam, must try !"
19923,"This is a really fun game if you add up all the time that i spent on this game on my phone and on the PC version i have over 250 hours in this game, i love this game so much and for people that think that you need to pay to win in this game just know i never have spent a single dime in this game and i am just fine. What i really would love to see is if they could let you use the save game from the PC version (i shared the PC version save file with my phone) because that way i dont have to restart the entire game a again.

Fallout Shelter Steam Edition: 9/10
"
19924,"This has a problem with time passing when you get off the game.


When I went to sleep, I woke up with disaster, dehydration annd starvation everywhere."

I love this game! Nice and relaxing."
19926,"I couldn't switch from controller-controlled to keyboard, crashed the game."
19927,"If you played Rimworld this game will look too easy and a bit boring. However it's still a fun an interesting game, only a bit too simple and slow."
19928,Rubish
19929,"This game can be very addictive, BE CAREFUL!"
19930,"""Pay To Win"" That's it!"
19931,"It's a easy and interesting game, and many people like me want to see the simplified Chinese version of the game as soon as possible~

19932,I wish that there were more games like this. Not to much work. And alot of fun! Very creative gameplay. Would recommend.
19933,"Whilst there is a lot of waiting the quests and frequent hazards (for me at least don't know if im just unlucky) keep the game interesting, whenever i do a quest i usually find nuka cola quantum bottles that cover the cost of speeding up the quest so im never wasting anything. I was recently thinking of this but wouldn't it be nice if you could have actual relationships at some point in the game rather thn 2 people in the room and bam baby."
19934,"Without Big Words this is Game wich makes really lot Fun.
You ever wanted to make your own Family deep in the Ground? This is your Game! ;)"
19935,"Game Is So Cool And Addictive ! Playing on Both Steam Engine And Phone ! <3
Just A Lovely Game! :)"
19936,it was g great game it gives you a challenge of surviving
19937,"Started it, ran for a couple of minutes, it crashed my Win 10 computer.
Started back up, opened task manager, scrutinized the specs while running the game, nothing out of the ordinary.
Crashed my PC again anyway.

Screw this game."
19938,best 2d game ever
19939,"This is the game I was looking for, for all of your picky gamers(like me) I recommend this game."
19940,"I remember Bethesda's announcement for Fallout Shelter, it was originally meant for mobile, and it worked perfectly.

On PC? I'm definitely enjoying it, but there are some cons, as well as pros

Pro's:

- Off the bat, it's fun, there seems to be a lot less waiting around than when I played on mobile.
- For what it is, it's graphically pleasing, each room has it's own feel to it, and you can upgrade and merge the rooms, and they change their look. It's had the thought put in and it's aethetically pleasing.
- I never experienced quests on mobile... I feel there is more content being added, or has been added since I last played the game.
- It's fairly addictive, and there's lots to do. It's obviously not the perfect game for PC, but it does still work.

Con's:

- It feels like a mobile port, lots of the dragging, either through your menu's or vault, it's very jumpy and it feels like it would work better with a touch screen (which mobiles obviously have these days)
- Local saving is a let down, you've probably read it already, but it makes micro transactions a bit of a waste, as they're solely on that save and only that one, along with your vault.
- Feels in leagues with like 'Clicker Heroes', it's definitely more of a background game, you don't sit there and play for hours, you have it open in the background and come to it every now and then. (Maybe not a con, but not a pro either)

All in all though, I'm enjoying it, it's fun, addictive, 8/10"
19941,"Overall a fun game, but there was one thing that really pissed me off! I spent $5 on a starter pack, and it just took my money but didnt give me anything, just because of this, i'm giving this a bad review."
19942,"This game has micro-transactions FOR ONE WORLD and add to that automatic save dissapearing (happened to me, but atleast I didn't put any money inside it, but still freaking annoying that everything got wiped). So basically you can pay and you lose your money."
19943,Really cool!
19944,"Fallout Shelter is a GREAT GAME!

And who cares it is FREE, so you have nothing to lose! Except your time and life and when you are on your deathbed you may regret all teh time you ahve been playing this game OR ANY GAME and wish you had spent more time with your family and freinds and exlpore teh real world rather than teh vrirtual world...

Think about that..."
19945,"You either pay to make the game decent or uninstal to win. If they had revamped the resource and quest timer system and removed the micropayments, they could have set a solid price on this game thus making it decent. As it is, it's a time sinkhole you'll regret like every clicker/farmville game."
19946,"It feels like playing an iOS/Android game on an emulator; not enough effort went into making the controls keyboard&mouse  friendly. In addition, the gameplay is just really slow paced, unless you pay $$$."
19947,Hella fun game! Fracking fantastic game to play on yo free time and when u are bored!!!! Get it now!!!!!!
19948,Great game
19949,"I'm happy this game was released on Steam, that's where it truly belongs, good job Bethesda."
19950,"Nice game, Ive played it on my iPhone before it was released on Steam.
Just a question: Could you make the option to let us transfer vaults from phone to pc and vice versa?"
19951,"I Only Recommend This BECAUSE!

I did a glitch where you could get 9999 lunch boxes. (There's a guide somewhere in the Fallout Shelter Guides)

Lot's of waiting but If u have 9999 lunch boxes... Well you just keep unboxing things to speed up time, get more characters, more resources, ETC.

I was also playing NBA while playing this so i could kill more time n be more chill with this game. Honestly recommend if you do the 9999 lunch boxes glitch. (Ik its cheating but it's like the only way it's not boring and just a waiting game.)"
19952,im am so addicted to this game already! love it
19953,"All the mechanisms of game are pretty good, this fallout simulation is really funny and great both at differrent time, sometimes its feels a bit repeating but quests are pretty interesting everytime, game is easy and nice.
Fun to play, as it consists all of big fallout games in very simple 2d graphics and simulation.
Great game, so don't think before playing it, just play and you will find it really interesting and nice.
It is great game again from them."
19954,"Fallout Shelter is a cool game where you are the overseer of a vault. It gets annoying sometimes when you run out of a certain material, but otherwise it's good. It's a good variety of base building and adventure in the Fallout universe."
19955,"awful crap, no point in playing after first 10 hours, just becomes the same"
19956,"This is a mobile game ported to PC. You just sit there and watch them. If you want to buy anythign orwant to process faster you need to spend real money. You can't go afk for a long time because they start starving and nothing will be collected.

If you want to spend a lot of money for almost everything this mobile ported game is the right for you."
19957,üëç
19958,"It's a game without gameplay - every 5 minutes you have to click your rooms to pick resources, and maybe level up a dweller, the rest of the time you do nothing..."
19959,It's like the old Sim Tower game just Fallout style and going down not up.
19960,"I don't know what it is, but it's so damn addictive. Just ignore the microtransactions. If you're fan of Fallout, then get this game!"
19961,"10/10 Recommand it ! Best game ever, also you can find it on Appstore / Google Market !"
19962,"I played to Fallout Shelter on mobile phone, with associated battery issue. With this version on PC, graphics are very pleasant and we an take time to play.
It is a very addictive game (you can start just to do a 5min task and finally ou stop after 2h).
Spirit of the Fallout serie is here and the game itself is very nice and will give you a nice and fun moment !

It is free with online shop. Very playable without any buy.
I warmly recommand Fallout Shelter !"
19963,Best free to play game!
19964,"[h1]For the Fallout fans:[/h1]

I'm happy that Fallout Shelter is on Steam.
Made for mobile devices first, this is a game purely made for the fans of the FALLOUT Series (and not for everyone). Since I'm a big fan of the Fallout series and the wasteland, I cannot avoid to play this.

In this F2P game, you have to manage a vault built in the underground, and help your dwellers to survive, providing them water, electricity and food, and equipping them with weapons and clotches. That's it.
Lots of stuff to collect, to upgrade, and to discover, helps the game to have a little bit of more variety, but it remains a very simple, casual game, to play in relaxation sometime in the day.

About the shop items, those are not necessary. They just help you to advance quickly, but they are not required to anything you can achieve in the game.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
For who loves the Fallout series, the wasteland and the survival/casual games in general, this is a must b.. ehm,, play!?
For who simply don't like too much those, avoid this, or maybe give it a quick try. Can't be booring and not satisfying. Not funny at all.

"
19965,"Don't like it. It is painfully slow, at the same time it demands constant attention when running. The dwellers have no personality. It doesn't make sense you are building a vault in the lore of fallout. These were pre-war ""bomb shelters"", not post war construction projects. The scavenging is dumb (yao guai are ""easy"" enemies""). The way you make money is dumb. The constant suggestion that spending real life money will make the game easier grates on the nerves.

If you want to play, well it's basically a freemium browser game sort of thing. Just make sure you close the game after checking it and DO NOT leave it running in the background or your vault will go to crap. As a browser game it's just ok.

To me it just lacks personality and reeks of cash-grab."
19966,it good
19967,"You need to work more on the PC version bcs it is full of bugs
I don't recomend instaling it before they do something about the game......."
19968,"Love this game, thanks it is free 
Play this game while browsing and blogging 
"
19969,"Nerf the death claws already you bastards, the event frequency is insane... every 2minutes there is a disaster, if you had opened the vault door in those 2 minutes and have 30+ followers guess what, death claw attack! Oh you silly thing, you don't know that by opening the vault door you attract deathclaws because there was no such explanation in the game? No problem here is another deathclaw attack in 2 minutes to help you understant, oh and a sprinkle of raiders to wash it down with. But wait! I guess those raiders really loved animals because, you guessed it! Another deathclaw attack! Ahh... Isn't it lovely outside? Well, normally you wouldn't see deathclaws for miles when exploring the wasteland, but when it comes to the vault it's like you have a locker full of deathclaw eggs in the back of the vault and even though deathclaws trash your whole place up countless times they still can't seem to find them, it's like the synths are printing the claws out with a 3d printers and sending them your way for population control.

No but seriously, I understand that they did this so you would have to pay to play, but come on guys, that's not how you get me to pay for something, I was considering buying some pet boxes maybe a mister handy and a few lunch boxes but now? Now I remembered why I quit the phone app and honestly, bethesda, I despise you, you sell out whore! You have destroyed one of the best games out there by creating that linear, kill everything, be everything so called RPG Fallout4 (I even preordered a season pass that's how much I trusted you bastards (first game I ever preordered and the last)) and I will never forgive you for that crime, but you could at least give a damn about something and fix fallout shelter.

I would gladly pay 20euros for this game if it wasn't free and I always support games that I like (sadly there are very few of them) even though I live in a poor country and don't really have much money to spare. 

I love this game, I love how you have to earn things in it, I love all the art, quests are a great addition to the game, this game is superb and it breakes my hearth that I will give it a negative review because of some design flaw that breaks it.

Just add a restriction on deathclaws so there can only be one attack over a period of time of gameplay or that they  don't attack you after a certain perion of time after they did so you can lick your wounds. Honestly? I would like to see deathclaws wreck even more havoc, something that makes it feel like they actually are the ferocious unkillable armored beasts that they are. But I don't want to see them kill people faster or go through rooms faster or have more health, I want them to damage rooms that they pass through so that you need to repair them after, I want them to feel like a threat. What I don't want them to be is something that destroys everything I've been working for and then return after 2 minutes with new friends. I want to have consequences for not killing them all off, in terms of much faster return, for example in a day instead of 2 days, I want the radio brodcast to actually make a difference on how often they show up. Oh did I mention that I don't even have a radio studio since I DIDN'T WANT THREE DEATH CLAW ATTACKS IN A ROW!!!! But now I see that radio studio can only spawn an event of death claw attacks, but obviously doesn't actually infuence the frequency of them... Now it feels like deathclaws are like stronger raiders in the wasteland.. Which I think we fallout fans all know is not the case. 

P.s. I'm sure this review will never reach many eyes and it's even less likely that bethesda will see it but it's healthy to vent once in a while.

P.p.s. Wtf are these power armors it gives me 2 strength and 1 perception? Are you high? Some camaflaged rags give me 7 strength but a mother freakin POWER ARMOR a LEGENDARY drop gives me less than a few slightly polished battle metal plates. Also water energy food and common garbage in a box I paid nearly an euro for? Legendary trash junk is fine if I can use it in the future for some good gear but other trash is a no no. Also weapons of no less than 6 dmg. And these boxes I pay for better be in my whole playthroughs not just that particular one save that I bought them in, there can even be 2 types of items 0.5euro boxes for a single play through and 1euro box for all your playthroughs I don't care. Balance your shit out or I will never pay you a dime ever again. I will even one up that one for yah, if you don't stop treating gaming community as money bags for you to exploit and start giving a fuck I will make sure to point out all the flaws on any of the games you work on even before they come out, over eight years of fanatic experience in game design philosophy and psychology gives me that ability."
19970,10/10 dwellers will fuck
19971,"It's really bad port.

The game hangs when I try to do the first assignment. Anyway, there are flashes, glitches and the game itself seems to expect you to have a gamepad with no customization options.

Maybe they'll make a large patch - until then, don't bother your bandwith."
19972,Nice game. a lillte slow in the beginning but its a lot of fun =D
19973,"A game like this minus all the mobile game stuff would be an awesome game. Don't get me wrong, it's a kinda okay port from mobile to PC but not good enough. It's sometimes frustrating trying to click on something that is behind another element.

The game has a LOT of content and missions. Rotating missions are available daily and weekly too.

If the game had all the time gates and need-to-click-to-get-resource from room stuff removed it would be on par with something like Prison Architect or Rebuild 2."
19974,I would give this game thumbs up :D For free game it's actually pretty nice
19975,"This is horrible. I don't even know what the gameplay is like, I couldn't play through tutorial even :|
The port quality is abismal. First thing is the flicker. Just moving the mouse around makes the UI flicker like mad. Then the UI is not responding well to mouse drag, the mouse drop events are not registered properly when you are assigning dwellers to posts. The screen scrolling is bad and the tutorial is referencing controlls that are clearly not mouse and keyboard and all you can do is experimenting to see what they are talking about = hitting the keyboard until something works.

And top of it all it crashed twice in like 20 minutes...

I love the Fallout settings, but there is a limit how much torture I can take for it, and this is waaaay past my threshold.

Call me back if you fix it."
19976,Very nice and fun game to play if you've played fallout games before and ur a fan but if not you might not enjoy this game as much.
19977,"Great mobile port, Run wells and is great for passing time"
19978,Addicting af game
19979,"A great game to play in the background while you're doing an assignment or playing another game....OR WAITING FOR PREMEIRE PRO TO RENDER!!!!

It's a good time waster just don't expect much to happen"
19980,Awesome game I like it.
19981,"It is a joke of a game. No gameplay whatsoever. If you wanted and waited it to be released on a PC - that was wrong. It's a strictly mobile donate-based game with no redeeming qualities except for being ""free"" and Fallout-themed, probably. If you value your time - don't try it. It's just like any other mobile game there is.

It cannot be played on a second display properly. If you try to put it there and expand - it will move back to primary display. Even if you try to resize it whilst it is on your secondary (tertiary etc) it will move back so you won't enjoy the experience of 
Other mandatory mobile port issues.

TL;DR: It's not a game."
19982,"If you're reading reviews for a free game with a <300mb download size, you have got problems"
19983,"One of the best Mobile to PC ports, also quite good to mod, so gets a thumbs up form me"
19984,The game wont open it just loads for etenrity
19985,"I've nothing bad to say about this game. Better than Fallout 4, that's for sure. And it's free. Try it out."
19986,"Generally good game

Pros:
- Easy to understand
- Not much skill required
- Easy to run

Cons
- The incident chance when rushing is often incorrect (It always fails way more than it should)
- Gets boring quickly
- Gtes much harder to play if you dont want to pay"
19987,"Buggy Port with questionable content and no signs of fun detected.
Save your money - get a sugarfree soda !"
19988,"This is probably the best mobile game out there. As long as you've enjoyed web games where you had to wait for resources and quests. Having it on Steam makes it the perfect game to just relax and play while you're doing nothing. Also, it's perfect for those who have crappy cellphones and were not able to play this gem on theirs. 
Starting it goes slow, but once you start to build a few rooms and have dwellers to spare, you can start doing missions or just send some of them to explore the wastelands. 

5/7 :p"
19989,"Seriously I usually wouldn't think Bethesda to be able to make anything worthwhile, but this game has definitely stolen my heart.

They must've had a rare insight.

This game is like Fallout Tactics (OBVIOUSLY) and Sims.

Keep up the good work."
19990,"This game is very nice, I like how it dosen't have over rated system requirements even though i have a 1050ti but it's good for people who need a game that's not to demanding and it's free."
19991,"I purchased the starter pack and the game bugged and reset my vault the next day making it so I can not use the pack. Steam refused my refund request  because ""We cannot grant a refund at this time. In-game item purchases are not refundable if any items in the purchase have been consumed, modified, or transferred.""

I highly advice that you do not spend any money on this game as it is buggy and you will not get your money back even if you only had access to the content for half an hour"
19992,"absolute fucking dumpster game ive never seen such a turd tried to be marketed as a game
equivalent to fucking staring at a wall simulator
all the reviews point to how simple and easy it is to navigate because its designed to appeal to 3-4 year olds with no mental capacity"
19993,I liked it 7.5/10
19994,"18% chance of failure? Lets rush, failed? How tf"
19995,MEGA GOLEMQ KEF :D
19996,"All the other reviews are correct - this is a port off the mobile version from google play stores, and that means yes, this is techincally a mobile game first, but it works well on pc.

This isn't a game where you sit there all hours of the day doing stuff. You aren't suppost to complete the game in one sitting. It gives you timers, and the game more or less allows time to pass even when you aren't sitting there playing. It's a game where you can have your little valt dwellers breed, and then close the game down and do stuff you need to do or play another game, and then you can open it up again and see that your baby is ready to be born. 

All in all, it's a fun game, just a very very slow one. Cheers!"
19997,I LOVE IT
19998,"This game comes highly recommended on *mobile*! Here's a review of the PC version:

MAIN CON: This game is designed for a mobile experience, through and through. It's a game you start up, play for a little while to manage things, and then set aside to let more things happen. Meaning, if you approach it like a regular PC game, you're going to spend a lot of time just waiting for things to happen. Or buy stuff for real money to make them happen faster.

OTHER CONS:
- Controls manage to be almost just as annoying on PC as they are on mobile.
- UI is same as before, designed for mobile, which means it feel really big, clunky and unpolished.

PROS:
+ I still can't put it the feck down.

DISCLAIMER: There are some features that are new to the PC version, which I haven't unlocked yet, like quests and crafting. I'll edit this if those things change my mind about the game.

CONCLUSION: Please do play this on mobile! Although the controls can be a little frustrating, everything else about it is great, and it's super addictive. Works really well to play in short intervals, before work, on the bus, on breaks, etc."
19999,"Its pretty great game. however this is free2play. And i love as much as i play in my android.
Be a great Overseer and rule the world !. umm i mean, rule the Vault !.
#War_WarNeverChanges"
20000,"basically THE SIMS, fallout edition...
buggy and confusing
tutorial needs improvement
UI and menu is complicated"
20001,"A very casual idle game made to promote Fallout 4 before its launch.

In that regard, even though it has micro-transactions, they are completely optional. Anything and everything in the cash shop is earnable in the game. Its only purpose is to speed up game progression.

Even though it was made as a promotional gimmick, it's actually a very addictive, solid base-building game with a good assortment of unlockable underground room types that you can design and lay out any way you choose, goals, crafting, group missions, solo missions, base defense, character stat-building and level-ups, rare loot drops, character enhancements via assignable pets, and more.

All that and it's free to play to boot, with nothing locked exclusively away behind pay-walls. Definitely a thumbs up. Well-designed, totally free to play, and solid, addictive gameplay."
20002,"So yea this is a fantastic game. But if your hardware fails and your computer has to turn off while you have your save open say good bye to all the hours you put into it. If your fine with wasting hours and hours of time in a save then ignore the rest of this review but other than that keep reading.

Alright FUCK THIS FUCKING GAME.

I put 35+ hours into a vault that I roleplayed the shit out of every day since it came out. I spent hours and hours training my dwellers that I named and gave my dwellers weapons and customized the shit out of ALL FUCKING GONE. MY graphics card froze cos its a piece of shit and what happens when I turn my pc to play this game that I devoted and planed to devote so many more hours into? MY VAULT GONE. Oh but surely there is a back up file for your vaults angry person typing a angry review? Yes! But guess the fuck what? IT DOESNT MATTER. THE BACK UP FILE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU TRY TO RESTORE DOES SWEET FUCK ALL. Good bye one of my fav mobile games and now after a long time of waiting pc game. What a fucking waste. My gpu freezes so you delete my save? What the actual fuck were they thinking? Even with my shitty old laptop that frooze ALL the time during game sessions NEVER did this on other games. 

SORT YOUR SHIT OUT BETHESDA. FIX YOUR SHIT FFS. IM NOT EVER TOUCHING ONE OF YOUR FUCKING GAMES THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A STUPID SHIT CODING LIKE THIS. YOU CANT EVEN CODE YOUR BKP FILES RIGHT YOU LAZY MOTHER FUCKERS.

Sincerely - Fuck you."
20003,"10/10 

This game will destroy almost all of your chromsones , and teach you the ways of inbreeding , so that you can be the inbreed master"
20004,The best of Digital Ant Farm and Post Apocalyptic survival.
20005,10/10 loved it
20006,I really like the game specially the tweaks and it's so easy to navigate
20007,"PC Port of a mobile game: usually I hate these types of things but Fallout Shelter is an exception. It improved upon the mobile version. The rng (Raider attacks for example) seems more balanced and now I have precision controls which were my only real gripes with the mobile version in all honesty...
Since this game is Free-To-Play, the microtransactions (as always) are present to snare the idiots who impulse buy, but you don't need them to ""win"" so don't buy into those and you'll be fine. If you do, just know that they do NOT carry over to your next game. Gameover = money wasted. There isn't really any ""gameplay"" to talk about since it's basically just about you as The Overseer of your own vault managing it's resources. Vault Dwellers being the most important resource of course, LOL. It's more or less an idle-game, Clicker Heroes being a good example of what I mean. Start it up while you listen to some music, read something, chill out and have a beer, ect...

All and all if you want a F2P resource managment game you can play to relax a bit after work/school or before bed, this is one that I'd highly recommend. Plus it's set in the Fallout universe. What's not to love?"
20008,Meh?  Just add Workshop to it i guess..
20009,Good
20010,"Ok, let's be clear, it's a game from the mobile world so its model is entirely based on micropayments. Problem is that you CAN'T play decently without paying. If you decide to not buy anything, then you'll have nothing to do, the game stalls.

Worst, it's still active even when you log off. So either you constantly paying to play more, or you lose all what you did after a couple of hours.

It could have been a good game but it's not. And from Bethesda, I can't even say I'm surprised, they're very efficient to ruin anything they do since many years."
20011,"Really that was nice  game !!! 

i play this game every day"
20012,Great game
20013,great and funny mini game
20014,really good game
20015,"With all these negative reviews i'm seeing right now why don't we appreciate the greatness of this mobile game that just adapted to PC and putted on steam.

But tbh to have a good/better experience I prefer to play the mobile game instead of PC.

(Oh don't mind the cons here)
Why? for F2P this is really tiring for end/late-game clicking all those rooms with no mr.handys (since i'm an f2p player i don't pay for lunchboxes), dragging the dwellers in the rooms 1 by 1. BUT we have some features that mobiles don't have so it's just quits between the two.

Well it doesn't matter if you enjoy this in PC right?

"
20016,"If yuo have played the mobile version, this has absolute 0 difference.. Go play the mobile version instead of this one since the PC version lacks mobility and flexibilty in opening the game which is quite essential to this type of game (Espcecially for F2P players)

Also save file from Mobile Version cannot be shared to the PC version.. which is a shame."
20017,I really recomend this game especially if you are trying to make time pass. You can open it up do your stuff and check on your vault and the dwellers. Then tab out and go watch some videos or go play something else. I have it on the phone and the pc. Love this game for what it is.
20018,Everything was going good then a mole rat showed up and was literaly unkillabe so now like 2 hours of progress is gone and everyone is dead. This game is dumb.
20019,"Another poorly designed iphone game ported to PC. After the first half hour of play, you sit around and wait for something to happen. Then you get bored and frustrated so you gamble on rushing, which uses XCOM rules to determine if you succeed. (I.E. If it says 40% chance to fail, it's more like 90%) When everything finally goes tits-up, including half your population, the game waves it's microtransactions in your face reminding you that real money will fix everything. On top of that the best way to play the game is to not play it. The game practically plays itself and disasters only happen when you're micromanaging.

Slow, boring, frustrating and stupid. Basically another hamfisted cash-in to sell microtransactions.

Don't waste your time and especially don't waste your money."
20020,Its a cool game thou but the game has a lot of bugs
20021,I have been played for 1 hour and so far this game told me about how to became a good leader for your own fault.
20022,"Well, it was addictive at first, but you never can gain enough water, food, or energy to be able to do anything else. Also, just as you think you can do something else, raiders break in or mole rats attack or fires break out, etc., etc., etc. And the quests are a joke! You can't quit halfway through it or you lose everything you have earned! Also, while you're on the quest nothing gets done at the vault so your ""behind the eight ball"" when you return. And the ghost that appears is so camoflaged you can rarely catch him. All in all, really a frustrating game. I would definitely not buy it unless there are a lot of improvements!"
20023,"When I started playing fallout i really wished for more vault time. Well I got it!  My dreams came true of being the Overseer and punishing those that I just can't make happy. (My personal GO GET 'EM team. Win or don't come home!) 
Yes i'm addicted and play both on mobile and now steam. Who says an Overseer can't multi-task and have a side job."
20024,"Freemium. The ""mium"" is Latin for ""not really"".

Minister of Mobile Gaming: And so in conclusion, the successful freemium game is based on five principles: Entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing cashings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency...

Prince of Canada: So they'll forget they're spending money.

Minister of Mobile Gaming: ...and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.

Phillip: We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it - just at least be fun?

Minister of Mobile Gaming: No no! It has to be just barely fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun."

20026,"Died 10 hours (excluding sleep time) into my save with everyone geared with rare armor/weapons that deals 5 damage or more, 1 radroach attack spawned in my empty storage room in my vault and instantly spread everywhere killing everyone.

Why did they put this on Steam if they didn't even update it from when it came out 2 years ago. Sure the quest system is cool but being in a quest longer than 15 minutes makes it so when you come back everything happened in almost real time, that means there will be a mass shortage of power, water and food, basically also killing everyone.

Im dissapointed Bethesda, I love your Fallout games, but this was just retarded, I don't know why you don't just hire some real people for Fallout Shitter instead of some monkeys that have autism and don't understand what ""fun"" is.

2/10, the 2 coming from quests being semi bareable/fun.

Edit: Decided to log back in to see if I could save my vault, ended up logging in to having around 20 babies that couldn't be born because of my dweller limit, aaaaand a triple deathclaw trio turned up at my fuckin door, so yeah, no thanks."
20027,"I'm actually really enjoying this and it's why I'm kinda torn with this review. I'm a huge Fallout fan, coming up to 30 and followed the games all the way from the first. I'll likely continue to play only for a short while though -

Fallout Shelter could have been so much more. I'm not sure what went wrong at Bethesda, because there's a real gem game hiding underneath the monetisation.
It's such a lovely, charming game. The artwork is brilliant, the audio is fantastic, and I like how much you can customise different aspects of your vault. I like that you send your dwellers out into the wastelands, and the logs they record while they're doing it. I played on release on ios as well, but in all honesty it didn't last very long.

The game is weighed down by microtransactions. I wholeheartedly believe that if this was treated like the single player game it is instead of parroting that crappy model that countless games on the mobile stores follow, if the wait timers were divided by 10 and all of this stupid quantum cola stuff was removed altogether, if questing was fleshed out somewhat and timers were reworked to timers in the range of 1-3 hours, long enough to put down but quick enough to ride through if you kept yourself distracted,  if you had slapped a ¬£17.99 price tag on the front of it, I'd imagine it'd have sold like hot cakes and the reviews would be immeasurably in your favour. You could have added card expansions in the form of paid DLC if you really were looking to squeeze a bit extra and it would have raised a lot less eyebrows.

If you had slapped it on the ios store like that at ¬£9.99, it would have sat at the top of different mobile site's top charts for years to come. There's very little in the way of deep strategy games on mobile without in app purchases, this probably would have made a mint done the right way with integrity, instead of taking this trashy route that only serves to annoy people into paying money. A Fallout themed strategy game with  no iap that cross synced between my PC and my iPhone? It'd feel like Christmas.

I'd like to imagine that many of the designers were not on board with any of the monetisation stuff and I'd like to believe there's probably a few guys out there that wanted to do something entirely different but had to keep the bosses happy. I feel like this is a good example of what happens when the quest for money interferes too much with a player's experience. You pick these designers up because they are talented people who are passionate about their work and art, let them do their jobs properly!

Bethesda in my eyes is respectable when I compare them to other companys in the industry. Get off this road, it leads to ruin. And from a fan's perspective, Fallout deserves better than a honey trap. Shame on you, Bethesda. >:(


The jist of my review is that the content is fantastic, I can't fault it. The problem is the way it's served is questionable and why I have not recommended it. Fallout is a flagship title and holds weight in regards to normalising IAPs in the PC gaming marketplace, and said games are more often than not shady, anyone who is familiar with mobile gaming will understand what I mean. Their design makes it easy to irresponsibly mine money from people in an irresponsible way, and I fear that this title will help make it easier for this price model to become commonplace.


Cont-
So why would you use the microtransaction model? As others have touched on in the comments, part of the reason is that it makes more money, particularly by badgering players into spending small amounts a lot of times to make it harder to recognise the value of things. It's a deceptive price model and the majority of the reason I didn't recommend the game is because I see a brilliant game underneath a model that is unhealthy for the industry.

There's a perfectly reasonable arguement that places the responsibility entirely in the hands of the person spending, and I believe the majority of people who thumbs up or downed me are probably divided specifically on how they view that. Is it the responsibility of the designer or the player? I'd argue it was both and I'm not one to complain incessently about games, but this kind of price model is notorious for going after what you call ""whales"", and I just think it's in bad taste. 

It's not where I want to see PC gaming go, and in my opinion it's dishonest game design and irresponsible because the majority of income from this game will come from players on both extremes, the ones with oil baron parents and addictive personalities or ""low hanging fruit"". I work in mental health and these kinds of games can end up pretty much robbing vulnerable people, where the model is most effective. You could quite literally lop the microtransactions off this beautiful game, readjust the timers to compensate, and have an honest title at a set price."
20028,"good game, an exact copy of the mobile one. One thing though, I want to transfer all my data from my phone to the pc...wish there was a online website where you can make an account and save progress from there. From there you can transfer your progress into the pc. If this is possible, please let me know! I really am going to get bored if I have to start all over again. Can you also put a pause button where you can pause and plan out your base. I want this because everytime I edit my base I forget about things which ultimatley (sorry can't spell) screwes my game up and I have to fix it. But in all, I still love this game."
20029,"The only game where incest can happen with no consequences.

20034,"Better than Fallout 4.

Select one male for breeding, name him Dirk Diggler. Continually have him sleep with every female and soon enough your glorious vault will be full of little Digglers.

[spoiler]#moist[/spoiler]"
20036,"This is a terrible game to be on steam, after you quit the game, the game runs in the background, this means on steam it is still counted as running, this means, you can't quit steam or play other games unless you unplug or end the steam process. Both is bad, also don't use real money on this game, the stuff you buy is placed into a safe file in your computer, so if you delete or lost it, it is gone forvever."
20037,Best played on mobile but your battery will get raped by it so It is good steam added it here
20038,"fun, BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE NEW BASES!!"
20039,"I get why people don't like it for the most part.  It really is a mobile game because of the waiting and it isn't a click-fest so people aren't enjoying it because instead of watching resources build infinitely while they click like monkeys having seizures located primarily in their fingers, it's a slower-paced game where resources build over time. 

I see people whining about having their money ""stolen"", although that would mean the game is taking money from them without their permission which is just a lie.  You don't get anything stolen, you choose to pay for items in a F2P game on Steam.  I'm not sure why these people are lashing out at someone else for something they clearly chose to do, but in either case it's just a lie.  I don't care if purchases don't carry over to a new vault (how many do you need, did you screw up that badly, that many times?) especially for a game that doesn't need *any* item to actually be bought in the first place.  You wanna toss a tip to the devs and buy a box or pet or bot?  Ok, it's your money to toss.  But don't buy something then turn around and scream they stole your money.  It's pathetic.

Graphics are fine, it's a pretty fun game to play while drinking a cup of coffee and reading something or watching a video on the side.  ""Sing"" & ""Fantastic Beasts"" just came out, I'd suggest either of those I think they were very good.

Good game, good resource management means you need to do some actual thinking, or you could buy something to make it a little easier.  Or you could do the daily quest things and get caps & boxes for free like most people."
20040,YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSSS.  ITS FINALY ON STEAM!!!!!!!!!

20046,e c k s d e e
20047,Great game! Its a good escape from reality to help relax stress and make you feel in controll!
20048,"There should be an option to sync the progress in phone to steam version and vice versa, I dont want to start all over again. i am very deep down on the mobile version, please make it work. Dont recommend it as of now.

Update: I just did what AWalkingTizzle said, it worked."
20049,"so fun and i happy that they put phone games on steam now i guess, its a good game 100%"
20050,"Pros:
+True to the Fallout theme
+The late game seems to have potential

Cons:
---Progress is VERY slow paced
---A bad RNG murders the fun factor
--Large room incidents in early game last too long
-Only way to pause is to exit the game

Recommend avoiding if you're not a gambler who likes idle/slow games.

And DON'T spend money on lunchboxes, they'll be lost if you start a different vault or the vault file you bought them for is lost."
20051,ANOTHER FUCKING FACEBOOK GAME ON STEAM. VALVE YOU FUCKING SELLOUTS. EAT SHIT AND BATH IN CAUSTIC SODA.
20052,Play it if you want who cares jusat have to wait for people to do stuff for free
20053,"I was disappointed after an excellent presentation on the Store page to find that navigation, even early in the tutorial, was a puzzle in itself, involving console commands and responding in part to a joystick.  My computer hung about 1 minute in... to the tutorial.  Other negative reviews suggested that the game was not well designed for Windows systems.  Now I understand."
20054,The best free-to-play game out there !
20055,good
20056,"3/5  fun game but gets boring aftert a bit
"
20057,"This game is actually really good. There are tons of things to do and while there aren't really any specific goals for a while, the game just starts to get very addictive. You can do something like 50 different quests that take forever to get your dwellers to travel to, but they reward very well. The game has immense depth in how much you can do, as in how much you can explore, build, and so forth.

The problem with this game is that while there are microtransactions (because this is a mobile game ported to PC) you can lose your save file, and therefore lose the microtransactions. Not only is that bad but there are no backup save files so if you work on your amazing vault by: having dozens of dwellers exploring the wastes and questing, the entire female population impregnated, and completing tons of objectives, if your game crashes in the middle of an auto-save, it's all gone. Played for 10 hours in the 3 days and lost it all cause I crashed GG

TL;DR BACKUP YOUR SAVE THE GAME DOESN'T DO IT FOR YOU!!!"
20058,"Switching to resolution 1024x576 failed, trying lower one
All resolution switches have failed
Screen: could not switch resolution (1024x576 fs=0 hz=0)
FIX IT!! NOW!!!"
20059,you must try this game
20060,"An app put on the steam done right this time

good job steam

you actually chose a really good mobile app to put on steam that isnt a clash of clans rip off :P

and also its really fun and doesnt throw pay walls at you :P"
20061,"This game is pretty cool. I like the easy controls, the simple objective, and the design. 10/10 IGN would FallOut again. :D"
20062,its free...
20063,"Fallout Shelter is the best f2p mobile game ported to pc, this pc version its definitely more comfortable than the mobile version. For me it's better this way, because I no longer have to spend my phone battery to play.Including that the mechanics and loadings in this Steam version are more improved than in the mobile version."
20064,"The hitbox for characters is off, which during tense base defense means 2-3 (sometimes MORE!!!) click and drags to get someone to change rooms to avoid death or save another. It's really poor quality play, and very annoying.

-click right on cappy, the vaulter behind him is selected.
-click to level a person, it selects them and does not level them.
-highlight and click to select a unit, the room is selected not them.
-highlight click and hold to drag a person, no the background is being held and manuvered.
-another cappy that was impossible to click on, I was hammering it all over.
-Had to hammer a bottle all over to get it to target and ended up spending a nukacola on a vaulter to get one back.

Because of this I can barely recommend this title, it's fun and free until they F you over for control of your guys during an emergency, then it's just another free piece of S that dont play right."
20065,"I dunno why u guyz are complaining about this game. After almost 1h in this game, i realised that isn't THAT bad. Of course, it's a new type of game, but if you start playing this one and also keep playing, you will see that this game is very good. I am not sure, i heard that the game was p2p before, but now it's free for all damn peoaple. I believe it's not a short game, after i saw the achievements. It's getting interesting minute after minute. I recommend you this one, for a relaxing session of gaming. 

My finale rate is : 7.5/10"
20066,"Well its definitely more comfortable than the mobile version. loading times are way shorter and it fits better on the screen if you have a big vault. its somehow not very optimized vor pc especially regarding controls and settings but i also had minor graphical bugs as well.

The Game itself is the typical freemium wait or pay formula. except that its a little bit less worse than most other of these games. There are more things to do and you will most likely unlock a lot by just playing. The Gameplay Mechanics are nothing new but it has some enhancements like taking you to mission areas that look different to gather loot. I think the fallout universe fits very well for this type of game. There are plenty of items, places and other things you know from fallout that give the game some depth.

So if *chi-ching* slotmachine sounds let you have the pleasure of achieving something in a videogame this is the game for you."
20067,"FUN

and not to in you're face about paying for extra stuff :D"
20068,"Can I get a refund for a free game?

I expected a fun Sim-Tower-esque game in a Fallout theme. Fallout Shelter is almost exactly that...
just not fun."
20069,Really fun game EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY
20070,"Cute little game.  Its slow, but interesting.  Also worth noting, the game seems to assume some passage of time even when it wasn't running.

BUT I hate the way they do ""micro""transactions...they're far too expensive considering you only get to use them once and it's gone.  Sure, maybe buy a lunchbox because that one time you really want to start out with good stuff...but $20???

So...I recommend the game since its certainly worth the price, and maybe even the price of a lunchbox or two if you want to support the work.   But I really don't recommend buying stuff for the game."
20071,"If you using your smartphone or tablet, download it. Waiting is a little bit sleepy for me."
20072,"If you like Fallout, then you will like this game"
20073,Absolutely amazing free game! So Impressed!!
20074,Fun little game .
20075,"Please fix ""GetThreadContext"" 

other than that the game was pretty fun"
20076,"(This is a complete redo of this review)
I have played this much much much longer on my xbox one soooo I""ll be talking (more like typeing and you people reading) from the experiences I've had from that version.

There are multiple issuses with this game. Which I will be talking (i need to say typeing about) about in seperet sections since I have alot of hours on the xbox one version.

Issue number 1.) Your starting people are so weak and pathetic that you will have a hard time keeping your needs up at the beginning. I HAD TO pay for lunchboxes (loot boxes) in order to keep my needs up or i would have lost. You have to reach a certain point in the game to lvl your people up in the required S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats for each different rooms. For example you will be given people with HORRENDOUS stats for the begining rooms (which are the life blood of your vault) Power, Water filtraion, and Dinner. Which need Strength, Perception, and Agility. Even if you have more people in the room (you can build more of the same room next to each other to merge into a bigger room) the time to make the resource increasses with the size of the room.

Issue number 2.) Like i stated in issue number 1, you must pay for lunch boxes in even an attempt to keep your vault up in early game. Since you need 6 rooms at the begining of the game. Bedrooms, Water purifire, Power generation, Dinner, Med bay (stimpacks), Science lab (Rad away). Each needing power, so in your mind you make a bigger power room to have more power income. Tho in the same time you need more food and water production for all the new power workers. Which needs even more power so you go into a spiral which drains your power. (but when you can train a specific S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat this dosent become a problem)

Issue number 3.) The production of recourses are WAY TO SLOW in the early game, but in the later game once you have trained people in the ""right room"" (games words not mine) this dosent become a problem. However, the training time takes little time in the early game but becomes way to long in the later game when you have people high lvl in the S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat that you need. 

Issue number 4.) If you have weak people exploring the wastland you WILL have to babysit the person. You will have to know what the stats do in this game to even be good. Fully lvled Dwellers will have a VERY clear advanteg than you begining Dwellers. (Endurance will increase the HP of the Dweller EVERY LVL UP so you will need to train this at lvl 1 to be usefull.).

Issue number 5.) The clothes have a very different point in this game than the other fallouts. In here the clothes just increase your Dwellers S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats, but not increase you Dwellers defence and damage resistance. Unlike in other fallout games the either do increase your stats, Damage resistance, or will do both. So at lvl 10 stats on you Dwellers they become just cosmetics.

Issue number 6.) The dwellers cant reproduce with family members. (know your asking why is this an issuse) This is an issuse do to there being no way to keep track with the family trees when you have 100+ dwellers in your vault. (unless you write down every name and who reproduced with who, and who had whos baby. Which you probly wont do.)"
20077,games fun and addicting also as a plus its not pay to win like I thought
20078,"Nice game, I played it a lot on a tablet."
20079,A good time waster.
20080,I'd recommand this game
20081,"I need a Linux version... (Android is Linux so, why no Linux version?)"
20082,"Played for 10 hours. Lost most of my progress cuz of a major attack by mole rats.

10 hours/10

In all seriousness, it's an amazing game. I played for 15 more hours after I originally wrote this comment, and I rebuilt my vault better than ever. Check it out if you have the time, there is minimal pay to win."
20083,This is a brillant game and makes you want to play more every minute. This is a must get game.
20084,"This game is grate time killer, but the graphics could be upgraded from the mobile version."
20085,"Really good Idle game. Doesn't ram Micro- transactions down your throat like most games. You really dont have to spend money on it either, unless you are super SUPER lazy."
20086,Nice game !
20087,"Fallout Shelter is a spin-off 'Fallout' game that delves into the 'mobile gaming' genre. Usually these mobile games communicate whether you should be playing a lot online or leaving it to run offline, and this one can't really decide.

For a Steam port, I expected a graphical upgrade since you can really see these textures up-close, and they are pretty reminiscent of N64 games. The UI overall is actually pretty poor, I find myself struggling to put people in the right places and to pick up things on quests because the spaces are so tight and crowded. There isn't a lot of organization either, there should be some sort of family tree categorization as well as organization by chronological appearance. To use every single 'dweller' to the perfect advantage would actually require studying because of the annoying options here. There should be an option to see every weapon and outfit even if it is held by the characters.

Quests are actually fun enough despite the idea being so bland. Combat does feel slow though, and like there should be more interaction. I feel like this game would be very fitting for some strategic combat. 

There is a pretty good variety of outfits and weapons wielding different stats as well as different rooms to use and some good humor as well. For a free game I can't complain, but for a free game that has been out for a while and obviously still containing issues like these I'm not really impressed. I look forward to future updates if there are any, in hopes of these small issues being fixed."
20088,"It's great for a multi-tasker like me. I need to do other things while I do stuff like homework or draw, and this helps immensely with that. Fun little game, but not over-the-top. ^^"
20089,Mr. Antifun...google it
20090,Works okay for the first hour or so and then things get really really REALLY slow.. So slow and annoying that it makes me think they WANT us to buy helpers with real money so we can go on..
20091,Fantastic!
20092,gay
20093,Casual real-time management sim based on the fallout universe. perfect for running in the background while catching up on homework
20094,"Strong 7/10

Here's why:
1. Its a fun time killer, basically just the app which was great to begin with. Great to have running while doing other things.
2. The paid content doesn't make or break the game, just some fun stuff and you have a chance to get enough of the boxes and other stuff in game if you just play for a while.
3. Quests are interesting, but combat is really lackluster. Probably worked really great for a mobile app but on PC, eh. Maybe if SPECIAL affected it (which if it does, its not explained how) it would add some more strategy to it other than just have a bigger gun which the previously mentioned paid content can let you cheese it.
4. It is unclear how involved the developers are with continuing to update and provide content for this game, there's a very good chance the port is just way to widen the audience to make more $$$
5. There isn't currently a way for the app and the PC version to interact with each other and as stated in #4, that doesn't look like its going to change. If it does, then a solid 8/10 for this."
20095,nice
20096,"A very fun time waster. Just wish that there were more items, ideas and things to do"
20097,It could've been a nice game if it wasn't freemium.
20098,I owed AT&T a lot of money because of this game once
20099,"Entretenido y divertido hasta que llegas a tener todo y no puedes conseguir el √∫ltimo logro. ¬øPor qu√©? Simplemente porque tienes que pagar o jugar much√≠simas horas e ir abriendo tarteras farmeadas en las misiones. Calculo que unas 1000 horas para conseguir todos los mu√±equitos legendarios.
Lo recomiendo hasta que consigas todo los desbloqueos dentro del juego y tengas un refugio estable. NO lo recomiendo si vas buscando todos los logros.
NO hace falta comprar nada para poder tener todo lo del juego. (Menos los legendarios)
"
20100,"Unless your vault dies, this game has no ending, and thats great; this game is a fun, ""Time-waster"".

Don't pay attention to the negative reviews, this is a recource management game, that takes time, its not an instant kinda thing, you'll notice most negative reviews for the game are by ADHD filled autists, who have pretty much never actually played a Fallout game, that isn't just Fallout 4, and are also pretty shit at the game, and after a couple of hours of playing, got their vault fugged up for having a shitty set up, then just decided to rage quit, then write a negative review.

I haven't used microtransactions yet, and my vault is pretty small, but its fun as hell, and exactly what I need at this moment in time; I'd say this game is currently a 10/10 for me, and I haven't yet hit a road block to change my opinion."
20101,"I played this ga,e 2-3 days so far and already I can't stand. You can't leave for 4 hours nevermind sleep for 8 hours or go to work because they start starving and nothing is collected without a collect bot which you have to pay for. After coming back catching up becomes too dradful and the game becomes not enjoyable at all anymore. As much as I tried giving it a try, it is such a time waster and if you want to stay on top of the game you have to be on it 24/7. If you don't like sleeping adn you don't need to work maybe this game is for you. Otherwsie save yourself the trouble."
20102,Addicting game.
20103,Drag Albert White & Andrea Robinson to the living quarters and they have a baby. Damn I love this game
20104,No
20105,"Awesome game,I like this game I play phone game 860h.

Greate-pc
Greate-Phone"
20106,Great game for free. Much better on steam than on ios or google play. I highly recommend this game!
20107,"It crash.. and crash
It crash and crash and crash
crash, crash, crash... crash, crash, crash
The big Bethesda crashing show!!!

Same user [strike]torture[/strike] experience I had on Android"
20108,:O Finally on PC and it's perfect
20109,"This game is free. It is a mobile port. It has microtransactions. It is a waiting simulator. It is singleplayer. Graphics are cartoony.

It is literally just a free, micro-managing, waiting game that you check in on once in a while. That's it. That's ALL it is. Whether you prefer to do this inbetween other obligations while working on your PC, or simply once or twice throughout the day, or even every other day. 

Fallout Shelter just puts you into the propaganda-style Vault introduced in the Fallout series, it has good humor, and it is interesting enough for a free game to warrant my recommendation.

And to all of the people who passionately dislike this game. It's still Fallout, maybe not an open world shooter. This is not a game you are supposed to rush. It is not a game you are supposed to ""win"". It does have microtransactions, but you can earn those readily ingame as well, without paying. All those negative reviews bitching about these various non-sensical issues are just trash. 

The game has good humor, it is very relaxing to watch your dwellers do whatever they do, and frankly since its release on mobile platforms, it has come a long way with a lot of updates and new features. For a FREE game, it is absolutely recommendable. But buyer beware I guess, if you are an elitist moron who thinks you HAVE to rush through the game and ""win"", then you probably will not enjoy it."
20110," I have played Android Version before 

Thanks for make PC Version

Thanks alot for make it free to play <3"
20111,Pretty gud
20112,Wonderful little game very good at wasting time and having alot of fun while doing it. its alittle slow but still super fun ;D and can get really intense out of thin air.
20113,It has a selective breeding mechanic.
20114,Not The Best but it's great !
20115,Cool game. easy to lern but its a lot of waiting.
20116,za4em?
20117,i have this game on my ipad and it was glitchy so i figured out why you all putted it on pc:so it wont be glitchy that way ehtier way i still think fallout is awesome!8949/over 9000!!!!get it?
20118,A fun port from Iphone and Android Devices very fun!
20119,Its like an ant farm but with humans.
20120,Good Game
20121,"If you dont feel like playing any specific game, this is the game for you, just dont spend real money pls"
20122,The only fallout game where raiders can blow up vault doors and deathclaws have the ability to raid your vault resources...
20123,"The game is one that was on phone, now they have published it on Steam. but overall it's good."
20124,"We'll hear Todd Howard's lies again, 10/10 best game."
20125,"It's the mobile game for pc. 

What are you expecting.

One monitor movies, second monitor shelter. Just relax and enjoy :3:"
20126,Game defaults to Xbox controlls and has no option of changing them. and refuses to work properly with the keyboard and mouse.
20127,"Been playing Fallout Shelter recently using the Windows 10 Store version and it freezes randomly and repeatedly during play, you don't lose anything but it's infuriating. Just switched to this Steam version (v1.11) and haven't had a single freeze-up yet. Even managed to transfer my saved vaults across and continue playing them too.

I wish it wasn't so addictive but at least this version is stable!
"
20128,"Fun little time waster while you're waiting for something to download in the background. As with pretty much all other Bethesda games, there's some pretty nasty bugs though.

Don't take my word for it, it's free so why not get it if you're already bothering to read reviews about it."
20129,GOOD GAME!!!
20130,"Nah, doesn't work in a PC game. They didn't add anything to the game, meaning you need to wait for hours(real time)."
20131,... because the main goal of this game is to copulate :D
20132,"Don't spend money on the game. Don't do it!
It's not worth it because it is mostly a hype companion for Fallout 4 which has now found its way to the PC. Originally a mobile only title to play along riding to work on the bus or checking on the toilet every once in a while it is a fun game. You surely can spend money on it but it won't get you anything other than a few in game boosts. It's the common formula for 95% of all browser games and a thing I hate about gaming.

Why do I still recommend the game? Because it is fun, dammit! It's not as slow as many browser games are  (deliberately) and it can be played without the need for any registration and consequent spam. It doesn't always remind you to please buy stuff for boosters.

It surely works not as good on the PC because the game relies on checking in from time to time and collectiong all the stuff your vault produced. But as long as you can play it just for the hell of it and refrain from ever spending actual real money on it. Why care if it doesn't play out as ideal. At least this one does not drain your phone's battery or sets your Samung in flames. ;)

It's free and rather small. If it's not your thing - delete it. Simple as that :D"
20133,"This game is actually very good, i dont see why people say its more made for mobile, although i wish that you had a mr. handy right away, would be nice, but i really want a co-op mode! basically, 2 players work on 1 shelter, so it could be that 1 person is on a mission, another is taking care of the shelter, or if 1 is offline and the other online, the person can check in on it from time to time. it will be a lot of fun working together on a tycoon like this in my opinion."
20134,Hey you can't beat FREE :)
20135,"Just gonna say, great mobile game on steam pretty much fun at start, then boring as hell at end with 200+ wastelanders and other things.....  11 nukes / 10"
20136,"This game is slow. Very slow. Like wtf am i suppose to do slow.
Rates and numbers lie (Rush) which might say something like 30% chance to fail then fail 15 times in a row.
Very boring, management game that requires you to pay money for even simple things like going afk for 30 minutes to do something else and leaving the game open."
20137,Best mobile game.
20138,"I'm surprised at the ""Very Positive"" status of the reviews for this. 

If you didn't know, this is originally a mobile game. The developers did very little to polish this up...excuse me, the developers did nothing to make the controls something even close to reasonable for the PC. As other reviews mention, the snapping is absolutely awful. Addtionally, there are a lot of miscues brought on by clicking. Such as, I wasn't trying to click ""the room"" I was trying to click my dweller. Since it's free, go ahead and play it and see what I mean.

Speaking of clicking on dwellers, there are a number of bugs, such as you click on one dweller, the menu pops up correctly, you then click another dweller and the menu does NOT change to that dweller, it instead disappears.


But the biggest problem, THE ABSOLUTE WORST PROBLEM of this game, that even applies to its mobile form, is that this is just another ... ... ... ... ""Play to wait, Pay to wait less"" piece of .........


Now, if this was $10 to buy and you didn't have any of the BS ""pay to play"" aspects, it would be worth it. But sitting there staring at the screen is NOT a good PC game. You can trick people into thinking they're receiving something on a mobile game, where you can easily go and do something else, but when you sit down to play a PC game you should not have to sit there with literally nothing else you can do! 

Spent all your caps, got all your dwellers working, and sent off an expedition? Congratulations! You get to waste the next 5 minutes of your life watching...nothing.

Don't waste your money on this. Seriously. Just don't. Don't do any of the in-game purchases. Don't support this kind of .... through Steam."
20139,CRASHED THE GAME AFTER 3RD TIME PLAYING! If you want to play this game play it on mobile. 2/5
20140,"When I first saw this during the Fallout 4 presentation, I was curious about this game. I'm a sucker for management games.
And when I realized it was not going to be released on PC, this disappeared from my radar.

Now, when I have played it, I am very unsatisfied and disappointed. This game is contrary to what I expected.

Description of game: Wait and click the game.
If you like farmville type of games, this might be up your alley.
Not for anyone expecting anything more than infantile level of management."
20141,"Its a fun game, there are micro transaction¬¥s but they are not a game changer.
Roaches,radiation,some random room catches fire.
 10/10 would make my dwelers work without rest and they are happy."
20142,"same as mobile version
but with 60 FPS
dunno i like it or don't

maybe i will keep play this game when i have free time"
20143,Sometimes i had a glitches and game crashes
20144,"i already played this on mobile and via Andy android emulator on PC.
Since then it has gotten a lot of new rooms and features added.
Quests, Pets, more loot, weapon and armour construction and so on.
Especially the Quests are fun, but 20hrs to run to its destination...?
ofc you can speed up with money or if you find nuka cola quantum.
But we most likely wont always have those benefits ready.
And seriously, you shouldnt spend money. The savegame is stored locally and on mobile it wasnt even backuped.
I lost quite a late savegame of an earlier game version because it broke. I never paid money and still enjoyed this.
So i can still recommend it.
For a f2p mobile port it offers a lot of fun within the fallout universe.
Good to kill some time now and then, but youre better off to play one of the fallout pc games with more depth...
The new content makes me play it again!"
20145,"the game allways crashes when i load it up
"
20146,"What should you be aware of?

- You can create upto 3 seperate Vaults (3 save games). If you decide to spend money in one it will only apply to that vault, not your other 2. You cannot transfer / carry over characters or weapons.

- If you have played on your mobile device spending countless hours (and possibly money) do not expect to be able to transfer your save/s over. They do not allow transfer of games to/from iOS, Android or PC. ""Please note that it is *not possible* to transfer your Vaults between different platforms (Andoid, iOS, PC) in Fallout Shelter.""

I enjoyed playing it on my phone and looked forward to playing it on the pc instead. Not being able to transfer my saves over is a deal breaker."

20149,"I love this game. If it only had some Fallout Tactics elements for combat and exploration, it would probably be the best Fallout game yet :D"
20150,"Finally its on Steam! I didn't play on PC because of the Bethesda Launcher. I'm still playing it on my android when I have some freetime, now I can play it on PC too.

Fallout Shelter is a mobile game and this  a [b] free	[/b] opportunity to play it on PC. You don't have to pay for anything and the things you buy are just for that one save file. But if you enjoy the game a few dollars for a few Mr Handys sounds okay for me. 

This is not a game to play all day but definitely fun for about a hour per day."
20151,Played a bit... Pretty fun
20152,fun! i likes it. addicting!
20153,"It does not work on all Personal Computers. It is a sink hole for money like every other micro transaction game. We need to stop supporting this kinds of games or they will stop releasing quality AAA games and start focusing on this kind of thing or worse... go to pachinko machines and micro-trans phone games exclusively in some areas; here's looking at you Konami.

So a recap
-Runs poorly on many computers
-Does not work on all computers
-Costs a stupid amound of money just to keep playing the game at an enjoyable pace
-Is not free to play - is pay or wait to play
-Games pre-2000 had simular graphics
-Games pre-2000 had better mechanics
-Cash Grab
-Encourages the Developers to make sloppy mobile and pay to play games if you get it"
20154,"i love this game but once i saved and exited and got back on it wont launch it just sits there saying ""preparing this game for launch"" and i cant find the troubleshooter (or im blind as a bat). help me please... i also recomend this game its one of those games where you can play two at once (meaning for example playing fallout 4 mainly and cheacking up now and then on fallout shelter)"
20155,I played this game for 1 year and I finally finished it
20156,Finaly........what took them so long?

20160,fun
20161,"I think this is not good yet there is posibility when you buy something then after deleting/reinstall the game the item you buy will lose, also there slight diffuty in movements in camera, when click those AI, during my expierence on cellphone, during raid, the drakeclaw can kill your entire dwellers if you cant move those people as fast as possible... thats why i quit on cellphone because i delayed moving my dwellers to avoid being killed in raids specially those CLAWS cna kill a dwellers around 5 seconds and with a 3 blocks of facility with 6 dwellers it will be hard to transfer it as fast as possible...

PLs arrnge the control can we use arrow or W S A D key to move camera and we use rigt click mouse to click dwellers,

and lastly make sure when we buy a items, you should guarantee that we will never lose it... even we reinstall the game... and i was hoping you guys use cloud data my Fallout Shelter with 74 dwellers is there.... i remember 24 alive and 50 dead after continue unexpected raid of fucking drake claws...-_-

-Request 
Controls camera Movements using arrows keys or w s a d

and

Items Buying - make sure it will be permanet on a account of steam or cloud even we reinstall it or we buy a new pc.... 

I still  recommed this game to play..

Ill come back when your guys have updated...."
20162,"This is a rewritten review after I finally got the game to run without crashing.

It is actually a sweet little game, good for killing time or run while doing something on the other monitor.

When playing on PC through Steam your progress is transferred to other PCs running Steam. That is pretty nice and hardly surprising - but I have read elsewhere that the progress is tied to the device when playing the android version, so I thought it relevant to mention it.

Two annoying things in the game:

1: When dragging your dweller from one room to another the placement is not intuitive - it is very easy to place the dweller in the room below the one you intended.

2: When your shelter gets attacked by raiders you will send dwellers to stop them. If you send the dwellers to - say - the diner, they will do battle. But when the raiders decide to run on and further down into your shelter you can not stop them from doing that. But what is really annoying is that your dweelers say ""Ah, nice, the unppleasant chaps finally vacated the diner. Let's sit down and take a cup of tea."" And that is what they do - instead of chasing the raiders. 

Some have complained about micro-transactions. I haven't played enough yet to have anything to say to that.

All in all, an enjoyable little game - and gratis to boot (at least when I got it)."
20163,"It's a fairly decent game, very fun to play. And the nice thing about the PC verison is that you can get to see all of the details up close that you wouldn't be able to see on a smaller screen like the phone.

 HOWEVER!!! It's painfully obivious that this was originally an mobile game, due to the fact everything is on a timer. like you have to wait 14 to 4 mintues before you collect engery, food, and so on forth. the thing about casual browser and mobile phone games is that they're designed for people on the go. you send commands to your settlers/dwellers, etc and then shut the phone off while you do things such as work-related stuff... and then get back to it on your lunch break.
  It's not really meant for long-term gaming where you can have fun building endlessly for hours. It's not that kind of game.

 Better stick to playing this on your phone instead of on steam."
20164,"Overall: 9,5

Pros:
Just like on the phone

cons:
fps dropped constantly
"
20165,"It's OK. Not designed for PC. They should make saves cross-platform so you can continue playing on mobile and vice versa. Also, needs trading cards!"
20166,"Ok This game is funny, 2 minutes in to the games You will need to find a Hammer and click on it to build a room, the funny part is there's no Hammer."
20167,Good Game I love all Fallout series
20168,Fallout Shelter is just a Fallout themed mobile game ported to PC. Stop giving negative reviews if you don't like mobile games. Nobody forces you to play or spend money to it. Also It's pretty enjoyable if you stop being an a hole and give the game a chance. I'm glad they brought Fallout Shelter to Steam.
20169,"Controls still wonky and a lot of bug and crashes (at least for now), I hope this game gets better. Thanks Vault-Tec!"
20170,this game is very fun to play when you don't have internet connection
20171,"Fallout Shelter is a nice little F2P micromanagement game where you build one of Fallout's infamous vaults from scratch. Every vault consists of many different rooms which all serve one specific purpose like generating energy or drinking water. Then there are your inhabitants or dwellers which are necessary to do the actual work. Every dweller has his/her own unique strenghts and weaknesses which makes some of them better suited to perform certain tasks (rooms) than others. When you click on a power generation room, for example, a new display will pop up, there you will notice a circle with a capital 'S' in it which stands for strenght. Now you wanna check your dwellers' stats and assign the ones with high strenght (S) to the power generation room. To prevent things from becoming too easy the game will randomly throw threats at you which threaten your inhabitants. Usually, however, are your dwellers quite capable of handling such situations on their own as long as you have enough of them assigned to the room where the threat will initially occur or spread to. Weapons, armor and pets can help to deal with threats inside your vault easier and are also recommended to increase the chances of survival in the wastes. When you drag a dweller outside of your shelter you can order them to go on exploration missions or build the Overseer's office to send your dwellers on quests for rewards. 

That's more or less it. What I still should point out is that Fallout Shelter isn't a game you could play for hours on end! You wanna load it up in the morning and before you go sleep, for example, to get maximum enjoyment out of it. It WiLL definitely bore you out of your mind if you think you could get entire gaming sessions out of it! I have played the game for about 5 hours now and didn't run into any annoying F2P crap yet. Those loot boxes or Nuka Colas which you can buy for real money aren't exactly necessary in my opinion to enjoy or survive in the game (at least not yet?).

While I liked the first 10 hours I lost interest pretty quickly once those feral ghouls started to constantly attack my vault. Annoying, especially due to the fact that those suckers do not even drop any rewards except for contaminating my vault with radiation.. Constantly swapping weapons around where they are needed also became infuriating way too fast to ever even consider putting any real money into it.. 

Shelter is still alright but it can go and fuck off as far as I am concerned ; P"
20172,"This MOBILE GAME is the literal textbook definition of ""it's better than nothing"".

Only play this if you:

1) Don't have time to commit to a serious game

2) Don't have the motivation to invest in a serious game that requires actual attention and presence

3) Are just hanging out in a call with a bunch of people, but don't want to play a game that requires you to listen or focus, or that you actually care about

4) Are waiting for your pasta to boil but cannot be arsed to click -any- 5 minute youtube video 

5) Clicked the wrong game but are too senile to realize"
20173,Gut game!
20174,"So, they finally released this game onto steam after they required you to use their own launcher.. i refused to use it and even tweeted them (as if they read it) to stick it onto steam aha anyway the game is fun and makes a good casual idle simulator aha have it on in the back ground and do what you need to and just checking the status of your vault is quite good :)"
20175,Play it!
20176,"Nice Game ! LOVE FALLOUT
I love Bethesda Game Studios 
Thank you for bring the most beautiful moment to my life !

20177,Super awesome i recomend it if u played fallout or if u want to play fallout
20178,Finally available on Steam.
20179,"Have it on phone and loved it there, only difference between them i found so far is that i need to stop touching my laptop screen to collect from rooms 


And still find the death scene for raiders too long

20180,I recommend this game for anyone who likes 2D type to survival games.
20181,"This was my favorite mobile game!!!
Now its on steam!
99999999/10"
20182,"A Mobile-port F2P Waiting-game cookie cutter that uses the appeal of Fallout to try to mix things up in the heavily over-used genre. As such, since it's a game spawned from the cancer that is the Mobile gaming industry? It's full of microtransactions that really don't do much but try to tempt you to throw your money away for the sake of vanity or completionism. The best advice that can be given is that you play the game patiently during your free time, or when you can multitask this and other games to make the best of collecting resources while on the PC while playing any other game during intermissions - (Like say you're playing CSGO, you die, so you quickly collect the resources and go back in-game, rinse repeat).

The pros, I'd argue involve it having a lot of things to do, a lot of things to collect for those that like collecting things, the game seems to have improved in the amount of things you can collect or do since when I last tried it on Android when it first launched.

The cons, it's a mobile game and you can draw numerous negative conclusions from just that. Don't waste your money, quests give you 'Cards' and they are preying on you being impatient, preying that you have a gambling-addiction, and preying that you give them money that as others point out? The things you waste your money on IN-GAME are purely connected to your ONE save file, your one vault. If that vault is deleted or anything happens to it? All that used money is gone forever.

I give this a Recommend only because I like having something to do inbetween other games and I'm sure I'll be content and pre-occupied with this quite fine in comparison to other games of the same genre - that and I give them a Recommend because they actually ALLOW you to get the Premium (Lunch boxes) via quests, where other money-grubbing devs normally save those behind a paywall and a paywall only."
20183,Dont spend money?
20184,"Vault 11 - This vault was a massive social experiment where the inhabitants were required to select one person to sacrifice every year. They were told that unless they did this, everyone in the vault would be killed. The experiment continued until there were only five original inhabitants left, who all refused to continue rather than choose. At this point, the survivors were told the true nature of the experiment - that sacrifice had never, in fact, been required, and they were ‚Äúshining examples of humanity‚Äù.

I created vault 11 in this game, now it's time for the experiment to commence."
20185,"A fun time waster, just dont waste your money on microtransactions."
20186,"It's a good F2P game, to kill some time with it, but it gets boring after a while, there are just not much real content after few hours and there are only repetitive stuff."

20191,Still better than Fallout 4's dialogue system.
20192,Awesome game and really fun. I love this game because sometime they could give you free lunchboxs on the quest and I love doing those quest.
20193,"A lot of people are complaining that this is a mobile game and should stay on mobile, however, if you work from home, are doing something or are playing another game where you can easily tab over to the other screen then this is a good time filler to have. Also, on mobile this game drains phone battery like a bitch.

The in game purchases do not cross over between other play throughs, no, but they are not required and you still get a lot of fun out of the game without spending a penny."

20200,"Don't get me wrong, the game is fun and very addictive, but......

It's a mobile game port to PC, ergo: most of the click and dragg mechanics are off the mark, to the point that you visiously scream at the game to stop being an enoyance and let you pick up your dwellers in the Vault to dragg where you need them to respond.
Resulting in most cases that your dweller is on the floor below it.

DEVELOPERS: FIX YOUR PORT
GAMERS: Play this ghame for free, DO NOT UNDER ANY  CONDITION PAY FOR THE MICRO TRANSACTIONS!

in short: Play. Have fun dispite the enoying porting failures.

(Edit after 100 hours of play)

so advise for the developers:

-Fix the room dragg box.
      The lower half of a room is actually the room underneath it, resulting in people being allocated to the wrong rooms.
-When a room finnishes it's production run, you HAVE to empty the room of resources before ANYONE can be dragged to another room (very enoying in crittical situations.
Vault Lunchboxes are WAY to unreliable in it's payout to warrant paying real money to shortcut.

Tips for players:

THIS GAME IS A PORT, treat it as such.
-right and left clicking produce the same results.
-there is a way to keep the numbers up under the resource bars, top center of the screen, however this happens more as an accidental result and not clear information on how to do it in game.
- as rooms produce resources, people will wander within the room, this meens them running back to their production spot (running from right side of room to the left) which makes it imposible to grab a dweller to assigne to another place within your vault in case of emergencies.

So, with that out of the way (and believe me, there are more bugs and i senceerly hope the developers will spend time to help fix this game), here is my Verdict:

Play it
For free
the game is entertaining and addictive, fun and indepth, varied and allows for roleplay to change each vault experience you deside to make.
However, do NOT allow yourself to be lulled into spending money on the ingame store.
the vault boxes, nuka cola quantum, mr Handy(s) and pet boxes are all collectable within the game.
If you deside to play survival (ironman) mode, i suggest getting a starter pack otherwise the randomness and unrelaibilty in the contence of the Lunchboxes will see your vault Fail very rappidly. The Starter pack costs 5 euros/dollars and is a ONE TIME USE. Change vault (yes you can have more then one vault each with it's own save) and your Real Money items will have to be rebought for that particular playthrough........... yeah a bit to easy to make money that way and not one i endorse.

Youtube has several playthroughs and tip/tricks videos from well known entertainers and well worth checking out to get a good idea about the game.

The game is fun, but has allot of consumer unfriendly mechanics which makes it agravating from time to time.
It's way to earn money to warrant this game though, is a rip off.

NOT EXPLAINED IN THE GAME OR HELP MENU:

-click on the Resource bar top center  to show numbers (resources/storage space). automatically fades afte x seconds (around 6-8 seconds)

Strength = damage
Perception = hit chance
Endurance = carry weight/hit points, wastland site discovery chance
Charisma = Quest responce options, romance quicker
Intelligence = encounter options
Agility= This increases fire rate and is the most important stat.
Luck = better chance to succesfully rush a room, better loot chances, higher critts and critt chances"
20201,I got a dog
20202,nice game~!!!
20203,Fools game. SUKAAAAAAAAAAA
20204,"Needed power.  Rushed power with only 22% fail rate. Made a calculated and informed decision.  Failed. Big fire.

Really need power now.  Can't generate food or water.  32% fail rate.  Made another calculated and informed decision.  Failed again. Radroach infestation.  Frustrated.

Uninstalled.

I would have given the game a second chance, but the same thing happened to me on the mobile app and this was the second chance.  I was looking for a casual stress-free game to wind down for 5-10 minutes after my typical competitive PvP games, and this was not it. Soda Dungeon is a far superior game for this purpose.

Ultimately this is yet another game with potential that was ruined by RNG, forced limitations, and manipulative mechanics intended to get the player spending money. They should have just made the game $4.99 instead of a F2P model forcing you to buy the $4.99 starter pack, I would have gladly supported them if they didn't take such a manipulative approach.

"
20205,"If you're a Fallout fan, specificallty Fallout 4, think of this as just a free, fanservice offering. Don't spend real money on it if you can help it. I was hooked for a week or so on my phone when this came out, and now it's here on Steam, looking better and running better. You won't grind at this for hours. You'll be checking in on your vault every few hours or daily. Think of it like a virtual pet sim like Seaman for Dreamcast or something. Yes, it's stupid, but there's far worse free items on Steam to waste time on."
20206,"So far i like it also It's a freaking f2p you people bitch about everything because you have it good.

Edit:
I quit playing for simple reason it's way to addictive.I still think it's good game but i became bit obsessive with it lol."
20207,I like this very much
20208,This is pretty good for my autism
20209,"Xbox gui layout overlays the standard PC gui, and the two fight each other! Basically unplayable!"
20210,Bethesda's Fallautism has never been so authentic.
20211,Fallout Shelter is a great guide how to pickup women ! 10 vault-boys /10
20212,This game is like owning your very own ant farm!... except the ants in this farm have guns and level up. Very Addicting!
20213,This is a great game to play during wait times for league games or something similar.
20214,Game crashes - save file corrupted. Thanks for nothing.
20215,Phone VS PC....Let's start new game xD
20216,This is the exact same as the iphone version and if I were not so dang far on it there I would definatly switch to this one. Plan out your dwelling a bit and put your storages and rooms on the very far right using the 2 last spaces. This allows you to use the rest of the map for important nuke cola buildings and such! Also another tip if you disarm all your settlers in your building before an attack the attacking enemy will be lower stam/dmg and you can quickly equip your settlers when the alarm goes off and beat them easier. Like I said a pain but keeps you engaged.
20217,it is just like the phone version but you use a mouse instead of youre fingers
20218,similar to a phone game
20219,"Fun, interesting little game. =)"
20220,"Slow going in the early game, pay to win and there is really no point to it with no end game. It's very addicting though."
20221,garbage
20222,love this game
20223,"As one of the last people to own a smart phone, I emulated a smart phone just to play this when it first released. Since then they've added new features like pets, crafting, and new rooms.

I must warn you, if you want to enjoy what little purpose there is to this game, do not spend any money. I found the game's rotation of quests with the occasional rare/legendary rewards, along with sending people into the wasteland for loot to be the best part of the game. This is ruined if you spend money to get good items right off the bat.

Definitely a fun, but casual Fallout experience worth a try. Also some advice for those who are having a hard time: [spoiler]Raiders typically attack left to right, and clear your top floor first (this will change if you add additional elevator shafts). Do NOT move your people to the vault entrance to fight them. Instead, use this knowledge to make the first room they reach their last. Always equip your strongest guns you have available to people in that room. Also, start building medikits fairly quickly, and don't hestitate to rush it (as well as other buildings) quite often. Fires are easy to put out and also give exp.[/spoiler]"
20224,"It is a good pc version of the game, with the new features and the epic content and gameplay, truely a home run! I would highly reccomend this game! also I think it's funny how much faster I can do things in this verison, the mobile took forever to do a lot of things, so I'm happy, this is an epic game! :)"
20225,"Honestly love this game, its funny, fun if your bored, and its atleast something to do half of the time. good thing i was able to move saves too."
20226,Played 130-150'ish hours of this. Starting from scratch. I just love it enough to play it all over again.

20230,"pretty cool and free, a bit mroe interactive compared to other facebook esc games. never press the sell all common items, it did the opposite for me and sold all of the good items from my quest...."
20231,fix your shit bethesda.  skyrim.  fallout 4.  do you actually playtest any of your games before release or do you just put out the first buggy alpha build you can cobble together and stuff it full of microtransactions and overpriced DLC?

20233,"I let it run on my 2nd monitor while watching streaming shows - there are some options that seem better than on the phone, but not many - the original is a bit better.  Overall though, it doesn't suck completely - good time waster since you don't have to keep your eyes glued to it.

Wish there was a meh option..."
20234,"I had 8 people die within 20 minutes of a rad roach infection. Not even that far in the game yet.

Radroaches are the easiest fucking thing to kill in fallout, yet when I have people fighting them all with guns die, even after I give some of the stimpacks, they still die and im stuck with either paying money to revive the starting people or just let them lay on the floor untill I have enough.

In the beginning I enjoyed this game, but theres a lot in here that needs working on. For one, the fighting in general is just flat out retarded. Oh, raiders just attacked us! There coming to our room! Fight for your lives! Ok... Wait... They left mid battle.. There going to the next room... Im just gonna keep working and let them run around our vault willy nilly. What in the actual fuck. Like your not gonna just let them leave the room and go fight the next people. They go back to work as if nothing is happening. This, is by far the worst mechanic in this entire game. Defending your vault against whatever is just flat out dumb right now. Judging by how far and long this game has been out. It wont be changing.

In the beggining I enjoyed this game, it was fun. But, this is not made for PC. This is a mobile game, and all mobile games have waiting mechanics. I cant play this before I go to work, then come back to people starving and all that. They should have came out with a PC version of this game. Plain and simple. There are mobile mechanics in a PC game and it just doesnt work out.

The defending of your vault is downright awful. I cannot believe I lost 8 people in one rad roach infection. I dont have 3k caps lying around cause I havnt progressed in the game at all. Fuck, I just unlocked the med bay. All the sudden I have all these people coming in and killing everyone when I cant even handle myself yet. The difficulty just jumped all the sudden and now im stuck with a vault thats slowly dying. Fix the defence of your vault. Seriously. Fighting in this game is just flat out dumb. The rows or whatever your trying to do dont work out, just makes them stand 5 feet from eachother doing the same animation over and over. Somehow, a dweller with a shotgun lost a battle to a radroach. A single fucking radroach killed my best equipped dweller, even after I shoved a stimpack up his ass.

Going out into the wasteland is a joke too. You expect me to sit here and wait a few hours to check in on him here and there to make sure that hes still alive and kicking? No, fuck that. Thats not how a game on this platform works. Like I said before, this game has mobile mechanics shoved into a PC platform. I will not wait 20 minutes for the med bay to make one single fucking stimpack. During that time, I get attacked and whatever. Then people lose health. Boy, whos life should I fucking save out of the 5 people that are on the verge of dying from fucking roaches. 

I will continue to play this game, but from I can tell it will be a slow and painful death of my vault just for me to start all over again. Less then 5 hours in. Maybe 30 min of me actually being active in the game. Fix the mobile features and this would be a great game. But for now, I can not recommend it. I will still play, and I will keep updating this review with whatever happens.

Also, they dont auto collect resources, so while im working my ass off in the adult world my dwellers in my vault back home are starving because they cant click the fork and spoon icon. and no, I will not pay money to have a fucking robot come around and auto collect that stuff, when it should be auto collected on this platform to begin with.

-Edit one day later-
I have now lost 4 more people to a simple rad roach infestion. All equipped with weapons that do 6-8 damage consisting of one old lazer pistol and the rest with shotguns. They have all died due to a rad roach infestation. One. Single. Infestation and they currently have the best weapons that I had. I used up 9 stimpacks on all of them, and yet they all still died, after having there health refilled on some of them, multiple times. The rest I only used one.

This games defending mechanism is the worst I have ever seen in a game. Upon zooming into the room that they are currently fighting in, they arnt even near eachother and all of there health starts to deplete. Even with more than one person in the room, the health of all people in the room being attacked starts to deplete. One raider, 4 people all shooting at him, all losing health at the same time. Hes halfway across the room with a machete and hes somehow hitting everyone in the room at the same time.

I had 13 stimpacks, and by the end of one rad roach infestation and one Raider attack, I lost 5 people and used up 13 stimpacks to heal the weak. Everyone was equipped and had some type of outfit on them. Once the last person hit the floor, I couldnt fucking believe it. 1 single radroach had just killed 3 people. That was the last straw that I could take from this game. This shouldve never been ported over to PC. This shouldve had its own release on the PC platform. Seeing as this game has been out for as long as it has been on multiple platforms I think it is safe to say, from a person who loves the series and has played every single game. That this is the worst out of everything that they have released under the fallout name. 

Dont waste your time with this game, in the beginning you will enjoy and invest some time into it, but once you see its obvious major flaws you will regret ever playing this game to begin with.

With everything being said in this edit, I have uninstalled the game and plan on never coming back to it unless its obvious flaws and issues are fixed. Sad to see a game with obvious potential be ruined for me, a fan of the entire series and everything that comes with it, dwindled down with this mobile game. Never again"
20235,I do recomendit but I can play it until some of this stuff gets ironed out because i cam contantly being dragged into the corner of ther wrld and its unplayable
20236,Boring Af
20237,"This is a great game.
1. The game plays in real time, reals seconds even when the game isnt running. This is so you spend money to speed things up.
2. It's free to play which is great.
3. Great mechanics, no bugs.
I tried to use cheat engine to speed up the game, but it diddnt work?"
20238,gg its just like the phone version
20239,"Worth a look if you like Fallout, as it has that FO charm, but far too shallow and repetitive to grab your attention for longer than a few hours. Very disappointing, as it has the potential to be a great game if there was just more to do once you've grown your vault to a decent size and unlocked all the rooms. Bummer. 3/10"
20240,"I've only played a few minutes of it so far, but it's exactly like the mobile version.
If you're like me and played this originally on Bluestacks because you don't own a phone... or wanted to try this and never used Bluestacks and don't own a phone, I say try it out.
Found this game addicting then, and I'm sure this Steam version will pull me right back in in no time."
20241,"I've been waiting for a Steam version since DAY ONE, TODD.

TOOK YA LONG ENOUGH, it's 2017!!! 

Anyways, I'm glad the game is finally here on my preferred platform. 
I played for about 30 minutes on a new save before I figured out I could just transfer, and everything works great, as expected. 
I just transferred my old save off my old phone I used to play this game on and it worked flawlessly, even got a few achievements lol. I put about 30 hours into it then, but my last save date was 11/15/2015. I was attached to my host of characters, I even charted a family tree to keep track of the generations.  

Time to get back to it!"
20242,"Yeah the game is designed for the mobile version, so what? It is still a very good game where it keeps the simple entertainment just right."
20243,"pros: good graphics, not bad gameplay

cons: dificulty, resources slow generation, high consumption of resources too pricey for quests

over all: not bad, nor good, but needs improvment, plus dificulty spikes, and lowering of prices of revieving for caps"
20244,this mobile game doesnt quite fit with a pc but it can still be enjoyed
20245,"Great little civ building game, Fun an Free to play :)"
20246,gud
20247,Better than fallout 4 ;D
20248,"People need to stop complaining & maybe read up on something before expecting more in a product. Not once was this game advertised as something totally different from the original mobile version & for it being that, it's still good. It was never meant to be played constantly & that's what I like about it. I can only do so much before I am forced to get up & do something productive. 
Mainly happy I don't need to be running the Bethsda Launcher for this game anymore, now for ESL to get onto Steam."
20249,"My God...

No words can describe this pissing down the drain franchise, son of a bitch, rapist of monkeys, ape heart of buliamia. 

There I tried - and failed utterly - God rape [expletive] ect

You get ther point."
20250,"My favorite Bethesda game. Not because its the best, but because I spend the least amount of time, compared to their other games, fighting ceaseless bugs, horrendous UI inefficiencies, and pathetically simplistic yet somehow clunky combat mechanics. 

Please, Bethesda, stop taking on more than you can handle. You are the best at making environments in the gaming industry, you are crap at everything else; hire someone else to handle your mechanics."
20251,"The mobile game comes to PC. A fun management game with the added bonus of the Fallout universe. Easy to learn, but you find out very quickly that these resources can't just be left alone.

20252,I mean... it's cute.  But seriously the pacing is way off for the PC.  You just sit there and stare and you screen waiting most of the time.  Try it but don't buy anything until you see what I mean.
20253,"Freemium trash.
Pay now to not wait. Pay now to not have to manually collect everything you produce. Pay now for a miniscule chance for a legendary dweller (no, seriously, the lootboxes in this game are THE WORST lootboxes I have ever seen in a game. 90% of the loot is literal junk and they're the only way to get legendary dwellers - outside of 3 you get for quests, but you need 20 for the achievement). The only upside is that you can use a trainer for unlimited lootboxes and speed-ups, but really, if you need to use cheats to circumvent the pay-to-win trash, then it's a bad game. 
And the actual gameplay is not even really fun. It looks kinda nice at first, until you figure out that 90% of the game is either waiting or paying not to wait (or using a trainer instead of paying). 
And I'm saying this as someone who doesn't even hate idle games per se, I liked Adventure Capitalist for example. 

Also, the writing for the quests and dialogue is cringe-worthy, it feels like it was written by some edgy teenager."
20254,"If you are a fan of the series and want a themed game to chill in the background then this is a game for you. 

Pros:
-Most of the jokes and references are pretty funny
-Little number of bugs
-Microtransactions are not necessary (you can get everything just by playing the game)
-Nice non-recycled updates from time to time

Cons:
-No badges
-Anything you buy is connected to the savefile of your current vault (no full/partial transfer to new vaults of anything you buy, from what I could observe)
-No multiplayer interaction. Now that it's on steam, it could use some sort of multiplayer element (only for flavor, like being able to visit your friend's vaults and make fun of their in-optimal room placements ^^)
-Dwelers make babies, you can craft items, but no way to make more pets."

20256,"A phone game that clearly wasn't adapted to PC play.  When you are ""playing"" there's little more to do than click resources and move people around.  When you aren't ""playing,"" nobody picks up the resources so you start running out.  The game ticks [for a small amount of time] while you are away, which might be fine on mobile, but doesn't really suit PC.  For this to be enjoyable, I'd want to have speed controls, to tick through faster while playing and have it pause when not playing.  It seems like the time element is probably how they sell their goodie bags, so I doubt it will go this route.

[Edited to clarify.  I still don't recommend it.]"
20257,if you liked on iphone you will like it more on pc
20258,"A good timewaster and nothing more.

Unremarkable at its worst, a distraction at best, Fallout Shelter is a great mobile game, but fails to stand on it's own two feet on PC, but is still worth a time, again, as a distraction from the seemingly infinite repetition that is life.

*NOTE: I have played this on Android and on the Bethesda launcher. Playtime here is irrelevant. Also while I like the game, I do have several gripes about the game, mostly about the microtransactions, and lack of content but we'll get to that.

Fallout Shelter is a game where you are the overseer of a vault (Which you can number yourself, I really want a statistic on how many Vaults 69, 420 and 666 have been made) and your job is to build it and make your dwellers happy. The building mechanics remind me of a mobile game by Kairosoft called Mega Mall Story, but the building mechanics are almost the same. Some would also compare this to the classic Maxis game SimTower, which I've personally never played but the gameplay I've seen of that game is pretty similar as well.

Building a vault is as simple as selecting a room and placing it next to an adjacent building. You have 25 floors, each able to hold up to 8 rooms and two lifts. While that sounds like a lot of rooms to max out your vault, you can merge up to 3 of the same room to get better effects. Rooms can do things such as produce Power, Water and Food, which are the basic needs of the vault that will decrease as time goes on, a room to train your dweller's SPECIAL stats (which I'll get into later) and crafting rooms. It is also worth noting that each room has to be unlocked when you get enough dwellers in the vault, and each room can be upgraded twice at the cost of caps to improve said room's stats.

Crafting is a mechanic I have grown to like. Your collected junk ain't junk no more, when you assign dwellers to craft weapons or outfits to equip them with. You can get cool recipes when you adventure and then craft the best items if you have the junk required. (Although how you make a 10mm pistol out a desk fan and specifically that kinda makes no sense if you ask me)

How do you get said junk, either from exploring the wastes or from questing. Exploring basically sends a dweller out into the wastes, collecting resources and gaining xp. Oh yeah, there is a levelling system, each dweller being able to go up to level 50, though you still have to train SPECIAL stats via training rooms. A good SPECIAL rating can max out your dweller's performance out in the wasteland, each stat a modifier as to how well they'll do. Questing is probably my favourite feature, even if it is a pain at times.

Building an Overseer's Office allows up to three dwellers to go on quests, and with it you can control where they go in a dungeon, which really is the most Fallout part of Shelter. While battles are automated, there is a bit of player control in this system, where you can select who or what each dweller attacks, and occasional critical hits, which involves a mouse QTE (I think that's a QTE anyway) to determine how much extra damage you do. The end results could go from common weapons, armour, caps and the occasional recipe and then it's back to the vault with your loot. It has to be noted that while your vault can be attacked by raiders, you cannot select who to attack in defense or do crits, due to the quests actually being an update and Bethesda not updating the new system to the original defense mechanic.

So the game is overall very in depth for a mobile game. Unfortunately, this is PC, so there are a few gripes.

So everything in the game I've said so far sounds entertaining to you? Here is to me the SECOND worst mechanic in a mobile game, WAITING. There is a lot of waiting to do here. Heck, almost everything requires you to idle. Get resources, wait. Craft, wait. Get a freaking haircut, wait. Exploring, wait. And you have to wait another half of the time the dweller travelled for the bugger to come back. Questing? The best feature in the game? WAIT. This game is full of it, and eventually you realise the best thing to do is just let the game run in the background while you are doing something else.

Believe it or not, you couldn't even skip the waiting whatsoever in the beginning. Then Nuka Cola Quantum happened. Which is the typical skip the waiting currency. Now would be a good time to get to the microtransactions.

Now, before anyone says ANYTHING, this ISN'T, repeat, ISN'T, pay-to-win. It's pay-to-be-incredibly-lazy or as I like to call it, pay-for-random-stuff. Unless you are buying Mr. Handys outright (which by the way do nothing but collect the resources for you so you can do nothing even more), you can't control what you buy. Lunchboxes are a blind bag mechanic, where you get 5 random things in game, such as more resources, caps, quantum and new dwellers, weapons and outfits. And you can't choose what you get. This isn't pay-to-win because you can't just buy quantum outright and go all the way to maxing your vault within a week. No, the randomness is like opening a pack of randoms, can be anything. FIFA Ultimate Team Packs, Hearthstone packs, Magic the Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG cards. That's what it is. Cards. That are completely optional because you can get lunchboxes from quests and objectives. So it's not completely gated off. There are a few problems of course, such as everything you buy is locked to ONE SAVEFILE. So if it gets wiped, goodbye money. This is a bit of a problem to some, but really, since I have never bought anything on this game ($70 for your bloody Fallout 4 Season Pass is enough Bethesda) and just get lunchboxes for free, it's not THAT big a deal to me, though if you do plan to drop money on lunchboxes, this is your warning.

Another thing that grinds my gears is the lack of endgame content. Once you hit the dweller cap or building everything you pretty much have nothing left to do. It then becomes busywork. I myself only play this game in long bursts whenever the game updates or I feel like it.

One more aspect. I know Shelter isn't meant to be canon, but come on. Why does the vault open AFTER the bombs fall? And I'm pretty sure raiders and ghouls can't just break into a vault. And what IS the experiment for your vault? Vault Tec vaults are meant to be very dark social experiment so just... what is it supposed to be. Unless it was meant to be a utopia that also trains the settlers for survival, but that's just to kind of Vault Tec considering their reputation.

Despite these complaints, I have no issue with recommending Shelter. It is a good game, but it can only hold your interest for so long. And hey, kudos to Bethesda for their most stable and crash free game to date. There are bugs (of course) but nothing game breaking for me in about 30 hours of total playtime. It also has a better building sytem than Fallout 4. So there's that.

If you like Fallout or building, or are a newcomer to the series and want a glimpse on what the twisted wasteland is like, give it a try. I enjoy it and I love that this is on Steam.

Also if anyone wants to comment on this, please keep it polite. Don't throw names around and be civil for once please Internet."
20259,very good game! would definitely recommend downloading this game! soo much fun and addicting!
20260,"Addictive and fun. Spending money is optional, but it is in no way P2W"
20261,"A surprisingly fun Free to Play game.
Its like Simpsons tapped out and this war of mine had a baby in the fallout universe.

And if that doesn't make sense then just try it, ITS FREE!"
20262,"Thanks so much for porting this to pc, I've played several hours on my mobile but it started to get unplayable with over 50 dwellers, the game got stuck.
But on PC is all good, it'll stay running on background FOREVER :D"
20263,only reason I play it on the computer is because the Mobile version was coded by a ten year old and it crashes every five minutes
20264,"This is one of the best games I have ever played on Steam. It's a little slow in progression, but if the game did progress fast, it would absolutely ruin it. I already love this game. You can make Dwellers get pregnant, and loads of other things. Although it's a completely diferrent concept, Fallout Shelter still stays true to the originals."
20265,I usually dont mess with F2P but this one is pretty sweet so far if you like Fallout and the idea of a Vault management simulation.
20266,"I thought this game was stupid when i first played it! 
It turns out to be quit a fun little free game!
If you play it right you dont have to spend a dime!"
20267,Its a good game if you like resource managment and real time gameplay.
20268,"So far so good, has a few minor bugs, such as stim packs and caps overlapping when in the waste land. Overall the same game as mobile."
20269,"Loved it when it first came out, glad there's finally a pc version!"
20270,"Thumbs up


When Farmville meets a Real Time Strategy game the result is: Fallout Shelter.
A cool and fun game, easy to relax with. Also comes with that typical vintage sound track and great art work typical of all Fallout series.


Its free. Enjoy it.

About the micro transactions in game: No, thank you - you dont really need them to have fun"
20271,Really nice game
20272,"[i]Fallout Shelter[/i] is game that lured me in for tens on hours playing it on my tablet back in the day. Even then I was able to realise, how dumb this game is, how easy it is, and that there isn't much of a gameplay going on. 
Basically clicker with Fallout clothes on. But I was persistent. It kept me busy while watching movies, tv shows, whatever, so I didn't mind paying my attention to something that doesn't require a lot of it ... if any, for that matter.

Now this gem, came to our beloved [i]Steam[/i], and what I started to do? Playing it while watching movies, tv shows, or whatever. This game isn't great in anything particular. If you want hardcore management game, great simulation, you won't get that. What you will get is time filler, for killing some downtime during other more meaningful sessions with something else. Nothing more. Nothing less. 

There is a planty of things I would change. UI menus aren't as intuitive; screen from time to time is doing its own thing; moving population is sometimes pain in the ass; not a lot of depth; and so, and so on. Plenty of things that are wrong with this game. And yet, my time sunk in this game is raising, only because I like the theme, simplicity, and just look at it every five minutes while I'm watching movie. 

This isn't first, and certainly won't be last game that had this fate in my history. I just like to spread my attention to different things, and yet still be focused mainly on one particular. 
[i]Fallout Shelter[/i] is letting me do this, therefor I'm ok with all flaws ... and because it is free game, of course - otherwise, this tune could change really fast.

If you are not familiar with this tittle, give it a little try. 
If you are familiar from mobile devices, let me assure you not much has changed.
If you want kill some time, there is probably no downside to it, so do it.
"
20273,"For those, who always wanted to see the real of fallout vault!
Really nice time-killer with ton of collectible items."
20274,"It's free, why not play it and decide yourself if it is worth your time.

Its hard to say since the Mobile Free to play style of the game really does not fit to a PC title... the thing you will do most is waiting... and there is not purpose in having your game open then. Still I catch myself opening it over and over again to check my vault's progress."
20275,i loved this game on my phone so i thought let's download it but it keeps crashing like non stop i dont get why as my pc runs BO3 with out a worry but this game is a 2d game it make no sense at all
20276,"Ok why do people give dem bad ratings just because the DLC.

Also anyone that reads this, go to google and type kys and go to images and see what you find"
20277,"This game is fun and challenging.

In this game you build a Fallout Shelter. Then the dwellers arrive at your vault door. That is when things start to become a challenge.

You have several things that you need to keep an eye on. The first of these are three meters which measure how much food, water and energy you have in your vault. These are very important. You want to keep them full. If they fall too low, it lowers the overall happiness of your vault dwellers.

The more rooms you build in your vault, the more energy it consumes.
The more dwellers you have the more food and water they consume.

The other things you need to watch for is the happiness meter and the bottlecap meter. The hapiness meter tells you the vault's average happiness and the bottlecap meter tells you how much money you have. 

You can also bring up a view of all your dweller's and view their status, which includes happiness, their job and how they are equiped. You can equip your dweller with clothing, weapons and a pet.

Now the most important rooms that you will want to build when you start out are Living Quarters, Power Station, Water Station and Diner. This will allow you to get the first of your dwellers started. These rooms cost bottle caps to build, so be careful of how many you start off with right away. You don't want to use up all of your bottlecaps. 

Now will start out with 7 Dwellers at the vault door. You can drag them to the appropriate rooms and assign them jobs. You can determine the right jobs by another meter called the S.P.E.C.I.A.L Meter. Dweller has their own. This meter shows you the dweller's

Strength
Perception
Endurance
Charisma
Inteligence
Agility
Luck

If your dweller is high in Strength you would assign them to the Power Station.
High Perception would be assigned to the Water Station
Agility would be assigned to the Diner.

More rooms will unlock as you play. Each of these rooms will be governed by one of these SPECIAL stats.

Your Dweller's can also produce baby dwellers as well. Baby dwellers happiness will remain at 50% until they are grown and can be placed in a job.

To make things more interesting, your vault can have various disaster incidents occure. It can be attacked by raiders or infested by radroaches or even catch on fire.

Lastly, you can send your dweller out of the vault on quests in which they can fine and bring back various loot and bottlecaps.

It is a fun game and more challenging you might think."
20278,microtransactions are quite pricey but fun game wish there was more content though
20279,This game is really fun

The game is a nice port of a mobile game though. I don't have a phone that can play it, or a decent Ipod Touch. So this works for me! 

Really nice they decided to bring this to Steam!

I just won't be putting money into the game. It's not worth it, but the game itself is fun to mess around with. :D"

20292,Best free game I ever played...!!
20293,"Probably my favorite phone game ever. The game got its microtransactions, like every other phone game, but besides that, a masterpiece. And its free so if you're a die hard Fallout fan like me, or you ain't that into the franchise, try it out. You won't regret it."

20299,"Very fun game to waste time on, it has a similar playstyle as AdVenture Capitalist, meaning that you would play this game on short round bursts, I keeps getting funner when your Vault Dwellers go on quests because it turns the game into some sort of rpg. Even if you haven't played any of the Fallout games I would still recommed this game, partly because you don't NEED to buy microtransactions to do well.

Good Luck, Have Fun"
20300,"What a cool little game. I always wondered what went on in those bomb shelters in case of nuclear attack. I love this game especially because it's a simulation. When the couples get together, they say these cheesy cliche pickup lines and I can't help but laugh really hard. :) I hate it when the raiders attack. They steal your resources and kill your peeps if you don't arm them. Same with the roaches. Funny little game with a touch of armegeddon."
20301,"Nice to see it on x86/x64 Windows platforms now too - too bad Bethesda GS didn't upgrade the graphics atleast, or added an optional setting for it.
I do understand that this is made for touch devices which lack proper powerful hardware, but it would be a nice addition to play this in a better setting when you don't want to whip out your phone :p
Also save syncing would be nice too..

I do recommend it however for whoever doesn't know it yet and/or has a mobile x86/x64 windows device."
20302,Awesome design and gameplay mechanics! This game was already great in smartphone so just imagine it in PC !
20303,"Don't you hate it when you're getting laid and the raiders raid your vault ? :D My vault dwellers do too.

I played the life out of this game when it came out on android and I'm glad it's here on pc. 
Simple and fun game which makes you want to upgrade over and over to get everything maxed and then you send all your dwellers out to explore so that they die and you have to start over again"
20304,This is just another terrible mobile port. Dont give them a single cent.
20305,Ok but not. It is boring to wait. At normal speed is boring. Need some updates
20306,"Honestly, one of my all time favorite free to play games. Been playing it ever since it got released on the Google Play Store and haven't regretted a single minute spent playing this game. It was definitely a huge step bringing this game to PC and it was a good step. I can't wait to spend another couple hundred/thousand hours playing this addicting time waster."
20307,"Really fun game you are able to kill time with. This isn't a game you sit on all day, it's a game where you spend a small amount of time on it multiple times a day, well atleast at the beginning of the game. Later when the vault has started to expand and the caps are increasing you can spend up to an hour doing quests which are pretty fun.

+Have over 30 hours on the console version (Xbox one) which i currently am playing (SPENT NO MONEY)
+Have approximately 20 ish hours on the mobile version (SPENT NO MONEY)
+Just about an hour now (SPENT NO MONEY)

This isnt a ""Pay to win"" game, its a grinding game where you use your time and managing skills effectively to become more succesful.

Really fun game that is FREE and you can spend alot of time here,

20315,"Fallout Shelter is the best Bethesda-made (studio, not publisher) game since Fallout 3.

It's a simple, but rather polished idle game, based on managing a Vault from the Fallout titles.  There's three main resource productions to balance, Food, Water and Power, and then Caps is the currency for building stuff, with Nuke cola allowing you to skip wait times.

It's, at its core, a simple time-killer mobile game but that does not make it less enjoyable to play. The animations, personalization, theming and soundtrack are very well made, making you engage in one of those famous reward loops.
 
Time is the main gate to your progress, it is true that wait times can feel long occasionally, being this a title to be played in a ""Pet Game"" style, more so than some other idlers or city builders of the genre.

The game also offers the option to explore the wasteland, where you get a log of your pawn's progress delivered through their PipBoy, and the feature of quests, which add some very basic looting, combat and exploration mechanics, that are, however, rather fun to play.

I'd recommend investing some time in this if you are into this genre of games or are looking for a decent time waster."
20316,"This game is boring - I bored after 0,6 hours of playtime ... nothing interesting, nothing that PC player could expect. At least some economy or something like this instead of clicking on rooms. I cant give positive recommendation because I dont have such feelings toward this game."
20317,"I have spent loads of hours in this game since E3 on an Ipad2. The damn thing would crash from the amount of Dwellers I accumulated. Now that the game is up on PC, there will be no crashes interferring with my happy time this time.  

I'm happy and surprised they went and released this on steam. The game is free and there are microtransactions but that is entirely optional. It's a fun game when you're absolutely bored."
20318,What!? Fallout Shelter has come to PC!? Hell yeah!!
20319,"Pretty good port to be honest, have seen worse. Considering it's free I'd recommend you spend your bored afternoons playing this."
20320,Bandits somehow manage to break down vault door. I then quit game.
20321,"I used to play this on my iPod for about a week. Its a slow burn and got old fast. Such is the case here, but I got farther here than I did when I played it on my iPod. 

Its a simple little game where you collect resources by having fellows work in those area to produce them. These resources are automatically used up 'as needed', I guess. 

It reminds me so much of Idle Worship; but m u c h m u c h slower. RIP Idle Worship; the only casual game I would've played for longer than Clash Royale. 

Eventually the novelty dies and then it just becomes the slowest possible burn wating for fellows to come back from the wasteland to present me with things the RNG gave me, sometimes radroaches come out of the ground somehow desite a lab being where they came from. It would make more sense for them to come out of say, the wall, where earth actually is but nah. 

""Psi, you can't actually expect a mobile game of all things to have actual forms of logic.""
Actually yes, I can. Its super lazy to not have them coming out of the wall.
How many additional lines of code would it take to have come out of the wall.

Sometimes rooms will catch fire too. Again, this is done to keep it exciting but fires are even less so than the roaches cuz at least then, there is some level of danger. They could kill your dwellers. 
""Fire could kill your dwellers too!"" Sure, after a few hours, I'd imagine it would. 
I know at some point, some big things must arrive at the vault door. I know this because deathclaws are certainly a thing and there h a s to be a reason why you can upgrade the vault door to have more HP. 

Its a moblie game on steam. What did you expect. 

I would say ""Don't waste your time"", but that would be hypocritical of me since i wasted about 1.5 hours on this thing.

If you played it before and liked it, you'll like here as well.
If you're like me however, it burns out fast.

I reccomended it because besides the roach thing, there is nothing actually wrong about it.
It fits the actual games' art style, it has plenty of charm, visible requirements, and a handful of things to do from time to time. 
Its boring for me but maybe you'll find it more enteraining.

And if you do, just download it on your phone you iced-milk-drinking-dude-of-a-guy. /s
Don't waste drive space on this, there are far better experiences to be had here."
20322,Amazing game really
20323,"Fun Free game.  Similar to the older sims games.  Have a bunch of dwellers with stats that can level up, build bunker rooms and forage in the wasteland for gear and partsd.  Fight off Raider attacks, mutant cockroaches, giant rats and try to breed superhuman dwellers.  While it does have some in game purchases, noone of them are required to advance normally in the game.  They are conveniences like a robot that gathers the resources from your rooms, which is $1, lunchboxes, which you can get from quests anyway, etc.  It's definately not pay to win.

Sadly there is no multiplayer aspect.  I would like to be able to send raiding parties against other players and to fight those raiding parties off."
20324,"Can not link already existing accounts from Android. I would advise people to use an Android emulator if they want to play Fallout Shelter on their PC and their mobile/tablet aswell.

Otherwise, it would have been great to play it on Steam, it seems to run much smoother than on emulators."
20325,I LOST EVERYTING FUK THIS GAME >:(
20326,"Very good tycoon-like game, really liked to play it on Android smartphone. You can import your save from device on PC version and it works too! 

Also after quest update, it sucks that they added hard currency - Nuka Cola bottles. Yet, quests are themself are okey idea. Overall I recommend it over other idle clickers out here on Steam."
20327,really fun game
20328,Awesome game because i like to build civilazation
20329,"This was actually first released on mobile (I used to play it on Android, uninstalled it because my phone overheated when I played the game). Then the PC version just came out so hey I'll give it another shot (who doesn't like free game?), the game is not that bad at all....
Just DON'T buy any sort of ""Cash"" in the game, it doesn't worth your money at all, aside from that the game is decent for its simplicity. The main goal of this game is simple either, you need to develop your vault, make it really big and control it.

When you're bored this game can actually fill your time up, it's repetitive however.... You'll find yourself mostly clicking on stuff like collecting power, food, etc.

PC specs can be seen on my profile, but this game isn't demanding at all.... You can run the game using a potato."
20330,Its the mobile game but on PC. Nice time waster
20331,"Well as much as I can see this game is a mobile port, now whats so bad about this? Well like every F2P mobile game, you can't play the game without eather pay for it so you boost the everyliving  shit out of it or you are patient enough or live long enough to actually see some progress in the game.

The game runs in real time so if its day irl its day in-game, if  its night then its night in-game, this means if you want to built a room for producing food  you will have to wait several minutes till you can collect the resources. Same goes for the exploring part you let a Dweller go and hope he doesnt fall down a cliff and die, if he get back to the shelter he brings some money you can use to build some more room and so on and on and on..

Basically the game is too boring and too slow paced for a PC strategy ( i guess thats the category ) to be playable. But its F2P so yeah, go ahead and play...it....you can do it...yeah....go and download... this..... fallout shelter... OH YEAH  sounds exciting doesnt it... well its not."
20332,I like it.
20333,Awesome game.The key for success is inbreeding.Once your vault is full of sin you will have tons of bottle caps.
20334,as a long time fan of the fallout and other bethesda titles i love this game everything about it i enjoy my only complaint is that there is not much to do once you have all 25 floors filled
20335,"First of all ignore my steam playtime, I got this game on my iphone the day it came out and put probably 40 hours on it there.

Made a super vault that went all the way to the bottom.  Top four floors were designated for the vault's watch (Game of Thrones rip off) whose sole purpose was to train their SPECIAL to max out and defend the vault from raiders and deathclaws.  Those who were not training and manning the door were out exploring and doing quests.  Imagine a 200 person vault where 50 of them were in the watch, indestructable!

PROS
-simple game with no pay wall timers
-mindless gameplay you can do while waiting with your laptop
-Bethesda constantly updates it adding things (junk, quests, nuka cola quantum weren't in the game at launch)
-always side missions and mini tasks you can do, or you can close it and wait for your resources to regather

CONS
-the DLC or purchases for the game are linked to a save slot, so if you buy something and delete that vault it goes away.
-not too much gameplay if you are looking to make a guy and explore with him this is not the game for you (think tiny tower type game)
-can be slow going if you want to make a huge vault, it will take time and patients 


Overall a fun game, it is free so if you do not like it you've lost nothing but your time. Not somehting you'll be able to sit down and play for hours, but when you get the vault going it gets intense."

Thank You for wasting your time reading this :) Enjoy the Game.]"
20339,"I've poured hundreds of hours into this game on other platforms and all I can really say about the Steam release is, ""Why now?""

At first, the game seems fun. It's very new, still got that new car smell, and you're figuring out all the features. Once you've hit 100 dwellers and created all the rooms, you still want to snag all the achievements, right? So now you're building multiple skill-up rooms, more living quarters, more Nuka-Cola rooms, more power plants. You're still interested at this point, but you're losing it slowly. You've now found a routine, where you hop on the game for short moments at a time now. You complete the skill-ups that are waiting, you send some dwellers out for a quest. Your interest is still slowly dropping, but you're invested in it enough to continue playing at least once or twice a day for about five minutes at a time, not including quest time. At this point, you realize how inconvenient the game has become. You're still trying to finish each session more quickly with each passing day. You're a busy person, you have other, better games to play, but you dropped some money on this game months ago and you don't want that money to go to waste now, do you? Only now you really do know just how inconvenient the game is since you've been trying to only get in a few minutes at a time each session. Every time you log into the game, you're now trying to complete your tasks as quickly as possible in order avoid the elephant in the room. You've finished your task, you're hitting the Save option and you're about to exit the game when it finally happens: Random deathclaw attacks.
You say to yourself, ""You kidding me? I was a half a second short from exiting the game and doing anything else and NOW I need to spend another 5 - 6 minutes here to deal with this crap?"" I mean, you need to kill the deathclaws at some point. You could just go ahead and quit the game, but they'll still be there inside your vault when you log back on, so you might as well keep playing to make sure your dwellers aren't killed.

That's pretty much how I feel about this game right now. Just one more inconvenience, but I'm invested, I spent the time and the money, so I might as well keep playing so I can at least get my money/time's worth.

On a cellphone, it was alright, but the screen is so tiny and your battery is just drained quickly.
I picked it up last year when it launched on PC via Bethesda net. This version had issues even patching the game to keep it updated.
In my honest opinion, I don't know if this is a popular opinion here, but I believe the BEST version of this game is the Windows 10 version for two reasons.
The Windows 10 version included gamepad support (only handy if you're on a laptop and don't have a mouse) and it included Xbox Play Anywhere. Xbox Play Anywhere is a feature on the Windows 10 version that allows your save data to be shared in the cloud with your Xbox Live account so that you can play the game on your Windows 10 desktop or laptop and take your save data with you to your Xbox One console, hence the gamepad support. There aren't too many times when I'm playing the Xbox One instead of the PC version, but this also allows me to take my save data with me from my desktop to my laptop. For this very reason, I'm NOT leaving a positive review for the Steam version.
If you don't need the additional Windows 10 features, or you just can't stand the thought of using UWP games (how dare they, I know) or you've never played Fallout Shelter before, then by all means, check out the Steam version. Just keep in mind the inconveniences of this game. Again, I don't know why it took so long to bring this to Steam. This was the only game I even booted up the Bethesda Launcher for. =/"
20340,"its broken, unplayable, garbage by Bethesda 

the game crahed while trying to load a quest and i lost 3 legendery dwelers along with they weapons and armor.

avoid this game like the corona virus."

if  you need casual game for wasting time or refresh your mind after work this is your game
no need to spend real money just enjoy every second in game"
20346,not bad :D
20347,Free and Good.
20348,Very nice entretaning game :)
20349,"Hey, it's fallout shelter.  what more can be said?
"
20350,"Fallout Shelter is a free to play time management mobile game port where you manage your own Fallout Vault-Tec Vault. You have to manage food, water, and power to keep your Vault Dwellers happy. You can also send Vault dwellers to explore the wasteland or out on quests that you can play thorugh. Other than chosing your targets on quests and clicking on resorces, there's not much gameplay. It does have microtransactions, but I recommend it's not worth spending money on, you get free lunchboxes through to-do quests. It's simple to play and fun for awhile, though It's getting boring after the Vault gets to a point where it can survive without you. It's a great time waster if you need one. And I give this a 7/10."
20351,good game if you play it daily but sometimes i hate this game i had an vault level 130 and just be after an crash my vault from level 130 is going back to level 1 and now i cant have it back i need to redo all stuff that i have get on the game
20352,"Maybe this is somehow fun on a crappy phone, but this isn't even indy-game good as far as PC games go. It's just a crappy little game you'll forget about an hour later at most."

20357,yes
20358,Played it on my tablet and now I can play it on steam/pc. :) the graphics are good the background sound is good and this version has more features to it. Worth it. Pluss its free which makes it better.
20359,Can play for hours and still wont get bored.
20360,I've played for and hour and nothing really happened. If you want to stare at you screen for hours you should play this game. I think minesweeeper has more action than this game.
20361,"[h1] Good phone to PC game, but not very attracting [/h1]
I have played this game on my phone [b]for months[/b], so as I played it on pc and found nothing different or new, I think I am ready to review it.
I won't bore you and therefore keep it very short. You're meant to expand and prosper, create rooms in your [b]VAULT[/b] for dwellers.
You're meant to assign dwellers to different rooms based on their [b] S.P.E.C.I.A.L [/b] statistics (like Power generator room needs dweller with strength, therefore assign your strongest dwellers to Power generation room). New dwellers come randomly from wasteland or your dwellers can make out and have babies if you assign a male and female to a, [i] I forgot the exact name[/i], living room. 
[i] okey you know what? I'll skip to the end [/i], the game is a bit engaging at the beginning, but soon it washes off. You don't even feel accomplished if you fully dwell up your vault, and for people like me who played it hours and hours on phone, it's just a download-try-remove game.
[b] TRY IT [/b], if you haven't played it yet, do it. It's a good game. It needs you to reopen it once in a while though, like clicker heros or something, so best way to play it is play it while doing something else.
P.S. I will edit my review if something new comes up."
20362,"Fallout Shelter gives you control over your own vault and you as a overseer build it, keep your dwellers happy and out of the harms way. You can customize your dwellers appereance, change their habitat in vaults, explore wasteland and special quest areas outside your safe heaven while collecting, building equipment such as weapons, armors etc. Any action takes time, classic mobile game.  Fine for moments while you can't really play something but...why not play this on mobile/tablet then?
This is basically same thing as seen on iOs, Android or Bethesda Launcher for PC.

+ Fallout theme f2p sims
+ Random events, new dwellers, interesting mechanics of sustaining your vault
+ You don't really have to to spend any money on it, all you can get from game itself. No pay wall.
+ Achievments to gain for collectors
+ After all this time still new content rolling in
+ Hardcore game mode
+ Same as real life. Kissing for a while and faster than you know it, bam, you got kids!
- Mobile game graphically
- Time waiting better works on mobile than PC
- After a while very repetetive
- Singleplayer only. I would love to send invaders to some other vaults!
- Manual save management (if you want to move it to/from mobile/tablet etc. - steam otherwise run on cloud save so you can play same save between all your PC's, notebooks)
- Did I mention this game was made for mobiles?

20376,"So far I've found Fallout Shelter enjoyable. The Free to Play aspect can make certain things like characters and weapons inconvenient or a little difficult, but given the state of the low price indie game market on Steam or the rubbish coming out of Greenlight in the past few months, I'd say you get your money's worth out of 'buying' this. In that I mean it's entirely based on whether you enjoy resource management and casual building games. If you don't, you're going to not enjoy this game. Honestly, it's not so bad beyond the knee jerk reaction over a Free to Play game with microtransactions. I can't say you can call this pay to win because I've spent no money on this game, nor can I afford to, but I've gotten some pretty nice stuff from the scavenging and Wasteland exploration. To be honest, this game is entirely what you make of it to be. But it's a casual time-waster kind of game, so you shouldn't expect it to be a free game with AAA storytelling or something, it's a settlement management mini-game, basically."

If no patches provided soon, I suggest you try this game on your phone or Bluestack."
20387,Good
20388,"now you may be thinking ""ohhh boy another shitty mobile game on steam! Bet it's full of pay 2 win crap"" but personally this is a truly fun game! You don't need to buy anything in the store, as most of it you can find out in the wastelands. Tired of having games make you pay to unlock good weapons? ""pay 30 to unlock this minigun!"" This game is not one of those! Later on you can send out dwellers and scavenge for supplies out in the wastelands! When you have a god-tier vault and can send out dwellers with good equipment and 20 of each (Radaways and Stimpaks) you can find legendary recipies out in the wastelands that can be used to craft some of the best items in the game. The only thing you truly need to pay for (unless I just haven't found it yet) is the Mr. Handy. Caps, Weapon recipies, Legendary dwellers, Legendary weapon recipies, Pets, they can all be found without paying! Not only that but unlike other games with ""tier crates/boxes"" there are none of those in this game. One type of ""box"" and it dosen't matter! You can get something legendary from your first ever box in the game! (if your lucky!)

So get out there and lead your vault to the great beyond Overseer! Your dwellers need you!

20393,"I transfered my old save from my phone, now I look like some sort of haxor"
20394,"I've already spent almost 100 hours playing this game on the Windows Store, and I have to say that it's one hell of a time waster. Fallout Shelter doesn't have any specific goal in mind, so you can spend your spare time increasing your vault's population (and have your own Gary-themed whacko-fest); training your dwellers' SPECIAL stats for gameplay bonuses; or send them all out in the wasteland, and battle a dozen Deathclaws, for that chance to find a rare item - just remember to send them back to the vault if you're going to exit the game, because the timer keeps ticking even when you're out, and reviving a dead vault dweller costs a lot of caps. Tip for new players: a high food level keeps everyone happy and smiling in the face of danger; therefore, invest in it early in the game (or send the useless dwellers out to die in the wilderness), because it dwindles fast if you have too many people.

Overall, a fun casual game. There are microtransactions available, but your vault can survive even without purchasing any of them. You might have to spend more time playing and managing if you want some of the loot that can be purchased in the store, but a day or two of waiting wouldn't hurt.


And there you have it."

But you built it from bayonets and sat there alone
I hope your queen was worth it,

Just slept while we lived the dream

You won't miss the water,
Till the river runs dry
You won't miss the sunset,
Till it burns out the sky
You won't miss what you have,
Till it's finally lost
But you don't miss a bastard,

I mean you were always a prick,
But we still seemed to love you
We started this together and it should have stuck
But there's no room for a useless, miserable fuck
Well I know I was a cunt in the final days
It just filled me with venom, filled me with rage
To see someone not give a shit,
Despite of all of this

20401,"[b]Fallout Shelter is a great game, but it is not meant to be played on PC.[/b]

It first came out for mobile, and it sure seemed to be designed for it. You make a vault, gather resource and wait. Oh yes, there is a lot of waiting in this game: You wait for your resources, crafting, going to the wastelands, etc. The good thing for mobile is that you can open the game anytime, anywhere. This is obviously not the case for PC.

Also, your save files do not move over to different platforms. All vaults have their individual save files that are saved locally. This means, whatever progress and in-game purchases you made STAY ON THAT VAULT AND ONLY THAT VAULT. I don't know about you, but to me that seems to be an absolute waste of money. There are ways to import save files across mobile to PC, but really who would waste so much effort just for that. If they supported automatic file sync across platforms, this game would be much more enjoyable.

Don't misunderstand, I love Fallout Shelter. I have over 80 dwellers in my phone and it took a lot of time to reach that level. I just feel like playing the game on PC would be a waste of time since you can't sync your files anywhere else; it just stays there.

[b]EDIT:[/b]
First of all, a lot of you guys seem to think that I don't know that the save files can be moved from different devices. It is, in fact, possible and I acknowledged it in my review. There are dozens of websites that guide you on how to do it and even a Steam guide on that topic. 

Second, I marked this review negative not because I don't like the game nor the PC port; both are great. I'm did this because having played it on mobile for months, I just feel like the waiting and low maintenance made it seem like a mobile game. If you like to play idle/waiting games on PC, then this game is for you.

I spent months playing this game on mobile so I don't see a reason to suddenly move to PC just because it is released here. I've grown comfortable playing with my phone and I've decided to stick with it. I have moved my save files to PC just to try it out and it really works, but still not enough motivation for me to switch platforms.

20402,"Very good-looking resource management game with some control issue, 
such as when you need to quickly grab one of your subjects and 
drop them into an emergency,  and the cursor doesn't snap in 
properly, but minor issues. 
The major problem with this game is that it is designed to trigger 
people's OCD in a big, bank account-draining way.
Resources are not available unless you click on them at the end of 
each production cycle, minions don't level up unless you click on them‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs up to you: do you have an unlimited amount of time to spend 
staring at the screen and fighting the urge to spend lots of money 
to speed things up temporarily?  If yes, then play this game."
20403,"It's the same great game that we (some of us) had in our android device and we spent at least 8 hours to play with it !!!
And you can input (awsome fact) your android's game files to this one so you can keep playing your own game without any problems or you have to start it over !!!"
20404,Port of mobile game. But i still like it.
20405,"Enaknnya bisa bikin keluarga impian (Pfft). Gameplaynya juga bisa bikin kecanduaan untuk main di awal2. Kadang suka force out pas lagi main yang malah bikin hilang mood main. Parahnya item yang lagi mau di unbox malah hilang gegara force out. Pas masuk lagi, barang sudah tidak ada."
20406,bril
20407,everything soo slow without micro transactions

20410,I wasted a lot of time with this game on my phone. Really fun time waster and great f2p model in my opinion.
20411,"Bugs out something fierce. Screen scrolls all the way to the bottom without any possible way to scroll up again. Simultaniously ""A"", ""B"" and all sorts of buttons starts flashing. It's litterally unplayable. Might have to do with not supporting 21:9."
20412,BSOD after 40 mins..
20413,"Recommended.
I first picked this up for android while waiting for Fallout 4, since this was launched in the meanwhile as part of the hype. It has always been free, and is now available on Steam as well. Compared to other free tablet ports this is pretty decent, but it's nothing more than a timesink, to be honest.

Basically, you get your shot at constructing your own Fallout vault. A variety of rooms provide different bonuses or resources, and 4 main resources are needed: power, food, water and caps. What this game is about is pretty much down to expanding your vault while making sure you have the resource needed for it. 

As such, this is not a game that will challenge your intellect that much, neither will it require cool nerves or lightning reflexes, it's more about planning, building and then waiting while your resources stock up. The waiting I figure is part of making players buy certain add-ons, wich are sold in-game, but these are not necessary for the game, it just makes progression quicker. If needed you can also do quests to gain additional resources, and belive it or not, but the quest stories are sometimes better than the ones in Fallout 4.

All in all, as a timesink and considering it's free, there's worse alternatives out there, and for someone that's a fan of the Fallout franchise, this is a good way to quickly kill a few minutes when needed, or even an occasional hour."
20414,I like Fallout.
20415,Better than Fallout 4
20416,time consumer xD
20417,"It is a fun time wasting game. 

It is even better than the Fallout 4!"

You can`t play on the phone? 

So play on PC for free"

Good Gfx for what it is.
Good sounds for what it is.
Deep Breeding gameplay.
Lots of Items,guns,clothes
Lots of stuff to do. So far two type of quests and getting loot wholesale.
Crafting!

I have 45 dwellers so far and started the training process before i birth more.





A guy named Gary showed up at my vault door........i let him in........."
20425,"Choppy controls, UI is sometimes bugs out, sometimes you put a character to atack enemies and he runs around the room like a brain damaged llama, microtransactions are per save file which means you lose everything if you lose your save file. This is a mobile game ported to PC, worst kind of game, they didnt even bother to change anything."
20426,I enjoy this game. Very fun.
20427,After all the hype this got what a pile of garbage it turned out to be.
20428,awesome great for free time
20429,"4/10

If you don't have the autolooting/resource collecting robots then this game is absolute trash on top of the fact it's a ""waiting simulator."" You send guys out into the wastelands and it takes hours upon hours for them to find anything worthwhile and to have them come back to your vault also takes hours (yes real time). You save and exit to come back in and find everyone starving, pi.ssed off, and dying because they're too stupid to auto collect anything they produce in the vault since the developers expect you to use the robots. It also takes 3 hours real time for one of your pregnant vault women to finally give birth... On top of this I feel as if the ""rush"" option is a lie when it comes to the percentage chance of you succeeding/failing as you progress more and more into the game. You fail way more often then you succeed and it's quite sad.

When you send people out into the waste lands it takes half the time spent out exploring for the return trip back home. My best guy died out there when he had a minigun, survivor armor, and a golden retriever equipped to a radscorpion. He spent 12 hours and 15 mins in the wasteland and now it's going to take 6 hours and 7 mins to have him come back to my vault after resurrecting him for 643 caps... Boring.

The alarm sound also needs it's own specific checkbox option to be disabled because it is way too annoying. Having to disable all of the game sounds just to turn it off isn't what I wanted...

It's no different then most mobile games that make you wait and wait to accomplish something. Which in my opinion is extremely boring and ruins most of these decent free to play mobile style games.

Unless you're spending real cash to buy robots (to autocollect your resources on one specific floor so you need a bunch...), cola (to reduce times), and anything else they offer in their store then you might have fun. But if you're playing this for free it will only provide a few hours of fun before it becomes a nuisance/bore. 

On top of this it regularly crashes upon launch (at least for me) and to fix this I had to restart steam everytime and relaunch the game.

You can get more enjoyment out of a free internet flash game than this garbage. Like ""The Last Stand"" zombie flash games etc. Or better yet another free 2 play game like ""Leauge of Legends"" etc..."

Also don't buy anything, the items are essentially money dumps."
20436,If it happens that power went out while you're playing this game... boom... bye bye save data
20437,"First they came to our phones... Then they came to our Computers... At last, they came to Steam...

This game has made very little changes and from the start it was almost a clicker game where you would have to click on the production rooms to gather the supplies they make, and for a phone game it can be understandable, but not really okay by me.
The game would have been by far a better game if it was made more as a strategy game where power, food and water was continously gathered but always went up or down, so if you were heading towards too low you had to make a new room or find better people working that room, rather than ""just risk setting everything on fire"" and continue the clicker game basics where they started.

It's free, so why not give it a try? At best you'll love the boring gameplay and eventually find the quests okay, or at worst, you won't play past day 1."
20438,"like the SP version, and better improvement
"
20439,Played for few hours on smartphone and it's still the best game you evr have now on PC.
20440,"Spent more than 300 hours when I got it from the Bethesda store. Just don't buy anything in game because the purchases apply per save file. It's better without buying anything. Trust me. It is a very admirable game. I really like the conversations that happen between the dwellers and when you go for quests and raids. Sometimes they are whacky. Sometimes they are cringy. Sometimes they are just downright smooth. 

I highly recommend this game. 10/10."
20441,This game is a swift kick in the nuts to the franchise of some of the most badass RPG games made.

20443,I Named My Vault 404 Because It'll Never Be Found
20444,Shit game. Unless you're willing to pay real money to get boosts you'll find progress to be insanely slow and since you won't have weapons or the man power a single roach infestation will single handily wipe you out while your dwellers just run around dying without attacking.
20445,"Have this game on my phone, its good. and with glorious 60 fps. Still wish I had the opportunity to transfer my save from my phone into this pc port :("
20446,Already have a young stud who has gotten three girls pregnant and I've only been playing for about 30 minutes. The Wasteland is a wild place.
20447,It's a game app port that got moved into PC. However this is one of the best ports believe it or not. The game is just as additive on PC as it is on phone. If your pretty much done with fallout 4 this game will be even longer.

20449,"As of right now the game has caused many issues on my pc which include but not limited to:

-Crashing my PC
-Troubles tabbing out even in windowed mode
-Toolbar in game disappearing randomly
-World saves corrupting and deleting themselves

Now that I've got that out of the way I spent many many hours on this game via Mobile app which was a very good time waster when not doing other things. With this on PC it means I can do the same again without having to have my phone to hand constantly. Until these issues I've stated above have been fixed I wouldn't like to suggest this to anyone as it could cause issues with your pc as I've had to Hard restart my PC 3 times already due to this game. 

Over all the game is fun and is good to waste time on if you have it spare. If the issues I've stated above get fixed then I'd happy say to all to download and play."
20450,"Love this casual game, a must for any gamer..."
20451,"Just like many others, I too started playing this game since it was first released as an android app. Created multiple vaults and had fun. If you're looking for a fast paced or fps/adventure/rpg this isn't for you. This is a game I would recommend playing when you just want to sit down and relax, and occassionally have to click to make a decision for your dwellers. The game provides in-game purchases if you are impatient to get some legendary loot, but I promise you, buying lunch boxes and pet crates are not necessary, for with time, good loot will come. Either way, I rate this game a 10/10 but it can get boring if playing for hours straight. So just use the game as a, ""I'm bored"" or ""I' need to waste some time."" Game."

That being said, this game is actually pretty decent. It's quite addicting to micromanage your vault dwellers and attempt to create the perfect vault. Collecting caps, Vault Dwellers, Weapons, and gear is pretty fun. It's also a pretty good mobile port! Maybe my expectations were low from past experiences, but I was quite impressed how it runs fine on my PC.  It's the perfect game to slightly idle to while doing homework.

20461,"Starts out looking like one of those watered down facebook games with shallow game play that only involves waiting for timers to run and repeatedly ask for money.

Limited UI  like one of those watered down facebook games with shallow game play that only involves waiting for times to run.

Involved lots of sitting and waiting for timers to run and repeatedly ask for money like one of those watered down boring face book games.


Whole game looks like it's merely an effortless reskin of one of those watered down facebook games with shallow game play that only involves waiting for timers to run and repeatedly ask for money.

Even after building a facility, you have to click on it again anyway when it makes power very intermittently, which is really only an inconvenience, and very poor game play mechanics. (Almost ever game I ever played had regular and AUTOMATIC output on production facilities). Shallow gameplay.

Cant even get displaying simple room conscruction requirements right. It says it requires ""12 dwellwers"" then when you get 12 dwellers, it changes its story, and says you need other things. Kind of reminds of a spoiled princess that always asks for more when you give her what she wants, then reprimands you saying you did it wrong and you should feel bad and give them more, or more money(Surprise, you can actually give them more real life money too)


Everything about this game is shallow, no work put into game design. EVERY mechanic simply consists of clicking a button and waiting for some timer. (Clock watching simulator is not a very rich game experience.) 


Shit/Shit
Do not waste your time ,they only want your money and arent even willing to put any work in for it.
Only buy if you like sitting watching timers and giving away money to people trying to take advantage of you. (I guess this game is just an effort to exploit people with autism's money.I guess its a legal ""respectable"" way to do that)"

20471,"UPDATED REVIEW:

Since I've played it quite a lot now and know what I'm doing I'd say this is quite a decent little game. Build up your vault, go on quests, get loot, craft stuff, make children and that's about it. Pretty simple but since its all fallout themed its quite a nice game.
There are some problems with it for example in a single room you can't have two people both with pets, zooming in & out and moving the camera with the mouse is a bit annoying, especially when you keep accidentally grabbing a vault dweller instead of moving the camera. The graphics aren't good, could atleast make it look a bit better for the PC verison. The elevators aren't realistic, a character can go down an elevator right after another one just went down. After a while you see every location in the game and stuff just repeats, would be better to get a bit more of a variety. Perks/skills don't work like they do in the main games, you can have a level 50 dweller with the best weapons and armor and still have a bit of trouble killing high level enemies, whereas in the main games you just 1 shot everything at that level. There's also a lot missing that are in the main games, not many enemies, locations, items, or characters aside from the legendary ones. Hope they add more to it eventually.
Since its a FTP game it does take a long while to do things like beat quests and pretty much everything else, you'll probably just keep going back to it once or twice a day until its all done however its not a pay to win game although there are micro transactions. You can easily get everything done without having to pay a cent. Just takes a while.

Overall a decent little game. I'd give it a 8/10. Needs more content really. 




Original:

Bout time it came to Steam. Now I actually want to play it. It's a pretty cool little game but it does have its problems. Would be good if there was a paid version cause I'd prefer to get a nice big vault up and running easier without having to wait weeks while I make 50 children. There is a dumb glitch where if you alt+tab in and out it sometimes messes up parts of the UI which is a big problem really cause its one of those games where you just leave it open and wait for things to happen so it'd be good if minimizing worked better. Aside from that it's a fun experience even though it's full of FTP garbage but you don't have to pay for anything, you just obtain things much slower which is fair for a free game. A fun mini-experience for all Fallout fans."
20472,"[h1]I played this game for a very, very long time on my phone, and I would like to share this story...[/h1]

It was a quite day in vault 326.
112 Veteran vault dwellers were home, going about their daily duties. 10 More children. Mike and Lisa are expecting their 2nd child. Hoping for a girl this time.
They had created a strong hold, here in the rock. The raiders and deathclaw, easily held at bay by their strong door, and battle hardened guards. Mike had become comfortable in their home under the waste. ""We're safe here."", he told himself.
Mike looked at Lisa over the clipboard he was holding. She was pruning some plants in the hydroponic guarden.
""Did you hear that?"" asked Mike.
""No, hunny. What did you hear?"" She stoped her chores and walked over to her husband. He looked back at her with a concerned look in his eye.
""I thought I just heard something downstairs""
""It's probably just Tony dropping boxes off the shelf again. You know he thinks he's stronger then he really is.""
""Heh. Yeah, you're probably right."" 
The sound of Jim's 44 rounds rang out through the 6th floor halls, and echoed violently up the elevator shaft. Mike's head jerked around tward the elevator door, and then back to Lisa.
""That definatly wasn't Tony.""
The screams of the storage room workers could be heard, frantic and desprite, between the sparatic gun fire. 
""This isn't a normal attack,"" Mike thinks to himself, ""usualy Bob and Ray have this under controll by now.""
A new sound can be heard outside the door. It's getting closer.
[i]Bang... Scratch... Bang... Bang...[/i] The door shook. It was not ment for this kind of treatment. It couldn't hold out for long.
Mike took his wifes hand. This was the end. They both knew.
The molerats burst through the weakened door, into the garden room. They were hungry. They were relentless. 
None could stop the molerat menace. One by one, room by room, they mercilessly slaughtered every man, woman, and child. The vault was theirs now.
Molerat kind has a new home.

TL;DR
~10/10
~Molerats OP
~Will build more molerat habitats"

A few hundred hours, 11/20 Legendary dwellers, nearly every Legendary weapon/outfit, a mass of pets, 160+ 70 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. dwellers trained from level 1. No sync with GooglePlay, and my achievements don't pop when transfering a save?

20482,"DON""T EVER SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME! 

heres why, all microtransactions are PER save file. what does that mean?
if you lose your save file, delete it, it gets corrupted, OR you get game over from the games mechanics, you LOSE ALL purchases forever.

with that said the game itself is a heavily downgraded version of Sim-tower, with the same exact graphic setup. which btw Sim-tower came out in 1994... just saying"

20484,"[6.5/10]

fallout shelter formula just does not fit PC gaming. 

as far as mobile games go. fallout shelter is better than most management games out there. it's quite pretty and faithful to the fallout ambience. you can have your own vault, training dwellers, equip outfit and guns, sending them to explore the wasteland really capture the feel of the fallout style. but it just does not fit PC gaming. as a mobile, you can chick anytime, anywhere, but not pc.
"
20485,"You'll enjoy how fun this game is, until you find a Deathclaw and his two other buddies kool-aid kicking down your vault door in an instant.

This game is a classic as it was once exclusively only available for mobile and through Bethesda's Steam, and has a very acceptable use of microtransaction (which I personally never bought). It's fun, very addictive, easy to learn, solid gameplay, and frustration in a fun and challenging way. Wether or not you enjoy RPG-like elements, this game is fun and playable to anyone who can run Minesweeper on a shoe."

20490,"It's finally on Steam with achievements. I've been playing this game for a long time now first on smartphone and then on PC, and it's simply awesome! 
higly recommended!

if they bring Farmville Country Escape to Steam I sell my smartphone because I won't have any use for it anymore. hehehe"
20491,F2P love it :D
20492,"::edit 2020 update::
Still broken for those with multiple flight sim devices.
Initially devs denied the issue existed, but now the acknowledges it but does not fix it, only suggesting to unplug the joysticks.
In my setup there are 4 such devices and unplugging and re-plugging them to play a faulty game that has done nothing to deal with a well known Unity issue is not sensible nor ideal.

Self proclaimed elitist clowns need not reply to this. It would seem they are unable to read or comprehend plain and simple words. The nature of PC is that we all have varying setups, and occasionally slip into a situation where something doesn't work for your particular setup.
Sometimes it's an issue the devs didn't think ahead to (like this one, where Unity engines default enabling to accept joy input without option to disable causes the issue).
I'd probably lay the blame more on Unity than this title in particular, but the lack of willingness of Fallout Shelter devs in tackling the issue is concerning.

I have reported to to both the Fallout Shelter devs and the Unity devs, going back several times of the last 3-4 years. I suspect it has been fixed in the most recent versions of Unity, but anything based on previous versions still suffers.

Another game that suffers the issue is Yet Another Zombie Defense HD, along with a few other Unity titles.
::edit 2020 update - end::

The move to PC is not well thought out.
I'm a flight simmer, and thus have about 4(*) joystick type devices connected to my PC.
This game might work great on a game pad, but with all the devices i have connected it is unplayable.

Unplugging them is an option, sure, but the real issue is if you're going to code joystick support into a game, you also need to code the ability to disable joystick input.

There are hundreds of other games that support joysticks that don't suffer from this issue.
It might be a good game, but the experience is needlessly ruined by lazy coding.
Back be up here guys, we all have unique setups and developers can't forget this.


So a few years have passed, tried this again, issues still remain however a dialogue saying to disconnect joysticks now appears.
If it were a single joystick connected to an accessible port then fine, but i have 4 such devices and none easily accessible (flight sim enthusiast).


(*)Yes, 4 joysticks might not make sense to some, here is the detail, and is fairly standard for a keen flight simmer...
1 for Stick or yoke, containing usually 2 axes and a few buttons
1 for Throttle quadrant, up to 8 axes + buttons
1 for rudder pedals + toe brakes (1 - 3 axes)
1 for radio comms, buttons and axes ext.."
20493,"Great port from a mobile game if you dont have enough storage space or if phone slows down.

+Smoother framerate
+Ability to play full screen compared to the small size of phone or tablet

-No way to transfer save data from cloud to PC, to continue progress.
-Doesn't save automatically, so you have to manually do it from the options menu."
20494,"Got this version just to see if it remembered that i had played it but i guess that's just too complicated for a small company of untrained kids like Bethesda. Seriously though, is it really that hard to transfer saves from the PC version to the Steam version? Cause i'm pretty sure it's as simple as adding a log in screen so people can log into their Bethesda accounts.

It would be best to only get this version of the game if you have not played one of the other versions or have already gotten to the end game on one of your saves and don't mind being forced to start from the beginning again. But other than that, not really worth it in my opinion unless they fix it so that you can keep your saves from at least the Bethesda Launcher version."
20495,"Its amazing and i love it, its exactly like Adventure Capitalist but better, love you bethesda.

It would be nice if you added steam trading cards!"
20496,"AWESOME game. Really glad to see it finally come to Steam. I've played Fallout Shelter on my Iphone and from my desktop before. This will be my third vault haha. Looking forward to building up another vault. 

Great game for simple gamers.

10/10 recommended."
20497,"I now have twelve women in my shelter, all pregnant by the same man, at the same time.

10/10 Price is right."
20498,"Good for Android, casual indie pay2win for a PC. Only windows"
20499,This is a game to put on in the background. I should probably give it a negative rating. But it's something to put on in the background. I recommend this game to no one.
20500,love this game used to play it on ios
20501,"--Thoughts: 
- Nice game to use while multi-tasking.  
- Layout is simple and friendly enough.
- The game design is fairly straight forward.
- You get to learn to charm the pants off of people... literally.

--Bonus: The daily objectives are a good way to get some easy caps and lunchboxes (rewards such as special vault dwellers, outfits, weapons, caps, junk, resources, etc).

--TIP: Make sure you keep an eye on the resource production.  The production rooms can be expanded, upgraded, and manned by multiple people (to a limit)."
20502,"Great little free game!

Do not expect anything groundbreaking or new... the ideas it is using are tried and true and can be found in so many other games out there. However it is done WELL and that is the important thing
It is quite addictive and has a great Fallout vibe to it. You would be crazy not to get it

20505,really fun n a good game to play if you get bored
20506,Im glad this game got released on steam since my phone couldnt handle it. I'd compare this game to adventure capitalist but fallout shelter has gotten much deeper since all the updates.
20507,"Highly recommended. I've spend countless hours in this game when it was only avalible on mobile devices and I'm extatic that you can transfer saves from these devices. Intuitive gameplay, dynamic quests, random encounters, it has it all. I always giggle everytime my dewellers romance eathother, olny to be interupted by a deathclaw attack. And the little hidden stories in quest mode expanding on the Fallout universe are the cherry on top of the cake. Would 100% play for days on end, and highly recomend for anyone that is a Fallout fanatic. Just download the game now, a must have! 10/10"
20508,"Played this game a lot on my phone, moved over to the Bethesda PC version and now I've got it on Steam. It's kind of addicting. It's definitely a cash grab, but I've got a very big, full vault with lots of good weapons and strong dwellers and I only once caved in and payed 99 cents for some nuka-colas when I was a little impatient back when I first started playing."
20509,Love This Game Still Have It On My Cell Phone!!
20510,"Played this on mobile and loved it. Saw it here and had to have it. Love this game. It is Fallout, which was its first great point. So far no issues and am loving that it is the same here as on mobile. Great game, even if it does take time. But that is part of the fun. Set it up, let it run and check on it now and then through out the day. Or, sit and watch and play it with some mucsic playing in the background and just laugh at the little sayings that the dwellers come up with in the different rooms. All around great game and would recommend it to any and every one."
20511,Better than the Fallout4 Vault-Tec DLC.
20512, RUNS GREAT! ALSO VERY FUN GAME TO PASS TIME!
20513,"Got in, Game ran like shit, realized i had 4 other games open, realize i have shitty computer. close out tabs, throw crappy pc out window. 941/941"
20514,not bad
20515,"YES!!! finally all the waiting was worth it!! :p i played this game in the past, but having achievements it's just a plus to play this gem!"
20516,Better than Fallout 4.
20517,"Short: A good game to waste away some time. Aside from controls, I see no difference between the PC version and the Mobile version of Fallout Shelter. Which ever device floats your boat.



Long:
1. It can be played via Keyboard, Mouse (my method) or controller(*).
2. While you can make purchases, you do not need to spend any money to progress.(**)
3. Most of the excitement, for me, is in the overwatcher's missions.

Alright, first keep in mind that this came out first as a mobile app. The graphics are simple and cute. The playstyle is also fairly simple and does not really offer anything 'new'. But it is a good game to play if you have a few minutes to waste but cannot or do not want to get invested in another game. OR if you want to multi-task for some reason. (Window-mode movie watching or working on homework/projects.

Keep in mind that boxes earned in a game (the free boxes) can not be opened in another save. But you can get pets and Mr. Handy from them. You get one box every 7 days you check in and you can randomly get a task that rewards with a box as well. (Same with the overwatcher missions. Some times they reward boxes, pets, outfits, etc.)

Customization mostly comes later in the game, but you are free to re-name the people as you get them (or randomly during play). Once you unlock (via x amount of people living in the vault) certian facilities, you can alter their hair style/color and make clothing/weapons without relying on chance. Dinners and living quarters also have themes (fairly new) which auto change during certian events. You can also collect themes to change it anytime you want.

Holiday events are enjoyable enough without feeling overwhelming. But you will find lots of slow periods while playing. Especially on Survival mode where building up too quickly has deadly drawbacks.


(* Not sure if it auto detects for a controller, as I rarely use them on PC gaming.)
(** That being said, progress can be very... very slow at times. It is a pay to be lazy mechanic more than anything.)
"
20518,"Fallout Shelter is simply a freemium ""Game"" using the Fallout series as a crutch. It is, in essence, a clicking simulator with no thought, no way to lose and no actual point to playing. Every action just leads to another action, and in essence forms an infinite loop. Look no further than silly ""Clicker"" or ""Idle"" games. Of course, if this is your cup of tea, then I'm certain that you'd enjoy this game. It has been out on Mobile devices for quite some time, so take it as you will."
20519,This game is why fallout 76 is the way it is and why the creation club exists. They made so much money from idiots buying hundreds of dollars worth of lunch boxes only to lose their save a couple of months down the road.
20520,my water is running low im uninstalling
20521,"Always wanted to try this, but never wanted to download it on my tiny-screen phone. Now, today, it has finally launched on Steam! BUT. Alas, I cannot even launch the game due to an error stating that it cannot render the ""requested"" resolution of 1024x576, which I would never play any game at that low of a resolution while gaming on a GTX 980. It then proceeds to attempt LOWER resolution, but considering that it's attempting to launch the game in 1024x576, I don't see how anything lower would help the issue at hand. I would love to try and fix the issue myself, but as soon as I click ""OK"" on the error screen, it closes the game. 0/10.

ALSO, had to try and launch the game roughly a dozen times to get my ""play time"" up to 5 minutes just to post this review. Fun."
20522,"[h1]TL:DR[/h1]
[i]The reason as to why Vault Boy is always smiling.[/i]

[h1]The Good Stuff[/h1]
+Dark Fallout humor at its best
+Easy to learn survival strategy
+Protect your Vault Dwellers from the wasteland, gather resources, and find pets AKA Dogmeat
+Scavenge the wasteland for goodies like junk and outfits, trust me those are goodies in this game
+Quests that provide bigger rewards than scavenging
+Can easily walk away and come back and have nothing catastrophic happen to your Vault, as this game is not time based long term 
+Deathclaws. Yes, they go under the Good Stuff section. 

[h1]The Ok Stuff[/h1]
=Login, logout, login, logout, logout, login, login, deathclaw... definitely logout. 
=Slow start, but it picks up after a couple days/deathclaws
=Rocks.
=It's annoying to build elevators, as all rooms become more expensive the more you build of each one

[h1]The Bad Stuff[/h1]
-An iOS to PC port, those usually never work well
-In-game ads for the game... really bro? 
-Dragging dwellers is very glitchy

20523,"own it on my phone and already owned it on pc but now its on steam so its easyer to use a no log in each time, love this game and love fallout to death"
20524,"After the first Mission, where you need to build a power thing (IDK)

My game bug's so i can click on anything, but if im lucky enough to click on the Dweller, my game crash. GG"
20525,"Dweller assigned first job, immediately decided to go on a coffee break.
I see how it is."
20526,would recoemned but needs a few touch up as it says build a room as you got pleay tutoriel and the building thing keeps disaperaing and have to close etc but orther then that its brill ill be addming more hours as i do :) loving this i use to love this on my phone but saddley its a bit small on an android phone but on a computer its so much easier just got make sure the screen settings are set up or my building sign will disappear :)
20527,So much waiting  . . .
20528,"200+ Hours on both android/ios devices

Still better than Fallout 4."
20529,More fallout is always a good thing. Its fun and a great time waster.
20530,"So I made a vault full of Garys

10/10"
20531,Pretty fun society building game. Plus it's free and doesn't have paid mods so it's basically already better than Fallout 4.
20532,Great game where you get to build and manage your own vault.
20533,Very nice game 11/10
20534,"Breeding simulator of the millenium. You literally put 2 people in a room with shitty music while the rest works. They pretend to understand themselves, get into a room, she comes out pregnant and he with a smile and never talk again.

TL;DR good game! you dont have to spend a cent literally. But the game is so fun you'll want to buy something. Might get a little slow without those colas but its manageable. You play this game like Ogame for example."
20535,nothing needed to say about it ...IT JUST WORKS
20536,"This is a cool game, i'v have over 500 hours invested in this game on bethesda launcher.
However steam version is ""attached"" to a controll scheeme (?!) and you CAN NOT play with keyboard and mouse !!

If you want to play this game download bethesda launcher and have fun !"
20537,"Have played this game on iOS since launch, and enjoyed the easy way to kill time aspect of the game. Now with this version, which makes gameplay slightly easier than a phone screen, I'm looking forward to ""restarting"" the game so to speak. Definately recommend to anyone who enjoys the Fallout franchise, and anyone who wants to play a game that doesnt require setting aside hours for set gameplay."
20538,should have been on pc when it first came out
20539,"A free game which is designed for mobiles and tablets.

It is enjoyable if you are the type of person that enjoys clicking repetively on rooms to collect power, food and water, which in turn slowly builds your bottle caps (money) allowing you to expand your base over time.

As per usual with these type of games, they make it relatively easy in the beginning so that you feel you've accomplished something, some form of base which you're happy with, just before the real slowness sinks in, and the possibility of your wallet feeling the weight of your growing lack of patience kicks in. 
To speed the game up, which is another typical feature of mobile games, it has got a 'pay to win' system where you can buy additional lunch boxes to collect junk, food, water, power and those trusty bottle caps. Without these purchases you may experience boredom and even death due to the extremely slow and grindy nature of the game.

What's a couple of pounds/dollars here and there? Nothing until you realise you've lost track of how many small purchases you make and you end up living a real life desolate waste land experience in an alleyway out the back of Burger King.

I write this review from my friends couch, as I suffer paranoid flashbacks each time a bottle cap drops or a lunch box rattles.


I would recommend this to achievement hunters or people with bad computers, otherwise there are definitely better games to spend your time on."
20540,Five minutes of fun!
20541,"Get new PC after brother F***s it up-
Windows 10
Appstore has fallout shelter on pc? sweet.
lost all data from my old android, figure ill throw 15$ into it to boost.
3 days pass
Oh Fallout shelter on steam now? With achivements? Yes please.
OH WAIT the 15 dollars ive spent (on top of mad money spent on android version) are down the drain.

tl;dr GREAT GAME but f*** i wish i could import windows appstore saves into steam.

EDIT: SUPER buggy. Where did my 4x wasteland return speed pet go? Why did the Fat Man i got on a quest dissapear? I have plenty of starage. What the F***

EDIT EDIT: My cat was with jericho who died in the wasteland. so the bug didnt take away my stuff, it just made it so i couldn't see his progress in the wasteland until death."
20542,"As a fallout fan, this game amazing done. Yes I know it isn't perfect but its still good enough to enjoy it. Also hey its free.

As for the microtransactions, they do seem a little bit wrong here since they give you many vault boxes and instantly stops in the hope you will buy some using your money.

But other than that, This game is a solid 7.5/10"
20543,"This game has very little going for it, other than biting off the concept of Fallout without any of the actual gameplay."
20544,i like alot great game
20545,Its Good
20546,"This game is a pile of crap that will let you pay for something that you will than easily lose forever.
it's the shlttiest kind of P2W on the market.
"
20547,Great little game for wasting hours on.
20548,"Really Fun - I usually dont like platform games but this one is great it looks pretty good too and had a lot of thought put into it, definatly worth it for Free."
20549,"Great game on phone, too bad that you can't get your saves from there.
If you're playing for the first time, go ahead, it's great fun.

The reason I downvoted is because of the missed opurtinitty to make a cloud save between phone / tablet / pc (even Punch Club had this feature, Bethesda fix pls)"
20550,"Played almost 100 hours when it first came out on mobile. Very fun game, well polished and doesnt force you to play X amount of time. Want to play 15 minutes an go. go play and leave it whenever you want. 

Now in steam I say there is no excuse to at least try it and see how good of an Overseer YOU can be."
20551,"I don't know what yall dumbass people be sayin about Fallout Shelter but I play this on my phone. I don't mind the control because their not hard.

Pros: Everything with the mobile game

Cons: Nothing just these stupid ass people hatin on fallout."
20552,"I have played this on my Android device and on Windows version (Through Bethesda launcher) and this is just the best on PC. Why? Because it's lag-free experience and you can play with wider screen.

Recommended all the way!"
20553,I have the game on phone so and i love it but when you have a max population and biggest vault you can have its hard to just start over i would love it if you made the game compatible with saves on your phone
20554,"oh wow, i'm really surprised. you was able to port it and keep most of the bugs in place. and even add new ones. great job! I downvoted it on play store for bad controls, I'm downvoting it here for same reason. keep up the stable quality!"
20555,very nice game :)
20556,"A relatively nice, fairly active 'idle' game... but seriously Steam needs to stop bringing MOBILE games to the PC... it's ruining the PC gaming community in favor of 'clickbait' games.. at least this one doesn't have random freaking advertisements."
20557,~
20558,"it's a great game for a free game ,but i really play a lot on bethesda launcher and i want my vault 101 back, steam plz"
20559,I already played it on phone and i can say that it is an very good game
20560,"This is a fun game to mess around in, It will not be a game you will play for days but if you are waiting for a download of just a little bored its take your edge off things."
20561,"Great game and time consumer. Amazing features, plenty of content. Game does not require paying with real money to unlock features, you can unlock everything free! Played it on mobile devices, and play it again on Steam! One of my favourite game on mobile devices."
20562,I had never got a chance to play this game so i thought well its time to download the one of the site and i hope it would come to steam my wish came ture this game is so fun at all about checking the right skills to my your workers happy this better than fallout 4 this is way more fun i swear.
20563,Entire vault was wiped out by 1 radroach 10/10
20564,"Okay, been playing this game since the original Android release. I am happy to say that my saves have been transferred successfully to yet another platform. This game is pretty fun, but at times can get repetitive. That said, with all of the new questy stuff added, it's definitely a fun game. I still have my original Vault save, and I am happy as can be that I can now play this on Steam, without mucking about with the STUPID Bethesda net launcher. =)"
20565,"The game came out for phones first,
later for bethesda launcher,
much later for windows store and xbox,
and now on steam ([u]finally[/u] thank you gaben).

I played the game since it first came out (before fallout 4) and I really enjoy playing it.
A pretty cool thing is that you can always switch between your platforms by copying and pasting your savegame in the savegamefolder of your choice (pc/handy), check out the steam guides or google for a tutorial. This is how play anywhere should work!"
20566,"I've ""played"" some of this game on mobile, then on the bethesda pc platform a lot, then on the windows store version which was a terrible thing to do for the immense pain that it is to even create an account on that freaking service.

Frankly if Steam had a ""mixed"" option to rate games, I would probably be rating it that, since it doesn't, I tend to lean a bit more in the whole ""negative"" rating area.

For a simple reason really.

Fallout Shelter is a mobile game that has been ported to pc, problem being that when detracting this game from the mobile ""ecosystem"" you essentially missed out on any incentive to keep playing it, just try it for a while and you'll see it's true, and it's for a basic reason, it's simply easier to give a follow up and a check up in the phone that you don't use always for games or work, than it is to give that kind of attention and consistency on the pc.

Pair that up with the fact that since it is a ""free to play"" title, the game obviously has in-game transactions, something that's no bother, makes sense really, but again, the incentive for even paying for this transactions goes out the window when you take into consideration the simple amass of trainers, as well as memory editing tools that are out there.

Some people might start comparing those tools to piracy when being used in ""games"" such as this one...

The pc version of this game is no more appealing to anyone that hasn't played the mobile version than any other flash incremental game, which in a way, if that's what you're looking for, then this game it's fine, just know that is one of those ""keep opening every day to do stuff that you'll continue the next day"" in order to actually end up simply getting flustered and annoyed once you get most of the stuff there is to get in the game and whatever motivation, or satisfaction you had to keep opening lunch boxes in order to get yet another replicated outfit or weapon, its gone.

Just like any other mobile ""free to play"" game this is nothing more than a successful attempt from Bethesda to create a game that essentially uses the already amazing Fallout popularity as a pedestal in which to have a name, but besides the superficial similarities don't think you'll get more from this than you will get from any other ""free to play"" game, you'll enjoy it at first, then you'll stop playing it after spending some cash on it, or cheating to give yourself everything, making the game in whichever way you choose, redundant, and a dull experience in anyway you see fit.

Some might say i'm being ""ungrateful"" or ""entitled"" because i'm posting this in a ""free"" game, but let me just remind you that right past the ""play now"" button on Steam, there's a series of items that charge money for you to get them.

Others might add that any game becomes a chore once everythings unlocked, but I differ, Dishonored, Styx, Deus Ex, even freaking Fallout, become if anything a lot more interesting once you get a lot of your locked abilities available to you, they expand and they open areas in the game in every sense of the word, for you to keep exploring, for you to keep experiencing, and enjoying.

This game doesn't expand on anything, because it's a simple formula, a cycle if nothing else.


This is fine for fans that want to throw more cash at Betheda's feet, not for fans that want to get unique or interesting experiences like the ones they got from playing the actual Fallout games.

If there's anything positive to say about this, it's that at the very least it succeeds in what it sets out to do.

I'm not saying it shouldn't be on pc, The more games the better right? I'm just simply stating that when removing this game from it's mobile ""enviroment"" there's little to no incentive to actually play it the ""proper"" way, mostly when you take into consideration the proper way of playing it, signifies nothing more than: Wait till you get tired, and want to spend on some random item to follow the absurd and ridiculous skinner's box scheme set by this game to succeed.

You might as well be ""playing"" a Fallout themed slot machine."
20567,"A port of the mobile Fallout game, which I played when it came out. The controls feel much clunkier than they did on tablet, and the micro transactions are much more annoying and intrusive now. 

A mildly diverting game that you can leave running in the background."
20568,"First of all. The game is good compared to what people say, it is not a ""I'll sit down for 5-6h straight and play it game"". So don't expet to get that right away from it. If you don't like that, you should for sure not play this.

People keep complaining about this game how you need Nuka-Cola to speed up everything and that only fanboys will like it. The thing is, the game is out for a year allready, and Nuka-Cola thing, is not even a half year old thing. It wasn't used before, and you don't need it now. Sure, that means you have to wait for around 6h for something to be done. But that's how the game was designed, it wasn't made for you to play it 5-6h straight, but to jump like once a day or every 3rd day on it and just check stuff out. There is even bots that can collect stuff for you automaticly even when you are offline that you can get frew quests (witch is the biggest complain I see yet), and when you don't play, all your things drain super slowly. Your people won't die, if you done everything right, I haven't played for a week and they lived. 

I played this game since it was reliesed on android but then switched to PC because my phone is not the best one. I had a population of over 160 people, in less then a month and didn't spend a single coin on the game. People are always just jumping to the HATE vagon for some reason. You can get even everything from the game for free frew quests. Just, calm down people, this is not Fallout 4.5, and it won't be that good.

I expect to be called Fanboy as that is a also common thing :) because liking something is a crime apprently now.

Is the game good? Yes. Is it god's creation? No. Should you give it a try for a few days? Yes, and if you don't like it, then don't, just, don't try to dig a hole for people that do, jeez.

I would say the game is a 7/10. Can be fun, if you don't play it 24/7, but just for fun."
20569,"Played for hours on my smartphone. Then for even more hours on the Bethesda launcher and now it finally arrived on Steam and I started again a new vault. Being addicted as before. Very impressive little time waster. 

Very much recommended!!!

20571,"+ Excellent tutorial
+ Engaging soundscape
+/- Some depth to the game, but it's no ""Oxygen Not Included""
- Mobile port. Clearly not made for PC

20573,"made a new dweller called hitler and did another holocaust

10/10

20574,Very...
20575,10/10 a Good Thing For Wasting time
20576,"If BSOD/another crash appears ‚Äî> saves deletes.
Thanks Indian coders!"
20577,I named my vault 420
20578,"If you want to kill your day, very fast, download this. 
It's good fun!"
20579,"This is not a good game.



Steam: Stop letting these trash mobile games into your store, it's fucking everything up!"
20580,Solid game. Insta-buy! Oh wait it's free. Thanks for this Bethesda.
20581,"After making loot-shooter S.T.A.L.K.E.R. rip off with a little bit mass defect spicy, they decided it‚Äôs not enough and defecated cartoony pile of p2w happiness with micro transactions."
20582,This game is amazing and addictive as hell !!!  Good job Bethesda!!!
20583,"Good casual game, but please x86, i would like to play it on my windows tablet."
20584,"I am Suprised this game is even on steam cause it started out as a Moble Game, eather way, it is a good time waster and it really has no goal just play it till get bored, stop, and get back in it, it's that simple."
20585,Trash
20586,"At the time of this review I haven't put much time into the Steam release of this game. I've played it a lot on my phone, & from the PC Bethesda Launcher, and Windows 10 Store. This game is really good. It starts off slow but gets better the more you play it. It's a much better game than I thought it would be from looking at the trailer & gameplay footage. It has optional micro-transactions but isn't pay to win. Over all the versions of this game, I've never put any money in and I have more than enough caps, dwellers, Nuka Cola bottles and so on. I'm stockpiling resources on every version because the game without putting money in gives you more than enough of each. The game has a lot more depth than I originally though it would, and now you can also leave the vault and go on quests. I highly recommend giving this game a serious try, and putting some time in with it. If you're a fan of the Fallout games, you'll understand things a bit more, but I can image even a non Fallout gamer enjoying this game. In my opinion this game works really well with a controller, but is far better with keyboard and mouse. It's free, so check it out."
20587,awkward controls
20588,"garbage

waste your time simulator"
20589,"Why do people play stupid **** like this? Terrible game, just terrible.

EDIT: had to disable comments due to super butthurt Fallout fanboys."
20590,"Even though this is a port of the mobile version, the extra quest and Steam achivements are good bonuses. This is a game that is good to play when ever people are bored and want a quick break from doing work, to have this game to be playing on the side to play. I recemmond this for anyone who is on the go alot with their laptops, or for people who do alot of work, but still want to play something quick."

20592,"Love it! Played it already many hours with the Bethesda Net Launcher.

One of the few F2P where u CAN pay but don¬¥t need to. There is no Paywall. U can get all the content just by playing and u won¬¥t have to spend ridiculous amounts of hours to unlock it. You can get Lunchboxes and Nuka Cola Quantum easily by achieving Quests and Daily objectives.

I highly recommend this Game!"
20593,yay its here now :).
20594,"Yup, that's Fallout Shelter; now on Steam with a tasty framerate without the hastle of sketchy Android emulation.
Probably the best free-to-play idle game on mobile, a much better use of your time than AdCap. I probably have more time logged in Fallout Shelter between platforms than I do in Fallout 4.


I'm glad i no longer have to feel my phone physically heating up from playing this game. Give it a shot, its free and the free-to-okay hooks aren't as sharp as they are in some games of the same ilk."
20595,GOOD
20596,It's fun and free
20597,WHERE THE HELL IS MY SAVE GAME DATA LOCATED !?
20598,Named my vault 911.
20599,"I've already spent almost 100 hours playing this game on the Windows Store, and I have to say that it's one hell of a time waster. Fallout Shelter doesn't have any specific goal in mind, so you can spend your spare time increasing your vault's population (and have your own Gary-themed whacko-fest); training your dwellers' SPECIAL stats for gameplay bonuses; or send them all out in the wasteland, and battle a dozen Deathclaws, for that chance to find a rare item - just remember to send them back to the vault if you're going to exit the game, because the timer keeps ticking even when you're out, and reviving a dead vault dweller costs a lot of caps. Tip for new players: a high food level keeps everyone happy and smiling in the face of danger; therefore, invest in it early in the game (or send the useless dwellers out to die in the wilderness), because it dwindles fast if you have too many people.

Overall, a fun casual game. There are microtransactions available, but your vault can survive even without purchasing any of them. You might have to spend more time playing and managing if you want some of the loot that can be purchased in the store, but a day or two of waiting wouldn't hurt.


And there you have it."
20600,Game of the Year
20601,"I saw this on Steam this morning and was worried I would not be able to transfer my saves from my main non Steam game, those worries were somewhat unfounded. The game doesn't sync to your bethesda.net or mobile data but you can manually put the save you have been using into the game and have it work mostly fine. It was strange Fallout Shelter did not come to Steam sooner, I think it is pretty good. 

In Fallout Shelter you build, manage, and customize your vault and its citizens all on the fly. It does seem grindy at first because most things are time based, but it was designed to be a game you'd play on and off all on the go, so that's understandable. I really enjoy the game and while I was playing through Fallout 4, played shelter on and off that entire time, and more! 

If you are a Fallout fan, or are a fan of mobile games, or even just looking for a stress free, simple idle game and don't want any pay to in garbage this is a game you should check out! I have played it hundreds of hours and can still get enjoyment from it, but maybe im just weird.

20602,"I found this game in the APP store first. Now it's available in steam, that's great."
20603,"Why is this still a thing?

xdddddddddd"
20604,Meh
20605,"Too many Bauldies
Exile them to the Wastelands
Make Vault 420 Great Again !

10/10"
20606,Just Play it
20607,"I like how the graphics were more smooth and crisp, and the fps were higher than the mobile
loooove it."
20608,Loved this game when on ios platform. happy to play it again
20609,"Named my first vault vault 69, the other vault 420
after I gave everyone ghetto names
then I stopped playing"
20610,A F2P pile of shit that is laced in microtransactions that doesn't belong on Steam. We do not need these shit mobile ports. Stop releasing them!
20611,Finally! Now I can put my nvidia geforce gtx 1060 to good use!
20612,"I have been playing FO Shelter from the beginning (as soon as it was available on Android). Also I am a big fan of Fallout Series (played all of them starting from Fallout 1, including tactics and latest games).

It's a highly addictive from the begging and most of the fun (it's a pity) are nearly the initial game start. At least over a month. The game never ends. As a FO fan, you can see all the beloved graphics, dwellers  and monsters. As it free to play, there are some boosters you can spend money on (and for this game this is completely optional).

Pros:
* Highly addictive (first month only)
* familiar and cool graphics
* proper micro and macro management (for no more than 20 dwellers)
* payment content is not a stopper for F2P users

Cons:
* Once you reach high level, micromanagement is a mess
* For a big collony you're easily lost in dwemmers and rooms
* have to play every single day for max boost
* no more fun end-game content

Summary: For fans it's a must-try, for others - yes, definitly try either. Hoewver I doubt that you will play it more than 3-5 weeks.

Added 2017-11-23: I like that developers still support the game, in-game holiday items and bugfixes. Still enjoybale if you have long pauses from that game"
