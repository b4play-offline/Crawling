4,to much for dlcs but still very fun
5,No
6,help
7,game
8,The game is really well designed and the gun play is top-notch. BUT IT IS EXTREMELY COSTLY TO KEEP UP.
9,"I don't recommend this game because if you don't already have it you're probably not a Destiny fan and not an OG Destiny player so there's really nothing for you here unless you want to spend dozens of hours learning the intricacies of being a Guardian (not fun with how complex the game has gotten over the years). I have over 800 hours in the first game and on PS4 and PC combined around 300 hours on Destiny 2 and I gotta say, I couldn't imagine getting into it as a new player. It's just not worth the time required to feel strong and powerful. I'm trapped, but you don't have to be. Don't start playing this game if you haven't been sucked in already. It truly is a harmful addiction"
10,epic graphic .. super stories .. nice co op
11,"great game. Dismissed it for way too long. Great way to unwind after a long day, or grinding if you have the gaming bug"
12,"I loved the build man its outstaning, definitely well developed game and really fun to play"
13,hella fun
14,I would rather stab myself repeatably anywhere than play pvp in this game is so dogshit pain is more pleasing
15,grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat
16,"All of the updates just add one more BS meta into the practically dead PVP, and you follow it up with the complete disregard of balance in either PVE or PVP aspects of the game. If Bungie actually cracks down and fixes the MANY problems this game has it could be a solid game. Unfortunately its just another cash grab each season
"
17,"If the game didn't constantly give connection errors 15 minutes into 18 minute long events it would be the perfect game
"
18,top tier
19,yes yes ahhh gardian you have returned i see yes yes
20,Great free to play content
21,Finally Get  new gun. love life. Bungie *nerfs gun*. Hate life. repeat
22,ben
23,god bless you if you play this game i wish you the best in your retirement
24,Did you like Destiny 1? Then you'll hate it! Recycled content. Too expensive and the updates invalidate any grinding players do the season before. Do you have an abundance of money and like being play to win? This game is for you! I have over 300 hours and will probably keep pouring my time into it anyways but my year long breaks aren't long enough.
25,"Had trouble with a dungeon.
Went to tower. 
Kidnapped some random with cool armor into my fireteam. 
Helped me finish it. 10/10"
26,great for all skill levels
27,"Great game with an almost infinite number of things to do. Best enjoyed with a few friends, but still single-player friendly overall. The variety of equipment, events, and campaigns makes this my favorite FPS. 

Downside is the FOMO and the steep learning curve for beginners, especially when it comes to the lore."
28,"i officially have no life now, this game is so fucking addicting and amazing. it gives me a lot of movie and game vibes, like star wars and borderlands."

54,"Got to the 'Navota' encounter. Yeah, pure dev cheese, Basically was epic in how bad it was in design and execution for a new player, it wiped out the first five and a half hours of really positive experience with the game. No really, this single part was just that bad.

What made it even worse was seeing how more discouraging it got looking at 'how to' for the fight video guides on YT, making it obvious it would be 'Warframe' level time sink and waste to get to where the fight be less so a pain... in the first ten hours of game play.

You got years of content here Bungie, stop being stupid. No really, this is stupid, like completely moronic. Your letting grind sneak into the new player experience? Wow."
55,Games aight I guess

92,"This is a good game if you want to fight cool bosses and use powerful abilities, but it does require what I would deem a ""medium"" grind level. If you have the dlc's you want to get all the items before the nest dlc comes out so that you get all the items for free, because otherwise getting the rest of the items requires even more resource grinding. All-in-all, a good pve and pvp game that can be enjoyed by many people."

If you enjoy Halo this game is just as good (or maybe better, looking at you Halo Infinite and Halo 5 Guardians) The game doesn't require any money to play but you can buy optional DLC expansions if you want more story missions to play or more ways to collect Exotic weapons. 10/10 would recommend for anyone who wishes Halo had a little bit more"

115,"Bungie are the kings of recycling old content and trying to make everyone believe that its new.
Now i wouldnt mind this if it was free like the kings fall raid and vault of glass raid but its a lot of seasonal stuff as well, stuff you buy into by purchasing the deluxe ultra mega corpo words corpo words corpo words edition 
the one thing you get are new weapons AND EVEN THESE are sometimes just old weapons with new perks...

Theres other stuff that bothers me like for instance you got these mods you can put inside your gear or exotic items that make certain things better but then you have extreme bullshit benefits like certain temporary buff orbs moving towards you faster if you wear a specific exotic its like... really? thats what endgaame gear is? it makes stuff move towards you faster?
The classes themselves are also rather underwhelming, same with the subclasses.
The pvp i wont even mention because its the epitome of garbage 

theres other things that the developer wont fix such as bad collision and annoying glitches and thats mainly due to the fact that they dont have much competition in the AAA looter shooter genre 

TL;DR : the moment a better looter shooter rolls around the corner i'll switch without even batting an eye"
116,"Когда то давно я поигрывал в эту игру, и мне она понравилась, вернулся в неё совсем недавно,(живу в России). В чём суть плохой оценки, мы с моим другом(казуалом) начали проходить миссию длиной в 3 часа, на сложном уровне, это было реально сложно, всё для того что бы получить Экзотический (Самый лучший в игре) предмет (всего в количестве 1 единицы каждому), и ради этого я выслушивал крики и оры своего друга, объясняя ему что, чтобы действительно проходить эту игру, и близится к высоким уровням и повышению уровня самой игры, нужны сложности, и спустя 3 часа мы завершили одну из многих сюжетных миссий, но из-за того что мы проживаем на территории России, мы не получили предмет ради которого убивали на миссию время, у меня несколько вопросов к разработчикам, постараюсь без мата, ВЫ СОШЛИ  С УМА ? То есть задонатить в игру я могу, саму игру скачать могу(НА ТЕРРИТОРИИ РОССИИ БЛ), хоть на это уйдёт пол дня, так как игра весит почти 100 гигабайт, потратить в ней часов 20 своей жизни что бы дойти до нужной мне миссии, поучится механике и стрельбе игры и пройти миссию с большими усилиями я могу, но получить за это, по моему субъективному мнению даже не достаточную награду, Я НЕ МОГУ?! Я понимаю что ответы на мои вопросы просты, разработчикам игры(этим алчным людям) нужны деньги, но смысл в том что людям которые не донатят в эту игру, просто нет смысла в неё играть. Я понимаю что когда война закончится это скорей всего исправят, но почему тогда просто нельзя запретить на это время игру на территории России ? Мой друг, у которого не было этой игры в стиме её спокойно загрузил, хоть Россия сейчас под санкциями."

119,good
120,"pve is fun but pvp is just shotguns and whatever else is meta atm, abused into oblivion. its breathtaking how such a toxic and abusive community (PvP) can even stay alive. either you use a shotgun or a jötun to get kills or you get killed by a shotgun or a jötun or whatever else kinda weird abomination of balance the destiny weapons kitchen has brewt up this season. also fak bungie for removing dlcs and stuff people have paid money for. move it to a seperate location on the destination screen where you have like a ""realm of the past"" wich allows you to play what you pay for."
121,"As a player that's been playing since the year it launched, what the fuck. How the hell do you get away with REMOVING THREE FUCKING CAMPAIGNS FROM YOUR GAME, PAID FOR DLC REMOVED. HOW IS THAT EVEN LEGAL."
122,Pretty Fun
123,I enjoy it despite its flaws
124,"Honestly, I hate this game so much I love it. Every aspect of it is great, even though I don't like the pvp but that is but a personal preference. I prefer to spend hours farming for a weapon to the point I don't believe it actually exists in the game(cough cough Heartshadow) and running back and forth around planets for hours just to complete the story. But hey, to have fun you must always be asking yourself if it is really worth to keep playing. But Destiny is 10/10 would recommend but only if you wanna spend about a month trying to understand whats going on"
125,fun game with friends

134,Easily one of my all time top 5 series of games. The Destiny story line has been fantastic with a constantly active team working on improving game content.
135,Just one word: Pog
136,Played a lot of destiny 1 back on Xbox only thing I don't like is how light now works but The game is really fun for what it is! I would recommend trying free to play and if you like it get the DLC.
137,oh i hate destiny 2 Its my favorite game
138,amazing
139,"There's a reason why I'm close to 500 hours on this game and this is why...

Destiny + Destiny 2 have been some of the best games I've ever played in my life. It's the reason why I fell in love with looter/shooter type games. I used to come home everyday from school, jump on Destiny with the boys and grind the shit outta the game and the amazing raids. Destiny was a masterclass of a game and Destiny 2 has arguably just improved on its predecessor.

I've played Destiny 2 since it came out, granted not everyday since I had breaks but would always come back. I play this game solo most of the time and it's still really fun. The only downside to playing solo is that dungeons are a lot harder (I still manage to solo them but just a little harder than with friends) and raids are obviously a no go unless I do LFG etc so if anyone likes to play then hit me up :)

Anyway off topic a little. Destiny 2 is f2p for the most part. There is plenty of content to be done with the base game but unfortunately is held back massively by the multiple different DLC that this game has had. I'd say 20% of the game can be experienced as complete f2p, it's just a shame that so much content is locked behind paid DLC and is arguably overpriced for the most part.

That's the negatives I have of this amazing game, on to the positives. The atmosphere in this game is without a doubt the best I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of space so this game is right up my ally. the scenery on different planets is jaw-dropping, the combat in this game is amazing, you feel like an unstoppable beast when you use your super. The game itself is just amazing.

PvE is my definite favourite. Doing strikes or nightfalls with friends is so much, gambit (a bit of PvE and PvP) is also really fun as the drifter is my favourite character. Going for loot is also so satisfying in this game, I always do my best to stay ahead of the power level and grind to level up my seasonal artifact. The current season (season of Plunder) is also really fun just like the previous few seasons. Going for stronger weapons and armour is so much fun in this gaeme.

PvP side of Destiny isn't my favourite as it is for other people, not my cup of coffee. I enjoy the crucible from time to time but there's definitely some matchmaking issues (like most PvP FPS games lol). I've also never touched Trials of Osiris because I'm too scared and never had anyone to play with and would probably get destroyed anyway. PvP overall is okay but definitely something I'd try to avoid if I can and just get the pinnacle gear and leave.

The story of destiny is also incredible too I don't even know where to start. Right from Forsaken, Curse of Osiris, Warmind up until The Witch Queen and eventually Lightfall has been amazing. Ikora, Zavala and Cayde (RIP ;-;) had such unique personalities and that's just a handful of characters. The guns are amazing, the abilities are amazing (Thumbs up the solar Titans) and the game is relatively kind to new comers. The raids are incredible despite me only doing the Europa raid once, forgot the name of it :( and I haven't had anyone to do any raids with. 

The story of beyond light was amazing as well as witch queen (although a little short). There's always stuff to do in the game and it's rare to fully run out of content to do. Bounties keep you going, grinding nightfall is fun especially with friends, gambit is hella fun, crucible is meh, dungeons are incredible and the introduction of elements 3.0 is an amazing boost to sub-classes. I love the Destiny community and made so many friends in my Destiny lifetime. I love hunters and I love warlocks and I've always been a titan since the beginning (hammer throw, Tractor Cannon and Synthoceps have carried me through multiple dungeons) I just wish elemental mods were easier to get and not only from Ada on a daily random rotation. Regardless I love my 1575 power titan with 100 resilience, intellect and recovery. Considering I've played this game the majority of the time solo and still had so much fun really goes to show that it's enjoyable solo or with friends. 

I could go on and on about how amazing this game is and write a whole damn book about this game and how perfect it is. I'm so excited to see where this game goes in the future and am really looking forward to lightfall. It's been an incredible journey seeing how this game has involved from the start of the game to today. Destiny has been a big part of my life and will be in the next few years for sure <3"
140,Eggcellent
141,hmmmmmmmm
142,"Great game

158,good game i Recommend
159,More addicting than opioids and designer drugs
160,it would be great if u can just play the witch queen dlc as a new comer ... but instead u have to lvl first and open all the planets so u get to a play a dlc u a paid for .. ridiculous
161,"its fun,"
162,i took out a bank loan to be able to afford to play this
163,its liek fortnie
164,is good yea :)
165,Quite fun even solo
166,Fun game solo even more with friends community is really helpful and since the part from Activision its been a lot more content and its improved in quality from playing since Alpha Destiny 1 I'll give the current state of play a 8.5/10.
167,GREAT TIME KILLER
168,"GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
"
169,"After finally hitting 1,000 hours, I really think this game is fun.

I will say, if you are new to Destiny and are thinking about hopping in, be warned that you will be locked out of quite a bit of content. The game has 4 DLCs (Including Light Fall), plus the 30th Anniversary Pack, plus Season Passes. So its quite the money sink just to access what the game has to offer. But oh boy is this game fun when you get into what it offers.


The Negatives:

Now I will say, if you are not into the Looter Shooter genre of games or games that have a large focus on grinding, then you most likely wont like Destiny 2. Grind is what makes the D2 world go round. 

Another issue with D2, that will usually have me forgetting about the game until I see a YouTube video on it, is the time gated content. Everything in this game is set to a daily or weekly cycle and that's just how it is. End-game content can be breezed through on all characters in a matter of hours on the first day of reset and can leave you with nothing to do for the rest of the week in-game. Mods that are required to solo hard content or to make builds for fun are locked behind a vendor that resets daily. This vendor usually sells garbage mods and can go MONTHS without selling the meta mods just for them to be outclassed when they come around for sale.

By far the largest negative this game has is PvP. I'm no PvP sweat who has a 69 kd that uses the Giga-farter 8000 cause its meta, I usually just try to hop in PvP to get weekly missions done and to possibly have fun. Having fun in Destiny 2 PvP is not something you can do. Its sad to say, but you really can't have fun in the games PvP. Everyone and their mother is using the Giga-farter 8000 cause its meta and unless you do to, you can't compete, and if you want to you will have to play the sweatiest games imaginable. The Trials of Osiris is what has been stated previously but cranked up to 11. PvP in this game quickly devolves into getting 3 matched done to get out as fast as possible.  

The Positives:

The PvE is this game is very fun and allows for casual players to enjoy PvE content and gives a good challenge to those looking to test their skills in harder PvE content and offers some of the best weapons in the game as rewards for passing these challenges.

Raids. Raids are a PvE mode where a team of 6 guardians team up to face some of the games hardest challenges. Raids are one of the best parts of Destiny. The Deep Stone Crypt is a raid and it has one of the most breathtaking moments about halfway through, its an absolutely gorgeous part of the game that i will not spoil if you haven't seen it. Not only are the raids a wonder to look at, being some of the prettiest content in the game, they offer some of the best weapons you can get. So running through raids can land you some great gear. 

By far my favorite part of Destiny is the community. Its not hard to find a team and attempt your first Raid because so many people in this community are willing to help give people that satisfaction of their first raid clear or help you slog through PvP to try and go flawless in Trials or help you grind bosses for that rare drop.

In Conclusion:
For all the flaws this game has, it makes up for it and then some with the great community its built up over 8 long years. 
So I can't recommend this game enough for all the fun I've had since Destiny 1 and for all the fun I know I'm gonna have in the years to come."
170,"Money trap, I bought the game full price before it was made free to play, I wasn't given new dlc or anything as compensation, I feel scammed, these trash developers also vaulted all of the DLC that I did own so I basically only had the base game (f2p) content, I expected better, charging players $75 for DLC for your f2p game is disgusting, I hope your game crashes and burns."

174,Welcome to Destiny Players Anonymous.
175,Its lie a leech but for your time and money
176,AHHH this shit sucks
177," One heck of a game to follow the story, well written, creative weapons and all around perfect game to get lost in for a FPS
"
178,Worst game i've ever played
179,For new players there is almost no in game way to understand the plot as most of it has been deleted. Additionally to get up to date with the best gear you have to pay hundreds of dollars on all the DLC's. The gun play is good and the game is addicting but the new player experience is not good.
180,This game is a good game except it has no solo experience at all there's some raid that I want to do and I just Can't do them because it requires more than one person If you are a solo player to not get this game cuz it has nothing for you you're not going to get the best experience out of it This game needs to seriously fix its solo experience Cuz my friends can't Be on 24/7 And especially since there's no matchmaking for them only in the beta and it takes An ungodly amount of time to find guides and everyone that just needs it's unnecessary in my opinion they should just make matchmaking for raids it would be easier that way I could play a red and get The full money is worth that I spent I spent money on this game I would like to get the full experience that's why I spend money But overall it's a good game I just wish they would fix their solo experience and I've been with bungie ever since Halo 2
181,"Do you like spaghetti? Imagine eating that crap for 365 days straight and never getting full. It is repetitive and non-rewarding. You are left with nothing but regret and sad turds in the toilet. That is how drop rates for things you need feel in this game. For instance, for 2 weeks, all I need is 1 pair of Isotoner gloves for my Titan to get to pinnacle cap and this game only gives me Super Soakers instead. Zavalla and Rahool also suck. Don't get me started on the clan vendor 9 Dot either. Eris Morn should be named THIRD EYE BLIND and they killed off Cayde 6. That was sadder than 2pac and biggie dying. RIP. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."

202,it sexy
203,Great game 10/10
204,The base game is not too great and there isn't much to do. But once you get some of the dlcs the game gets really fun. There are so many different mods build classes and weapons. The story is also really good. Would rate a solid 9/10.
205,Its just ok
206,Epic
207,This game is awful. I love it.
208,beautiful great smooth mechanics runs superbly on a mid lv laptop its great

212,"If you want to put money into a game that constantly disconnects and hangs up ... and I mean constantly, then this is your game. Fun game when you can get it to play. Seems like they want to get your money more than they want to fix bugs and problems, or maybe they don't know how to fix it, who knows. It used to not be near as bad with the connection problems but as the player base increased it seems as if they can't keep up with it. If I made a game and more and more people paid me to use it, I would invest more resources into keeping up with the servers. Too greedy in  my opinion. I've been playing this for quite some time and have paid for the expansions as I went, but I am tired of paying for a game that always tells me it has problems  connecting.  Time to look elsewhere."
213,"Absolutely amazing game, coming from D1 this is a very good sequel and very fun to play. Enough nostalgia to keep me going and the new raid and dungeons are so complex and very enjoyable. Its got me hooked."
214,I am playing destiny and I can't stop :(((((
215,"very fun, like WOW but space themed."
216,"i  hate it here

217,It is very fun with friends.

219,Its aight
220,Game kinda sucks tbh
221,The best game I would never recommend to any of my friends.
222,Run
223,the fuck?
224,One of the best fps games out there. Paying for all the dlcs and stuff is kinda annoying.
225,This game has horrid monetization other than that my favorite rpg
226,this game is very fun when you have it all the base free to play is very boring and bland if you want to have fun you have to drop 100$ on dlc content plus the community is one of the most toxic and annoying ones ever
227,yes
228,"Played for a few hours, it was okay but not really my thing tbh"
229,"If you're going to play and buy, don't go buying the $100+ combo packs. Those are a waste of money, and is full of lies. You know how in other games, you can buy the base, and then the entire expansion pass(entire game + all dlc's including future dlc's); Destiny doesn't do that. You're better off buying the cheapest deals, and waiting for sales, if there ever is any."
230,its a cool mix of first person shooters like cod and magic
231,"its pretty good
"
232,"good game
"
233,Crucible is horribly balanced pve is great.
234,Pretty fun
235,I say no because I got a permanent ban on a game I haven't played in 4 months. Fuck y'all :)
236,"Best looter shooter out there in my opinion. Heavy MMO type structure, Halo-like game play."
237,addicting
238,"Lots of fun and solid gameplay, usually play to a certain point and take a break but the regular releases of DLC makes the game more interesting and helps me come back to it. The story is getting better and better over time. Downsides, it can get very repetitive if you want to progress and level up gear so you can complete more difficult activities. There is no match making for dungeons, raids or the more difficult levels of strikes and the trials of osiris (PVP) which can make playing some content difficult since a lot of the community that plays those regularly will boot you off the fireteam unless you have certain gear or completions. In Destiny1, there was more of a community that would help teach how to complete raids but not so much the case with Destiny2 which is a shame. There are changes coming to improve this with Lightfall apparently, with players getting rewards and rep from helping players but will see how this plays out. Accessing armor, weapons and mods relies on grinding to see if you can get a certain item. Final note, the Witch Queen legendary campaign is the best content since the Taken King on D1, lots of fun and great lore :)"
239,"yes
"
240,potato
241,its really good but theres way too much grinding for minimal rewards. It almost forces you to buy a seasons pass. This game may be free but you aren't gonna go anywhere without paying a minimum of like 50 dollars.
242,"don't play this,please."
243,"i havent seen my family in almost a week, i dont even remember what the sun looks like because of this game"
244,.
245,"This can be a fun game to play with friends. The community can be pretty toxic on all ends of the game, but other than that its a great looter shooter game! 9/10"
246,why did I even play this looter shooter
247,this game should not exist imo they should have stayed with destiny 1 and updated since the game was booty before destiny 1 content coming back.
248,yes.

262,"You know I started playing Destiny, the first one, in pre-alpha. I fought the three avatars of the dark heart in the black garden, destroyed Atheon in the Vault of Glass, killed Crota, the hive god in his throne world, defeated countless enemies in the Prison of Elders, killed Oryx, the taken king, and survived the SIVA crisis by destroying Aksis, the Archon Prime. I LOVE this universe. Destiny 2 has grown this universe so much. Bungie has put so much work into this game and I hope they continue the story for years to come. I'd recommend this game to anyone!"
263,It's chill
264,Quality game with updated and constantly expanding content.
265,"Great game with a lot to do, however many activities are locked behind huge pay-walls, but if you have the money this is an amazing game"

277,"This game is like smoking-
It’s fun to start with, you think it’s cool and great with friends. Then as time goes on you end up doing it more and more and enjoying it less and less and inevitably you just feel like shit. You try to stop because all your friends have and your girlfriend hates you doing it so often but you just can’t stop because your a said excuse for a gamer 😂 screw this game! You need a second life for the grinding, all the DLC content is just half effort, it’s not easy in newcomers, and even after you spent to much money on DLC’s which you should never get unless they are on sale because you will complete them in a few hours, bungie will eventually just remove the content, for “new” content that again you have to pay for. It could have been a great game but instead it’s just addictive and mehh."
278,hated the game loved it got bored came back its chill
279,"I am a 54-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing destiny 2.
I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing destiny 2
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours.
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing destiny 2.
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well."
280,Destiny was the first looter shooter I ever played and till this day Im playing. People complain about the game because they are not masters at every aspect of the game and cant get the dorps they want when they want it. So they disrepect the people that really love this game and the developers who care for this game as well...just so they can feel superior. I believe Destiny is bigger than any of us could imagine. I was just a teenager when i started playing and now my son is asking me about....just another way for me to connect with him.!
281,Spectacular gaming.

""free to play "" games for ppl to start playing cost over 190 euros if they really want to play all the content...
Free to play content - Strikes, Pvp Gambit.. and 1 Dungeon... 
Dlc's are worthless if u don't buy deluxe edition couse  Dungeon is Closed, some content in game is closed if u don't have deluxe edition... So what's there free tbh ? 

Don't get me wrong game is awesome almost 1k hours in it ... but U NEED LOOK AT THE FACTS !!

335,"This game is a true money sink. At this point, they should literally just move to a ""Subscription-based"" platform. $40 for DLC, $20/season pass, Dungeons and events are locked behind another $20-$40 ""Key"". You want the new weapons? Gotta buy the battle pass. You want access to the story? Battle pass/DLC. You want access to content other than basic gaming? Battle pass, DLC and ""Dungeon Keys"". You want access to past content because you didn't get to enjoy it? Better buy the previous Battle Passes. Would you like to partake in the Special Events that Destiny has? Gotta buy that DLC/Battle Pass. Heaven forbid if you don't buy the DELUXE Edition because you will be paying for literally everything. The gameplay is great, the pyramid scheme of moneymaking is unethical. At some point, I'm going to have to stop giving you my grandma's retirement check and then I'm gonna be big sad. I already got yelled at for stealing my mom's welfare check."

346,"Completely new player to the game...Fan of MMORPGs and FPS games. This game is a pretty good marriage of both those things. A lot of things the game does good, some things just ok, other things out right terrible. 

Story, Word building, Characters, Area Design, Combat/Gameplay, Variety of content, End Game content, Dungeons/raids are all good.

PvP, UI, Quality of life stuff are just ok

New player experience is absolutely horrific. They are supposedly working on it, but as of this writing it feels like they through you right in the woods with a compass that just spins around in random directions. You need to go in knowing you will have no idea what is going on and nothing will make sense. I was doing one quest story line and the game randomly on its own picked me up and dropped me in a new story line since I hadnt been in that area yet. Find a friend who plays to help guide you and get ready to read a lot on the internet. 

"
347,"good game, fun to run iron banner, crucible, gambit, raids and dungeons"
348,pew pew
349,"Awesome game! Could be better though, If you did not need to find groups in a off game app on your phone. Other than that very nice game!"
350,"This game gives me tons of headaches, ive broken controllers, the community is toxic asf and i never get good rolls on guns. I love this game."
351,This is by far one of the greatest games you'll ever play whether by yourself or especially with friends if you're into FPS and enjoy a good quality story. Bungie has never stopped growing the content and story of Destiny since it was first release.
352,game fun too much money but still fun
353,Always finds a way to bring more and more content and fix their issues.
354,"It's a very nice game. I like all types off abileties u can use
"
355,"Yes,
If u like to go Pew Pew all the time without having a clue of whats going on. This game is for you, because in Destiny 2 you can go Pew Pew all the time without every idea of whats going on.
"
356,"Have you ever wanted to be a superhero, a stealthy hunter, or a wizard of destruction? You can be all that here with excellent gun play to boot. The story has been getting better as the expansions and seasons release and with Lightfall coming out around the corner I recommend getting started now. The new player experience is what I would say being thrown to the wolves but nothing a quick Youtube video can explain to you (Reach light soft cap, grind pinnacle to hard cap). After getting out of the blueberry phase you will soon become addicted and treat this like a full time job, clock out your 9-5 to clock in to grind for god rolls. Lightfall will also be introducing a new class and in game LFG system for finding raid parties without having to scour Discord or forums. My only downside to the game is no in-game cinematic viewer as some of the cinematics you see are breathtaking but only viewable once without looking for them on Youtube."
357,Great game
358,+
359,VERI GUUUD SHOOT SHOOT:)
360,"Great gun-play. Good story. The seasons are cool. The current campaign is good. But I feel like too much of the content is hidden behind a paywall. They let you try the first couple of missions for the campaign and seasons, but the moment you become invested, that's when you have to pay up to play the rest of the content. I wish I would've known this sooner before playing this free-to-play game; ""free-to-play"" instead feels more like ""free-to-try."" 

This wouldn't be an issue if I was certain I got to keep what I paid for. But after buying all of the legacy content and having them remove most of it from game to make space for new content, it kinda makes me think twice about spending more money with them.

If you play this game, be ready to fork over ACTUAL money to be satisfied with the ""main-course"" of its content.
If you don't, then prepare your taste buds for a most delicious sci-fi first-person-shooter ""appetizer."""
361,I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story and a semi competitive shooter
362,Grinding but fun with friends
363,"
Games been made super casual now, so it's not as much as a grind as it used to be to level up. Endgame PVE / Trials is the only modes that demands certain light levels to complete the content. Don't buy the DLCs, wait til they're on sale, and especially don't buy them if this game isn't something you see yourself investing time into since a lot of the content gets sunset (vaulted from the game).

PVP is 50/50, you will most likely get your cheeks clapped by someone with adept weapons. be ready to meet either end game content gate keepers, elitists or if you're lucky, a half decent community that carries / teachers new players the content."
364,Its a great first person shooter
365,good
366,full time job
367,"This game sucks ass, uninstalls it. Immediately reinstalls it."

371,"Destiny 2 tends to scratch the itch that other looter shooters just don't quite reach. Abilities feel good, guns feel great. Mods give you a variety of ways to play and build. Plenty of casual content and high-skill content. May eat into free time."
372,love it
373,fun
374,"The game's an absolute banger.
It has:
- Some of the best OSTs in the industry I've ever heard
- Some of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in any media,
- Some of the most addictive gunplay I've ever experienced in an FPS
- Some of the most satisfying abilities
- An epic story spanning a lot of different themes, characters and locations
- Various exotic raids and dungeons with unique rewards
- A lot of drip
- Some of the best DLC & Seasonal content the industry has to offer...

... Oh, and also DCV, as well as incredibly terrible New Player Experience (which is supposedly changing next year). Which sucks for any Release & Year 1 content owner."
375,You WILL regret playing this game i love it
376,addiction yes
377,Weapons go pew pew and i'm now addicted.
378,"Not bad but PvP is completely unforgiving to new players. Big turn off to even queue for crucible without the meta exotics and build.

Bounties and powerful rewards FORCE you to play a certain spec or weapon. Makes each mode even worse. Worth picking up DLC's when they're on sale but not full price.

Certain activities and gear are behind paywalls."
379,"One of the best shooter looters in the market, with deep MMO mechanics and PVP modes."
380,10/10 would play everyday >
381,Best game i have ever played in my 25 years of gaming.
382,"dont recommend, Bungo only simps for content creator, they will not, and never will care about their base, casual players"
383,"I hate this game, Its my favorite game"
384,"It's fun. Grindy, but fun. Free to play is more like Free to try, considering that you cannot do much other than what is included in the first 2-3 years of the game, and you are limited to a certain XP level like in wow. It appears pricey, but because you don't pay for game time, you can argue that it costs less than other popular mmos. Story is intriguing, but absorption is low when playing for free, so expansions or involvement from the community with guides and videos are the way to go. PvP is competitive, and cut throat, but I don't spend enough time to formulate an unbiased opinion. Raids and dungeons are great, never done them because I haven't put the time into finding a group, but watching world's first is quite exciting. Gameplay is quite straight forward, but detailed enough to interest me into grinding for better loot. Overall, not bad, but you need to pay in order to feel the full effects of the game. Getting Witch Queen Deluxe Edition at this point is kinda risky, as you have only 2 seasons left, and the previous two are also accessible. And with the next expansion (Lightfall) at £80 and 5 months until its release, you would need be comfortable with up to £120 in just Destiny. But always look for deals on Greenmangaming, actually have the game at 16% off there at the time of writing."
385,B O W
386,shit game
387,"Game hurts my soul most of time, but sometimes it is euphoric."
388,bad
389,Another example of a game that is the most gorgeous game I have ever had the pleasure of watching for five years but playing it is a different story. Game developers will make the greatest game of all time but it the gameplay with will be either filled with grind or painful amounts of rng.
390,"i mean, perhaps
it could be enjoyable, it could be painful
but at the end of the day you still regret every second you spend on it, so come join the very toxic community of destiny 2 and join in on the toxicity, so shall we go beat the shit out of people who have no idea what their doing :)"
391,I used to be addicted to drugs then i started to play this game and now i don't have time for them anymore.
392,no

397,very niize
398,yes
399,Other than the having to pay for a new expansion every 6 months its the most amazing game i own that i can hop into whenever i feel. The only other issue is the grind to get up too level for end game content which can take awhile
400,with queen has loads of content. Pvp still sucks tho

And the farms where just dumb fetch quests that sucked. However with the Witch Queen DLC they really fixed a lot of things. Just by playing the story you can level up decently. Its no longer a major pain to upgrade gear and weapons. I actually find myself enjoying the game instead of grinding mindlessly just to keep up. I 100% recommend this game now. Its fun to just play the story. I also enjoy the PVP but its optional. My last gripe is with matchmaking for raids and top level gear. For years they forced us to use sites like DestinyLFG and others like it. And stupidly refused to put something like that in game. But now after YEARS it seems they will do it. Took way too many years to give fans a much requested feature but better late than never. This game should be amazing with that feature in place."

432,"Game is fun but is too much of a grind. Worked my ass off to get the best gear only for it to get constantly nerfed or made obsolete by new stuff they release. 

Doing constant power grind is not fun to do high level activities 



"
433,yes very good
434,"It's Destiny 2. It's Halo with magic, what else needs to be said? It's free to play. Hop in and let's go."

437,"There's way too much to go into detail here, but overall:
Fun game, pew pew guns, such story, very drama.  Space magic good."

444,"this game franchise will always be a core part of who I am along with Halo 3 and Diablo 2! this game isn't perfect, but its has so many memories attached to it that I will have for the rest of my life. I may not talk to any of my old Fireteam after the initial release of Destiny 2 and I fell off because of it around the start of Season of the Drifter, but this game means a lot to me and so many other people!"

466,"There is no sense of direction, no explanation of progression, nothing guiding the player as to what they should be grinding for, which weapons are good, how to level up weapons, armor, and your abilities, and just generally is a confusing and unrewarding experience for new players."

499,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcnwAuTv_s4&ab_channel=ShadowDestiny

Video only explained half, maybe even less! Why i don't wanna play this anymore. 
Many players from season 1 to now or in between probably have other reason why this games is questionable.
Gets repetitive and boring midway IF you even get to that point."
500,"fun gunplay with boxes to check and weapons to collect, whats not to like?
story is actually really compelling if they would STOP SUNSETTING.
I've heard they arent going to be anymore and the current story is still really interesting so if you have an itch for gunplay with mmo aspects yay"
501,"i weally weally like it
"
502,its good
503,"Tried it briefly, didn't really play enough to understand it."
504,"Its going to be a no from me. Playing Destiny on anything other than console will only lead to constant connection lost and choppy game-play.
Other than that, it just feels like the fun has been sucked out of the game and replaced with loads of unnecessary content."
505,Skill Issue.
506,"The Mythic Science Fiction lore and universe in this game is the best I have ever seen for a science fiction game and why I play.

I have seen so many AAA video games fall short of the hopes and dreams or bad design and Destiny doesn't have any of those problems except being more of a grind than I like, but only because I am no longer a kid with spare time.

The gunplay is the best (as Bungie always does) though I do not have the twitch reflexes to use a sniper rifle in PvP except from a hidden vantage point, which is uncommon."
507,No other game has made me want to pimp slap a child. 10/10
508,
509,"Worst Game Ive played, but you should totally get invested into it, I'm still going to play it"

547,is that the battlebus?
548,"great game, but dont expect anything cheap. 
These boiiiiis be hungry for the money.
"
549,"If you can get the dlc. worth. if you can't. not worth. If you also don't have ppl to grind with, probably not worth. Basically all you need to know about this game since D1 :')"
550,"very fun game with an excellent community and plenty of fun people to go on your adventures with... let us not forget the fact that the game continues to expand on a regular basis
"
551,its just fun.
552,Loved destiny when it came out. same with the sequel. But as soon I blinked hackers were in every game acting like admins desperate for attention. their cure was a barely working anti cheat that doesn't seem to ban anyone when reported but it can have access to check everyones  files... and honestly I try to use this game as a distraction from the crap everywhere else and bungie just brings it with them. If you want to be dissapointed like the 2010 jets get this game.
553,perfect buuuuuut expensive
554,This game takes time away from your life its not worth it
555,Destiny 2 is True Friendship Killer!!!!
556,used to play on my PS4 was pretty into it. Saw a new expansion coming out in feb. and some friends were getting into it so i joined as well. In the last 2 weeks ive put 109 hours into and i am truly loving it A LOT
557,good
558,good
559,Joined a few years late. Put in 35 hours without spending a dime. Then I spent all the dimes Bungie would let me to get all the content. 11/10 would spend my dimes again.
560,"Played for awhile now mostly alone, sometimes with ppl..i would recommend having some time already with fps and mmo's or a great teacher..which i lucklily had both. great graphics N story is engaging. Love seeing new places and being awed by  the game or veteran players. Overall great game; great ppl ; n always something to do or see! Good Luck and hope you have as fun as i have so far."

562,awesome
563,kms
564,iz gud bruh
565,decently fun.
566,"Look, the game isn't perfect. Truly, very few games are.

But what Bungie has with Destiny is very special - a well crafted FPS with MMO elements, compelling PVE, and passion to keep iterating on the live service model to make sure that it keeps working.

This comes from a relatively recent PVE-focused player - I played Year 1 for about 100 hours (Pre-Steam Merge) and came back at the end of Season 16 (Witch Queen Start).

Pros:
- Unique gameplay, as an ability-aided FPS with good PVE encounters
- Simple and non-taxing weekly loop after getting powered up - Do 3 rounds each of Strikes (Quick, 10ish minute PVE encounters), Crucible (PVP, typically done via 6v6 team deathmatch with other modes available), and Gambit (PvEvP, Kill Monsters, Bank Resources the monsters drop, Invade and PVP the opposing team), do some dungeons if you've got some friends and some time, maybe raid if you're chilling with a clan. There are some other small power gains from weekend events and whatnot, but anyone who has played a ""more hardcore"" MMO like WoW knows that this is a laughably short gameplay loop for high tier loot and can be done relatively quickly every week.
- Fantastic story - This is going to be personal taste, but I really enjoy the story that Bungie has put together over the past few seasons. It's gone from a ""Villain of the Week"" story to focusing heavily on the core threat to our universe and taking on the smaller steps we can take at the moment. Some excellent character-driven writing makes this game feel infinitely more alive
- Distinct, highly customizable classes - This is more readily apparent with the recent 3.0 reworks. Lots of fragments and aspects to make your character play exactly as you want it to. A theorycrafter's dream honestly, with a lot of room for personal preference or to play what your group needs on a moment's notice!
- Monetary Model (Seasons) - Season passes (new ones coming roughly every 3 months) being $10 for more content than a standard MMO with a monthly subscription makes the seasons an incredible value. Rewards track is decent and gives a fair amount of resources for old and new players to use.

Cons:
- Really poor LFG system - The mobile app is fine overall, but the fact that this is the only way we can look up groups to join is a bit rough. Thankfully community discord servers have done a lot of heavy lifting to stop this.
- RNG on Loot - Divided on this, as some weapons are now craftable and get 95% or more of the way there to a god roll, but some weapons are still much better than others and targeting these weapons can mean a LOT of grinding.
- Armor Mod Accessibility - Getting better, but still, some builds and weapons are INFINITELY stronger with certain armor mods that are not easily available. This has already been acknowledged as an issue, particularly for really powerful mods (Lucent Blade, which makes Swords infinitely better than they are currently), but still needs to be addressed fully.
- PVP Accessibility - PVP is *really* hard to get into as a new player. I have 400 hours since returning, and I'm not a particularly cracked shot, so it's taking me a long time to get used to all of the different abilities and weapon ranges that you can run into in PVP. It's definitely fun gameplay, if a bit frustrating, so go in expecting to get dunked and try to learn where you can.
- Monetary Model (Expansions and Dungeons) - Okay yeah what everyone complains about in these reviews. This needs a whole subsection:

Older Destiny 2 Expansions are... rough at this point. With the Advent of the Destiny 2 Content Vault (a process where Bungie ""patches out"" content that is already in the game to make room for new content), many people fell off of the game and I can't really blame them. The reason this was done with entirely on the technical and power fronts - bloating filesize and overpowered weapons lead to what I can imagine to be taxing meetings at Bungie reagarding design and fixing problems that have stayed in the game for far too long. If this was like a traditional MMO where you only had to buy the most recent one, maybe 2 expansions to get the stuff you're missing, I think most people would be okay with that. However, you still have to buy all expansions in D2 if you want to be able to have access to all exotic armor and all current raid/dungeon content. 

Alongside that, dungeons (3 player ""mini raids"" which contain unique boss designs and unique weapon drops) are now tied with either getting that Expansion's Dungeon Pass ($20) or getting the expansion's Deluxe Edition ($80, vs $40 normally). Now, for a player that's established, the Deluxe is a no brainer ($40 expansion + $40 of battle passes for each season), but for folks who may not be ""as into"" Destiny, telling them they have to buy the Dungeon pass to do some of the best content in this game at 3 players is really quite disappointing overall. I really hope Bungie will reconsider this model, but it definitely doesn't seem to have affected their bottom dollar, so probably not.

--------

Overall? Destiny 2 is pretty good for what it is. A new player friend of mine recently described it as ""If Borderlands took itself seriously as a game"", which I agree with. The systems are pretty good overall with the glaring exception of Armor Mods, PVE encounters are excellent, there's a lot of content to do in the game each season that rolls around and seasons come out with high enough frequency to keep you coming back. However, the monetization and accessibility problems keep this game out of contention for being easily one of the greatest games of all time.

Just hope that with what happens after Lightfall, we can get something even better."
567,BUNGIE WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT FROM ME :(
568,A bad game built on a bad engine engine by bad developers who don't care enough about the game or it's many many bugs.
569,dlc were fun
570,"This game feels repetitive and endless. I would only recommend it for playing with friends as a party game. My friends play raids together all the time and enjoy it! I've only played alone and it just didn't hold my attention. I never bought campaigns or season passes - perhaps that's where the real entertainment is located.

The game feels smooth and encounters ""feel"" good with detailed graphics, clear visual response when hitting targets, and very clean user interfaces.

However, every encounter feels soulless and I got no tangible sense of progress. Every area respawns infinitely and your equipment scales gradually and infinitely.

Seems like a good choice for a party game, though!"
571,"it would be nice to fix somehow the way points in gameplay ..  i lost the destination of the road ingame all the time.
some better waypoints to show you the way  is beter i think!!
the game is amazine..!!  real fun and action..!"

576,its ok
577,"literally played for 2 hours, finished the first mission, it didnt tell me where i needed to go so for an hour i was clueless until i went back and literally scanned every wall just incase, finally the wall opened for the enclave so i could progess yayayayaya then i played the some  more and i didnt enjoy the new class of weapons one bit.. it does 7k damage when i was doing 9k before i got the glave. so the glave nerfs your punchs along with doing hardly any damage. plus they drop zero ammo for it so you basically equip a useless melee weapon.. the story telling was dog water they covered everything in a shitty slide show or in 30 fps, they put all the effort on the looks of the throne world. they dont care about the way it feels or anything. like there is no testing or effort into this dlc like i literally waitied months so all the content could be ready and its still just like the dlc never even happened. shit company. even shittier effort put into the game."
578,"Great fps RPG
"
579,Johnny lee plays it!
580,"6.5/10 as a whole

PvE is good but PvP is genuinely the worst most piece of absolute dogshit excuse of multiplayer fps I have ever had the misfortune of playing. It is actually personally offensive how this disgusting bastardization my beautiful fps genre passes itself off as a triple A experience. The English vocabulary is quite literally too limited for me to represent how much I despise crucible, its mechanics, its place in the fps genre, and everything it represents in the world of game design. If I were to rate crucible on its own, it would be 1.5/10."
581,very fun game even singleplayer its really enjoyable
582,good
583,"There is just nothing like it. Despite popular belief, its fantastic and an absolute joy!"
584,Fuck Bungie there not getting anymore of my damn money im so sick and tired of paying for content to play the campaigns for to just have it pulled away from something i paid money for shouldnt have been taken away and give us the excuse its been vaulted to make more room fuck that you dont take away fucking content that your customers paid for bungie needs to stay with halo and leave destinys content the hell alone this isnt the first time theyve done this to there customers its no wonder youve lost a shit ton of fans and customers bungie fuck you and you will not be getting any more money out of me you need to make up for this bull shit im suprised your company is still in fucking buissness
585,"DO NOT BUY 
Received as a gift from a friend who wanted/needed someone to play with . ( several times ) 
[list]
*They ask for $99 Dollars for an expansion and 4 FOMO season passes , 
*This is not a solo friendly game to experience all of the content , so good luck with that . 
*You get very little for what you pay for from the seasonpasses , padded out with mostly junk .
*Most loot in the game are junk rolls you scrap upon obtaining ( low stats on armor / guns with bad perk combos)
* They still consider shitty wireframe models(""emotes"") and flat 2D pictures( ghost shell holograms) something worth paying for in their in-game store 
*Ship of Theseus Development Team called Bungie , remove your Halo Tinted googles . 
[/list]
Players in match-made cooperative content care little in reviving you , as the developers have ""bounties"" in this content that incentivizes competing for limited enemy spawns ( its one less person to compete for if they're dead) . 

There's more than that , its not worth your time for an always online service game riddled with bugs glitches and exploits that pop up weekly that seem to make up the bulk of content , as most content creators are limited to clickbait boring ""GOD ROLL "" perk rolls on often uninteresting reused assets of guns to pad out their uploads on their braindead viewership. 

Have some self respect and just pass on the game , and when you see Destiny 3 come out , pass on it too ."

621,havent played in years came back and this update is amazing
622,new stuff
623,"This is my Ex and we've been together for 4... no 7 years now, wow, where did all that time go?"
624,I hate this game. 10/10
625,"It is a good game, I was a day one player on PS4 and one of the very few people who still played the game back in the two DLCs pre Forsaken. RIP Brother Vance, hes dead for sure. 

A lot of people do negative reviews/comments on how there is no way to experience previous DLCs, and they're right, Bungie was stupid for that. Though, I get it, not to many people went to Mars or Venus or Io on the side for fun, and those locations took up a lot of GBs. Its saddening that all I have from those times are emblems I won't use and emotes, sparrows, shells, and other things that anyone else can get for free from bright engrams without being there back then. But hey, there ain't nothing I can do about that. 

The past is gone, but the present and future look alright. We still have multiple game breaking bugs, seasonal activities for the price of a subway sandwich, a decent story and lore to read, crucible is balanced in a (personal opinion) good way, gambit doesn't eat two hours of your day anymore, and Zavala is still bald. Plus the game is free now, so we have a bigger community too. It's not perfect, but its like I said, a good game. (And to be perfect it would have to be D1, which is impossible since they killed Cayde for sales after the Warmind and Osiris DLCs failed. Fun fact: Cayde has been dead longer than he was alive.)"
626,good game
627,
628,Nice seeing an older game still actively supported and having an active community. I feel games like Overwatch and Siege failed to meet that standard.
629,"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold."
630,"gambit sucks.
"
631,I love this game
632,Game Just crashes constantly and is unplayable
633,"Iz fun, would defo put 1300 more hours in lmao"
634,"yes
"
635,"The gun play is extremely satisfying (probably the main reason why you will play this game) and the universe's lore is especially fascinating. FOMO and anti-new player design aside, having witnessed the various declines and rises in this two-game series, I believe that they've built up something uniquely prominent in this relatively small sub-genre of looter shooters. 

And then the guardian said ""This is my Destiny 2"""
636,hell
637,gud game
638,e
639,"play for first time, finish story, be confused, grind gear, get levels, more light, grind more gear, play pvp, F*** gambit, grind more gear, find guns, talk to xur, play more pvp, GRIND GEAR, reach soft cap, wait weekly to grind powerful gear, still F*** Gambit, grind gear, reach hard cap, wait even longer to grind pinnacle gear, more pvp, find meta gun, play some raids for more gear, GRIND EVEN MORE DANG GEAR, play Trials, grind for god roll gear, fail to get god roll gear, cry, spend 100 hours finding drip, grind more gear, wait for next season.               

And that is the destiny 2 experience..."
640,ok game
641,"This game pushes me to the brink of destruction and drains my wallet while simultaneously destroying my professional and personal life.

I love this game, would recommend"
642,"Played it since beta. And had fun until shadowkeep season 2 then took a break because the season´s were really dodo and decided to play something different..... half a year or so later the game lost 60 percent of the content to ""balance""  and reduce game size. Bungie called it ""Sunsetting"" and the ""Content Vault"" until they threw away both of these concepts later on (still coming or already in the game I dont care). But early adopter of the game got shafted because they paid for the content that got ""vaulted"" and is not longer playable like : 4 whole destinations including pvp-maps,strikes,raids etc on those destinations. people had paid 60€ for it and no its gone, they never gave those people something back like a discount or anything like that for the newer season. Imagine some 3rd Party Developer Tools Bungies uses got vaulted and sunsetted without them knowing in advance and they deleted it because of size/balance Bungie would sue the asses out of them like a bitch :D. But still one of the best feeling shooter and coop experience i had."
643,"yes

644,cool w friends

660,Mid
661,Addicting .
662,best game with a great graphic also with exciting plot story without some payment to play
663,its pretty fun now and the witch queen is a step in the right direction
664,"If you like lore, grinding till you cry and empty wallets then this is the perfect game for you."
665,MUST BUY DLC MUST BUY DLC. DLC YES
666,"This is my life now
"
667,"i think i have enough hours to leave a review for this game now.

its good."
668,i've lost all possibilities of meeting women
669,"Destiny 2 is a game that is at its best when it is challenging and rewarding, and right now it is neither. Add onto that poor in game social features and a generally unpleasant community experience and it leaves the current game state stale and unfun on pretty much every level. And the real cherry on top of the game right now is Bungie locking any cool cosmetic in the game to a micro transaction. Want cool armor? Spend 20 dollars. This goes for anything in the game with cosmetic value whatsoever and it leaves the game barren of any visual representation of player accomplishment. I want Destiny to be better than it currently is, but unfortunately it seems to be getting worse every 3 months."
670,Very good game to play with friends. Requires solid cooling or else it will crash.
671,It's a blast.
672,Fun until you have to spend multiple hours grinding the same mission just to get slightly better gear
673,Pog
674,great pvp and pve
675,Premuim Orb-centric Gameplay
676,I got cross mapped by an Izanagi body shot and kept playing Gambit
677,AMAZING
678,It is a good game
679,not addicting at all 10/10
680,shamelessly designed around getting your $10 every 3 months. I can't recommend this game to anyone who has self-respect.
681,"I really like this game increase intimacy with your friends and make new friend but now i'm completely don't want to play this game so many things new and change that's mean my Really GOOD time it's gone with all the change but it's okay for new play now and if you find some game play this game if you have party invite your friend play this game with you everything you do, everywhere you go will gonna really fun if you play with friend"
682,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
683,yes
684,cuz
685,good
686,𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙩 game lol
687,Big titan bonk make me go OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
688,"GJALLAHORN
"
689,very fun
690,it is a game i have played for a while and has an easy understanding on how to do quests however wouldn't recommend if you don't want to spend money on dlc's.
691,its fun if you didnt pay full price for the deluxe
692,I only play this game because my friend bought all of the dlc's for me. Yeah it's alright i guess.
693,Coolest game!
694,"While the game is really good, it has a couple of issues that I dislike about it. One main issue is that even though you pay for content, the content may go away in the future. The ""Fear of Missing Out"" hits heavy with this game sometimes. So if you are a completionist, you may not like the game. The other is that, as of right now, you will be expected to use ""LFG"" websites to find random players to complete tougher activities if you don't have a dedicated group already. Which is getting changed... Whenever the new DLC ""Lightfall"" gets released. It may seem like I'm bashing the game, but if you have a dedicated group of friends to play with, or are okay with ""elitist"" randoms, then the game can be fun and challenging. Also don't take the PVP too seriously, the balancing is a bit of a challenge for the game devs to nail down apparently, lol."
695,amazing game
696,I have been playing this game for several years. It can be a fun game with exciting story components.
697,P
698,Very Good
699,Something alien genocide or other
700,70 quid just to do a single dungeon with friends yeah right fuck off
701,destiny
702,I just can't recommend a game that removes content that you pay for because they don't want to make another game
703,Can't play due to low graphics issues and crashes...
704,"Just dont play this
youre welcome"
705,It feels like everything is paywalled and the basic game modes are very repetetive

721,yes
722,perfect if you have countless hours of spare time to do the same mission over and over again
723,nojs
724,"Only play this for PvP and nothing else, I refuse to elaborate any further."
725,its addicting
726,i love this awful game
727,very fun and free
728,Much game. Good wow
729,"help i'm only 88 hours in and i've already bought the dlcs
"
730,"There is so much to do, and every system is unique and complex without being overwhelming. I can easily see myself putting a few hundred hours into this game."
731,"cant stop playing even though the game sucks
"
732,"The fact the content gets removed that was already paid for is an insult and blatant spitball to the face of those who supported it. Not to mention, the constancy of removing content has left me and several other newcomers to the game feeling completely disjointed from the overall story and world building of the game. Plus, that makes me starved for content and constantly recycling through missions repeatedly. I wonder where all of the stuff that offered so many planets, strikes, missions, story acts, and raids went? Oh wait. That's right. It was gutted from the game. Entire planets went bye bye and all of the DLC content with it that was paid for. SO many great PVP maps to be swept away too. 

I highly recommend saving your cash and giving it to another studio or developer who treats you with more respect than Bungie ever does to their players. Absolutely insulting to beat the playerbase over the head by charging them and then swiftly voiding their purchase. This game could have easliy been one of the most massive content wells available for a shooter, and its been reduced to a repeated pattern of bring in and bring out content."
733,"yeap, it is still fun without friends"
734,h
735,"This game is the greatest and the worst game I have ever played. I'm writing this while I have the game open. This game has endless potential, the lore, gameplay, and difficulty are some of the greatest I have ever seen. But it can fall short when it comes to finding things to do as a casual or solo player. Also it has a massive paywall to experience a lot of the amazing content. Still having to pay to experience some honestly lackluster content when it comes to the previous expansions before beyond light. Now though, this game is the best it has ever been."
736,help
737,Imagine playing a game thats pay to win. Now imagine you are unable to buy anything. Thats Destiny 2.

748,KraP is all i have to say
749,Always Grinding
750,I loved this game so much but the fact that they are racking us over the coals to even have an enjoyable time is just abysmal business practice and Im just sad that I and the rest of the community are still buying into it
751,good fun
752,if you like to grind but are willing to pay money for content this is the game for you.
753,fun but long
754,"Came back after around a year only to find that the content I was in the middle of is now gone and there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do in game unless I drop BIG money on the new expansion's. No thanks' I'm going back to WarFrame.

Maybe if Bungie let's me finish the content I payed for last year, I'll look into the new season but until then; NOPE!

At least they seem to have stopped forcing you to PVP to unlock the new seasonal exotic catalyst's; So baby steps..."
755,this game is retarded confirmed
756,Remember the game you bought 3-4 years ago? Neither does anyone else. The base game story and the first 3 expansions are just gone. Thanks for stealing my money.
757,it good enough

803,DON'T YOU DARE NERF MY DIVINITY :(
804,The poor handling of the game by Bungie makes this game hard to recommend. This game was amazing when I played it but the poor choice to remove DLC instead of updating the engine makes me saddened.
805,shoot the man and then i die 10/10 no idea what the fuck is going on please help me

810,Fun for a bit but gets boring quick.
811,it is a game
812,A confusing interface that required Google just to get through the first 30 minutes of the game the combat is ok but the Weapon system is Trash. I bought the Witch Queen expansion and learned there is a bunch of gated content before I spend more money on another 2 dungeons Another 50 Dollars I might add .3/10

831,"I like this new slightly different hand cannon, time to go use it in PvP for the next 3 hours, realize it's actually ass, delete it, and repeat again the next day."
832,Not fun
833,"Bungie has replaced almost everything I enjoyed about Destiny: The Taken King with something inferior, but the free version of Destiny 2 is excellent way to waste time."
834,is ok
835,"I would only really recommend this game if you had some friends to play with, or you're okay with using some less then ideal LFG finders for end game content. 

The gun play looks, feels and just is awesome. Some of the best in any FPS game I have ever played. The powers are fun to use and experiment on, but can definitely be confusing and a pain in the butt sometimes to keep track of. The story lines, lore in general, voice acting and questing is all top notch. The newest expansion, The Witch Queen is just AWESOME. (weapon crafting aside, anyways.) 

Biggest draw backs for me: I hate PvP. I just don't like playing it, or having to grind stuff for it. I know some people really enjoy PvP, and that's fine! Destiny 2 can provide some great experiences to a lot of different player bases. BUT, I get SO. MAD. that some of my exotic quests REQUIRE me to complete some ludicrous achievements in Crucible and/or Gambit, and it just absolutely kills any desire I have to complete the quest or even play. 

But, I keep coming back for more. Even if I only play PvE and end game raiding sometimes, it's still a really enjoyable and rewarding experience with my friends and clan mates."
836,This game is great however you will hate it. You will never stop playing
837,this game ass
838,"Every night I shed tears of agony in my one bedroom studio apartment, grinding away at Lost Sectors and the Crucible, dedicating every fiber of my being to getting my light level a single point higher... maybe even two."
839,"DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME AS A NEW PLAYER
The main story campaign and several other core sections of the story have been removed. You will not understand what is happening, what to do, or be given any direction in either regard by the game. There is no explanation of the game's systems, who you are, who any of the NPCs are, or why you will be doing any of the missions as they've removed all of these explanations from the game. This is NOT a game for new players. If you didn't get in early enough to experience the story then it's not worth joining this late. If this type of gameplay scratches an itch for you, I'd strongly recommend picking up Warframe or Borderlands 1/2 instead."
840,Great Game I've been playing for years!

847,Good game
848,"Crayon munching is gud, crayon munching is life 10/10"
849,fuck
850,It is very epic
851,"I think this game has major strides in the right direction. 

Biggest gripe is that you have to buy every little thing in order to play the game. Battle pass. Witch Queen, Forsaken, Beyond Light, ETC. The list goes on. Sucks trying to invite someone to play with you then telling them they have drop $150 dollars almost to get to do a dungeon. (Duality, major bummer.)

Then I heard that the community at one point or another revolted about them making too many outfits or cosmetics, when if they did that they could instead monetize cosmetics ONLY this game would be great. So much to do and so much to to have fun with IMO. 

Being able to make builds has been a breath of fresh air with the mods.

Perfect gun hunting has been a beautiful pain and boon for the game. I think it's great when you get the exact gun with the exact mods you like, because that is a BIS, gun. You don't have to replace it. You are good and can come back to that when you want to mess someone up. 

All in all great game experience if you are wanting to spend the cash to get the ENTIRE game, and alright free experience I would say."
852,Amazing game
853,"is pre good
"
854,"I am usually not a big fan of games that involve shooting and all of that, but the Player versus Environment of Destiny 2 keeps me coming back to play more. Also the lore and backstory are great, in my opinion. My only caution is that it can be quite addictive, so be mindful!"

883,"its a good game just a little prone to crashing and I have a 3090ti Founders Edition, Intel i9 12900 ks  so I dont know if this game is going to run for every system how it should,"
884,Yes
885,its amazing
886,"Game is filled with exploits thats abused against other players. Bungie keeps throwing shiny shit in their player's faces without ever discussing or fixing long time bugs.

Examples: 
Melee registry: You can strafe to avoid melees from registering in PvP
Stability: Range means nothing, if the weapon is stable you can shoot anyone from long distance and kill them quickly due to the headshot dmg bonus.
Mods: ungodly amount of mod mixing to have your health and shields instantly regenerate fully per kill, including in PvP
Dmg vs Fire rate: Fire rate is king, as in.. because of all the mods you can slap onto yourself and keep the weapon stable Damage means dick. So yes you will be overpowered across the map by SMGs and Pistols.

""Light Level"": In Trials and Iron Banner, theres light level being enabled, no problem except reaching max light is difficult unless you got a dedicated team on Destiny 2 and literally exploit the bounty system to reach max level for the season get yourself a fuck ton of gear early on and grind ungodly amount of time to reach the max light level that is almost impossible to reach for casual players. Making the ""High Skill"" pvp mode just a showcase of how abused the game is.

I get that Bungie has been slowly overhauling the game's classes but Ive yet to see any effort to actually cater to long standing issues. The only bugs they fix revolves around PvE and theyre bugs that BENEFIT players. 

So no, dont get the game. Itlll suck up your money and ruin your fucking day., week, etc.
"
887,"Destiny 2 might be one of the biggest money grabs in all of gaming history. I feel sorry for the poor bastards that actually take the time to play this heap of trash. Not only did the games launch suck dong but all the dlc's that bungie promised were all underdeveloped and over hyped. Being a destiny 1 player i have a special place for the franchise however that special place burned when i payed about $115 for the collectors edition and never actually got any collector additional items. Anyone with half a brain could tell you that bungie is in shambles and needs a way out fast, whether bungie actually starts hiring actual game devs or a marketing team that doesn't get off at night to charging everyone almost $100 per any bit of content. One day bungie will understand that if you give your players around 2 hours of dlc content for 70-80 dollars while other companies are showing off ground breaking development in their respected fields for 60 dollars for an entire game with 20+ hours of content. Bungie Straight up cant compete."
888,"yes
"
889,Destiny 2 is a fun game you can come back to again and again for that looter shooter game play. Pvp is  action packed. The raids are fun to do with a group of people or solo joining random people.
890,"i've been a destiny 2 player since playstation 3. or something. I don't like this game, for some reasons like, i'm bad at it. Besides that, i guess i see why some people would like it, but i dont't like it. THings BUNGIE could improve in order for me to give this game a good review is, better mouse sensitivity adjustment cnotrols, that are more stable and less likely to work one round, and fail; all the rest. alright BIE GUYS"
891,"I've bought and paid for this game twice only for it to go F2P and all the content I paid for get vaulted. That's after getting scammed buying & supporting pre-y1 Destiny 1, shelling out over a hundred dollars for content that costed late-risers $20. Maybe one day I'll support this trash when I don't get punished for it."
892,"After coming back from before Beyond Light, I can say that they have righted the course a bit. Sunsetting of content is gone according to Bingle. A lot to grind for, and their announced changes and additions coming with the next expansion are welcomed additions. 

The game however may or may not be welcoming to new players. if you buy both expansions, once loaded in you will start with the beginning of Witch Queen right away. If you dont care about that and rather watch a YT video about what happens before beyond light/Witch Queen, then you should be good. If you want to play from start to finish or even load in and go back to the older main game and expansions, those aren't options. maybe one day. 

If you like to grind out ranks, gear, mods, season rank, etc, theres a lot here to do. dont let the negative over all score sway you. Bungie pissed off a lot of people but they seem to be changing things now. the newest season, Season of Plunder has a good story and the new weeklies of Ketchcrash and Expedition are pretty fun. the new pirate inspired gear looks really cool. 

if you want a grind, it's here. if you're a returning player and want more story it's here. if you want a game to complain about after a few hours but keep playing anyway, it's here."

925,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

933,..
934,Its aight
935,"SO. MUCH. MONEY.

GONE.

I love this game :)"
936,"Great game to casually play on and off, inreasingly grindy the more you want out of it"
937,"I will give this a negative review for now until it's all fixed and here is why:

THE NEW PLAYER EXPERIENCE.
So, you want to play Destiny 2, alright lets log you in. Oh, you're being thrown into the newest DLC mission, how do you know that? Oh, wait you can't know that, you're a new player how would you know how to start new missions or even how to pick them, the game just put you into a big ass green tomb and told you to kill moth god.

So you kill the moth god and get orange looking weapons and purple weapons and then you may be teleported somewhere. You still have no idea what the story is, who you are, what is going on or how to switch weapons. You're thrown into the next mission where the floating eyeball wakes you up.
Hang about. Why is he waking me up now, I just killed a moth god with NPCs yelling at me, why does he tell me is resurrecting me NOW. Okay so I fight a tank and get told how to use weapons. Oh cool that's the key for that. Enough for today though cause moth god took 2 hours to kill.

You log in the next day SUPRISE NEW DLC DROPPED so you're automatically transported into another mission, of course you as a new player still haven't been told about this concept or that this isn't where you're supposed to be because the NPCs that talk to you haven't actually been introduced yet. So you kill.... someone or something? You have no real way of knowing. After a time you're just done with killing ?????? and go back to... The Tower I suppose?

So now you're at The Tower, you don't know what the tower is but the NPCs talk to you like an old friend. After 5 hours a real life friend of yours tells you how to find the first mission so you're finally ready to take on your first mission. However the map is so confusing you take a screenshot of the map, then disabled the quest and compare the two pictures to figure out what the hell the right icon is for an open mission. You figured it out and go there in your yellow and epic armor with a gun that shoots lighting and finally get told how to.... put on a grey armor.

You're at a crossroads here. Do you continue this incredibly useless and crap new player experience, do you persevere to play with your friends, do you just ignore the many gameplay designs that make no sense, do you accept that this game has 200 currencies AND NONE ARE EXPLAINED TO YOU.

I for one... don't know yet. I might play together with a veteran player and just play it for the sake of shooting at pixels.

But it's not fun to be treated like garbage by the devs just because you decide to start playing the game now instead of years ago."
938,Very Nice!
939,"It's Destiny 2, it's incredible"
940,Giga Chad
941,"I still enjoy the games, sure I've on and off of it, but in the end, I still come back to it. I am a warlock main, but the titan jump is way too short and somewhat slow"
942,i dont know what im doing
943,w
944,no
945,Everything locked behind paywalls seems like a good idea.
946,"The F2P aspect of this ""game"" is nothing more than a glorified demo. You get a 4 hour long tutorial, intro to pvp (Which seems fully free) 2 strikes, one mission to two previous dlc and two missions to the current dlc. So basically it tempts you with an intro to the dlc's then blocks you and makes you pay £60 for the new dlc which will be obsolete in 6 months where you will once again pay £60 for a dlc.  All previous campaigns have been removed, you cant even play the original Destiny 2 campaign its just stupid. Out of the two companies who ran halo, Idk who has become worse, 343 or Bungie but fuck this is predatory."
947,"add sex

this game is like crack"
948,"Destiny 2 has an amazing story, with regular content drops. The downside is that for new players, they miss a significant part of the story due to content vaulting. Though Bungie has committed to no longer vault content going forward.
There is a grind, like with most games of this type, but there is a lot of different content to grind each season providing some choice."
949,"Hive, bring a sword"
950,so fun
951,Fine

With new subclasses.- cool

Please delete gaem."
962,this game is great.
963,help i started playing destiny 2 again
964,fo7
965,This is a great game. Much fun to be had.
966,"i definitely have some issues with this game, i went into the game with the idea that it is an mmo, you know like it says it is.
but much of the hallmarks of an mmo i was looking for are not here, i enjoy interacting with other people in game, thats one of the biggest reasons to play an mmo. but for me everyone may as well have been an npc. no one even bothered to use chat  in party or in local areas. in regards to the game-play it really does have some pretty dang good gun play, the sounds and the ""feel"" of the guns are stellar, but it all seems bogged down by its difficult to follow story and systems. And trust me i have been playing complex mmo's for maybe more than 15 years. Plus it has a seasonal pass? seems like an extra scummy way to get money, and i hold no reservations, i know mmos are a money sink, but this just feels real scummy. shame so many mmo's have been going down the ""unethical"" way of taking your money. play it if you want, its rated highly and its free, but i don't recommend it."
967,Dont Get Sucked into this game
968,i love and hate this game and only play because its wastes my time so much. Don't play this if you're a new player unless you're willing to pay $150 for DLCS that only give half of the content they promised.
969,"Games aight. I like some stuff, I don't like some stuff, but all in all its pretty good. Sadly Path of Exile is total garbage right now, putting vision over player feedback and desires, so back to Destiny 2 I go for another 3 months."
970,decent base game for free and DLC is good as well.
971,"if you dont mind the grind and you would like a great game with nice story then this is the right game for you. 
( Bungie make the DLCS a bit cheaper )"
972,Pretty fun to hop on and do raids with friends. Hate the grind tho :/
973,it is amasing
974,the game makes my head hurt but its fun
975,:( i hate this game
976,"good game
"
977,HELP
978,Incredible game with incredible graphics and storyline. All of the content is always original and Bungie seems to never run out of ideas. This game is amazing and I highly recommend it to gamers. PVP and PVE are incredible.
979,"i like this game
"
980,yes
981,bad game lol
982,money sink
983,jetpacks.
984,"Why do i keep returning to this game and keep buying the DLCs? 
Nostalgia."
985,nnn
986,i hate this game its like a five put of ten on a good day it needs better gudiance for new players instead of them having to search stuff up about the game i dont have many hours but this game has its flaws the story pulls you in but its pay to win and it says its free to play but you will have to buy things to have just a little bit of fun but it all stops when you have to grind pvp and thats obv not good but 10/10 game would defentily recommend
987,space magic + guns = mega fun

990,the best
991,"the game is very fun however it is not very easy for new players, old content is vaulted and cannot be played anymore and the new content has little context as to what happened in the previous DLC, PvP is very difficult and is not very fun tbh but the PvE and raids are very fun but can be challenging if your raid group is a bunch of dumbos and stinkers"

1016,"This developer deserves a class action lawsuit. I'm sure their lawyers made sure they were airtight when it comes to EULAs for people like me...

I bought Destiny 2 when it wasn't free to play, I bought the expansions... None of the game I bought is available to play anymore and I personally feel like that's an absolute trash move for any company to make.

I downloaded the new, free, Destiny 2 here in steam and it doesn't feel even remotely the same to me, it doesn't draw me in or make me want to play it. Seeing the Lightfall + game pass for 100 bucks today made me want to go review this piece of shit. If you spend 100 dollars on this game, expect them to take away the content you paid for and replace it with some other garbage in the near future - history has a habit if repeating itself and this company deserves none of your money."
1017,i hate it. good game.
1018,"Coming into destiny 2 is a mess, there's no real campaign since with multiple updates they swap content around so much. ( i personally would love to play through the story start to finish wit ha select few buddies).  Destiny is basicly Halo w/o vehicle mechanics, but instead replaced wit ha unique rpg subclass system. What keeps from from fully enjoying destiny 2 really does come down to there being no campaign."

1041,"Unless you want to spend $200 on DLC to meet the bare minimum requirements for this game to be fun, it's not worth it.  The gameplay is repetitive and they weaponize nostalgia to resell you content.  Don't be fooled by them, this game hasn't progressed at all over the last 3 years.  Not to mention, the New Light experience is horrible.  Unless you have an already established group of people to play with you will not enjoy a single second of this game beyond the story (which also sucks).

1⁄4
cup flour

Destiny 2 is best described as one of those games you can play for hours and still feel like you have made 0 progress. There is ALWAYS something to be doing on your characters. And you can have up to 3 characters which can always keep you busy every week. 
The game is heavily centred around it's lore so i'd recommend watching the hours worth of catch up content on youtube unless you want to remain confused by what is happening around you.
A beautiful online community and generally very inclusive, with plenty of opportunities to group up and get involved in the larger activities.

1062,This game makes me question my sanity
1063,It's good yeah
1064,"I hate destiny 2, it's my favorite game
I know my time on steam says I have 1104 hours, but I actually have like 5 times that on my ps4. 
Now with that amount of time, I feel like I'm somewhat qualified to state my opinion on it. I love this game, it is truly a great and constantly evolving experience with very cool and unique weapons, and amazing gunplay. but just because I love the game does not mean I would recommend it to new players. It is very complex and hard to understand once you are first entering the game. The best content in the game is reserved almost exclusively for the endgame, which has always been incredibly difficult to access if you don't have any friends who play this game with you. Destiny's overall experience is greatly improved if you are playing with others, and is much worse and harder to enjoy if you don't. the barrier has always been high for entry to this game. that has not changed and only worsened with time. For players who are entering the series now, the original stories and content from this game have been removed. There are many story elements you won't be able to catch up on at this point in the games life, unless you watch Youtube videos of course. The mechanics of this game are insanely difficult to grasp for new players most of the time. They have incredible depth and thought put into them, but they are very complex for newcomers. The community of this game is mostly great and welcoming, but even still it can be hard to get into things. One MASSIVE issue with the game is that the free content is almost nonexistent. If you don't spend money on every year's major expansion and seasons, you won't enjoy what you play, the free content of this game is dry, lifeless, and not a good representation of what the game is like when it is good. If you aren't planning on spending upwards of $100 per year on this game, you honestly should not bother. the old expansions are both required for this game and outdated content that people rarely play at this point. The point is the game is a huge investment, both in terms of time,and money. if you don't have those, you won't like it. I don't think you are likely to enjoy this game if you are just coming into it now, but you can try it if you want, you don't have much to lose. These are just my experiences as a veteran and currently active player."
1065,GooooD
1066,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my son Uffe, who is 14 now. Uffe got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle Adam, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my Uffe, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son Uffe closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1067,gud gam
1068,Great Depth to the game and love the little side quests and puzzles throughout the entirety of the game !!!!
1069,"Worst game I've ever played, it’s buggy, players are sweaty af, content drip is awful and titans are broken………10/10 highly recommend."
1070,"Endless checklists and abhorrent leveling systems are mind numbing and insulting, every time I boot up the game I get angry by the DMV-esk amount of number crunching BS and cost of each DLC. It feels like paying to do someone else's homework. Do not waste your time/money trying to keep up with the rat race content and abusive community."

1088,someone help me before i end up no life-ing this game
1089,"I will gladly change this review once Bungie adds support for Linux and the Steam Deck.

If Bungie spent the effort to get Destiny 2 working on Stadia, and Stadia uses Linux, then Bungie has zero excuse to ignore supporting Linux."
1090,"Entry level has a pretty decent learning curve, but unlike other games - this one is much more forgiving . After about 10 hours and maybe 15 minutes of videos, i was able to grasp the basics and have fun. There's a lot more to learn and participate in so i'm sure i'll be putting in much more time here. Don't PVP. youll be 360 no scope one shot through stairs if you do. Being forced to PVP for the main story line kinda sucked, but I did find the team defense stuff more fun than deathmatch. Overall pretty fun so far, may even invest some cash into it to support the developers.

1117,i love this game
1118,what have i become
1119,It's alright
1120,"*Points to kirby meme teaching on a whiteboard with the text ""If a game isn't fun without friends, maybe it's  not that good of a game.""*

For someone who has been with the franchise from the beginning, it's a great game. I have a solid group of friends who I can play with and ask for help from when I need it, and I have a solid understanding of the game's core mechanics, even as they've changed and evolved over the years. Really, Destiny does it all in a sense, but it does certain things better than others. So, I would still encourage new players to give it a go, but you should be aware of the breadth of content available, it's quality, and how deep you wanna dive is all."

1127,"First person shooters were never my favorite genre of game. I played a little of Destiny 1 a long time ago, then this game was introduced to me by a friend. I stopped playing after I spent far too much time on the first jumping puzzle. I stopped after months, until a friend told me that there were swords and bows later in the game. It was also through this game I met great people, including my now partner. This game is really quite good, and I would always recommend it."
1128,I was having fun but Bungie decided to sunset it.
1129,Good game to kill time with friends
1130,"This game is older, yes, but it is such a fun game to just kill time and have fun, especially with friends, and other people. This is where the game shines, not as some massive lore filled experience. It shines as a fun, beautiful, and somewhat story driven time killer."

1143,"I've played the first game and this game for so many hours. It's really addicting but you get burnt out super fast. I love taking breaks and coming back and doing everything because it gives me something to do. Destiny 2 is an amazing game for someone who has already played the game but for New Lights(New people who have never played destiny 2) its so annoying. thankfully there are people out there helping them and stuff. Anyways, ya, destiny 2 is an amazing game and I cannot wait for Lightfall!!"

1155,I like the game and it's too confusing now since you can't access the previous mission story campaigns.
1156,"Returning player from Warmind. Learned after I bought all the expansions that I cant even play them due to the campaigns being vaulted? Constantly forcing you into newer content so older players have no clue what is going on. No direction outside of that. Why would I want to play the witch queen expansion when I haven't even started forsaken. Decided to start the witch queen expansion just out of sheer desperation for some type of value from the content I purchased up until the next time i log in it automatically teleports me to europa to start Beyond light. Game used to be really fun, but now seems like Bungie's shit practices have no regard for newer or returning players. No thanks..."

1164,"Best gun play of any looter shooter hands down, worth every penny. Now that sunset won't ever be a thing again, even better."
1165,Can't quite put my finger on it...just frustrating.
1166,good gaME
1167,"A fun little time killer, granted I had to go and read up on the entire Destiny (1 and 2) story line to get an understanding of what's going on since I never played Destiny before. 

Pro's:

- Great gun play, although I picked the Hunter class so I'm loving the bow so far.

- Runs very well considering the graphics aren't dated, and there tends to be a lot going on-screen. I get around 130-165 FPS on fairly light action, and around 90-130 on heavy action with tons of players running around @ 1440p with max settings with a 5800X/6700XT combo.

- Tons to do, especially for new players like me, although this will also fall in the cons section below. 

- Story isn't treated like a minor back drop to a looter shooter, so far, from what I've seen story plays a heavy emphasis on creating a universe that you can really get into and enjoy.

- Good soundtrack.

- Intuitive controls with KB/M, able to do things fluidly without having to do much guess work. 

- Although I haven't seen it yet, there's tons of loot for the loot-mongers out there, the pieces I've seen so far have definitely been hitting that dopamine sensor of mine.

Cons:

- There's a ton of stuff to do for new players, and honestly a lot of it can become overwhelming if you don't do everything in increments when trying to catch up. Which, for those gunning for end-game content, is a bummer. 

- Honestly, for the story whores out there, you're going to need to do some reading. When they did their ""sun-setting"" on the older expansions they removed a ton of content and story that's crucial to understanding what's going on now, if you're not a story whore and just want to get to the goodies asap, then this should be no problem.

- High cost of entry if you don't catch a sale. Luckily, I found the legacy edition, 30 year bundle, and Witch Queen Deluxe on a decent sale so I got a way with spending roughly $78, but not on sale you're looking at $150+ just to get everything you can out of the game in it's current state. 

The In-betweens:

- Cross-play, while it makes match making easier, also has it's own issues. I got into a group earlier, and one of the players was on an Xbox, and just watching him move around was not only laggy/choppy, but it took roughly 10 minutes before we could actually start, but after that the run went relatively smooth for a first time run.

Summary: 

If you have patience, a penchant for reading up, and moderation I think this game is definitely worth the investment. If you're none of those, and just want to rush to end-game, hit up the PvP scene, etc. then you're going to be in the dark about a lot of the games story and why things are the way they are. Myself, just starting out, I've just been hoarding quests and just taking them one at a time, piece by piece. I learned from playing WoW for 13 years that if you try to rush everything, and you're impatient, you're going to miss out on a lot of what the game has to offer, and this game has quite a lot. 

Sip it like fine wine, slow and steady, and once you're settled in and the buzz is there, start chugging - that's the only way I can see this game being accessed by new-comers."
1168,it's amazeballs

1176,very interesting game always something to do and if you like pvp that is deffo fun at times i have played this off and on since 2017ish always gets updates price range for some the dlc is a little much i own all the dlc including the preorder of lightfall + Annual pass i will say the end game content is way to hard though i still havent been able to do any dungeons or raids and quite a few of my exotic quests are not done good if you have alot of friends that play or if you are good with making friends deffo not great for solo play would recommend this game 80% i say 80% due to the dungeons raids and exotic quests being to difficult

1209,"Capless rant inc, but Destiny 2 has the skeleton of the best looter shooter game in existence to date (9/8/22). The Gunplay is as good as it gets, the graphics are AMAZING. The world building that Bungie has done creating this game is top notch, bar none. The ""battlepass"" thing and the microtransactions, not so much...AND they charge even more money with every expansion that has launched. Which, to be fair, has been quite a bit of content. I understand wanting to make money from your game. I understand a ""live service"" concept. But what we wanted, nay...I daresay...what we DESERVED...was an online halo-esque looter shooter that we could play with our friends and have a blast, as we did with their previous IP. What we got was a bit short of that, but an amazing game regardless. Want the truth? Destiny 2 could benefit AMAZINGLY with being taken in a separate direction as it stands. Don't change the feel or look....add 3 more classes. (3 is NOT enough for an rpg by any means) It's already a fantastic game in its own right, but its hollow. You can tell that they only care for the money, but know how to put out a quality product. I'd give it a solid 8/10."

1228,"Destiny is a game/franchise I hold very close to me. So many good memories across this and Destiny 1. It's a universe and game I love to death. It has it's ups, it has it's downs, however I think there is truly something special here. Especially if you can get past the (as of now) horrendous New Light experience, or maybe have some friends to start with you or that were already playing."

1250,Money drain but kinda pog sometimes
1251,GAS
1252,"From a casual point of view, it's a good game to drop in and out of.

Things I like:
- Gunplay/mechanics/Feels of the game
- Story (that isn't locked away behind paywalls)
- Environment (universe it's set in)
Things I don't like:
- Cost of the game from a new player perspective (nearly £350)
- Poor explanation into the 'bits & bobs' like engrams for new players without your own research (btw, they're just random drops you redeem at a vendor) <- just one example
- It's one of those games you personally want to rewrite and fix yourself...little things here, little things there that'd you'd personally change
- The 'destinations' (map view) is a poor mimic of Warframe's 'place's to go' screen. Just looks cluttered now

Overall: It's good for casual play, as long as you look into the game and how it works. End game, no idea. I'm guessing more of the same but I hear it's not much in the way of solo play there as not all of us are streamers that bring the money in...I'll happily accept investors though :3"
1253,FUN AF
1254,How do I get to the tower?????
1255,"Gun go shoot, feet go jump"
1256,this is a really fun game!!!
1257,"Game feels like a free trial, yet it's priced the same as a full game. If you wanna play free then all you get is the same crap over and over and over again. And once you've played it all (takes about 8 hours) then it gets repetative. And that gets boring, FAST.

All you get without buying the expansion packs are five to ten percent of the game. Then you have to pay the same thirty to forty dollars per expansion pack.

Destiny 2 isn't a game. It's a free trial for the expansion packs, which each have part of the game in them. And they each come at full price. Very much NOT recommended."
1258,now I don't know whether to call this double or triple jump
1259,good game
1260, returning player coming from console. Game is a completely new experience on PC. Highly Recommend trying it out again as it has tons to do. PVP is still dogwater but that will never change due to the nature of the game. Happy grinding Guardian
1261,"I loved destiny 1 despite its flaws but I just cannot love destiny 2 despite my honest best effort to.  It feels hollow and instead of fixing and removing any of the problems destiny 1 had they left them in and just added a more in depth gear system.
Progression is also a tedious mess because once you reach the so called soft cap you have to spend time doing only the activities they want you to do and not what you the gamer want to do. The game despite removing content manages to have little variety because you do not get the choice to partake you have to play what gives the actual higher level gear. Not to mention the soulless season system that is compounded by adding another level making every dlc season have a deluxe edition to get all the stuff they add.

Need I mention they never improved on destiny 1's 80% loading screen issue"
1262,"I've played too much. My cat left me, But at least i have destiny"
1263,yes
1264,Somehow one of the most addicting games i have played.
1265,"Put a few hours and a little money in, I guess its worth"
1266,this is hands down the shittiest husk of destiny ive ever seen. literally just a cash grab game that does nothing but milk the community of whatever money it has left then provides 0 content in response. and then on top of that REMOVES content that you already paid for! not refunding it at all or even providing anything in game for having bought it before it was removed! destiny should have ended with rise of iron so we wouldnt have to see how far bungie could fall from grace
1267,The controls are smooth but that has come to be expected. The graphics are on the upper end of the MMO side. The community is fairly large and very good sport. I enjoy the little bit of time I have played thus far.
1268,"Horrific game, it truly is horrible. Do not recommend."

Destiny 2 has been in a rough place ever since its release. With the first year of its life being awful and then fhe next year being a golden age for the game.

as someone new coming into a massive world, all i have to say is that it's sinking its claws in me, in a good way.
most of the other long time games i have tried playing late into a cycle have been in a way, very walled off. but this one, this feels very different.

am very excited to keep at this until the end <3"
1358,i recommend it
1359,lit
1360,"This is more of a middle recommendation, rather than yes or no. I hit yes simply because the game is really fun, despite its flaws

The gameplay is solid and the art direction is awesome. Dungeons are just as fun to look at as they are to complete which is hard to say for a lot of online games nowadays.

With that said, the new player experience is AWFUL. You pretty much get thrown into the deep end with barely any explanation on what's going on in the story. Here's 5 quests that feel incoherent and the UI is kind of a mess trying to figure out where I'm going and what I'm doing. Who is this character we're going after? Why do you insist they're really important with no elaboration? I completed a lot of the quests and still have barely any idea of what's going on!

Bungie [i]really[/i] shot themselves in the foot with the sun setting. The story is kind of an unitelligable mess without prior knowledge of past events and the fact you can't play that content anymore makes it really hard to have any motivation to figure it out.

It's a shame because this is a really good game, but they butchered it by cutting content.

If you're just looking for a fun online game to play with friends, story be damned, this is worth checking out. But if you want to be caught up on the lore without having spend time watching youtube videos of cut content, you're probably better off skipping it for now."
1361,this game is confusing to get into
1362,"Traveler forgive me, for Mara Sov and Empress Caiatl have made me sin"
1363,Huge Fan Horrible game.
1364,"CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING FREQUENT CONNECTION ISSUES. BUYER BEWARE!

This started with the addition of the Epic Client and I suspect they simply don't have the server capacity. The sole reason I do not recommend is due to the connection issues. Can't recommend a game that you might not get to play because you get disconnected every 5-15 minutes. The Epic client is somewhat better, but the launcher is clunky, and not established with a high degree of quality vs steam launcher (and steam's customer service).

NOTHING in the game can be accessed without a connection, including solo content. So connection issues are a very serious and critical detriment to the entirety of your experience. I DO NOT recommend playing (at least on Steam) until this is fixed.

The game is very much rinse and repeat with very little innovation. Keep in mind, the game does not have LFG for anything other than ""PUG dungeon"" content that you can do with your eyes closed, and is only just now getting around to it for nex year's expansion (after almost 10 years for the IP with this being a known complaint for the entire time).

Also, new content is essentially a re-skin of older content, there is a reasonable grind, and a battle pass, but the gun play itself is pretty solid. The other complaint is that half of the content for each expansion is pay-walled, instead of adding extra value to the content and paying for that, they just make you pay to experience the half of it.

Also really disappointing that they charged for anniversary content, only to wait until everyone bought it, to then release it for free on Epic store. So if you want it for free, but have already made purchases on another platform, you have to download the game twice since the licenses and currency balances don't transfer. There's only a ""half"" workaround. With cross save, only redeemed items in your inventory carry between platforms (including items bought for premium currency), while access to content (and un-spent premium currency) does not. So if you buy an expansion on Platofrm A, you WILL NOT be able to play that content on platoform B, using the same characters, since the cross save is only on the characters and their inventory."

Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer, the UTS-15 weighs 6.9 lbs. Additionally, there is a top mounted picatinny rail for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes."

1368,"i both love and hate this game. if i made a review before sunsetting was introduced i would say play this game but due to sunsetting the story is kinda jumbled and hard to follow unless you already have knowledge of the story. due to this jumbling the game itself is jumbled as it can be difficult to know what exactly to do even with the tutorial. the little bottom bar that gives info doesnt give you anythign really. the proper starting campain of the red war allowed people to get their bearing with this game. it was a starting point. it was an anchor. now with it and other campaigns gone you have lost that anchor and while bungie tried to replace it they didnt check to make sure that one had the same quality and weight limit as the old one causing the ship (the new players) to get lead astray fairly easily. the gunplay, visuals, story (if you keep up with it) are all great but its this main problem where you dont have an anchor for new players to secure themselves in the gameplay, story, and mechanics can cause players to get confused "

1391,"It's a fantastic game in theory, but the performance issues have only gotten worse. I have all the expansions and a couple more season passes to go through so i feel obligated to play. My ping is at 200ms. The only game i have above 20. Even pubg feels more optimized at times and that game is hot trash. it is a lingering issue because I'm constantly killed behind walls or outside grenade splash zones. Every few months they add stuff that would seem cool in pve but totally destroys the pvp experience. Also worth noting with how the base game doesn't exist anymore there really isn't much lore. Jeez, I honestly wish i never spent money on this at times.

Unless you have 5 friends to play with every time you get on it's very difficult to enjoy this game."

1393,"While Destiny 2 has its issues, the new player systems being one of them, getting past those early game problems and becoming invested in this deep universe tends to be extremely rewarding. The story, unlike in Destiny and early Destiny 2, is phenomenal, the gameplay is some of the best in the entire industry, and the depth and complexity of the loadout building as well as the incredible end game experience will never cease to bring me back."

1466,"TL:DR
PROS :
Seasonal Activities - Content Drops broken up by Expansions
Fantastic Story
Rewarding Builds and Gameplay ( Find your flavor )
More Dungeons and Raids than ever
Triumphs and Seals make objective chasing fun and rewarding

CONS:
FOMO on armor ornaments from seasonal pass (Paid)
Dungeon Key is a bit confusing
Champion Mods can be a blessing, or a curse ; depending on playstyle
The game made me like Uldren ( Crow )

Destiny 2 has seen it's bad years, following a trend set forever ago in the storied days of Destiny 1 : House of Wolves. However since Shadowkeep ( and arguably before ) the game has begun to shine. This game will pair great with someone looking for a light loot chase, good story, and that trademark Bungie gameplay that makes even the most absurdly annoying archetype ( Looking at you sidearms ) a joy to use.

Personally, I remember the Red War, I remember the unveiling of Mercury and the Infinite Forest. There was so much great potential there and it's a delight to see that finally, the gameplay loop has found it's feet. Beyond Light was a tipping point in a lot of gearing hiccups, and only have been improved since. Builds are back, and stats are now more important than ever. It's taken a strange turn where your gameplay can be heavily dependent on Guns, or Armor. Such a wild whiplash from previous seasons.

Witch Queen introduced perhaps the most darling of additions, the Legendary Campaign. Difficult but not spirit breaking, rewarding, and a fun challenge ; proof that Destiny can make content that even casually playing guardians can tackle and have a great time. This is a bonus considering the lead for the team is now in charge of the Lightfall expansion campaign, so the good times keep rolling.

Crucible and PvP is extremely volatile from season to season, but remains to be fun in small doses for myself personally. However I've always thought Destiny shined brightest with an unparalleled PvE experience when it comes to FPS. That being said, Trials and Iron Banner provide fantastic challenges and very enticing rewards.

PvE has never been better. Raids out the butt, Dungeons, fun seasonal activities, fantastic storylines, targeted rolls and loot chasing. This is the apex of Destiny experience for the moment and it's only going to get better. I cannot stress enough how much BETTER this feels than year one.

In summary, Destiny 2 is fantastic and will drain hours upon hours of your time, but leave you feeling rewarded at the end.

See you star-side, Guardian."
1467,Great MMO
1468,"good game, played since beta on xbox. can say it is fun :)"
1469,"if you need something to waste alot of time, this is it"
1470,"This is a well developed, well supported, and is actively progressing with its story and content. Would I recommend this game as it stands right now? Yeah, sure.

Would I recommend someone new play? Definitely not.

Like many ""live"" games, the consistent development and game progression means it becomes more and more targeted towards the existing player base. Bungie has tried developing the new-player-introduction several times, to mixed success. The very fact Bungie has removed years of story content and has no introductory video, a la ""the story so far"", cements the fact this game is not built for new players.

Even if you are a returning player, you'll need to look at lore and story videos on YouTube rather than have the game itself catch you up.

If you are a recent player: yeah, this game still rocks. New player? I would say stay away until Bungie develops a sufficient enough new player introduction. The current one is very lacking."

1484,"This game has a good mix of MMO and FPS elements that make for fun and interesting game play. While the game can be enjoyed solo, it is better when played with a group due to the nature of dungeons and raids and well as some lover level content. The price is steep if you are trying to buy everything all at once when you are just starting out, but if that is not an issue there is plenty of content to keep you busy once you buy all the DLC. My only issue with the game comes from PVP and Gambit. Gambit is just not fun, and PVP feels too much like a sandbox with little consistency when it comes to loadouts and weapons. This pushes the player to farm for weapons with good rolls in order to be successful in a majority of matches. This RNG element makes PVP much more frustrating compared to games that have set loadouts to choose from when it comes to PVP when the weapons and stats are balanced making a more fun and balanced environment."

1486,"Its fun sometimes, ive logged a lot of time into destiny 2 and 1 and done a lot of the content especially pvp. But i can so for right now i barely want to play it at all, shotguns are so Overpowered that no one complains about them even though they are broken, all i ever see in pvp is shotguns and shotguns and shotguns. Theirs multiple other types of guns in the game. Like i believe bungie needs to fix this issue, special weapons in non 6v6 modes need a heavy amount of fixing. I load into comp and over half of the players if not all have shotguns, its either that or camp with snipers. I dont think comp or trials will ever truly be a competitive game mode/modes until these 2 weapon types or special in general gets heavy changes. They are used far too much, hand cannons are even very broken, people think they aernt but they are, they take the least amount of effort to hit a headshot and you only have to hit people twice usualy due to team shots. If bungie wants to improve pvp these 2 things need heavily changed. Ive logged in a lot on console and can say even Apex legends and overwatch are more fun than anything in d2 because of how prevelent special is even though in d1 specials wernt as strong. Like how we went from d1 to d2 is just not understandable. I know its a different game but if thats the case why not call it something other than destiny. Theres so much unbalance in pvp besides certain kinetic and specail weapons, the stronger ones are far too strong. These are my own opinions about the game and i dont want anyone to read this thinking its hate, i want the game to improve but it never will if these things stay in the game. Nerf them all and youl see pvp slow down and take more skill, and then all you do is buff ammo in 6v6 so its more chaotic like people like it to be."

1494,Been playing the Destiny series for over 10 years. Although after the past few seasons I have had a falling out with the lore and have tended to look into other grinding games to entertain myself. If you are starting the game fresh I highly recommend although getting into late game content is a grind that only a select few can do solo. I'm also pretty sure I played for more than 100 hours just in destiny 1 and 2 combined sense I started back on the ps3.

Wait for a sale if your going to dabble in this moderately occupying fecal matter. Remember though, once you dip your toes into this poo pool, you will have absolutely no idea whats going on in terms of game-play and story. Luckily bungie already destroyed any semblance of what could be called game-play or story upon this ""games"" inception. Its far more important for bungie to create a smooth microtransaction shop than to ever fool around with wasteful concepts like story or lore or game-play or design in general. In other words, you wouldn't be interested in the completely uninteresting story even if you could be bothered to pay attention. This abomination will give you up to 6 whole hours of game-play before you are a drooling stupefied bored mess wondering to yourself ""How did it come to this?"". No wonder this is one of the highest played and rated games on steam..."

1505,"Mentally draining, but addicting."
1506,"This game, this series is amazing. The story, the gameplay, the raids, everything. Lets talk about Exotic weapons and armor. They are pretty much what differentiates Destiny from other shooters. They are these highest rarity possible gear you can get. They all do something different to enhance your gameplay. Need more damage for your supers? Cuirass of the falling star and Star-eater scales. Or do you want to destroy a whole room of low-rank enemies? Tirinity Ghould or Riskrunner. There are a LOT of exotics, and they help you fulfill those space wizard fantasies. This game is one to be played with friends for the best time. Don't have friends that can hop on at the moment? Try the official companion app and put on a LFG post. Only downside to this game is that the New Light ""experience"" is terrible. It doesn't really explain why we're here and why we shoot these bad guys. I just hope one day Bungie brings back the Red War campaign for those who want to understand the lore. Another option is to watch multiple hours long videos explaining the story in-depth (i personally learnt it this way). And also, the DLC prices. I'm pretty sure most of you don't want to spend 50$ on a brand new game you just got, let alone 100$ for the DLC and annual pass (including 4 seasons, and the dungeons). It is not recommended to play this game free to play, as there isn't much content, other than like 2 raids, a ""introduction"" to the game, and the occasional seasonal events, such as Festival of the Lost for the Halloween and The Dawning for Christmas. But other than that, the game is amazing and i would highly recommend to anyone who likes shooters in general."

[b]TL;DR:[/b]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Destiny 2 is great shooter and kinda tactical game, if u wanna really experience it I suggest buying at least Beyond Light and Witch Queen expansions once you try it F2P (sadly you can't play certain old content, because it was removed due to console space reasons? this is kinda turn off for me but I still liked the content I was able to play). You can also do the Vault of Glass raid(join D2 community Discord for LFG) without committing to buying first. All 3 classes are fun and good, you will most likely play them all 3 eventually, start with which jump/class ability feels best for you. ^_^

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[b]My Destiny 2 Experience[/b]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Prelude: [/b] As a shooter enthusiast I've been recommended playing Destiny 2 in past more times, but lot of people said that it's similar to Warframe and I've been playing WF a lot so I felt like I couldn't really handle these 2 games together and I kept postponing trying Destiny 2 out. 

When I actually did start playing this game, because I suddenly had more time, I just stopped kinda playing almost anything else because I fell in love with it pretty early. Also as a new light you have lot to experience, but also as a shooter gamer with their heart still in Quake 3 Arena, I kinda felt like Destiny 2 could finally be the game that gives me a bit of similar playstyle. There's strafe jump, but no strafe speedrunning, but over all I was very sad to realize I could have been playing this game much earlier if I didn't tell myself it's bad idea with WF together.

[b]Warframe x Destiny 2:[/b] 
Many WF players convert/start playing Destiny 2 and vice versa. Why? Both games consist of exploring different planets, both have various playstyles and both consist of a lot of repeatable content. I still love WF same way I did before but I've been in WF for really long time and sometimes certain builds felt too op to me to feel challenge in the game, or I just felt like I need something totally new and D2 offered this to me. WF is bit more run and smash things faaaaast, while D2 is bit more actual shooting and requiring special mods and equipment for certain situations (obviously you can smash and run too, but not in all content :D). 

[b]PvP:[/b] 
I started playing originally WF for the PvP cause it looked cool, but in reality PvP is kinda dead there or it doesn't really feel encouraged, while in D2 there's normal PvP for pinnacles(power rank levels), there is sometimes Iron Banner, other times Trials of Osiris and while there is sometimes really annoying meta in PvP it is played and you can go and have fun(or pain and suffering) there with friends. Bungie is trying to make PvP more friendly/interesting by testing new game mods. Some people come to PvP only for the rewards or forget they have PvE mods, pls be nice to them :'D

[b]PvE:[/b] 
There is campaign (or there used to be more campaigns but they sadly got removed for Bungie reasons - most likely limited storage space on consoles) which has a good story telling and some fun content, there's maps to explore, triumphs to get. There are fun dungeons and raids, seasonal activites and other PvE content. If you are starting now, I suggest you to find a nice community or few friends who will escort you to your first dungeon and let you figure out things out, I had a blast while dying in the Grasp of Avarice dungeon this way, it is really good :'D With raids it might be harder to find people who will let you do this, but rn there is new raid Kings Fall and you might still find people who are willing to do blind raid with you (as I did last/this week and it was really different experience and I wish to experience all new raids blindly <3). One of my favourite PvE activites are also solo Lost sectors, which are very easy when you do them in open world, but every day you get to do one LS on Legend and Master difficulty with chance of Exotic gear drop and it can be bit challenging especially if you're going for the solo flawless master triumph. You can also challenge yourself with doing dungeons alone or try raids with less people or even alone like some special friends of mine :'D Certain exotics have their special quest, sadly most of them are available now as a random drop or from the exotic kiosk. I would love more of the quest ones, since I would get to hear a story how they've been made etc.

[b]Gambit:[/b] 
BEST OF THE BOTH WORLDS <3
So as you might have noticed from the sentence above I love Gambit, because it is literally combination of the PvE and PvP, many people who played it in it's previous form aren't fond of its current state but since I haven't been able to travel to the past I'm enjoying what is available to me now. I wish there were more maps in the Gambit but over all I usually have good time there ^_^

P.S.: Can you all start using your super when u are invading more please, it's hard to get that last Dredgen triumph >.<

Congrats if you read this whole thing, this is my personal opinion, I play this game since March 2022 and I am happy here."

1548,"I have been a bungie fan since the Halo days, and after hearing and watching others play the original destiny back 2014 it became a staple in my library. The stoies for the universe are amazing, this is something i would normally highly recommend.

I love this, But I am endlessly Plagued by error code Marmot. 
For months on end, basically almost 6 months now, I get the same error code every day and I cannot avoid it. I have followed everything recommended and advised but I consistently crash. I'm sure others will be able to enjoy it more than I do right now."
1549,"i had liked the game but due to their auto ban banning our clan leader you lost a group of about 15 players who participated daily and weekly, it is for these reasons i dont like destiny anymore."
1550,its ok
1551,I hate this game. It's my favorite game.
1552,How do I stop playing
1553,"pve is the only good aspect of this game the pvp and gambit are absolute jokes they arent balanced at all and if it ever feels fun its ruined by cheaters and meta abusers who force you into using meta weapons just to survive, the pve is very satisfying and rewarding to end game players. if you like dumping hours into a game i recommend destiny but if you dont plan on playing regularily i dont recommend sinking the money for the dlc since youll get left behind pretty quickly."
1554,"PvE:

The PvE in Destiny has always be fun and enjoyable especially with friends. You really find yourself losing track of time when completing a raid and so for me, I think that is a good feeling to have. I don't mind grinding for hours for gear just to be well equipped for a solid raid.

PvP:

The Devs do an excellent job at showcasing just how much HAND-HOLDING there is with PvP. There is absolutely ZERO skill involved whatsoever. And the worst part is, you have to do it to get better gear. 

Any and every time I go into Gambit, Crucible or Iron Banner, it's makes me want to uninstall. It is an absolute nightmare and while I have nothing against classes per se, Destiny is without a doubt made for PvE and NOT PvP, period. Sprinkle PvP with the technical issues Destiny has and it's just bad.

Trust me when I say this. Only play Destiny for it's PvE.
DO NOT be committed to the PvP at all. Get in, complete those daily/weekly's then get out. Plan a time to do raids with friends or join some randoms and the hours put into that is worth it. 

PvP on the other hand? Lord No. Stay away at all costs. 

That is my biggest recommendation for those attempting to get into Destiny. DO NOT get into PvP. You'll ruin your entire motivation to play, trust me.

1556,"Feels like I am having sex for the first 3 weeks of any new season, then feels like shit. When play with friends no longer feel like shit. Feel like sex. It make me a happy guardian.

1557,"> Terrible Season system with lackluster content instead of creating an actual good campaign or story.

> Continual paywalling of content. (Brought the DLC? Fuck you. Pay more for the dungeon key or shell out for the 'Deluxe' edition.

> Gamebreaking issues on content releases that sometimes take weeks to fix.

> Deletion of paid content because 'it's too difficult to maintain'. (Don't make a live service fucking game then.)

> Systems implemented poorly that most of the time don't work properly. (Yeah, I'm looking at you SBMM.)

> Boring content grind and purposeful drip-feeding of content to slow your progress. (Fuck you. Play our game more as if it's a job instead of a game.)

> Constantly recycled content. (Played this/had this in D1/an earlier season of D2? Fuck you, we're either taking it away from you or making you pay for it to have it again.

> Monetisation of long standing asked for systems by players. (Transmog system? Fuck you. Grind for it or pay for it with silver.)

> Lack of interaction on their forums with players, then blaming the reactions they get on the players. (You did this to yourselves with your shit practices, Bungie.)

> Companies reliance on handing out C&D letters and lawsuits for cheating rather than implementing a decent AntiCheat system for their only game.

It's unfortunate, but the glory days of Bungie are far gone, and this company is a shit, money hungry shell of what it used to be. Remember when we all thought it was Activision? Ha, how dumb we were, eh?  I really do hope this company one day fails, and all of the people responsible for the majority of the issues and gripes that players routinely have are out of a job. 

It sucks, because the core gameplay is decent and enjoyable. The gunplay is nice, and the extended lore is akin to the Halo franchise, and yes, for these reasons and these reasons alone, I will continue to play this game. I am too far down the rabbit hole now - May as well see this pile of shit to its end. But if you're a new player looking into getting this game, even if it's free, just realise that you are going to be locked out of a lot of content, and even if you are to buy the DLCs for their ridiculous prices, you are going to be drip-fed boring, unaffecting content like an old age pensioner on an IV.

1561,"I've been pretty much addicted to this game ever since it went f2p in shadowkeep. After watching it flop in year 1 I never thought I would see the day that  I delved back into this franchise. This game is a content rich, fun, and engaging experience for those that want it to be. What do I mean by that, it's simple. 1, you must buy all the dlc, there's no way around that. While the f2p experience is fine, you're missing out far too heavily to not but the expansions, luckily they seem to keep going down in price. 2, you have to treat pvp as a VERY casual experience, or you will hate the game, and yourself. It will get league of Legends levels, of a love, HATE relationship, i've been there. 3, be very connected with the community. Guides, locations for Xur the exotic vendor, strategies, and most importantly, LFG, do it all. Lastly, have friends, or a clan. Don't have those, get them. It will enhance the experience of playing TENFOLD. With all those in mind, this game is amazing, just don't let it consume you, or you will lose your love for it. 8.5/10."

1580,"Kind of a cluster truck if you ask me. Way too much to do with very little introduction with many of the complex game mechanics such as leveling up weapons, infusing weapons, transmuting weapons, what the hell is an exotic and why should I want one. Trying to complete quests is confusing in and of itself there's multiple ""quest steps"" and steps within those steps and you're inundated with multiple quests at the start and clearing out your quest log really just becomes a chore. My interactions with Destiny have always been; Log in, go to a planet, shoot at things for a bit, look at quest log, get overwhelmed, log out. 

If this game is your jam then by all means give it a shot now that its free, but I would have 100% regretted actually paying for the base game."

The hud is so incredibly lackluster that I can't figure what is going on, the tutorials are practically useless and most of the time end up breaking and just covering 1/3 of your screen and are incredibly difficult to get rid of. The lack of customization for the game is also something I don't like, I can only choose between 3 levels of opacity for my hud? There are several keybinds that can't be identified through options or changed to separate keybinds, because why would I want my ability and melee to be the same key or to be able to identify my aerial action key? You're randomly dropped into missions when starting the game as well which is incredibly confusing and unhelpful. The artifact system is also incredibly irritating as it practically forces you to play a certain way rather than being able to play how you enjoy if you want to get into the higher tiered content. The load menus are all disorienting cinematic show offs that I would like to disable, but can't. Most of the story is meaningless as the old content has been vaulted so understanding what has happened so far takes watching a hours long video rather than being able to enjoy it through the game. I could really go on. I don't understand why this game is so well loved as my experience has been wholly disappointing."

1618,"If you've played Destiny 2 and still live in the Last City, you've missed the entire point of the game."
1619,lots of fun i would suggest finding a group of friends to play with
1620,no good
1621,Very fun with friends and is a very enjoyable game
1622,Aliens?
1623,"Just a dude addicted to space magic and hunting for those sweet, sweet god rolls.

On an actual review note:

As of writing (Season of Plunder), the game is quite overwhelming for newer players, just through the depth of all the game has to offer. From dungeons, to story missions, all the guns, raids, builds, crucible (PvP), there is so much content to take in all at once. And honestly, what doesn't help the new player experience is the current lacking of a strong introductory campaign, especially compared to the likes of the Red War Campaign, which I personally enjoyed very much. 
I highly recommend that a newer player either find a more experienced player to show them the ropes, or head onto Youtube where there are more than enough videos explaining anything you'd ever need explained. 
DLC wise, if you don't have the budget to drop your money on them all, start with 1, or wait until sales come up for the expansions. I've bought every deluxe expansion since Beyond Light, as I love this game too much... xD
A thing to add, this game is very fun with friends, whether IRL or found within the game (joining a clan can help with this). So many laughs and good times from raiding with the boys. 
For returning players, if you haven't checked out the subclass 3.0 reworks, they are a ton of fun, and a huge QoL change. 

Please remember that Destiny 2 is a live-service game, and not everything is going to be perfect or balanced when things change or new stuff gets released. But Bungie cares about what the players have to say about these things, so we're all in this together to help them build the game to it's full potential and into the devs' vision for it. 

I hope this was helpful for whomever comes across it :)

1635,"While there has been good news that Bungie will no longer sunset expansions, I cannot recommend this game as they had the horrible business practice in place in the first place. If someone pays money for extra content and then you take it away from them to where they can no longer play it after giving you $100+, then you're a terrible company with horrible practice that should not receive support for the product you've released."

1665,BULLSHIT TRASH GAME AND PAY 2 WIN GAME NOT RECOMENDED
1666,"It is a great game if you`re in it for the PvP, I absolutley love the pvp modes in this game and they are great fun but if you want to get maxed out and stuff you need to grind and i mean grind hard and be patient. the rng for some wepaons can be annonying but all in all its worth playing especially if you have some friends to take with you.
its a fun game pve or pvp. I especially enjoy the mode GAMBIT where 2 teams compete to bring down a boss monster on sepeerate playing fields, it is a fun mix of pvp and pve and can lead to some of the most intense gaming moments, for instance if you kill a enemy player when invading their playing field while their boss monster is on the field, that heals their monster! giving you a chance to go and kill yours. a game can get flipped in seconds back into or out of your favor.
get the game for Gambit alone and you`ll pour hundreds of hours into it guaranteed!"

1708,"you grind same shit until the rest of your life, dont get addicted i beg you"
1709,A good game but only if willing to buy DLC. Wait till the DLC's are on sale.
1710,I'm a D1 veteran and I've been playing this game since it came out. It's really fun to play by yourself and with friends. It has one of the best communities and everyone helps each other alot. Ofc you will experience things that you might need to understand and some frustration about the perks and rolls on armor and weapons but just like all of us you'll take the hit of disappointment and keep playing. Hope you have fun playing the game and if you reach endgames activities and search help we might meet. Game in overall is balanced(we never talk about telesto) and classes are amazing. Have a nice day guardian!
1711,I honestly think it is a good  game. I really think that over the past few seasons they have changed it around a lot. I do think there was some ups and downs that kinda made the game really hard to play at times and made it super boring to play because there was nothing to do in the end of the seasons. I also think it might be hard for new lights (new players) to get into the game because they have no clue about any of the story. I overall will always love destiny and think no matter how dry it get will always still play it because I've put so much time and effort into the game. I'm proud to say that I like the game and that it's one of my favorite games of all time along side with D1.

1720,The game is fun. End Game mechanics are a joke though. You'll NEVER complete an end game raid unless you have no job and have time to make a full fire team of friends. You won't create your team of friends in game because NO ONE uses their mic. Game is a money grab pure and simple that most people will never get to fully enjoy. I don't expect when I buy a game that I'm going to be locked out of 30% of the content.

Understandably there is a lot to learn when you first start out.
Gun Types/Slots, Major Perks, Minor Perks. It's hard to know whats good in the beginning.

There are some flaws such as acquiring all the mods for builds, and the economy for glimmer/shards/cores can feel very frustrating when you first start out.

Overall really fun and worth the time you put in."

1740,"""This game sucks, it's my favorite game"" memes aside, this game is an absolute masterpiece. The story is captivating, the world is so expansive that it can be host to nearly any type of story, and the gunplay is second to none. But PvP is a mess and a lot less competitive than you might expect from the people who made Halo, the monetization is incredibly predatory, and it's nearly impossible to get into as a new/returning player without one of us no-lifes to show you around. A lot of this is *supposed* to be fixed come Lightfall and The Final Shape, but im skeptical, Bungie's track record with that stuff is spotty at best. TL;DR: this game is a 10/10 don't play it till they fix it."
1741,"The game has great visuals and smooth control scheme that makes the all out experience great 
"
1742,"It's been 20 hours already my house isn't clean anymore, my partner is getting ignored and i keep thinking the DLC is reasonably priced. this can only end well."
1743,"Somehow less like halo, and more like Tetris 99."
1744,new player here. Its fine overall but without red war or a proper campaign system that makes you play everything in order it is really hard to find some footing in the game since the only free campaign missions are the first missions of the latest 2? expansions one that must be bought after. It was odd to play the witch queens first level only to play beyond lights first level right after.
1745,"If i had to describe this game in one word it would be ""good"". If I had to describe it in two word they'd be ""not good""."

I just wanted to play something in my off time between playing older games, something to come back to over time.
Though it seems like theres absolutely nothing to do. I played though the main tutorials and then the game just completely hit a dead end.
No mission on my map, no people in the server for crucible, no npcs to give me anything to do at all other than use my characters money, or even worse; my real money.
And im sure as fuck not buying any dlc for a game with no seemingly no story content in 2022."

I purchased the newest DLC and feel like I'm playing one of those test disks that used to come in magazines. Want an exotic from Xur? Buy this old DLC that we've removed 2/3rd of. Unless you plan on buying all of the previous DLC and all future DLC, stay away from this game. This is after I preordered Destiny 2 originally and had to stop playing after a couple days because there wasn't any content left, the game wasn't released as a finished product. 0/10"

1773,"I have put 81 hours into this game. I don't know if that's a lot, but that's my time.
I enjoyed it at first. I made my character, grinded some missions, the basics.
However, the only thing that really, truly kept me playing was the DLC campaign I had bought. After I finished it, I stopped playing.
The main game is terrible without any DLC. The weapons are boring and don't feel fun to use. The missions are repetitive and ugly. PVP is the worst. The whole game is horrendous. Seeing it again after this much time really showed me how bad it was. And, maybe the biggest problem I've seen personally, the servers. Right before I wrote this review, I had tried completing a mission (not DLC) and I played through it 3 times. I did not complete it 3 times, no. I was kicked out of it 3 times. The last time was right before the end of the level.
TLDR: Everything that can be wrong with Destiny 2 is wrong with Destiny 2, you must buy DLC in order to get any fun out of it at all. I got the hype for a while, but now I don't.

1776,"I would say at its core its a great game. It has great gunplay, both pve and pvp are fairly balanced and satisfying. The downsides is that you could fall behind if you dont want to buy the $40+ dlcs every 6 months or so"
1777,"Destiny has been good, bad, and everything inbetween. It has had different goals, and identities throughout its life, but now that Bungie has been away from activision for a while I think they have finally found Destiny's identity. Really enjoying myself right now."
1778,Great with friends!
1779,They've added a lot in the two years since I've played this. I would say all expansions are worth buying if PvE is your preference because they've really done well in that area.

1788,It is good
1789,"Just a hollow grindfest. Starting off as a new player is incredibly overwhelming. Overly complicated and bloated. 

I played PVE for about a day levelling up and acquiring gear, just running through some quests. Then the game gave me a quest to play the Crucible PVP mode. Got put into games against players that seemed to be decked out with the best gear and was just getting stomped with seemingly 0% chance of even fighting back. I'm talking about emptying full clips into enemies and getting 1 shot like they're swatting flies. Unbelievably frustrating.

I even watched a few 30+ minute guides on YouTube to try to get me up to speed and it's still an overwhelming amount of confusing.

My impression of this game is that it's a completely mindless time sink created solely to drain your energy and time. This game seems like a full time job. If you already have a real job I don't think you should even consider trying this."

1796,"Genuinely one of the best games I have ever played. Bungie has definitely turned it around. The early days of D2 were rough (pre-Forsaken), but after they split from Activision and went FTP its so much better. I play this game almost every day and I continue to enjoy it. The dlc is always amazing, and the seasons continue to impress. Don't listen to the people who call this a dead game. Every game has issues, this one included but Bungie is taking it in an upward direction season after season!"

♡ Best game I have ever played. Very fun and the game is almost endless with constant updates, new seasonal releases, and new DLC.
♡ Only downside is it is very costly if you want good things."
1822,"fun with friends. if you don't have friends, then go find some."
1823,"It's Very repetitive you basically kill hordes of enemies for like hours and that's for everything story, strikes, side qust, just killing the same enemies. Its a real chore. music is good, maps look cool, story is alright. game is boring. only good part is PVP"
1824,"Now that it's free from Activision's clutches of evil, the game feels much more like itself."
1825,"I don't have much time in Destiny 2 but I did start enjoying it till I started reading peoples reviews and watching videos, Bungie removing content really doesn't help new players since I'm new and have 28 hours into it and I still don't even know what I'm playing nor do I even understand the lore of the game. The base game is a glorified demo, if you don't buy the DLC you will be doomed to repeat the same thing over and over again. I've finally got decent weapons but I get clapped in PvP due to other players having so much more time in the game and having such powerful weapons. Its not a rewarding experience at all, how many times can you replay the same things over and over before you get bored?

The gunplay is amazing the weapons are cool the graphics are really nice and the gameplay is fun but the decisions Bungie have made just ruins the game. It seems to me this game is a stockholm syndrome simulator that preys on peoples addictions, its blatantly obvious because I had a serious addiction to Fortnite that cost me 27,000 hours and a heap of cash (Yes I played Fortnite deal with it) so I can understand people being addicted to games like Destiny. 

As it stands right now I cannot go any further without spending large amounts of money on DLC but that's not the issue, lets say I do spend the $600 for all of the DLC will I get to replay it all later? Answer is no because Bungie will remove it to keep the game under a certain capacity so why don't they incorporate a selection process for the downloading of individual DLC's? Because they're incompetent idiots, only explanation I can come up with. Or they prefer to vault old content in a bid to get people to buy the new content but all this has done is put off new players like me since I have no intention of starting the same addiction I had with Fortnite. At this point I am SICK of passes and macrotransactions, I'll leave it up to the whales to keep Bungie's pockets full. 

The whale community is quite toxic but as a sign of our times the whales that play this game will attack anybody that has any valid criticism regarding the issues that plague Destiny. I've already read so many reviews from people that have so much time into the game that have very valid factual points regarding all of these issues but are met with Whales that cannot stand someone else calling out the issues in game that they're heavily addicted to. So many childish replies I've read replying to very valid criticism of Bungie's ridiculous system. I stopped and wondered are you serious? Most of the negative reviews are from people with in excess of 1000 hours into the game so I would trust their critique more over some addicted whales white knighting of a developer that are that greedy they would drain your blood to make a profit. 

I'll keep playing it with a friend because all in all minus the ridiculous decisions and greed of Bungie the gameplay itself is pretty solid and it is fun till you start repeating the same thing over and over but that's when I'll stop playing it when it gets tedious and boring. As for the DLC? Yea no thanks Bungie, not falling into that trap. If you can just play the base game and enjoy it with friends I do recommend it but one must have self control otherwise the game will become a money pit life wasting simulator. 

To Bungie I say F you with both middle fingers in the air and my toes."

1827,"I have been playing his game for 1 week and what i can say about this game is that it has an amazing campaign story and it really pulls you in the more you play. The DLC's are a bit expensive, but I might buy it anyways so i can unlock new raids and new campaign missions. Worth it for free players and people who pay for more content."
1828,"extremely pay to win and most, if not all, of the fun things are locked behind paywalls. only spend money if u plan on playing the game for a long time"
1829,"If you bought and played Destiny 2 when it was released you may not like this game in 2022. This is actually Destiny 3. You wont be able to access your game or characters, your cool loot and emotes or any of the things you bought.  The game you played is completely gone, but don't worry you get the opportunity to pay for new adventures and emotes and items."
1830,dont even bother no help to get back into the game if youve been out for more than month

1835,its fun. but its pay to play now.
1836,"This game is like a toxic relationship, you want to break up with her so badly but her ass is just too phat to leave."
1837,i cant stop
1838,"Destiny 2 is kinda like playing Halo, if Halo was also a Borderlands game that had a lot more magic going on. Over the years Destiny 2 has really improved on its game play by redoing the old subclass systems for each of the three classes in the game, some of them have gotten worse, but overall it's still an improvement to the old system. The gun play has always just been fun, and pretty much just like playing any Halo game so it should be familiar to anyone who has ever touched Halo.

Bungie is not the worst company, but also for sure not the best, their current strategy of removing old DLC every few seasons or whenever they feel they should is really annoying and kinda stupid, but if you buy the DLC and complete all of it which you have plenty of years to do, then there is no real reason to complain.

Newer DLC is a lot better then the old DLC like Curse of Osiris or Warmind but that's up to opinion. Each DLC always has new exotics and some new quest, always with a raid to go run with Randoms or friends if you have the group for it. The biggest issues Destiny has though is the what to do at the end, cause while you do have raids, you are pretty much left to either enjoy PVP or just quit playing till next content drop. One way though they have tried to fix this issue which is respectable, is giving players a new mission each week of the season if you own the season pass.

Overall Destiny 2 is free to play and will give you plenty to mess around with before you decide if you hate or love the game, and if you love it then you can invest the price to play the game more."

1851,Belt.
1852,omg play this now its so good
1853,its a good game just it can get really boring if you dont have friends (me) but it can keep you from being bored too
1854,"Destiny is in a good place right now. Lots of content, killer graphics, and a diverse, beautiful art style spanning across all of the environments. Combat is fun enough to distract from the repeated content and the grindy feel to the progression, which in itself doesn't feel too controlled. Definitely getting my time and money's worth."
1855,Probably the best looter shooter game you'll play.  New player experience kind of sucks but other than that the game is incredible and its only going to get better.
1856,i hate this game!!!

Yeah, FuÇk off bungie."
1860,"The shooting feels great but everything else is awful, loot is a big part of the game but it's the most boring and just annoying loot system I've ever seen. Forcing you to do really weird stuff with your gear and weapon choices in order to make your power level high so you don't gimp your item drops, so you're forced to use gear you don't want to use at that moment. Or you need to constantly go into your inventory and hot-swap your gear mid-battle. 

Also the grind is really brutal, it's all just daily quests and weekly objectives so everything about progression is built around chores that you might not wanna do. The system is completely built around milking players to spend more time on the game and create or exploit compulsions of the players who worry about missing out on upgrades.

The story is a total mess, If you're a returning player you're thrown into the new expansion missions right off the bat before you do anything else, and nothing makes any sense because it doesn't give you any context, it's like picking up a scifi novel and jumping to chapter 23 in the middle of the book because you picked it up at a used book store and half the book is destroyed. I returned to the game because they announced they were no longer going to be deleting huge chunks of the game from existence (a.k.a. Vaulting) but after playing a bit it's clear the damage is already done, so until they decide to re-add the campaigns that have been cut I can't appreciate anything going on in the story.

Also the PvP has lots of matches with bad connections which makes the gunplay feel less satisfying compared to other shooters like Halo or PvE in Destiny."
1861,Removing older content people payed for and locking everything new behind DLC. Truly one of the F2P live services of all time

The game can be grindy and has content for everyone. Wanna do casual PvE? Strikes and Public Events. A PvP casual player? Crucible. A PvP gigachad wannabe? Trials of the Nine. Wanna spend 3 days learning strats and dps patterns just to find out DPS phase can just be broken by one exotic that hasn't been relevant in 4 years? Raids baby.

This game has brought me some of my best friends, some of my worst enemies, and some of the most fun I've had in a single game in many years. I definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it, especially now that it's free."

1881,"As a longtime Destiny player (since the D1 alpha), I'm quite pleased with the current state of the game. The seasonal grind can grate a bit, but the rewards are cool, if not consistently groundbreaking. Visually, the game is stunning, and the gameplay loop is a lot of fun, especially if you play casually or are looking for a game that can put you in a relaxed/flow state. Losing DLC content to the vault is a hard pill to swallow, however, and PVP is still not in a great place, but those of us who are primarily PVE players should find a lot to like here. While it's not perfect, Destiny 2 is a fun time, with lots of activities to complete and a great community to hang around and make friends with!"

1883,its ight
1884,The battle eye is a pain. it gives me a plum message. and the support on bunge and battle eye websites are garbage.  Played this game for a long time on xbox and PC and now I guess ill delete it cause I don't want to deal with the headache of figuring out what setting on My PC is causing this stupid code. Was going to come back to the game and play with friends but they decided to use this garbage of a company cheat software. Could have used Easy anti cheat or someone else. Battle eye has been causing every game that uses it to time out error. I don't have problems except with it.

1904,"Destiny 2 is a great game that is being ruined (or has been ruined, depending on your perspective) by the greed of its developers. Bungie has created a fantastic world and universe in Destiny, coupled with great gameplay and fantastic encounter design, the game itself is unparalleled in the looter-shooter genre.

This is the problem however, as it allows Bungie to essentially do whatever they want when it comes to the design and monetization of future content. Every season of every year, Bungie repeatedly reuses the same old overload/barriers on enemies to create ""challenging"" content, and every season consists of us just losing all the artifact traits we had the prior season and leveling them up in the exact same way we did before, leading to increasingly stale and boring ""progression"" until the next expansion comes out. Having to slap the same old mods onto my armor every season gets old real fast, especially when we already had them unlocked, as previously mentioned.

The other core problem with Destiny is that Bungie is exceptionally greedy, and every year it gets worse. If Bungie can't just straight up increase the price of things year over year (just look at the Eververse or the fact that this years annual pass is now $20 more than it was the previous year), they will just charge you for content that was previously free (see dungeons) or create a new system that the community really wants, such as armor synthesis, but then make it exceptionally grindy to entice you to spend real cash on it. FOMO is used *heavily* in Destiny 2 as well, to drag you back into the game in the hopes that you either dedicate all your free time during a season to complete the seasonal pass, or spend some money to level up the pass so you can get those sweet armor ornaments at the end.

Bungie does sometimes make some good choices when it comes to the health of the game, such as stopping vaulted content and no longer taking things away that their players have already payed for, and again the content that they design is always top tier, but these are stained by the continual greed they showcase when it comes to the monetization of this content, and I cannot recommend anyone new jump into this game with the predatory way that Bungie monetizes it."
1905,this game has irreparably ruined my life and i would do it all again if it came out today.
1906,"This game is very unfriendly to new players and people who are unwilling to spend on new content
Hardly anything is explained in game what tasks there are to do or where to do them. You need to either spend a lot of time researching how the game even works to play or have friends to help you through it
There is no in game social tools, nothing to team up with a new friend you meet randomly. No bonding like you do in other MMOs
lacking all social infrastructure to build a community, you need to take things to discord or some other 3rd party service to socialize with other players.

It's a very pretty game, with a lot of style, but a terrible MMO
Get friends or a veteran to guide you and be willing to spend on it's expensive DLC otherwise there isn't any content to play since the content purging
especially if you play MMOs mostly solo
play Runescape instead"
1907,I hate this game.
1908,its alright
1909,Game prioritizes money over fun and ignores your time investment or completely removes your hard earned work. Nothing more rewarding to have all your resources drained for the tribute hall that got vaulted.
1910,Idk man seems kinda good to me ngl
1911,"Titan punch hard.
Warlock never gets drip.
Hunters without adhd don't exist.
By Caiatl's Cabussy I recommend this game."
1912,"I can't really recommend it as it keeps bugging me out. I always end up restarting the game or the mission, just to do the basic; it's annoying."
1913,Great game to play
1914,"Just play it. The gun play is amazing, There are a ton of Open World zones, and just overall a ton to do.

The only negative thing I have to say about this game is that the original story and 2 DLCs are vaulted, so for new players, the game can be very confusing at first."
1915,no
1916,Can't believe I slept on this awesome game! Highly recommend you to try it out!
1917,God tidsspild
1918,Never had a game that makes it fun to grind high tier loot until now. I've been playing since D1 and I have always loved the Destiny games. Brings a different feeling of comfort playing this game. Want to pop some alien heads? Play this game!!
1919,i think i am gonna regret downloading this
1920,"I spent way too many hours on this game, and I don't regret a single second of it! Lots of fun to be had, MASSIVE Story lots of different game modes and it has PVP!"
1921,Challenging and fun. Kinda addictive
1922,you can see oryx's feet if you look off the edge
1923,The worst game anybody could get into is a complete waste of time and money. Devs only listen to half the community or just ignore them and do whatever they want with no input from the community. Every new weapon is a reskin every raid is old content all the armor is reskinned its complete wank. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
1924,This game has changed my sleep schedule and put me in crippling debt. Would recommend
1925,Better than Infinite thats for sure
1926,.
1927,alriiiiii
1928,fun
1929,Did not play much of it but still fun
1930,"Great game, fun to play
"
1931,This is one of those they did not put much work into the questing system. The issue is the game has been out so long that there is so much trash in front of you. So many random quests and random things to do a new player has no idea how to get started. The story is odd and hard to follow. It has you replay the same area's with different levels of content over and over. It is easy to get lost on other quests or lose track where you are.
1932,Awesome game
1933,aboslutelyyly nmot
1934,fun pew pew and also  gun go brr and boom
1935,Can be fun but it is definitely not friendly to new players.
1936,You kill things
1937,Man idk wtf ever going on in this game
1938,this is an amazing game i recomend to anybody thats into grinding and playing with friends !!
1939,Not much to do
1940,This game has no good servers and worst of all if you  pay for season pass there is chance that u wont get it at all and no one even cares!!
1941,"idiot devs, dont know how to make a game"
1942,güzel
1943,"Lost track of main quest, no zones had any quest marker indicators. Didn't know what to do. Most places locked for DLC."
1944,"This is such a great game! The only downside is the constant nickel & dime they do for new content. It’s always good and I eventually break down and pay for it. However, it also takes away old content which is disappointing. 

With all that said, there’s really nothing else like this game on the market. The controls are tight as hell, and the game’s performance is among the best even on older hardware. 

If you’re a fan of Halo this is a must-play. If you’re a fan of FPS then I’d say this is a must-play as well. You can go solo or play with friends. Either one is just as satisfying."
1945,"Oh man. There's just so much to unpack with this game. I'll start with the cons because I'm a pessimistic human being.

Cons:
- THERE'S SO MUCH TO THIS GAME. There's so much content that has been removed that if you're a new player, good luck getting behind the lore without having to watch a Youtube video explaining everything up until the Witch Queen DLC. I personally know very little of what's going on but I'm a Hunter and I throw fire knives A LOT.
- If you take a break from the game for a week, you're SOL on some content that you will more than likely never have a chance to claim again. I personally HATE this. Life happens, things can get boring and you want a little break.
- You will find you're confidently giving this company more and more money for cosmetics and feel zero guilt (this might be in the wrong section)
- Repetitive. Once you have, admittedly, blazed through the campaign and some small story-based side quests, you will be back to square one of playing Gambit or Vanguard Playlist or hunting down catalyst for Exotics.
- Light level caps. Each campaign DLC that comes out brings new Light Levels for items. Once you've gathered basically all you can from the new DLC of the year, you essentially cannot get to higher Light Levels. For example: you start out with an armor piece that has a 1450 Light Level, come the new DLC you will find items that are extremely high level from the previous cap. Once you finish with that DLC, you will be lucky to find items that are 2-4 Light Levels higher than your current item's. The items just turn into material farming at that point.
- DLC =/= price. These DLCs cost slightly less than your average game at $40-$99 (basic/deluxe). The amount of content is truly not worth the price but addicts don't complain and neither am I, I am just warning you people. The new campaigns are always short but lots of nice new cosmetics and new weapons, just the storyline is short and kinda boring.

Pros:
- This game is BEAUTIFUL. The quality, the sounds, the environments, the perspective. You genuinely will feel small compared to some of the mammoth structures in this game and that is something I have never seen before in the games I play. 
- Lots of lore. There's a lot to learn about the backstory to the characters and even the bad guys. They're not just mindless NPCs to decimate. 
- Quality of NPCs. I love the diversity in their behavior, they DODGE projectiles sometimes, they scale in difficulty and damage, and they will follow you to end you. Good luck hiding. I also love that ally NPCs ACTUALLY DO DAMAGE AND KILL STUFF.
- This is NOT a pay to win type game. I will constantly complain about how much money I spend on silver but I like that my character can look how I want her to look, be cool, have cool weapons and whatnot, but I'm not paying to literally be better than another player and give myself an unfair advantage.
- Aspects. Aspects are kinda new for subclasses BUT they make your character more customizable to how you want to play the game and how you want your character to function. This makes you feel more unique, you can test different builds, and overall makes it out to be a more fun and personalized experience.
- Matchmaking. For an online game with PvE and PvP the community (in my experience) has not been very toxic at all. It really does give you that team effort feeling. Idk if the the matchmaking pairs you by skill, but what ever algorithm it's using works wonders and I always have great teammates.
- Hard ass bosses. When they let you kill a bunch of little guys and then big daddy comes out to absolutely one shot you, you will be furious but I bet you won't give up. 
- Feels like a TV show. Each DLC is a new episode and I kinda like the feeling. Dunno how else to put that.

Anyway. I guess I could do a TLDR?? But it's a review so why wouldn't you read everything..
This game is awesome but is not very newbie friendly. If you have a friend that is more experienced with the game you will 100% love it more. Beautiful game, heavy lore, lots of content if you play constantly so you don't miss it. Not a play to win model but you will feel compelled to spend more money to look cool and of course buy the full game priced DLCs. I've never played this game under the Free to Play model so idk how much content you will get out of that. You will be frustrated, meet cool people, have difficult bosses, but also ruin the entire enemy team with a well place 'nade. All in all? Just buy the damn game."
1946,It is most good
1947,best game in the world
1948,Game bad
1949,"good

1950,good
1951,"I've been a fan of Destiny since the 1st one launched. I didnt immediately return when D2 launched. Came back Season of the Splicer. The games been an absolute blast. Perfect for a dad like me. I can play for short or long sessions and jump in anytime. Love the PVE and PVP content. The only con i can say I have is trying to teach a new friend the game. For people who have never played D2, the quest system seems hard for most people to figure out and i have to generally guide them through the first few days. Hoping Lightfall expansion will help with this."

1963,yeah its alright easy to play a bit of depth too. A lot on investment though
1964,Good soup
1965,good game
1966,Don't drink the coolaid. Feeding us the same content that they just took away from us in the last update is not worth sixty dollars.
1967,"I have 30hrs and feel like I haven't even scratched the surface, this is refreshing seeing how short lived most online games are. I can remember countless battles with friends on this game. The graphics are the cherry on top on the amazing game play. I will often find my self taking breaks between fights to look at the stunning scenery this game has to offer. I have purchased dlc because I feel I can get a few years out of this game."
1968,.
1969,other then having to pay for the story and lots of farming for items its a good game haha
1970,Its ok i guess
1971,"finally got that slightly cooler helmet 
"
1972,still fun
1973,"Destiny 2 isn't an MMO, first and foremost. There's similarities in the community aspect of the game; You can join clans, see a few people randomly in the overwold and do things with them, and you can use in game or external means to find a group to run content. There are ""dungeons"" and ""raids"" in the game, which are similiar to traditional MMO dungeons and raids, though a bit more simplistic mechanic wise and typically require either 3 or 6 people respectively. 

What Destiny is, is a first person ARPG. The typical gameplay loop is much more akin to the likes of Diablo and Path of Exile. I'd say a more apt description is that it is a hybrid ARPG with MMO features and Destiny 2 really nails that feeling here.

Destiny 2 offers a lot to players. There's tons of activities to participate in and the overwhelming majority respect your time, usually only taking between 5 - 30 minutes. The game is also beautiful, being driven by a team of very talented artists. On top of this, the general gameplay loop is fundamentally sound. Shooting feels good and so does utilizing your Guardian's abilities. This is paramount, considering this what you're going to be doing 90% of the time. I also personally like that the game generally feels fair in how often it dishes out a decent chunk of loot, which is another cornerstone of ARPGs - giving you that sweet, sweet dopamine when you see the item you want drop.

On the other hand there are a few things that can and do detract from the experience. First and foremost, if you're any type of competitive player and engage with other games like Counter Strike, Valorant, COD, etc... the PvP is very lack luster. Even though Bungie is known for developing Halo CE - Halo Reach, they have opted to use P2P for their PvP match making. This results in decent matches at best and typically frustrating experiences on average. P2P is not ideal for any type of FPS PvP experience. Other issues include team stacking in anything but the solo ranked mode offered (which doesn't allow you to queue with a party). The saving grace is that the PvP isn't really required to enjoy the game. 

There is also the fact that the game has a ton of loading screens. Unless you use external applications like their Destiny companion application on your phone and dim.gg, you will end up shifting between loading screens a lot. It's a bit of archaic game design and could possibly be attributed to the previous generation of consoles. Regardless, even with the third party apps you will still have to go through instances of: Loading into orbit (the pregame lobby if you will) > load into activity you wanna do > load into loading screen of your ship entering hyper drive > finally loading into said activity. If you run the game on a solid state drive you can shave a ton of time off this but, considering this game is crossplay with previous gen consoles and has a general focus on playing with others, you will still be subjected to a lot of loading screens.

Finally, I believe the worst aspect of the game currently is the new game experience. They have tried to remedy this with  the 'New Light' campaign, which currently serves as the game's tutorial. The issue with it, is that after you finish the tutorial, you are still thrust into the world of Destiny without any real proper guidance on what anything is or what you should be doing. Sure, it introduces you to important vendors in the main hub but it doesn't bother explaining all the activites you can do to you, so you either blindly just try things out and/or end up needing to Google just about everything you do past the tutorial. This can be incredibly daunting for new players and really needs to be touched on and revamped. 

Overall, if you like shooting stuff and getting loot so you can shoot bigger stuff to get more loot and so and so forth this game is for you. You can pick up a lot of the old content for very cheap, though I would recommend just sticking with the recent expansion and the directly before + shelling out for the season pass - if you decide you like the gameplay loop that is. I would give this game a solid 8/10."
1974,"It's like crack, only less affordable"
1975,good game but it is not fucking free to play
1976,i love this game
1977,wow i wont lose content that i paid for again
1978,its really a good game
1979,My favourite point and click adventure.
1980,"I mean, I HATE the way they do expansion content yearly and then literally took away the older, original stuff. I wish it was all included but whatever I guess.

What is here however is incredibly satisfying and arguably better than anything that was out before it so idk, it's not really a huge deal at all.

Worth playing tho."
1981,banger
1982,"I have over 2000 hours across multiple different platforms. 

Love the game, hate the game, get frustrated over it, cry, celebrate, scream, everything.

And that's just the first 30 minutes of the game for me.

Worth a try imo."
1983,It is great

1985,error code baboon
1986,;)
1987,is good
1988,fun
1989,"Game absolutely sucks. It's repetitive after some point, And it doesn't have much to offer except for the start of each season, But otherwise than that, it's kinda bad. Would highly recommend playing this. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely fucking hate this game, But it's the best game I've ever played, And i love it so much. It's unarguably the best game I have in my collection. 100% would get lost in it as much as i have now, but 1,000,000 times over. Love you Bungo"
1990,he he loot.
1991,i enjoy it.
1992,Gud game
1993,at least it's cheaper than cocaine
1994,I Would highly recommend not even installing this game if you want to be f2p or want to try to have fun this is not the game for you it has nothing you can do after 2 hours of gameplay.
1995,this game good man!!!
1996,I like money
1997,I really like the game. I wish I had more friends to play it with
1998,W
1999,"I love grinding the same activities over and over so much. I cannot recommend this game more, it's so addicting."
2000,good
2001,"with 2,000+ hours on all consoles, this game is ass. Dont buy anything"
2002,"I cannot recommend this game for too much content has been removed. I stopped playing about 2/3 years ago and decided to buy it on PC and come back and play it, see what's new etc. I made a new character and i was ready, ready for the red war campaign, ready for the forsaken DLC (which i got to play a few weeks before it was removed), but when the red war intro didn't start and instead put me in the tower, I was confused. Had i missed something? Had i done something wrong? Did the game messed up? So i looked up ""destiny 2 red war not starting"" and videos came up about why red war needs to be re-added and I was shocked, what game removes it's own campaign? What game has no regard for new players? I looked up ""forsaken dlc removed?"" didn't find anything. So i bought forsaken, played it, completed, then the next day, it was gone. What the fuck? who decided to remove it? why did they remove it? So I quit the game for a few weeks, came  back with a new character to see if they had added an intro, or maybe re-added the red war. Nope, no red war, but at-least there was an intro, but a strange one. Is this a beta intro or something? So i looked it up and it turns out that the intro was destiny 1's intro. Again, what the fuck? This is disappointing, I thought Bungie was meant to be a well respected company, for fuck's sake, these people MADE halo 1,2,3 reach and ODST, 5 great games. Yet the dropped the ball so badly with this game the ball is in a different fucking universe. I cannot recommend anyone interested in getting this game, getting it. Too  much has been removed for it being worth playing."
2003,crayons
2004,shit game. too many tutorial popups. boring gameplay loop. stinks
2005,its a good game
2006,Great game love gambit and crucible
2007,I love this because of the its story and the visual. The pvp is also fun and you can do random side quest if you are bored as well
2008,"fun game, go pew pew, dlc mad expensive tho ngl"
2009,cried
2010,"0/10
well i purchased this on battlenet years ago and tried playing it today only to find out that i was supposed to migrate my account. of course this expired forever ago so they went ahead and deleted the account. guess they really dont want me to play lol nice"
2011,"Despite my hours I played a lot of Destiny of console. It would be nice to play through the story and catch up but they removed the entire original campaign along with a paid expansion or two. This is beyond a brain dead decision, why alienate new players by removing their context for even being there? What about fan favorite characters now not even in the game? 
Why even buy the expansions if I don't have the original story to begin with? Hopefully they add them back as I have no reason to play without it, if I wanted to play a shooter for its gameplay alone Doom would be a better option any day."
2012,#1 game ever made
2013,good
2014,I hate Destiny 2. It's my favorite game.
2015,"good game, really makes me feel like i hate myself. 10/10"
2016,make it stop
2017,"not even 10min and 0min of actually playing game, boom achievement... no ty"
2018,"School yard crack dealer much?
""Here's a taste for free, want more? $220+ plus for the extras"".
Crazy repetitive, but is fun. The free to play doesn't get you very far, click on location or event in Destination and ""BUY ME"", click another ""BUY ME"", and another, ""BUY ME"".  Graphics are Amazing though and game play is smooth.
Like to grind, grind. I'm not much a PVPr so raids etc aren't much an appeal to me. Tried to follow the story but got lost a few hours in. But again, graphics are awesome! 
"
2019,"good very grindy but good
"
2020,We need a 6th for Master VoG
2021,"Everytime I try and come back to this game its quick to remind me of all the things I cant do unless I spend money on x or y expansion or pass. Its to the point where there is an actual in game checklist that tells you what content you are missing. To make matters worse the game cheekily lets you do the start of all the different mission types and game modes and then slaps you in the face with a ""buy this if you want to continue"".  I want to like this game but they wont show me all the things I CAN do with the content I have purchased so far they just want to show me what I CANT do until I have everything they are selling."
2022,It's alright ig.
2023,"I hate this game its my favorite game ever
all jokes aside I really do love this game a lot; the community is so amazing and the game itself was there for me during a hard time. really happy and super excited to see lightfall and the future of destiny!"
2024,i cant put in to words how much i love this game i have over 2000+ hours on my ps4
2025,"Ran a legend lost sector 16 times in a row and no exotic drop. took a break, repeated 10 times, no drop.   0/10 repetitive as WoW with a less drop rate."
2026,help
2027,"I like all the different quests and storylines that are available, although they do cost quite a bit of money and you can't progress through this seasons story line without the season pass apparently. The outfits are awesome and the graphics run smoothly most of the time."
2028,"shoot, die , wake up , boom, space,titans,war"
2029,"I cant get enough of Destiny 2 ,i am  never going to stop playing this game"
2030,"Destiny is a game that has a vast amount of potential... for the right people. If you enjoy long, late night grind sessions with a few buddies for a gun that is moderately better than the one you have this is the game for you, If not well that's just fine. This community has been so welcoming when I found the right clan and I met strangers that I talk to on the daily, no matter how many years pass I will never disrespect this game."
2031,From what I have played its been fun. I wish the network would quit dropping my games tho.
2032,"The destiny games are 2 of the worst gaming experiences i have ever had, This game resulted in sending my life tumbling down wards into an endless abyss that i will never escape, I lost all my friends, my social status, the love of my life, my job all because of destiny, not because i no life it, but because these games just blow dick

Buy it"
2033,DO NOT PLAY
2034,I just smashed my TV in front of 30 guests at my party because of the Destiny 2 servers. My wife just took our kids and said they’re all spending the week at a hotel. This game has ruined my life and my party. I can’t handle this anymore. Goodbye Destiny. I am no longer a fan.
2035,ATTENTION: Contacting Destiny Servers
2036,great gameplay and fun community to pvp and run strike or raids with
2037,"Good game. Halo with magic & more aliens. Lots of minute tweaking available to character, for better or for worse"
2038,Poop game
2039,"destiny 2 was unreal until current season ""season of the plunder"" they have completely ruined PvP with SBMM implemented and the servers are a complete mess at the moment, constantly getting kicked. This season is the downfall of Destiny 2, RIP."
2040,FUN
2041,really fun
2042,"This game is fun, ive had it for years on my xbox im just having a problem while switching to my computer, its putting my screen name as guardian3453 (numbers are random) and i didnt put it as that, if someone else can find a way to fix that please tell me haha"
2043,we all hate it but we all come back to it.

2048,eh
2049,See Time Played
2050,best game
2051,"the cost is the big issue for this game dlc's cost an arm and a leg game has a massive amount of cheaters because they just refuse to a type of anti cheat that scans your pc to ban cheaters.,"
2052,Good
2053,epic effects but no fun in story
2054,this a good game
2055,"Imagine with me if you will: you pay $60 for a sequel to one of your favorite games of all time. It comes with a good amount of content, plenty of time to make memories with the boys. Then all of that is taken away and ""vaulted."" To continue playing, you only have to spend $100+ on all of the subsequent DLC that has come out, because if you don't, most activities are locked. This game should borderline be illegal, its practically extortion. Pair all of that with servers that take a shit and punish the players for ""abandoning"" when the server boots them and welp, you've got Destiny 2."
2056,besides servers being poop. 10/10
2057,"The game has plenty of things to do but introduces each of them poorly. I recommend getting into the lore and finding a niche that you enjoy because for anyone thats a fan of ""the grind"" for loot Destiny has this in droves."
2058,dont
2059,"they made a dumb decision 2 years ago so i quit
i came back today to see they didn't stop making dumb decisions and half the content is removed or changed entirely and it's hardly the same game anymore
they just keep apologizing and they still keep getting away with it because the community is braindead"
2060,So much content. Easy to get sucked in.
2061,"The additions and changes since first release are great. It does cost quite a bit to get all of the expansions, and some of the mod systems are clunky but I'm having fun playing!"
2062,Best game ever
2063,"This game has the servers on Mars, I'm struggling to play this stupid game for about 4 days, every time I get connection error,I kept trying to search the internet to solve the problem, but it's not something that can be fixed, it's the same thing as protype 2, a game that doesn't work on steam"
2064,"I love the game play and story but there are far too many issues with logging in, server crashes, servers unable to accommodate the number of players, disabled weapons due to op, the list goes on."

2066,Great game. Love it. 10/10 would make out with it if it was my wife.
2067,"Only Sea of Thieves has had anywhere near this many errors codes that halt you from actually playing the game.
Codes like Plum, Weasel, Baboon, and many other dumb names they came up with to explain their poorly coded anti-cheat software is blasted in your face as you lose connection to the severs, resulting in the game dumping you back to the main menu or just kicking you out of the game all together.
Don't waste your time, this is a game so bug ridden from anti cheat that you'll feel like you lose money just from playing this free-to-play garbage that I can only imagine exists to make sure you need to purchase whatever in game currency or item Activision shoe horned in to make a profit off this trash. 
I too find this ironic, in that I wasn't even able to reach the pay to win aspect before giving up. I only hope you see this review and know not to even give this piece of garbage the opportunity to waste your time like it did mine."
2068,it's ok
2069,GUD
2070,i mean its alright
2071,"It's fun with friends. If you don't have friends to play with it's a slog. It's a slog with friends, too. But it's more bearable. Also the monetization is more and more egregious, the story makes no sense, the design/weapons/art/music is more and more creatively bankrupt, and the guns/skills are more ridiculous and uninspired each and every season.

I'll keep playing probably."
2072,enjoyable

2074,keep getting a faulty connection error code when i have over 100mb speed

2076,might be the worst game I've ever played?
2077,i love this game but the fact that i have to rebuy the dlc even though i bought it in the playstation store makes it to where i cant play it on pc which sucks cuase i really want to start playing on pc
2078,"good game, not worth playing if you dont pay"
2079,"makes we want to kill my self every time i play it
my favorite game tho"
2080,very fun doom style combat but i have only played hunter so i can not say about the other two
2081,Not a real video game
2082,this game feels like a completely finished and refined power trip that they labeled an mmo/fps/lootershooter but its good enough if you don't pay for every season on release
2083,mid game
2084,no
2085,amazzing game
2086,Satan
2087,Destiny 2 runs surprisingly good for how good the graphics are and you have lots of freedom even without any of the DLC's
2088,this game gives me unholy motion sickness
2089,"addictive by design, fun great game with predatory monetisation, avoid at all costs"
2090,causes pain. i like it
2091,Crack In Digital Form
2092,"this game is on a different level
"
2093,"MY WIFE AND KIDS ARE GONE, THEY TOOK THEM, I CANT HAVE THEM BACK TILL I BEAT ALL THE RAIDS HELP

Solid game tbh just not much to do without dlcs"
2094,"i have 1200+ hours on my lost account as well. only ever made 1 character, titans for life. Punch it, didnt work? punch it again."
2095,E
2096,yes
2097,This is my favorite game of all time. I played this game for 25 hours in a straight through session with no breaks. I beat the boss
2098,"you need some friends to play this with, yes solo its possible if you like to torture yourself like that. 
"
2099,Game is great. Free to play. Great Great game to soak up some time.
2100,"I spend about $100 a year on this game, give or take. That's a lot. It's also, for me, worth it. It won't be worth it for everyone. If you just want to play the expansions, it is well worth it- but only spend money on the seasons if you *really* like the game. 

The game is one of my favorites and I've been playing since Destiny 1's release, through all its ups and downs. I've taken full breaks from seasons, but I don't see myself doing that anymore. They've really nailed the content loop and the core narrative is solid and diverse. There is downtime after the seasonal narrative ends where there isn't much to do except play the game and unlock better weapon rolls and cosmetics while tackling difficult challenges.

For a new player, it will take time and serious effort to get into. It's the one major negative. The new player experience leaves players fatigued by slow progress and a boring beginning. If you can push past that, and try to learn about the world's context and story on your own, you'll be rewarded for the effort.

That's it! The game is beautiful and I personally believe Bungie is doing their best at maintaining the game while preparing endless content for the next decade. The Destiny universe is both wide and deep, and if you love sci-fi, or fantasy, or both... you'll love Destiny."
2101,"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE i'v never played a game where the company just keeps messing up the matchmaking for no reason! They never do anything about the main problems but, are gonna mess up the whole game even more when it was fine to begin with. I can honestly see they care about making money off of people instead of making a good game that's actually good. Bungie literally forces you to play with a specific play style that only people who rushes play with and dose not even requires skill at all. I,v been playing this game since D1 and all i can see is this game getting more worse and not fun its filled with cheaters they don't even do anything about at all then 1 weapon in the entire game could be the most over powered weapon archetype that some people might want to use because they don't like that specific archetype but now they have to use the weapon if they want to win or at least see a little bit of a difference in their play style just to win a 6V6 match. Bungie loves to make people utilize one side of a weapon archetype instead off all of them but, in a FPS all weapons should be viable at all times. I'v never seen a company (THAT MAKES THE GAME) can't even control what gose on in the game but, to let the mainstream youtuber's complain or pitch their own idea then bungie allows it, while you have a whole community behind them that's complaining about things that just literally makes since but they can't do that because that would be completely going against the youtuber's play style! It just makes since why would they care about what the youtuber's think about the game and, why do they only listen to them its because their the only one's pormoting a Terrible company's game! I also know that they don't care about a veteran that's been playing Destiny since launch back in 2014 of september or what i have to say because I know because I haven't seen any improvement changes at all and I know that there not going to be any!"
2102,it good game
2103,"As a long standing destiny fan, I would recommend coming in on the release of the next major DLC release. The base game has not much to offer but that is what buying the DLC for a otherwise free game is a good I idea."
2104,7 or 8 times i must be a bungie fan
2105,yes
2106,"Been playing since 2018 and have well over 2,000 hours, though I don't have a whole lot of advice other than just play the game how you want to play it. If you don't like the game, feel free to drop it, but if you are interested, just try and get through the tutorial missions, because while those missions are [b]ass[/b], it does get better."
2107,"I mean its fun an all but having to do lost sectors for gear you dont have for it not to drop after your 20th try on top of it being nearly impossible to complete because of the health regen being ridiculous. Then adding in pay to play events now. Then having to pay ridiculous amounts for the expansions and buying dungeon keys which should already come with the expansion content. Have the guns an areas arent even play tested even tho they say they are, plus the constant killed by the the magical architects or the constant server kicks. Lets not add the fact fortnite skins are now a thing...... oh the melee hit register yeah dont even bother on that one their just napkin slaps for you but 1 shot for others. Oh lets not forget the content lock! :) ENJOY!"
2108,"Great shooting mechanics but just a trash money grabbing game overall. Locks players out of dlc they previously bought, Makes gear that was farmed for useless just because they want to sale another dlc... Activision was never the greedy cancer that is this game, it was Bungie all along. Enjoy the last bit of money i gave you, buy your mistress something nice...."
2109,.
2110,I love it

2113,"I got bored, then I remembered this game existed and decided to play it again for the first time in a year or so
It can be fun sometimes, but some parts are designed specifically for 3 - 6 people to play together to even have a chance of winning.
9/10 solo, 10/10 with friends."
2114,Fun loads to to do and tons of new gear and quest to completer and collect worth every penny BUY NOW !!!

2116,"Game is extremely unfriendly to new users.
Additionally, very little content for F2P users. I ran out of new content to run about 20ish hours ago."

2118,bosh
2119,i dont want to live
2120,:)
2121,was good just not good anymore you have to pay money for every expansion pack and you don't get any new content  game has just kinda died out

2128,it good
2129,cool game where shoot people
2130,one of the best shooter I've played in a long time. definitely my favourite game now
2131,Cash grab anyone?
2132,"Ever since they removed the ORIGINAL GAME that I bought, its been a FOMO crapshow!
I bought this game for the story of the red war and really loved the lore around it. last year, after a long time not playing I wanted to replay the story again with a new character... Guess what! THE ORIGINAL CONTENT IS BEEN REMOVED!
this means I BOUGHT a game ,what could be playable as a single player shootergame, that is been REPLACED by a greedy free to play looter shooter sweat game....

don't waste hardrive space on this, spend your time on a better game!"
2133,Cool
2134,"New player here. I spent 3.4 hours in the game, and I didn't know what the heck was going on. And I don't mean like ""Oh! I skipped the tutorial and dialogue, now I am lost""...  more like walking into a random household and pretending to be a part of their family, or waking up from a coma and looking to your left seeing a child calling you 'dad' that you don't even recognise, or want. Just no. Aint no way."

2149,Strikes kind of suck and all the good exotics are locked behind old DLC that may or may not be playable.
2150,good
2151,Better handled than Halo right now.
2152,"Checked out the game after 2 years of hiatus, half of the playable planets are missing now. A typical case of 'more DLC's = less content'. No thank you."
2153,very gud
2154,"4k hours in total drained 
over 500$ wasted
0 bitches 
worth it"
2155,This game will suck you dry.
2156,dlc required for the nightfall and the game has more locked behind dlc then the whole game has to offer. The light is so unimportant considering each update they increase the base light level and the battle pass is far to unbalanced and you cant gain enough to buy it back if you max level it on the paid side. honestly the game is dying because of these problems but the devs just keep doubling down.
2157,this is a great game
2158,Help me.
2159,first 2 hours a bit boring but after that quite interesting.
2160,it's aight

2168,Honestly one of the worst games in my library
2169,"I tried to come back after taking just over 2 years off. I quit in the middle of the Shadowkeep expansion i wanted to try Destiny out again. The total overwhelming nature of everything new just seemed too much. I wanted to load into the menus and have a look around to get a feel for what had changed. Getting thrown into a mission was instantly frustrating and for the game to perform poorly despite me having a not terrible setup but something i would of hoped to get at-least 60 fps at 1080p. (i9 9900k, RTX2080, 16gb Ram). So i quit the mission, went to the menus and looked at everything and the nonsense menu Ui and noped out. 

The game seems super cool but i don't have the time to figure out what needs to be done. More power to people who enjoy the game Destiny is defiantly not for me anymore."
2170,great
2171,MOST ENGAGING GAME IV'E PLAYED IN A WHILE
2172,"This game has had its ups and downs for sure. I personally think the PVP aspect is toxic as all hell, and while most won't admit, there are a ton of cheaters in this game. PVE is great and the game is usually bug-free. I avoid PVP/Trials, but love the PVE portions. GM's, Lost sectors, crafting, NF's and the campaigns are awesome. I can only hope the game will continue to get better."

2188,"The game is a lot of fun and easy once you learn the mechanics. The only thing that can be confusing is if you are trying to play through the DLCs, it can be difficult to figure out where you have to go next since the game is anything but linear. Still loads of fun, whether you play alone or with others"
2189,Amazing story line and gameplay in general. 9.9/10 would recommend.

2191,good ass game
2192,Full Time Job and just as fun

It is visually very appealing.
has F2P elements but you will be limited. good way to decide if you like the game enough to purchase it tho.
sound is well done.
lots to do.

Can be very grindy if you want to be the cutting edge.
it is nowhere near what D1 used to be."

2195,"It is an amazing game. I hope that the reviewer hat reads this knows that this game is the most amazing game ve ever played. Great Storyline , great weapons and the quests are fun."
2196,"[h1] Absolutely the most unwelcoming game ever [/h1]

What lured me into this game was definitely the world, story, and for me
with absolutely no prior lore knowledge of this game, the lore and
mystery surrounding the giant white orb, The Traveler.

Upon recent hype surrounding the upcoming DLC Expansion, I got intrigued
to try out this game, as I now saw that the base game experience was free to play.

Tought I might've just test it out. I was thrown into a area in Russia, woken up
by this small tiny robot, no time for explanations, we were in danger.
I was immediately interested in this world, a old, fallen, forgotten world, yet familiar,
overtaken by fauna, trees, and left in ruins. I really wanted to find out what had
happened to the world, what is The Traveler, I want to know why
we are in danger, how humanity has reached this point.
I bought the DLC's, (Hindsight, dumb decision).

The game was immediately fun, the gunplay is solid, the semi-MMORPG-openworld
solution, loved it. Got going with beginner quests, which'll act as a tutorial.

Does not explain much about the story, but ok, I will probably be well informed
and enlightened after this tutorial sequence, and I can start my
Destiny story experience.

Once the Tutorial was over and I had gained some good equipment I was
(at the time) pleased with, (Light level 1390), you are sent to the last city of humanity,
located under the giant sphere called the Traveler.
Still, no explanation about anytyhing, about the story, what has happened,
but, you are greeted with a fuck ton of icons, pop-ups,
side missions, multiplayer game-mode related quests, item store and shit.
 
I have no interest in any of this, fuck off. Tons of multiplayer modes, gambit things,
Strikes, Vanguard quests. I was lost. So I continued doing the quests that blue main captain
dude gave me, you know, the first character in the last city the game introduced me for
after the tutorial part. Which lead me to Vanguard quests.
I was thrown into a world, with two other randoms, while the
voices talking about some, dude, did some thing, and we have to stop
him? Like, who? Where am I, whom is this person we have to stop? And why?
What is going on?

Once we cleared the Vanguard mission, I was greeted with items,
far beyond what I had gathered during my tutorial phase. My gear and weapons
went from 1390-1400 to 1530-1540. Why, where's my sense and joy of
gear progression and sense of building up my character to a strong point?
Now I am suddenly certified to do the hard modes of Vanguard missions, called
Nightraids/Nightstrikes or whatever, and what, after one damn mission?
My sense of progression had been severely butchered.

And all these items, upgrade slots, currency items, I can upgrade weapons
using other weapons? What does that actually do besides increasing light level?
Does it make it better? What do these armor stats do actually? Intelligence stats,
Strength stats, Resilliance, I had to google this because the game didn't bother
learning me what all these stats are nor what these small upgrades and gear
mods do, at all. Hell, by pure coincidence I found out you can upgrade the
number of energy slots your gear had so you can fit more mods?
Why the hell didn't the game tell me this?

Some gear has different energy affinities, like, void, fire, etc.
Does that matter? Are energy slots just energy slots, or do you want to try getting
gear that has energy slots of the same affinity as your character has currently?

It is an absolute mess of an overwhelming number of things and lack of information
and clarification, it is fantastically infuriating.

At this point I had somewhat started understanding some things, ok, where's my
story campaign at? Some other person gave me a Quest called, A Spark of Hope,
or something, so I went to Europe on earth, to do this quest.

Before finishing the quest I dicided to call it a night, and continue tomorrow
morning.

I booted the game up the next morning, (my second time booting up the game),
and I was met with a new cinematic, ok, where is this going?
There's some people on Mars, and that meditation lady is also there? How are
they breathing there? Ok, doesn't matter, anyways, what's the dealio here? They want
to figure out why Mars has reappeared? Wait, Mars was gone at some point? Where?
why? how? How long? And wait, there's a alien faction also on Mars and they have a
huge fucking rifle canon attached to a space ship, they going to shoot something?
What is this H.R. Giger looking spaceship that materialized infront of us?
Shadovan or something? Who the hell is that?

What is even going on here? Who are all these people the game shows me and
refers to all the time? What even has happened? I know nothing, the game
keeps showing me crap I have absolutely no prior knowledge nor context for
to possibly understand or know any of this.

Where's my campaign quest? What's going on in this story?

I found back to the quest back on earth, in Europe. Retrieved one thing, then it sent
me back to Russia to, complete the arc conduction weapon or something. I finished
the quests.

And then it was gone. Mr. Blue Main Captain dude didn't send me to a continuing quest line,
it just ended there. Okey, where am I supposed to go? After a time on the Destination Tab,
just randomly clicking on different worlds to se what's going on there, I went to the Moon,
saw several icons of, quests, compaigns, Raids, dungeons. Tried clicking on the
Moon campaign quest. It showed me a cinematic I have no context for to be understanding
this shit, pyramids or, whatever, why is the Hive at the moon? Why have they erected a red
version of Sauron's tower here? Why is the moon cracked? fuck off game.

Why is this so confusing? Why is so little to nothing explained, why am I just thrown into
a story, with no explanation or context for what's going on and whom these characters are?

Then I googled it, and found out they have REMOVED, and purged the original base game
campaign, and the, one or two first Story Expansion campaigns, out of this world.

Gone, no way to play it again. So there's litterally, no way to play the story. You are
forced to be thrown into absolute clusterfuck of confusion, or watch hours
of YouTube destiny story lore videos...

This is horrible, and what a horrible way to greet new players. Throwing them
into whatever mess this is. It is by far, the most unwelcoming a game has
ever been to new players, that I have experienced.

That's why I can't recommend this game. If you're looking at this game for a new
epic sci-fi story and universe, look somewhere else. This game is beyond ruined
for new players, don't bother, this game is no longer for the story, this game is now
purely a multiplayer money-cash-grab, MMO dungeon raid game. Bugger off Bungie."

2199,"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold."

2216,"good game and fun. tbh everything is great besides raids. not my cup of tea. way to long and i see it only as a flex. dungeons are way better in my opinion.

the ability to do the raids if your lower level is only a pay to play. so much spam on destiny app for you to pay someone to carry you thru raid or actually do it with your account.

everything in destiny has a glitch at some point or another but doesnt make the game unplayable

2229,"Tried to get into the game several times, and each time it turns out a bunch of content was removed, a bunch was added that is tied to whatever was removed and you're thrust repeatedly into missions about some random people shooting some other random people for some whatever reason with no context whatsoever.

Maybe had I started playing at launch and kept with it for the entire time, religiously, maybe I'd have the faintest clue what this game is even about.
But I didn't, so there's no reason for me to ever try playing this game again."
2230,"Ive been playing this game sicne 2014 since about teh first d1 dlc was released i ended up spending about 10k hours on it in d1 between my 2 accounts (my first hard drive got corrupted) I enjoyed every minute of D1. Because I was a naive child. I sold my soul to that game buying xbox gold every month and the most joyous occasions of my life were when xbox live was on sale because of a holiday. over the years i continued to sell my soul to bungie throwing away my social life and neglecting all my friends, I even skipped school for new raids and pvp updates. Then destiny 2 released the most horrible bugged game ive ever seen in my life but at the same time the best game i had ever played. It was D1 with fov changers. The first 3 dlcs were great the story was good and i liked the lack of plot armor given to the player during the red war. I ended spending almost a thousand dollars on this horrible terrible game. I farmed day in day out as the new pvp and pve metas changed every other week. I tortured myself in day 1 raid attempts and slowly lost my sanity in pvp especially trials. These were the good times. Once shadowkeep released it was all down hill. Pvp was broken telesto probably didnt work and the story was terrible and dragged out with a million plotholes. I completely quit the game during season of the splicer hoping things would change but the game stayed the same and i kept playing regardless of the fact that i hate it wholeheartidly. Every story was horrible and the witch queen story was a horrible let down. they could have done so much more with the light hive and made the savathun fight a worth while raid. But no they remastered vault. Here we are in present day every pvp player uses a cheese weapon and pve is a joke. Nothing in the end has changed it was all wasted time i threw away my childhood for this terrible game and i dont reccomend that anyone falls into this horrible pit of despair called destiny 2. Great game!"

It def has a very active, mostly awesome community and while in between season/expansions it can get dry, there is never a lack of places to explore or loot to farm for. 10/10 and an 11/10 if you have some friends who also play/wanna try it out. RAIDS ARE THE PINNACLE DESTINY EXPERIENCE DO NOT SKIP OUT ON THEM. The rest is up to you on what you like to play but there really is something for everyone."

2241,"Ya know, when this game arrived in my library I sincerely thought it would not surpass Destiny 1 in any aspect. Boy was I right, this game had 1 good season and 2 good DLC's until it ran out of content and became a washed down holding cell for mentally challenged 15 and 36 year olds. It takes your money through expensive colorful micro transactions while simultaneously robbing more of your money with the low effort DLC's that run out of content in 20 days (Yes, I did count). Wasted 234 hours of my life on this muck."

2249,"I played Destiny 1 a bunch and played Destiny 2 through the Forsaken expansion. After not really touching it for four years, I picked up the more recent DLCs.

Positive: this game plays great on a controller and is a stellar shooter.

Why do I not recommend it, then? The structuring of the story content is an absolute mess. There's no indication of intended order, and a lot of the older story content is outright gone now. I booted up the game and got plopped into the first Witch Queen mission, which starts with ""Mars has reappeared"" -- when did it leave?!?

It's fun to go around the open areas and do the pop-up events, but it's hard to feel connected to the world since the story content is in such a weird place. And going through the story content is easy on the easy difficulty, but very difficult on harder one -- so it's pretty off for me. Power level is also scaled down for the missions, especially the older ones, so there's not a feeling of progression of getting stronger and being able to take on harder content.

 So although the gameplay is good and the story is interesting, it's really turned into a grindy live service game that I found wasn't worth my time."

The witch queen dlc is classic bungie levels of amazing. out of the park with that one.

Beyond light is alright worth 1 playthrough at least.

stay away from shadowkeep.

other then that the new stuff with the seasonal model is actually pretty decent. full cutscenes and story every season with good rewards for doing activities even without the season pass. 

somehow despite its shaky launch and bad looking midlife. it has far surpassed any recent halo experience.

destiny 2 is good now. Unless bungie does some sus shit with sunsetting content or weapons again. then stay far away."

2301,"i love this game, this game is so very good, i really love this game.
"
2302,"Really great game, keep coming back to it having played D1 since Year 1, would highly recommend.

However, if you want to play it F2P, don't bother. This description is a misnomer, the game is a glorified demo if you don't buy the DLCs, and there is no point in playing sadly. Whilst not as egregious as some other MMOs like WOW which require monthly subscriptions to even enter the game, you need to spend ~£70 a year for all the new content through the Deluxe DLC Edition.

'Vaulting' content is another issue, 99% of the content from the first two years of the game has been put into the 'Destiny Content Vault', likely never being released again. Whilst a necessary evil debatably, lowering the games size, content you purchased was removed. Whilst Bungie has promised not to retire anymore content, the bare minimum, it makes the story difficult to follow.

Asides from these problems, this game has to be one of the most captivating games i've ever played (I am writing this after playing for 12 hours). The gameplay loop is unique and unlike any looter-shooters i've played. Class and Subclasses are varied. The weapon grind and its payoff, grinding a quest to eventually earn an exotic and using it for the first time is a feeling never replicated in other games.

Would highly recommend the game if you are willing to buy into it and look over some of the worse parts of it. I have logged around 2-3k hours on Destiny and Destiny 2 from 2014 across almost every platform (360, Xbox One, PS4, PS5 and PC) across multiple accounts so I can only give a rough estimate. While my time investment may be a lot or very low having played for so long, I would say it is my favourite game series."
2303,"Its a pretty fun game although the vaulting of the free campaign and the multiple expensive dlcs are kind of annoying, its still worth trying out."

They can just get rid of paid content whenever they feel like it. Forcing new players to buy new DLC. Also they don'y include all the missions in the dlc now. If you want to get all the content you have top pay extra for the ""Deluxe"" edition. Destiny 2 players are cucks and I'm shocked i didn't have to pay an additional $15 just to write this review for the game.

2337,OK this is a hard one for me I've played destiny one and destiny 2 since the beginning on PlayStation I have well over thousands of hours on the games that I made the switch to computer same thing I really enjoy the world and everything in destiny destiny two when it first came out was harsh I really didn't enjoy the gameplay or anything like that like D1 was but it started to grow better with each expansion each season it started to get better and better do I recommend a new player jump in right now if you're willing to put in 100 hours just to get to the good parts 'cause it is grind there's multiple things you have to do just to get to the fun stuff so that one is left to people that want to play the game and I would recommend only playing the game if you have friends playing this solo is more of a chore than anything now with that said the new seasons and expansions coming out have gotten better story wise gameplay wise it's about the same as it was two years ago they ever really updated much in gameplay other than the new classes well updates too the new classes have been pretty fun you get to enjoy your power fantasy as far as story wise goes they're starting to clear it up in next two years it's going to be end of their saga after about eight years of playing the games finally get a closure to the lion dark saga fantastic for new players it would be horrible because the new light system is hard to get down with most new players I've ever seen or talked to have been super confused and I wouldn't blame anyone waiting for the next saga to jump in I wouldn't recommend it as a solo player and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not willing to put in like 100 hours to get to the fun stuff

They continue to bring back old weapons, armor, raids, because they are too lazy to push out new, interesting content. And if you try to voice your opinion, they will mute or block you.



As for Crucible, the sandbox continues to complexify itself and bloat. There is no hope for the Pvp side of the game in my opinion. I came to terms with what the game is and will continue to be since shadow keep, and that's where I started seeing the cracks. I don't have a desire for this game to be competitive, but I do expect the Pvp to at least be playable. They make changes that no one really asked for, such as slide nerf and introducing the aerial effectiveness system. These kinds of changes don't really change how people play the game, because people have been playing with sliding & from midair for years. So its not gonna suddenly flip a switch for them, instead it makes the game feel like sh*t by adding another annoying element of rng."
2346,is good
2347,It gets boring fast and is not worth playing compared to other games.
2348,if you are a Halo fan you will like this

2351,good
2352,"I haven't seen light in months, my soul is dying inside, I highly recommend it."
2353,"Endless builds, great competitive PVP and PVE."
2354,This game is like getting stung by a bee in the d!ck
2355,it hurts but god it addicting
2356,i really enjoyed playing this game again
2357,10/10
2358,please give me a dlc for free im poor 💀💀💀💀💀
2359,Rahool
2360,great game
2361,I only recommend the game IF you buy DLC. Since Beyond Light the f2p experience has been absolutely gutted.
2362,good game
2363,buy the dlc and i mean all of it gayboys
2364,"Not quite sure yet, lemme just play a little bit more"
2365,"I played this game on console for years and when i got it on PC the experience was so much better , so i would recommend you to purchase and play this game it is cross gen so u can merge your account from console to pc  . It is a grind be prepared !!"
2366,"Returned to it to play Beyond Light after having played through Forsaken and Shadowkeep in 2019.
It got boring fast. No shade thrown at the people who want to stick with it, but I feel like there exists better stuff out there to spend my time on."
2367,"The One Pieeeceee, The One Pieeeceee is reaaaaal
CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER? SO HIGH"
2368,"One of the most unethical developers in gaming history. If you like buying DLC then having it removed from the game, this is your game. There should be a class action lawsuit against this company."
2369,yer
2370,"Very good game, VERY good game.... only if you have all the DLCs'.lol :("
2371,"This game is very great, apart from the fact that it takes up a gigantic amount of size and a bit too high of PC specifications. (also i checked the free box because it was free)
-Mosu or mossyrockytemplate"
2372,game
2373,yes play this game
2374,enough with the whachamacallits
2375,Year 4 is better
2376,"destiny 1 was prime, this, well whatever this is... its not the same..."
2377,This game is a blessing but comes with a curse of binding
2378,Why not?
2379,q
2380,when devs fix battleye fail i minght try play it but un-till then .... the shelf Is where it lives
2381,This game is on my favorite list. beautiful graphic. And very expensive DLC. NICEONE
2382,"Destiny 2 is in a pretty good place right now, though pretty difficult to get into as a new player"
2383,"I just bought this game apparently not knowing what i was getting into. Starting up a new character i saw the you just got woken up quest that i vaguely remember from playing years ago, and from there it went down hill fast. After completing the starter quest line i simply had no idea what was going on, the quests were confusing and i was just bombarded with all the season stuff and a million quests that i had no clue what they were for. I couldnt figure out where the story line quests were so after a 5 hours of playing i decided to use google (which is a mojor failing in any game if you have to use an outside source to know whats going on). And come to find out 2/5 of the story line is no longer available... So glad i wasted my money buying the legecy edition to not even be able to play the full story. I asked for a refund anyways but im not expecting anything. At least i know despite splitting from them Activision is still running strong in Bungie, and i know to stay far far away from their products."
2384,Played with my ex back before they started removing dlc I paid for. Ugh.
2385,"Play the game if you have time to grind, some money to spend or if you are bored. PvP isn’t forgiving but it’s fun when you win. PvE is great and can be challenging at times."
2386,Been addicted to Destiny since 2014. Help lol
2387,This game is hot flaming garbage and I hate it
2388,I hate this game
2389,"follows the usual destiny 2 grind, but so far , as a returning player, everything has been streamlined and feels way faster paced and fulfilling"
2390,Genuinely impressed how the same gameplay loop for years hasn't deterred me from throwing my wallet at this game.
2391,great experience for a combat game.  pvp can be nasty but not anywhere near as much as other games.    it will be difficult for young new gamers probably.    i wouldnt pay the prices they are asking though.
2392,Love playing this game with my son online.
2393,"This is a very enjoyable if you are about to put a lot of time and effort into it. Getting into the game is very hard due to how much content there is and how fast the game progresses. But that effort pays off with the fun end game content. But you have to come into this game and spend a lot for the DLCs which is understandably a huge turn off for many players. But if you are able to invest, it's a hella a ride"
2394,"the guns are average, gunplay below average. the quest system is hot dog****, and at no point was i even entertained. waste of time and endless money siphon to keep playing; dont bother"
2395,Best
2396,good but pricy
2397,If you invest yourself in this game it will destroy your socia life like it did mine.
2398,Great Storyline fun pvp a little difficult to get started and may be confusing but a couple youtube tutorials always do the trick

2404,"Addicting game! Period. So much fun, so much to do and explore and all the mods to armor & weapons are so cool."
2405,"Wanna die inside for all eternity? 
then this is the game for you!"
2406,fun game i thought it was bad but give it 20 hours and you will find enjoyment.
2407,11/10 i hate it
2408,Fun game. I have about a thousand hours over consoles and computers so the game has obviously kept me entertained. One downside is the money you have to spend to keep getting content but otherwise very fun and well done
2409,"I personally love the lore from Destiny 1 & 2. I enjoy the grind if you're into that type of game. Overall the gunplay is top notch. Build crafting can be a lot of fun with the changes they've made to all of the different classes recently. Plenty of different PvP & PvE options for that grind. Also, Raids are some of the best moments I've had in gaming."
2410,Best game!
2411,"great game
"
2412,yes
2413,Great game! Always getting new content. Always something to do. & best fps gameplay in the industry. Highly recommend if your into fps looters
2414,no
2415,grindfest
2416,"100 hours in I've loved this game, never got the chance to play Destiny 1 other than at its beta launch for xbox. Due to shortly after beta I switched to PC. This game has been loads of fun already, though some things do take some studying on but doesnt take long to get the grasp of. Within my 100 hours, I've completed all current campaigns, Shadowkeep, Beyondlight, and Witch Queen. Thanks to bungie allowing them all FTP for a week, and I already had the legacy collection. Sadly, I've not got enough friends to do any dungeons or raids so I've not been able to touch that part of the content, though I've been told they are very fun and annoying at the same time. I've touched the PvP, really hard until you've progressed through the game cause it's filled with people who've been playing the 7 or 8 something years the game has been out, and have all the guns, and armor in the world, making their builds extremely good. Even that being the case, I was still able to do some work in the crucible and tear mfs up. I'm hooked, and excited for this new expansion coming next year. Watching the trailer for it only got me more hyped and I can't wait. If you're looking to get into the game, there is a huge pay wall, I recommend key sites just saying, or waiting for sales to drop if you're not into that kind of thing but it'll save you loads of money!"
2417,"Não consegui progredir no jogo por conta de uma missão logo no começo. A gameplay é até legal, mas só de o jogo não funcionar já não vale a pena. Perdi meu tempo, não recomendo."
2418,I really wish that I could play the game but Battleye will not let me. I can enjoy my time playing Destiny 2 in 5 to 10 min intervals.
2419,its shit i hate it
2420,The content and style of play
2421,A nice game
2422,this game is so fucking mid please go plsy somehting else i  hate everyone at bungie for making this shit
2423,Whole lotta money
2424,"It has been awhile since I have played Destiny 2. I will admit that it was a rough start for a bit, but this game has come a long way. It is nice that it is a free game, but the additional DLC does cost money and that I think that is the only downside. Other than that, this game is alright. 4 out 5 stars."
2425,"Played a little, It's alright I guess.

Bring back Self-Res warlocks."
2426,easy to use for a newbie
2427,"I have been playing Destiny for years and it never ceases to amaze me. 

The PVE side of the game is great, it can suck you in for hours, fighting bosses, getting amazing weapons, meeting other players ect. The PVP side is enjoyable, even though with SBMM now you have to give it your all every game so it's not very laid back and casual.

Witch Queen did not disappoint campaign and content wise so I cannot wait to experience Lightfall."
2428,"I have traded my social life and career for the past 2 weeks since installing the game, i'm in desperate need of help. 10/10 would play"

2446,"Была любимой игрой, а сейчас полное дно."
2447,game will betray you
2448,"I. Love. Destiny. I have been playing the series from Dark Below onwards. It was a beautiful thing, I built so many memories from playing it as a younger person, but Destiny 2 has broke me, and left me broke. Two expansions in and I gave up, I vowed never to go back, but I did after Beyond Light dropped. The game is still fun, I love and still love playing it, but l literally can't make money, and for this game it means I have to decide whether I should keep playing it or keep money on hand. It's hard not giving in, and I will admit I have given in, but you should not. I will still play this game until it eventually ends, and when it does I hope it ends on a happy note, which I so highly doubt. Don't put your money into this game like I have, it will only make you wish for more."
2449,"Its a tough love relationship. You get very cool content here and there but also melee whiffs and SBMM. Like I said, tough love.




Oh and you forfeit your bank account.

Very epic game :)"
2450,Fun game. Kind of pay to win with all the expansions but can be mostly played without them.

2464,.
2465,"I'm only down voting this game because i had 1000+ hours in this game on Xbox upon original release and i wanted to get back into it again. I followed all the cross save platform instructions and when my Xbox account was linked with my steam account successfully it showed like i had never played the game before on my Xbox account, not a single character or achievement. But it did somehow have the last ""clan"" i was linked too so it worked for just that one aspect.

So now if i really like to play this i have to start completely from scratch with none of my unlocked achievements, or cosmetics. Which is basically all that i would've loved to still have.

"
2466,this game is draining my money. can recommend.
2467,"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold."

2482,"Как я и ожидал, когда вводили сезоны, игра скатится в жуткое однообразие - так и произошло: все сезонные активности - кальки с активностей предыдущих сезонов с, в основном, косметическими изменениями. Убогая система итемизации брони (2.0? Вы серьезно?..). 90% всего оружия - никому ненужный хлам, крафт, к сожалению, положение не спас. 
Подземелья, рейды? Пожалуй неплохи, если вам нравятся гигантские пустые пространства и дикое совершенно количество паркура. 
Читеры почти в каждом соревновательном матче, иногда несколько человек из одного клана (сначала пытался репортить, потом забил, так как ситуация нисколько не изменилась).
В общем в текущем состоянии не могу порекомендовать.

2498,"Spent way too long trying to clear the first few missions because the waypoints kept bugging out, only to discover that there is essentially no story mode as it has been deleted by the developer.

No problem, just enjoy the open world? That's where you'll receive weapons you don't actually have access to use which the game then asks you to visit their website to find out why.

If you enjoy lore you're better off reading the Wiki because you won't find it in-game. Characters are campy, yet take themselves seriously, but worst of all give you no reason to care about them. 

PVE Strikes and Vanguard missions? You'll get matched with day-one players who simply run past enemies to reach the end of the level so good luck keeping up with them.

PVP? Meet the same day-one players with much better gear and weapons then you'll ever invest the time or money for so have fun feeding their kill streaks."
2499,yea
2500,pog
2501,it good
2502,"This game is a lovely title that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys sandbox and/or resource collecting games. This game is one of the best sandbox games I have ever played. An interesting yet well organised blend of in depth fantasy with the features of a well polished resource collecting game.

First of all, the fact that this game is 2D possesses both the ability to run the title on virtually any computer, and the art style of the game is simple, yet with the sound, atmospheric. This ability to blend art style with gameplay is one that I have only seen a few games achieve. The game play mechanics are simple, a ""hot bar"", or the slots of your player that are visible on the screen at all times allow the player to quickly navigate their most commonly used items in the easiest, fastest manner. The UI is centralized and clean, so you don't have to worry about ""Where is [Insert Button Name Here]...?"". The fighting mechanics in the game are simplistic, though are built upon when it comes to the large assortment of weapons that you will gain throughout the game. Anything else regarding performance is not to be worried about, quick loading times. Menus of the game are organized, though it may take a few seconds if you are searching for a specific option. On a side note, I do not know if this was fixed, but your save files may become corrupted at rare occasions, though I think they may have fixed this bug because it does not seems to occur anymore.

The depth of features in gameplay is of abundance. There are too many features to discuss in one review, though I can assure you that for the price of which this game is at you will be satisfied with the plentiful amount of items/features in the game. The game does feature a character customisation option when you want to create your character. Inventories are carried over into multiplayer. Single players world are also separate from you characters, meaning that you can use as many different worlds on as many different characters, and vise versa.

Multiplayer is simple to use and requires no real tinkering to work. Setting up a LAN for a few friends is easier than it may seem as there is pre-packaged software for small servers right from the developers. Playing on servers over the internet may use software called TShock, which is simple to use as well. Joining an internet server only requires an IP and a port.

Plentiful amounts of gameplay provide a depth of gameplay that not many sandbox resource collecting games can provide. Simplistic UI and mechanics means users need not a PhD in computer science in order to operate the game.

Overall Terraria has it's bang for the buck when it comes to it's genre. For it's price, I do not think that you will be disappointed with your purchase!"
2503,"F*ck this game, it's my favorite.
Also be prepared to waste money and time grinding for guns that will be powercreeped in like 2 seasons.
Still a good game tho."
2504,do you even have friends? cause its fun with them :]
2505,"D1 was literally what got me through middle school. This game has a lot of issues, but it will always have an incredibly special place and my heart. I will almost always be down to play it, and Raiding has brought me some of my favorite memories in all of gaming. The monetization of cosmetics is pretty iffy, and pisses me off a bit. But ive already dropped so much money into this franchise that i might as well BallOut. 

TL;DR: Shit goes hard, ngl.

That being said it has an amazing story decent writing and the balance is finally there for pve with the new subclass changes.

2526,Been playing since Destiny 1. The gunplay and abilities in this game are outstanding. There's a lot to build crafting and endgame content if you have the time and patience for it. I love the art style and overall aesthetic of the game. Definitely meant to be played with friends most of the time as some of the best content in the end game requires multiple people. This game continues to grow and get better and I can't wait for Lightfall!

2531,"This game has been out for a while and has changed dramatically since release- it may be hard to get into at first, but I promise it'll be worth it. Most people are friendly, the gameplay is engaging, and the game is constantly receiving updates. There is some stuff that is outclasses, but for the most part, it is a play-your-way game. It's loads of fun!"

2534,"The new Destiny 2 update has become more fun than ever. With some many new upgrades, quests, weapons, and in game content this is the grand we have been looking for in this game. The PVE play style mixed with a MMORPG and Raid like game play makes this game so much more fun with your friends!"
2535,"look, i realize this game is very high quality, i will not ignore that. i do definitely recommend you at least give it a shot if you're new to the game and have never played before, but it is not at all worth sinking your teeth into. paying for what is essentially a full priced $80 CAD game every year for content that you'll probably beat in around a week is not worth it at all. not to mention the sheer amount of recycled content being added, then removed, then readded and calling it ""new content"".

do not support these devs, you're better off spending your money elsewhere. seriously, content for paid dlc has been straight up removed in this game before, and the amount of content you'll get out of buying all the content you'll need to experience everything this game has to offer is not worth it at all. hell, you wont even be able to experience everything since older content has been vaulted and probably wont see the light of day for a very long time, or perhaps never."

2541,muy bueno
2542,I hate my life playing this game
2543,Didn't get the GigaFart2000 so people don't let me raid with them
2544,"This game is truly a new, and amazing experience. From a Fortnite player's (which I am) point of view, this game brings so much more to the table. You don't even need any of the DLC's to enjoy! Thank you, Bungie."
2545,"Ive been playing this game non-stop for the past couple months or so, and I've done almost all of the raids, got my conqueror title as well as cleared Kings Fall week one, and have some of the meta weapons in the game at the moment. So I am new but I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on what's going on in the game, just not to the extent of a huge veteran player. Im gonna just list off some Pro's and Con's.

Pro's:
-Gunplay is amazing, by far one of the best feeling FPS games I have ever played

-Loot, youre always getting loot, so someone with that need of a fix just for any loot drops will enjoy it

-Build diversity, of course there is some Meta things, but most builds will work for most of the content in this game if you're not doing minmax/speedrun stuff so you can experiment with the whole lot of pieces of gear thats available to you

-Raids, the raids are awesome, I come from raiding in Final Fantasy XIV and the raids in this game are nowhere near as complex,
however that doesn't mean it isnt fun, the mechanics are fairly simple but have you dealing with lots of adds in between it all. Most bosses in this game follow the same rule. Which is Do the specified mechanics>small dps window for boss>rinse and repeat until you enrage the boss or you kill the boss. It's fun, and pretty rewarding at most times. Dungeons follow the same rules and are just as fun, but for 3 player parties

-The loot chase, chasing for loot isnt always bad, because once you get the thing you want the dopamine kick is pretty sweet

-RNG Rolls of Perks on guns, this sounds bad but it does give you something to grind for, getting that one gun with the perfect perk combination is probably one of the best feelings in the game to get, if everything were given to you easily it just honestly wouldn't be that fun

-New Crafting system is pretty awesome, let's you select the exact perks you want on the gun once you have levelled it up enough and have the required materials(Not all guns can be crafted so dont confuse it with the RNG Rolls i talked about above)

Mixed:
Forced content for certain pieces of loot or upgrades, sometimes i have no urge to do PvP or Gambit(which is PvPvE) but in order to get an upgrade piece for the week you have to do these two 3x, some days it's fun but some days its straight up just so frustrating

Con's:
-Game drives off of FOMO - everything is built off of you being there at this specific time or if you don't youre gonna miss out on something. Every week you have your weekly grind for upgrades, every season there's new content that give you new pieces of loot that may/may not be meta and you might miss out on the chance of missing it. ADA, sells mods for your gear, every day she sells something different, forcing you to login to check it(or using a website) to ensure you get the armor mod you might be missing for a meta build. 

-Community is 50/50, this is most games, but in my 2 months of playing I have been expected to have certain weapons/gear/mods but I have literally no access to having them in the game as of yet. It's almost like the community expects everyone to have every piece of loot by now. Some kids on this game take it way too seriously, the game is not that hard but you wipe one time on a boss and some of these guys are straight up malding and it's kind of pathetic. There has been some really friendly funny people I have met on here though

-Weekly Grind for loot kind of sucks, you grind specific content for upgrades and sometimes it will just say fuck you and give you a duplicate of a slot that is already upgraded instead of another piece that's a lot lower. Example: getting 1570 level gloves again when I had JUST gotten 1570 gloves and my boots are 1566.
-Some tasks are really annoying for no reason, Xur's Weekly quest has you do 21(half of this if youre running with clanmates) Vanguard strikes, why is it 21, there's little to no benefit of running 21 Regular strikes and not everyone wants to run that many nightfalls either or might not always have the time to do that, I would much rather it be a mix of different activities personally.

-Sherpa's. ""Sherpa"" is someone supposed to help you through a raid and ""teach"" you. The problem is that there are triumphs aka Achievements, that are linked to Carrying people through specific content. So most ""sherpa's"" dont teach you everything in content that they are carrying you in and just kindof half-ass teach you because they want the achievement for their own benefit, honestly such a dumb move on Bungie's part for this because you can never tell if people give a F to actually teach you or not and will just do the work themselves to do it with minimal effort on actually teaching you. Then it snowballs because when you want to actually learn people don't want to bring you along because you have a clear already, and you dont get the achievement for carrying people who already have a clear.

Contraversal:
-The DLC's being Content vaulted kindof sucks, I have all the DLC myself, but when I started playing I was informed that some of the old DLC is completely irrelevant/gone now, and I do understand why they have done this, but it does *kindof* suck. Don't let this defer you from buying the game though, they have been bringing back pieces of content every now and then, such as the Kings Fall Raid from Destiny 1

Overall I do recommend this game, it is very enjoyable, it is COMPLETELY dependent on what you want to do in the game and how much time you wish to commit to it, but if you are going to play it, buy all the DLC for it and the season pass, you miss out on a lot of stuff by only having a bit of it, trust me."
2546,fun
2547,good... every now and then
2548,Cool
2549,To play this you have to spend a ton of money on all this stuff just to participate in scratching the surface of any of the content.  The initial amount of the game that is free is a barren waste land of emptiness.   Fun stuff but only lasted a few hours of actual play before was hit with pay wall after pay wall after pay wall.
2550,"Good game and its getting better, will update when lightfall drops, im hoping its gonna be great"
2551,Great game if you liked the halo franchise. Except you get to make your own spartan(guardian). Pretty neat. Dont see myself playing too much though. It lacks story driven content.
2552,"As a casual player... none of the content, balance, vaulting, or sunsetting decisions made any sense. Bungie trying to undo the damage is not something I'd pay money for. I hook up my PS4 to play Destiny 1 rather than try to figure out what this game is trying to accomplish anymore."
2553,"DO NOT play this game. I am warning you. I thought I am someone who plays a ton of games I play with my kids there is no reason I would have my account banned like the horror stories I have read.  Well it happened 4 ,000 hard worker hours in this game. And it's all gone. No idea why no response as to why. Just playing dares of eternity. And I was kicked and then the dreaded banned screen came up. I literally cannot reach them . Their support closed my chat asking why. Their form literally states they may not even read your appeal.  So I wasted my time. Sure there was enjoyable moments but aburptly right after pre ordering the new light fall and only getting 2 days to play with my preorder bonus I was banned. I am telling you I have never cheated if I did I would have a .5 kdr in trials. And suck so bad. I have been in matches where people killed me who cheated they are still playing but me nope. Hundreds of dollars wiped away. I can't stress enough this is a gamble on playing this game wether tomorrow you will even still have a game to play. This is no I'll intent towards steam they are very good on protecting you the best they can . But Bungie does not care what you have to say. They will just ban whoever in a desperate attempt to control the cheaters because they don't know how else to do it. This is not good business practice. This is a kick them right in the face for supporting us practice. I recommended friends to join and have praised them over the years but this is what I get. Some loyalty they have. I am telling you if you value your time in a video game do not buy this. Buy anything else. Support steam they are great they even will stand behind you. But not Bungie. They don't care about the player. You have been warned. Oh and free to play it's not they is very limited content that is free and thing worth anything costs money. Do not think you will just play for free and accomplish much."

2594,"OK here's a little fun fact for those who don't know. This game works just fine on Linux and the Steam Deck. How do I know? When BattlEye announced support for the Deck, I had the audacity of launching it to see if it works at all. It did. 

An hour later I got a notification that I was PERMAbanned from the game. Permanently. Forever. Por vida. Simply because I launched it on Linux, which Bungie only has to send a single email to BattlEye to enable support.

Want another fun fact? I reported that I was banned to the Proton Discord and Valve SPECIFICALLY has disabled this game launching on the Deck and Linux in general so people don't get permabanned by accident, Just to get an idea about the atrocicious stance of the devs.

Nothing more to add."
2595,yes
2596,"it fun
"
2597,fun
2598,"EDIT: I have played since destiny 1, 2014. I have dabbled in PvP(flawless maybe twice?) but main PvE.

Good game for casual and semi-competitive gamers. It does a LOT of things right but the things that are bad are hard to get by. 

Balancing across all classes is an issue but is able to be worked around when you know the game enough. Each class has something to abuse and will be abusing at all times in PVP. Movement is a great feeling and very rewarding.

A LARGE portion of the community/players reflect casual gaming and their room temperature IQs come with it. If you get some properly skilled buddies you will have fun after you pay $100-$200 but remember that the content you paid for WILL MOST LIKELY be removed in the future with no access to it(sunsetting). The hard work you put into a previous season/dlc will go to waste. 

End game content for anyone that plays competitive fps is not challenging what so ever. Sure there are certain missions that ARE more challenging than others but you just wait for the next rotation for the same reward and do an easier version(why waster time?). Acquiring end game guns/armor really DOES NOT MATTER as you don't use it for anything substantial except for DAY 1 raids/contest mode which only last 24hrs. If you have teammates that can't/don't do the end game content and maximize their builds. You will FAIL the DAY 1 raid.

The community is one of the dumbest i have ever been apart of. There is some toxicity but it is completely deserved when others don't do their due diligence or research(as in a 5 minute google search) before starting end game

There needs to be QOL improvements so i can see how others perform real time. I shouldn't have to use third-party chrome based websites to get info(stats, realtime dps, etc), move gear, and create loadouts. But at this point it is deliberate because of ""bullying"" and extra work to create these improvements.

TL:DR. The game draws you in but end game content isn't rewarding/challenging enough(expect contest mode). Hard work and purchased content is often removed. Most content is completely brain dead for a half skilled fps players. End game gear isn't used for anything substantial. Good game for casual/semi-competitive gamers who want a game to relax to that is a little bit more engaging than just shooting zombies in blackops. The community, in general, is DUMBER THAN A DOORKNOBS."

2615,"This is my favourite game series ever, but I'm stuck between wanting to recommend the game to new players because I love it, and not wanting to recommend it to new players due to the changes that they've made to the New Light (New player) campaign. The NEW New Light campaign doesn't do a good enough job at enticing a new player to play more. It doesn't do a very good job at storytelling and fails to keep my interest as much as the Red War (The campaign that this one ""replaced"") did. 

If you're a new player, try the free to play portion of the game to see if you like the mechanics and then maybe wait for a sale on some of the DLC content to really get a taste of what the game can truly offer in terms of storytelling and end game content."
2616,Kinda mid
2617,"nice

2618,"Its hard to recommend a game that isn't stable enough to complete its Legendary campaign without continual disconnects. 12 Disconnects in a Campaign Run from start to finish is unacceptable, especially when some of these encounters later in the campaign take a significant amount of time for the boss fight. Nothing feels worse then almost having a boss down after several tries to only freeze up and get a Disconnect screen."

2631,"It takes getting used to, and they don't always make the right decisions, but ever since Joe Blackburn has taken over the Bungie team, it's gotten much better and continues to do so. Of course it's not perfect, and yes they are walking back unpopular decisions, but I've never felt like they ignored the community long enough for them to alienate their players. I can't say that about a lot of other games. I feel like the future is bright because they care about what we think, and that's great."
2632,"i have 1k first try my frend dont after 50 clears

2633,"I mostly played this game during my vacation with my friends. It's decent for 2 weeks of grinding with the boys and girls, but that's about where it ends, the DLC is just straight up a waste of money from my point of view. The PvP however seems to be fun. I'd say if you don't fall for the DLC´s, this game is worth a visit. You could find yourself having a pretty good time, on the condition that you know you are getting into a grind fest. See if you like how any of the classes play, and make an educated guess after around two hours, if you enjoy what is shown to you at that stage you'll probably like the rest of it."
2634,"As much as we complain about this game, I have to admit, we can all see real improvement recently on Bungie's end. Storytelling is becoming a much clearer focus and the new storylines have been fulfilling and interesting a good 90% of the time"

I think we've reached the point now where the majority of the game is unplayable to a new player, and it's the very first thing that everyone I ever recommend the game to responds with, and with the latest batch of vaulting I simply no longer have any kind of acceptable response to it. Destiny 2 is a game that I want to play, but it feels like it doesn't want me to play it."

2653,Although I only have 2 hours on it i have played through all up to shadowkeep since d1 crota. This game has me confused as it is a huge cash grab having to spend minimum 50 euro for each expansion (also having to repurchase all previous content i had already bought to play on another platform). It has made it so much harder for new light players to understand any of it (I myself getting lost at many times). This game was my favorite franchise for the longest time and now i am sad to say i will not even get anymore if their expansions

This game is lazy. Don't let the playtime fool you I have a good 1000 hours in D1 and 500 in this game when it was on the battle.net launcher. 

The entry cost is far too high, you need several DLC's to play any of the content. The free to play is basically a demo to hook you into the game, and then efficiently siphon money from your wallet like a Czech prostitute siphons cum from my dick. It will leave you feeling satisfied for a while, but somehow empty, like a prostitute .

Enter at your own risk this game will take your money, again like a prostitute."

Started off as a great GREAT game. 
Was given just enough rope to start hanging itself by vaulting content that we paid for. 
Then the seasons became grindy as all fuck, with little narrative movement and not rewarding in the medium nor long-term. 

Then with the Steam Deck announced and the clusterfuck that's become Windows, Bungie announced they weren't willing to support player's OS of choice, specifically if it aids in being more pro-consumer and further protects their privacy, even when an email, a checkbox, and some tweaking (aided by the community itself) is all that's necessary. 

No Proton/Wine support, no $$$.
Bungie = Anti-consumer."

2670,"Yea I'd recommend this game. If you are a masochist, sure."
2671,"Technically it is f2p. But actually, it's not. It's nothing more than a demo. You start a questline, you'll make it to quest 2 of 7 for example. Oh you wanna progress further? Sorry gotta buy a dlc. Dungeon, raid? nope gotta buy a dlc. Even for some pvp stuff, if I remember correctly. If you want to play, most of the content, the game has to offer right now, you have to buy witch queen deluxe. It's a shame, because the game itself isn't bad. Steam should get rid of the f2p tag.

Not worth your time, if you thought you could play an actual f2p game that just offers cosmetics to buy."

2723,Can play for story or to play at the highest level. Have done both and enjoy both.
2724,"While I do recommend this game, it can be overwhelming when new or a returning player.

Best bit of advice is this: Do the original quest line (it's pretty short now) and get to The Tower. Once you've turned in quests and collected the cheap bounties you can afford, hold down TAB and go do Vanguards. Don't worry, it's not PVP and chances are the other 2 players will clear things for you until you get the hang of things. 

Do NOT worry about gear in the beginning other than equipping the highest numbers you can as gear drops based on your gear level.

For a good story, try the Witch Queen as well as work on the current season quests.

There is a TON more, but it really takes a bit of time an play to start seeing the pieces come together.

PS: When you do Vanguards it will continually queue you fr more unless you hold down O to go back into orbit
PPS: Go to the H.E.L.M on your destinations tab (Hold tab and look on the right side) and collect some free higher end gear once you've done those Vanguards. - Limited time only, so may be gone by the time you read this.
Please note I am still rather new and this is, by no means, the full extent of things and some will change depending on the Season."

2729,"This is a game you will either love or hate, or both. The art is always beautiful and sound is on point. 

As for the gameplay, it has some of the smoothest and most interesting gunplay out of modern shooters. With hundreds of weapons and more always being added you can surely find something for you. 

The story goes up and down in quality but has been amazing as of late and now is a great time to hop in! (As of September 2022)

Although no game is perfect and destiny still has flaws, PVP can be unbalanced at times and always in contention with high skill players and low skill players, not having DLC will put you at a slight disadvantge over most players and without any DLC the story is non-existent.

Overall 9/10, one of my favorite games of all time and have had some great memories made."

Yes the devs announced that they wont sunset any more content, and i dont know about anybody else but that tells me that either they wont keep that promise or theyre getting ready to drop the game, yknow, like when they made the game free... to say that im pissed would be an understatement. i preordered the game (yeah i know, i should probably stop doing that) easily a $100 bundle, then for them to come out, make the game free, and vault the only dlc i have, what makes you think im gonna waste any more money on this??"

2755,Dont get me wrong i love this game. BUT its like hard drugs and is hard to quit paying for it once sucked in. Maybe you have a better constitution than me but to me I cant quit paying for DLC only for it to get vaulted and irrelevant a few months later. That buisness practice is garbage and I do not support it but at the same time I do by continuing to flow money into this cash grab. Its a good time killer and fun with friends with decently reasonable progression but the main part is that its beautiful and its a looter shooter so I will continue paying for it.
2756,just got back into destiny 2 bought shadow keep and witch queen and the amount of bugs I have ran to is crazy in the first boss fight on witch queen where you kill the guy and than have to re kill him 1 more time and than crush his ghost doesnt work for me nothing pops up to allow me to crush it. So it keeps on re spawning this shit is not gun anmore.
2757,"I'll be honest, at first I really loathed playing Destiny 2, and would only play for specific seasons like when Europa first dropped or warmind, and the season with the nightmares, those were really fun seasons. Then, Witch queen dropped, and at first I wouldn't touch the game as I'd uninstalled, but then I started playing and my mind was blown, Witch Queen brought me to love Destiny 2, and the current season has the most baller activity yet, Ketchcrash. Season of Plunder is definitely the most fun I've had in Destiny 2 since it's launch, the Story is good, even bringing back a foe we thought we defeated, I really like where Bungie is going with Destiny 2 right now and I hope they continue this march to victory because Destiny 2 has become a banger for me, and it was really hard for me to enjoy D2 as a D1 Veteran, but I've come to enjoy it almost as much as D1, RIP my old D1 faction armor though, I'll miss the clean AF design(The new designs this season are pretty baller too though so I can't complain.)"

2774,"From someone who has played destiny since D1 Beta, and has payed for all dlc's including base D2 game with all of the dlc's. $100 for the DLC and annual pass. I cant help but feel cheated. I have sunk 100's of hours into this game only to delete it because of PVP match making is complete garbage, drip feed content, seasonal missions take 10 mins to play only once per week. By the time the next week rolls around I have already forgot what happened in the previous mission. They recycle old content, bringing back old raids, they even brought back old strikes. Not to mention old guns. Nothing new has come to light. They separated from activision only to sell to sony. The once great bungie is no more. I understand that the game is free, and the devs need to get paid. But if your going to charge someone $100 make the content worth $100. Right now its worth $20 with all the recycled content."
2775,good
2776,"THIS GAME is....  well it is the worst, best game ever! Ive played this on xbox, ps4 and pc. As a f2p player you will have a crap ton of content to play, but will be restricted on alot of content. As p2p player good luck figuring out wth you want to do. Theirs almost too much content? but at the same time not enough? I do have to hand it to bungie they do have a handle on the whole dlc and season pass pay scheme. Not alot of games will have p2p/f2p/p2w aspects all rolled into one. Kudos bungie, youve taken my money once again."

"
2787,"Great expanse from the original story I used to play; back on PS3 times. Be sure to have a proper router with UPnP parameters on, like a Netgear Nighthawk, or similar, otherwise you will have hard times with ""cabbage code"" connection problem. It seems that, at Bungie, nobody had time to solve this issue on router like the Technicolor that are mostly common in Italy due to Telecom provider. 

Anyways, just an advice, take care. Peace."
2788,SOOOO GOOOOOD!!!!!
2789,"this game is amazing i love the feel of the combat still a little wonky to me coming from console to pc but im loving the challenge of learning everything all over again
"
2790,I really like the aspect of how the game is played. The pve is great and pvp is fun as well. The only tweaks I would want to give this game is just to be more consistent with content but if you are just playing to play then I think this game is worth the while.
2791,"Unrivaled fun. So many ways to play. There is always something new with the consistent content drops, and the developers actually care about and play their own game."
2792,cbt in a nutshell
2793,"Play the game if you must, but avoid buying any DLC.
These guys remove old DLC that people paid for, and then still give you the option to buy something that does not exist in the store. Pretty scummy. They also brought back some old content from DLC which they sold, slapped a new skin on it, and bundled it with new DLC. At this point, only people with stockholm syndrome are going to keep giving them money while being flipped off by the developers. Shameful"

2798,"Been playing Destiny since Beta for D1. Have had many, many ups and downs with the game. You either love it or hate it. You accept it for the flaws it has and entrust your gaming experience to the devs for improvements, or you complain about the game. If you enjoy grindy looter shooters, playing within a community, and ever revolving content then this is the game for you. The content can feel 'too grindy' and extremely repeatable - if you allow it to. You choose to grind or be casual!"
2799,"It's a shame. I wanted to get back into the game, get expansions and play some new content and dungeons. Well, I have to buy deluxe edidion for that. 80$ now and 100$ (ONE FUCKING HUNDRED DOLLARS) in 5 months. Yeah, sorry but fuck them devs. Go choke on that cash."

2812,"The game is a fucking joke. I have been tuning back into this game for years (I've been playing this game since the battle net launcher and used to sherpa the leviathan) to see if they are going to fix anything in there game and patch after patch its just more of a total waste of time and money. I have given them so many chances at this point. The grind is unforgiving as every few months you have to start it over again, the game doesn't even work properly literally ever, (currently at the time of this reveiw warlock doesn't have a R STAT anymore, guns are still deactivated every season cause they have never been fixed, there newer weapons like glaive hit reg doesn't work properly, and the list i have of crap they don't care enough about there job enough to fix and that is just the tip of the iceberg), they took out half of there entire game that people had to pay at least 120$ for, and my list could go on and on. This game is practicly a scam and a waste of money. I personally have spent over 300$ on content that I cant even play anymore. Whenever i ask one of my friends about what they like doing in destiny all they tell me is, ""eh the raid was ok but look at this cool thing that is gonna come out soon."" Nothing is fun to do in the game accept for the raid i guess. The thing is that there are plenty of other mmos with raids with even harder or more interesting mechanics and fighting styles that are actually enjoyable to grind. Don't get into this game unless you want to waste hundreds of dollars on a game that's devs trick you with false promises, or if you want to play a buggy infuriating mess that they are never going to fix."
2813,"Played Destiny since TTK in D1. Still enjoy playing it today, and really enjoy transmog. Wish the transmog system didn't require the grindy mechanics though."
2814,lots of play value but buying dlcs is almost a must if you plan on playing long term
2815, 👍
2816,yeyeye

2818,"good

2819,"Played this when it was in battlenet. Finished the campaign, uninstalled and didn't bother to transfer progress to steam. Installed during free weekend only to find that large chunks of the game are unplayable. Gone are the dramatic opening sequences. Instead, you get a lame-ass introduction quest. This is a huge disservice to new players."
2820,always been great
2821,good shit
2822,"Destiny 2 is the game of hope. When I say hope I mean players hope the changes that are promised come. Hope that Bungie fulfills their promises. Hope it will improve with subsequent patches or DLC.
Instead, you have a nonsensical grind that becomes job like - a list of chores to do that take a long time not because they're challenging, but because Bungie has conflated time consumption with challenge. Players hope the reward will be worth it or some sort of change will come, but it never does. Bungie comes up with all sorts of meager excuses and most of the time, the playerbase excuses and enables them. 
Storytelling and lore is the kind of ""deep"" that's cool if you're 14, but the players aren't 14 and it's just kind of cringe. 

Destiny has the bones to be something really cool and that's how it gets you - snared by the nice graphics and cool guns, you can see how easily it could develop into a powerhouse, but it doesn't. It's just a job like grind that goes nowhere. The story is nonsensical, not thought out with much foresight, and leaves you wincing when you think critically about it. If getting home from work then performing the same repetitive actions with the promise of improvement that never really comes or poor development choices that, despite what they say, do not allow you to ""Play your way"" sounds fun to you, then destiny may be your game. Once the polished interface wears off on you, you'll be left with the fanatics who are as fun as corporate colleagues and end game content that forces you to take a job as a Guardian that will end up feeling like your job at your cubicle, then go for it."

2824,"Fun game to play with friends, even if you only have one friend."
2825,good
2826,"NEED FRIENDS TO PROGRESS

2827,It's a long grind to get to the end game but once you're there it's one of the most fun experiences I've had with an FPS. Every few months the Weapon meta changes for both PVP and PVE and it keeps the game feeling rather fresh. The rain and dungeon releases give me something to look forward to every time I log back into the game.
2828,Totaly play this game it is amazing it has every thing PVP PVE and has a ton of content to explore
2829,"garbage. i have 3500+h and can say the game is shit atm. the developer-team have around 23 IQ. every season the make one step forward and 3 steps backward. i played 40h pvp for a long time every week but now its garbage. if u visit ur 3 years old kid with cancer in the hospital u probably would have more fun as playing this shit. I dont know which guys developing this shit or bring new ideas, but 100 percent they never play the game, otherwise they would realize what a stupid shit they are doing."

2840,"The game is hard to get into as a new player. First off you need to purchase a bulk of the DLC. The base game might be free, but it doesn't offer much in the way of core activities to grind on. You might get a New Light mission (tutorial), and the Strike playlist, but beyond that you're on your own. Bungie has made an effort to include a few End Game activities to new players, such as Raids, but they don't offer you much in the way of making you ""Raid Ready"" (lack of leveled gear, class light level, etc). A large portion of the better, more powerful weapons are locked behind DLC, as well as a subclass (soon to be subclasses when Lightfall is released). Also as a new player you might be a bit lost as Bungie has done a terrible job at incorporating lore from previous seasons. You're essentially dropped into the game without a satisfactory introduction to the cast, or the current events, with only Youtube available to guide you (though there are many great Destiny Historians in the community to ease this process).

BUT IF YOU CAN GET PAST ALL OF THAT. Destiny provides a solid sandbox. Gunplay and movement is top notch as you would expect from the studio that created Halo. There are dozens of guns in the game, each with their own unique perk permutations, so every gun feels unique. The armor system is robust with customization options you can build around. And the class and race system are distinct from one-another. It all comes together pretty masterfully, which allows the player to live out their power fantasy with the right builds.

The content is fun with a ton of things to do. The core stuff is built on a grind, but the activities themselves are fun enough, with enough variety there for repeated sessions. End game activities are challenging as well as rewarding. There is also seasonal activities and events which are introduced every couple months to help keep things fresh. 

There is a Player VS Player (PVP) community as well. As of writing this Bungie has renewed their effort towards building the PVP environment, adding new maps and experimenting with game modes. For what is available it is very fun, with competitive game modes for all types. From Quickplay Control (zone capturing), to Survival (limited respawn elimination), to the ultra competitive Trials of Osiris (the best of the best play here). 

That is really just scratching the surface. There is plenty to do that I haven't mentioned, or really only touched on. If you're looking for something to consume your time, Destiny will certainly do that. The community is generally friendly. The content is engaging. I'm sure you will find something you will enjoy."
2841,I hate this game..... but i play it everyday
2842,"Played Destiny from launch and although I have taken some breaks, I have always come back to it. Its a fantastic game and there is loads of stuff to play, even on the free version. Never have any server issues, lag or gameplay problems and it runs really well. Would highly recommend trying it if you enjoy an FPS. The story is great, the style of play can be personalised from character to character, with a wide variety of skills and builds to try and even if you just want some fast paced PVP action, it delivers."
2843,thumbs up
2844,"Amazing experiences start to finish. As a returning Destiny 1 player, I have lots to catch up on. It's daunting at first look and worth it. Games should have the amount of content that make players shudder with the excitement of an epic and long adventure that doesn't stop growing."
2845,Eeh
2846,A must play for any shooter fan
2847,"Sure does have a lot going on, but a fun game for people that like looter shooters with mmo/rpg elements."
2848,Fun game so far
2849,NOICE game
2850,The game has come a long way and it continues to get more and more fun.
2851,"Bungie deleted my old account, I made a new one but every thing is locked behind pay walls and I cant play with friends."

2857,"I played Destiny 1 from cradle to the grave.  I started strong with D2 and left because it felt as if Bungie sliced up a half-ass reboot into 3 DLCs.  This loot shooter has had a ruff time finding its place in the past several years with a weak storyline and end game content with to much cheese.  Other games make money with exceptional content and selling skins or content to keep the game going.  I personally pref the skin method as this would allow me to choose when I want to spend my money.  D2 has yet to bring extreme levels of endless enjoyable content outside of the crucible and crucible events.  However, this was destroyed when the cheating was uncontrolled and was the final straw for me to leave this game.  I watched as this game left partnership with AV and Blizzard.  Now to be invited back by my old team.  I download the game to only be met with locked screens telling me I need to buy outdated content along with the new current content in order to play.  Never have I seen a game that wanted me to pay to comeback and pay to play old crap that really wasnt that good the first time you tried to get me to buy it.  This game is going to now have to be 100 percent free to play in order for me to even think about coming back again.  There are far to many better games on the market for me to even wanna spend 200 bucks just to start back.  This game needs a better marketing team and will continue to fail if they dont change how they market.  I dont care how many positive reviews they have, its not enough to try and dig this game out of the bag.  Sorry Bungie but you have got to do better than this."
2858,this game steals your soul and life force
2859,good
2860,Bye Money
2861,"At 1,039 hours on PC alone not to mention the countless hours I have spent on Xbox 360, PS4, and Xbox One messing around playing hide and seek with my friends in the tower or struggling through raids Destiny 1 and 2 mean a lot to me, by far one of my favorite all time games. Recently though and by recently I mean ever since they added sunset weapons and decided to vault entire parts of the game like the story and locations this game has gone down hill. Destiny 2 now is only a shell of it's past self due in full to Bungie's terrible executive decisions on which direction to take the game, a lot of these new updates as they come out feel half baked. Please if you are a new player don't bother with the almost 100GB install and save yourself the trouble. Also, a partnership with Fortnite? like where did that even come from??"
2862,"to be honest the game play is great your going to get thrown into a wall a few hundred times but its great, now the community is bad and the devs seem to not care about the player base all that much but its a fun game that will soak you a large chunk of cash if you want t play it in it so ya hope this helps"
2863,quit 2 years ago because i was tired of buying expansions. Returned for friends and discovered i have to buy the expansion i didn't want to buy 2 years ago.
2864,A great game by an incredibly incompetent and greedy company.

This one is great because not matter if you stop playing for a while, you can always just back in and get caught up relatively quickly. The gameplay is really easy to learn but also, for those who want it, very deep to master.

Raiding is fun so long as you have a group of friends to take along. I recommend getting into an active clan/guild to work with you. Give it a try, it's free! The expansion are well worth it as well."

Titans and warlocks have high movement options. i can understand warlock for obvious reasons but when i think of a titan i think of a tank, i dont think about ground or air dashes and skating. so far i feel like the game is telling me ""if you want to be stylish pick hunter, if you want to be usefull pick titan or warlock"""

2906,"boring power grind that you need to repeat every season, no good endgame content after raids. 

most (~85%) good looking armor/cosmetics are microtransactions -> devalues incentive to do raids or challenging content (only challenging if you are mentally/physically)

destiny players only talk about destiny irl and online. shit sucks to listen to

The only game i regret putting time into.


forgot to mention story sucks dick"
2907,"Still the best looter shooter to date, needs more content with better matchmaking, However for what it is, its still the best."
2908,"it's grindy, it's expensive, but its fun to play and looks wonderful.
the gameplay is shallow in terms of it being simply a shooter, missions consist of traveling somewhere to shoot things, sometimes there's a puzzle to solve or platforming to do but otherwise don't expect much more than that, the dlcs are over priced (get them on sale or from somewhere you can find things cheap) and without them lots of things are simply locked behind that paywall. otherwise, the world, lore, and characters are amazing. 7/10 if you're on the fence and looking for a game worth its money look else where, if you like looter shooters and have like $200 to spare then jump in!
-IMPORTANT NOTE, not for someone looking to play solo!!! many things in this game require 3 to 6 people and there's not matchmaking for most so you have to use the mobile companion app or have friends that play in order to complete harder missions/raids/dungeons."
2909,w game

2920,"Used to be in my top 3 games. Now Bungie has set a precedent to delete content that people paid for when it ceases to be profitable for them.
The gameplay itself remains incredible, but deleting nearly every single piece of content that I and many others paid for with nothing to show that it will ever return puts the worst sort of taste in my mouth.
The absolute worst part imo is that new players will have zero idea of what the plot is or why any characters even exist.
All the ""sunset"" (removed) content should just be an optional install. Other games have done it and Bungie certainly has the capability to do it with Destiny 2."
2921,1/10 Would play again.
2922,"Destiny 2 is the first ever FPS game that has actually caught my attention and kept it for more than a few short weeks. I started playing the game back in 2020, before the Beyond Light expansion, and let me tell you: back then, it was only by the fervor of my friends that I stayed online. As a matter of fact, Beyond Light Deluxe Edition was purchased for my by one of my friends, as a ""hey, please give it another chance!"" and I am SO GLAD I DID. Ever since that expansion, the story and lore has gotten better and better, as well as the gameplay. Better subclass building, better community interaction, better quality of the purchasable content. All in all, the longer I play, the better this game gets with time, and I only expect it to get better from here."

2928,Lost items in vault and posted on forum with 0 response from company and having invested over 500 hours in game gathering these items this absolutely deplorable.  I would not recommend this game as this will not even respond if there is any type of issue. The game play is great and well worth the price but any problem they will not even dignify with a response. Bugs in game go unfixed for weeks on end.
2929,its fun
2930,"I would recommend this game to those who have friends who are already invested in Destiny and have an understanding on how the game works. You could *potentially* learn and play by yourself, but the game hinges on teamwork and cooperation. 

Great gunplay from Bungie as usual, and not too costly for someone who plays with friends passively, but as I understand it, to get the full experience you'd have to invest in annual paid DLC which is quite an investment, but I guess you'd have to decide how often you play the game. Only real critique to the game really is the entry for a new player or ""New Light"" is very steep on a multitude of levels. There is a lot of functions and places and quests and (far too many) different types of currencies; and with all of these elements you also have to be aware of what you can/can not do depending if you are a free player like me. Without the aid of my friends, I'm uncertain if I could engage with the time and learning investment this game requires. Perhaps the biggest criticism stems from the sheer amount of story the game tries to engage you in as a very late player. Having a very little context to the games story does contribute to confusion on where to go and who to talk to for missions and transactions. You can absolutely feel lost at times, which is a shame because I feel as though there is definitely an easier way to communicate the game's functions and it's story separate from each other-- but I know that would be a lot of reworking, which might not be worth it considering the amount of ""new players"" they are accruing versus keeping the players they already have to keep happy and engaged.

 While sitting at almost 10 hours I have a good grasp of the main gameplay and RPG elements which are at the very least cool and interesting. I have yet to do a raid (which I hear is one of the pivotal experiences in the game), but I will say I enjoy this game for the time being and can see myself coming back in the future to play with friends. As it stands, it's a pretty cool ""free"" game to play. I give my introduction a 7.5/10. Interested to see how I feel going forward."
2931,If you spend the time to get into the story and post game content it is 100% worth it!
2932,good
2933,It's okay I guess
2934,its good
2935,"Games got it's pros and cons, and to be honest most are cons. Not gonna list em all since I'm not really bothered but the game is still kinda worth it. Just too much Pay 2 Play"
2936,great game
2937,"Super fun!! :))
"
2938,Fucking grindy ass shit with no rewards
2939,"Paid over 100$ for the Digital Deluxe edition. Destiny moved over to steam and I missed the window for the account transfer. Since Bungie decided to switch platforms, I get screwed out of my money because I didn't respond in time? Get Bent. A bit tired of the Era of Digital content that you never own or lose access to. 100$ to learn Bungie is a trash company that will never get another dime from me."
2940,"Very fun, lots to do."
2941,"i hate and love this game
"
2942,Great game
2943,"its absolutely best when you play with friends, other than that, a complete grind fest."
2944,"It's a great game, though it can be costly if you buy all the DLC which is pretty essential to the experience. It's worthwhile though."

2946,yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!
2947,dank
2948,"For me, the game is fun but that might be because i used to play it before a long time ago and still remembered on how to play the game. The only reason why I'm not recommending this game is because the game is not beginner-friendly like, they literally removed almost EVERYTHING from year 1-2 including the original Red War campaign and the Forsaken campaign. As i said, i used to play this game a long time ago when all of the old stuff was still there and i started playing the game again recently just because i had nothing to play and was pretty sad to see that almost all of the old planets were removed since i had good times on them.
Overall, i wouldn't really recommend this game if you're new to the series."
2949,👍

2960,"BRUH they had me pay for season pass to be able to poop, DAYUMN"
2961,"This game used to be fine, till half of it was erased and we got Europa as a really garbage compensation, The price of the expansions, enhanced by the price of every season pass that you need to stay relevant is two steps of monetization too far for this now barren wasteland of a game,  It's cash shop doesn't do it favours either, with some of it's exotic cosmetics being mere pallet swaps as a poor excuse for denying the use of shaders on them.

The irony that they got rid of Destiny 2's opening for new players, and replaced it with Destiny 1 should be a testament to just how pathetic and shameless this game has became.  We haven't even gotten maps for PVP based on the new locations, instead locked to maps from locations that have long since been vaulted."
2962,epic
2963,yes

2975,this game sucks
2976,best game for people who want to waste their money
2977,if you wanna grind your ass off this game is pretty good

2980,Game is ass
2981,"gay and cringe lorents jews
 everywhere"
2982,"The best gunplay and movement you will find in any modern shooter combined with a deep and highly customizable buildcrafting system. One of the few games where you can create and fine-tune a truly unique playstyle and identity. A living universe with lore and story so deep you will never run out of things to discover.

Players that are casual, solo-oriented, or who hate losing will only get so much out of this game. 

Players that see the value in overcoming a challenge together with like-minded people will never run out of things to do. Both PVE and PVP endgame activities will challenge you to improve and perform at a mechanical level that is much higher than other, similar games.

Some other notes:
[list]
    [*]Behind every thousand-hour negative review and petty Reddit comment is a player that is likely still logging in and playing every day. Don't mistake these echo chambers as the general opinion. For every whine-post with 1000 upvotes, there are hundreds of thousands of people happily playing the game daily.
    [*]If you are a brand new player, you will be better off finding someone to play with and teach you the basics. You will also have to catch up with the in-universe story on Youtube, I recommend My Name is Byf.
    [*]There are rough edges, but the game has only gotten better with time. While the game will continue to evolve and improve do not fall into the trap of expecting perfection.

2992,"Amazing MMO that completely lives up to the hype and then some!  Disappointed I didn't start playing sooner. Very active community at all times of the day, and tons of single player content if that's what you're in the mood for.

As more of a PvE type player, I'd recommend trying at least the free version out first.  If you're still enjoying the gameplay after ~250 hours then grab some DLCs.  Season Passes are more for vets with nothing else left to grind; personally not there just yet."

3001,"Fun game, expansions are looking good"
3002,"To be honest i feel like Destiny 0 was better 
"
3003,"This has been a game I have consistently came back to, it seems like every year I am sucked back into what is destiny and so far, I believe I have completed most if not all of the campaign missions for it outside of the Raids; and yet I continue.

This game has became a fine tuning grind fest of building that perfect guardian for my play style. There are still plenty of things I am not quite sure on and I would argue a lot of the lore I have no clue about or understand, but the gameplay and atmosphere that Bungie continues to build is like no other. Back when Destiny 1 was released they said they wanted it to be a long standing 10 year or more project of constant story additions and gameplay enhancements and then it died....Destiny 2 launched and was, okay at first. But comparing this game to where it started? There is no comparison.

I whole heartedly believe this game can continue on for years with more consistent content drops and ever expanding stories and enemies to fell. The future is bright for this game and I am here for it!"

3008,"The game isn't amazing plus there is probably too much stuff to do for a beginner to really get into. Only the recent expansion is good and the combat loop feels good to grind, but the amount of stuff to micro-manage makes it not a good recommendation unless you enjoy those sort of things."

3012,"The gun fights and graphics are good, but I really disliked most of the other aspects of the game. I particularly disliked needing special items to upgrade weapons, but did not know where to find them. I am not interested in trying to learn subtle things about the administration part of the game. It also feels like dying does not matter, but in the high difficulty missions you might as well not even show up if you are a casual. If you are just starting to play it, like me, you really need a friend who is willing to explain things to you in painstaking detail otherwise the Tower is just waiting around. There are far too many low-level items to manage; I wish they had just cut out the garbage and given you the cash/glow boxes/tin foil instead. I do not advocate getting good items for little effort, but dealing with the junk feels like work rather than fun."
3013,i like it you need 6 people to do endgame content but highly recommended
3014,worst game i have ever played 10/10 would suffer again
3015,"After 150 hours, I've finally discovered what's been irking me about this game the entire time. Destiny 2 is a game that brings a lot of options to the table, a ton of tuning and tweaking and customization and ways to play. Which feels incredible for when most the game you're going through and getting new gear. Then you approach end game, and the game literally becomes Anti-Fun. 

The milisecond that champions and match game get introduced? All those options become meaningless. You need ultra specific builds for every single map and encounter. If you dont have it? Champions are literally unkillable. The shielded enemies which maps start having dozens of, if your weapon doesnt shoot the element that matches it? They get 95% resistance and take forever to down. 

All of this forces you into only a handful of super specific builds and playstyles, so you go from tons and tons of options, to almost none. Gods save you if you dont have the equipment either because nothing about the game prepares you for this until you suddenly have to deal with it. And even then, the builds that are viable? Arnt that much fun. They're either super cheesy or ultra clunky, but people will kick you out of maps if you dont have it. 

This is a game that just doesnt want you to enjoy it, and the deeper you go in, the more apparent this becomes. PVP is absolute cancer with bots and hackers in every single map, and 75% of the pinnacles, the only way to progress after a certain power level, are locked to pvp modes.

It's a game that has tons of customization but it's all an illusion. You play how the game tells you to play, or you dont play at all. Dont have a build for what it's asking? You dont enjoy whatever niche it's pushing? Too bad, no progression for you."

3025,good game

3027,"Just got back in for Witch Queen, like alot of other reviews i also have a love-hate relationship with this game. There are many pros such as good movement and fun abilities, while at the same time having cons that drastically effect gameplay. A few examples would be the removal of content and excessive money-milking, and that is just to name two. This game could be awesome, the devs just are not focused on the right things imo."
3028,I personally am not the biggest fan but my friends play so i play with them its a fun game with friends I would never get it without though.
3029,"Yes i do recommend this game, But it says it is free to play when that is not really the case. this game started out great, once you reach a certain progression point though the only way to keep up and play the content they release is to Buy there Expansions and buy into the seasons so if your looking to play and want to stay up to date i would wait until there is a sale on the expansions."
3030,idk kinda fun
3031,w
3032,ew
3033,"Destiny 2 is always trying to reinvent this self. The game lives and breathes and its becoming very mmo-esque. 
Great feeling when youre shooting. Combat and raids are very fluid. There are some guns that are more broken then the others but Bungie always has rebalancing patches. Overall a solid looter shooter turned MMO."

Since they have been requiring that to be installed and running the game crashes within minutes and any number of issues with the PC staying connected to the Internet.  I stopped playing and did a fresh install of Windows and have not had any issues for over a year.  Decided to give it another try and I could not even get past the new intro mission for Drifter before I was losing connection and getting crashes again.  So uninstalled it and immediately no more problems. Find another way to deal with cheaters and I will be back and change this to a thumbs up, until then can't do it."

3069,"I have 100 days of playtime on the xbox version of this game so im not completely unaware of the ""good"" content. I quit in the early days of season of the overrated mara sov vs savathun the bitch queen. I came back maybe 2 weeks ago to look at my vault for old times sake and was surprised being able to play the witch queen campaign, only to be blue balled 2 missions later. I played more of it when they made all the dlcs free for a week but never finished the campaign because frankly the story was boring. the gunplay is still top notch along with the music. but all the problems i had with the game when i left are still here, some are even worse. the monetization is worse than before, selling dungeons separately for twice the price of a season is absolutely outrageous. the 30th anniversary pack is disgusting and makes me sick that they would even consider selling their celebration of their community. all the seasons are still very similar and the horde mode not horde modes are still a staple after 4 years of them. the leveling process is still tremendously flawed. the new light experience is still garbage. bungie still hasnt given us back our old content that we paid for.

this game is an abusive relationship. you constantly hear all these people saying yeah this game sucks but i cant stop coming back hehehehe. its time to move on. bungie isnt respecting your time or your commitment to their product. find a new game, a new journey.

and for all the new people reading this, feel free to try this game out but dont say i didnt warn you."

If you are anyone but someone who has already played this game I would not recommend unless your just here for the PVP. The original 3 Campaigns have been deleted from the game possibly to  never return. The game is great as its always been, but being tossed into a story of events in the new campaign is like coming in at the last 30 minutes of the 3rd movie in a trilogy never to have seen the previous ones and expect to get it.

It does however play really well and is a good past time if you have buddies to play with."

3097,"I've played this game off and on since it was released. i would be lying if i didn't say it has its problems. regardless in my opinion it does a great job of being an open ended, yet somehow linear game with many was to find reward through the grind that is the missions. some quest lines are better than others but still, everything you do in this game has some sort of unique reward to it that keeps you looking forward to the next mission. it is a great game for casual players as well as hardcore gamers, that keeps you drawn in and playing through until you've completed everything you can. by that time Bungie releases a new expansion that blows the previous out of the water. i cant say I've never been disappointed but no matter my gripes with Bungie's decisions I've always enjoyed playing."

3119,"The game has great gun play going for it. About the only positive i can give it as of now. Getting rid of expansions that players bought with their money has rubbed me in the worst of ways. They wanna claim to be an MMO but lack a ton of the fundamentals of such. Other MMO's do not get rid of content due to lazy, poorly managed development teams. Wow, Eso, FFXIV to name a few have up to a decade of old content you can still go back and explore and experience. The games 2nd biggest downside is the New Player experience. 3-4 hrs of missions that tell you nothing to only throw you into a strike playlist to hear voices of characters you'll never meet or know anything about... If Cayde-6 is dead why am i still hearing his voice on strikes??? They removed so much that new players have no story to really go off of. 3 the time-gated content, just shows the dev's care nothing for your personal time. Destiny use to be one of my favorite games, D1 was a game I spent thousands of hours in. I've dropped in and out of D2 since launch, just doesn't keep me entertained. Oh and they removed the bad a$$ earn able cosmetics you could get in D1,  for the most part, to support their ""Eververse"" scam... It has it's pros and cons. Once you've been burned enough by Bungie you kinda just stay away. But if you enjoy it my hats off to you. Game has great potential, shxtty developers tho imo."

3130,"I have alot of hours into destiny 2 and a considerable amount in destiny 1 as well, with that being said there are some flaws to the game that continue to persist after years of tuning and development from bungie, however there is no other game I come back to religously like I do Destiny.  From the pvp to the pve it has something for everyone and for all ends of the skill spectrum.  Destiny will only get better as time goes on and expansions are released and now is the perfect time to start your own legend."
3131,"I always wanted to get into Destiny, but twice now I dared to start it up again after getting the itch for a new shooter. And a new update appears to have dropped and I am dropped into a cutscene with lore exposition I have zero context for, and into a level my weapons are completely ineffective against the enemies in (as I am just a beginner character with no loot). This second time I was dropped on Mars and talked to by characters I know nothing about and no obvious way to get back to the hub where I could maybe try to get back into the early story with.

Maybe there is a great game somewhere behind all these hurdles, but it seems like every major update tries to throw you into the newest content there is. I thus cannot recommend this to a beginner, because I am one and I can't begin."

No better way to say fuck you than waste my time and money right (not even mentioning sunesting/vaulting). Once again id like to give a big Juicy F   U   C   K  Y   O    U   B   U   N   G   I     E
3149,nice game!!!
3150,"Extremely fun game. Great looter shooter. Game doesn't really have an ending, as it is more of a long-term ""game as a service"" type game. Story is well written and enjoyable, though you do miss story beats unless you play it consistently from season to season. Recommended."
3151,iT'S NOT WORTH IT
3152,"too much walking, bored. Not worth a 90GB download."
3153,It's crazy fun. Yes as a college student i shouldn't be spending this much money on one singular game. But atleast I found a game that I genuinely enjoy.
3154,Great game really fun
3155,very good good nice game fun grind amusing
3156,fun with people
3157,Amazing game. Massive open areas and intriguing storylines. Full of activities and F2P content that allows you to play for a long time without getting any DLCs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone with a 100 gbs of storage on their computer :)
3158,good

3164,I like it
3165,"I tried very hard to enjoy this game. Bought Forsaken as a friend said it was the best expansion. Fastforward 150 hours later and I had to remove the game as it's such a frustrating and unenjoyable experience.
New players are left with a game world that's completely confusing. Nothing is explained. All the content that was previously in the game to explain things has been deleted. A bunch of in game stuff is never explained. You have to go to Reddit or Discord to figure it out. Hell, even some icons aren't explained with a tooltip or anything.

Because there's no in game group finder or builder, you are locked out of the hard and fun content unless you join a discord and find a group that way. Which is fine for very hard raids but not necessary for nightfalls or whatever.

Remember I mentioned getting Forsaken? Before I could grind through enough light levels, learn the game, study the raids, and actually play the forsaken end game content, THEY DELETED THE ENTIRE EXPANSION so I would be forced to buy the new expansion. Yeah, not going to happen."
3166,"Imagine making you spend $120+ CAD to even start playing the current game. That's $120 of removed playable content that is no longer in the game that you are REQUIRED to purchase in order to play the game. This game isn't, ""free."" Horrible publisher, horrible devs, their game could be on top but they choose to keep themselves down."

3171,"I love Destiny! Destiny is my favorite game of all. I have played Destiny on ps3 before ps4 did come. I did buy Destiny and Destiny 2 to ps4 and now I'm playing Destiny 2 on pc to. If someone would ask for my favorite game. It's Destiny and Destiny 2. I love both but still Destiny is better than second one. Now you have to use so much money to get everything you need. Raids, Exos... That's the part what sucks really badly. For some people it's hard to get them even if they come on sale. Like to me what really sucks. I want to do raids and get new weapons. Hopefully someday I get them"

3173,good game with friends
3174,I dont own the newest dlc therefor i am not allowed to play the game or try to get back in to it.
3175,its pretty good
3176,"Game is trilling, but DLC wise don't buy the latest massive expansion for 80$ in 4 months it will be on sale 35-50%, Season passes are good deals for what they're worth // 10$ for 3 months of content is a good deal // spend 12$ on lunch for one afternoon.

Other than DLC Destiny is a love/Hate relationship

Best played with others, rarely fun played alone

"
3177,worse game i've ever played
3178,gud
3179,"I just can't quit you. I love Destiny. Simple. Tons of activities (solo or with friends), so many in game achievements and triumphs, and don't forget the ol' powerful loot grind. This game is a borderline addiction."
3180,"bought the game for Playstation for full price when it came out, now it's Free To Play."
3181,a bunch of bull with this game having so much stuff to pay for to just get the full game. not worth it
3182,Its like crack. I keep getting that itch to bring me back.
3183,what have i done i hate this game and i still tell other people to try it i have cursed them
3184,Love it

3186,Fun game sometimes

This game is great. I hate it. It's my favourite. I hate it.
It's awful. I love it."

3189,"Experienced a bug in the mission Cold Boots where the waypoint would get stuck and the way to fix it is to backtrack until a line of dialogue is triggered, then proceed. This bug has been in the documented for over a year and happens in the first 30 minutes of play. Then I got to Last City and speaking to my classes vanguard triggered a tutorial popup that didn't go away until I exited to main menu and reloaded my character. 

That second bug didn't surprise me really, the entire UI experience feels buggy; popups constantly get in the way of other elements, certain ways everything is layered seems to make many of these non-interactable, waypoints disappear with no obvious way, if any, to make them stay longer than a few seconds, and the whole experience just feel like forcing your way through a glittery mess. 

Is there a good game here? Maybe, but I'm not putting up with a thousand hours of jank to find out."
3190,you need to put aside half of your salary for destiny
3191,not quite the glory of D1 but a great game overall. i play every day XD
3192,its bad
3193,.
3194,The hours I have put into this game in such a short period of time just goes to show how amazing this game really is! I have built life long friendships through the Destiny 2 community and would recommend it to everyone to at least try once.
3195,500 $ dlcs with no content for the price
3196,"bungie is a bunch of money grubbing fat lards.  every new expansion they as for more money and its a terrible format for games that players shouldn't support, if you buy expansions, I hate you."

3209,i dont like it
3210,"i really enjoy this game, i havent really gotten into gaming since i quit wow 3 years ago havent found anything to really fill that void and honestly its a nice combination of casual and hardcore pvp and pve kinda like halo meets monster hunter meets any rpg, its not for everyone but i personally enjoy it i game with buddies i havent gamed with in years and it makes all the difference"
3211,"I'm a returning Destiny player. Played Destiny to death, then played the initial Destiny 2 release back in 2017. There was something off about it that just didn't pull me like Destiny did. Content was sparse and it looked like it set itself up to be a DLC game exclusively, meaning that it would end up costing much more than it was worth it. While I enjoy the game play and the dynamics of the game, the price tag this game has in 2022, 5 years, almost 6 after its release, is laughable. It doesn't accommodate returning or new players and I'm not shelling out the combined cost of 2-3 AAA games for DLC content. To add insult to injury, apart from the exorbitant DLC costs, there is also the season/annual pass for temporary content and access to other digitally locked goodies and campaign. This game is nothing more than a money sink. Note that this review is after having had access to the Forsaken Pack, Witch Queen and Beyond Light expansions - all in all a solid 6-8 hours of gameplay combined."
3212,"They deleted years of content I paid for. No matter what the quality of endgame is right now, the fact that most of this games content has been deleted is insulting"
3213,"Amazing game. 
Amazing company behind the game."
3214,yes
3215,pve is fun but crucible is the least fun i have ever had in an fps
3216,"Pay for content that will be deleted in a year anyway!

Red War story - Deleted!
Curse of Osiris - Deleted!
Warmind - Deleted!
Forsaken - Deleted!

Instead, please give us money every few months so we can reset all of your progress and you can start grinding all over again! :D"

3224,"After starting a free to play account for this game, I have come to the conclusion that unless you are willing to shill out the ungodly amount of money for all the current expansions you will be lost and at a severe disadvantage to players who do own all the dlc. The new light experience drops you in with way too many quests, it's hard to focus on a main goal, rather than slowly teaching a new player about all the game modes. Additionally, the tutorial is absolute garbage. It's just the same tutorial as D1, except you don't get to fight a cool fallen boss. Instead you walk around and kill some trash mobs and scan some stuff and then the game just drops you into orbit and expects you to decide on whats important rather than having a main focus. Even if you have some friends to play this with, I can not recommend this game unless you are willing to A) Pay to much money for expansions you'll most likely never play B) End up watching more youtube Guides than actually playing the game and C) Spending hours in missions to end up on the other side with weapons and armor you don't want or that are unusable do to their perk combos. Good luck to the souls who try to play this game for free. For payed players though, not too bad. Unless you don't like looter shooters in which case I really don't blame you for skipping this title. Just go play D1, it's a better game overall anyway."

Edit: My bad it was my controller messing up with the game. i did alot of trouble shooting and reinstalled windows many times and did every guide in the web about fixing it. Today i unplugged the controller while i was in the stuck loading screen and the loading just starts moving."

Only other con is that i'm lacking in friends to experience this with."

3243,It's an addiction
3244,man I hate this game( i cant stop help me)
3245,"One of the few games (if not the only game) I own all the DLC for. 

Very worth the download."
3246,"Do NOT let 84 hours fool you.
Do NOT let the complaints of others about stupid lil things and the term ""fomo"" (Fear of Missing Out for you older gamers) keep you from at very LEAST trying this game.
But do so with a friend. And the best part is, they can have it for XBOX one or PS4!

I'm reviewing the GAME. I'm saying how much FUN I've had, not nit picking every lil mechanic, flaw, etc. And after reading SOME of the ""Bad"" reviews, it's clearly the ones who DUMPED their life into the game who are salty....some can argue their point...but others don't understand the reasons for what Bungie did in the past and are venting frustration. I'm a fan, don't get me wrong, I've invested a TON of hours, and spent a STUPID amount of money on this game, buying it sometimes twice on two different consoles. (lack of cross play at the time)

But that's not what's on ""trial"" here, the game is, and it delivers, if you deny this, you're being too emotional about something that was merely meant to entertain....

The community creates the ""meta"" and ""builds"" but people, YA DON'T NEED THAT SH*&

You need a gun, some wizard/ninja/future linebacker shoulder-punchy mystical crazy space wizard skills, and a desire to kick arse and take names. THAT'S IT!

This game is about FUN with FRIENDS. And even Solo this game's many Campaigns over the years have had stories keeping me coming back for YEARS. My hours are more so in the 1000s.....I'm a Beta Destiny player, hidden under many profiles, over 2 or 3 accounts. Due to a number of reasons you need not know. I either forgot, got locked out of, etc.

But this game.....man this game....I played on PS3, Xbox One, PS4, then finally....PC....PC has been the most gorgeous of them all. And I truly wish I had a PC back when it first came to PC...... But I'm here now, and as a ""Fanboy"" but a rightfully so mature aged ""Fanboy"" I'm telling you, I've been playing games a lot longer than most. And you won't find a FPS game that doesn't have a lil something for everybody. (Sure it's PvP is limited....but c'mon we're Guardians, we war with the darkness....not each other. ;) )

I love this game, and Bungie's done a great job, and it's future looks awesome. It's been a pleasure playing this game for all it's flaws, and let downs, missed steps, and dropped balls. It's become the last FPS game I enjoy, and has done so by just being Destiny...better than it was, and always trying to do better.

So try it....won't cost you, well won't cost you money, but will chew some band width. Add me, I'll take you for a spin around the moon, once pass Nessus, into the Leviathan, and skip across Europa before coming home, and having a celebrated toast to you, for taking the dive...and giving it a try.

And if ya don't like it, thanks for stopping by!

3254,"I wanted to like this game, and I think I would...if I was allowed to play the game in Chronological order. Instead, they scrap old content as soon as new content releases, so I can't even take breaks from the game without missing out on content, so I'd rather not get into any content whatsoever if that's the case. Even if this game had a required monthly subscription, it still wouldn't be acceptable to me because even WoW, which has a required subscription invalidates the whole reason to play old content. Just follow the FFXIV content model, and make players play through all the story content from the beginning no matter how long it takes."
3255,"At this point bungie has to be seeing diminishing returns on the DLC. I'm not going to pay 300$ to get back into this and be confused about the story by hopping into it midway. 

If this had a 15-25$ yearly subscription that included everything, it might be worth it? I don't understand this model, and it costs to much to try and understand the story now."

3284,"Gamebreaking bugs that are not being addressed quickly are currently souring the Arc 3.0 launch, as 2 of the 3 classes are broken with Arc (Warlock and Titan have no resilience, meaning no damage reduction), an entire weapon type is completely disabled, multiple exotics are broken (and disabled), including the new exotic weapon for Pre-ordering the upcoming DLC (Which they still want a premium price for). Not to mention broken raids, activities, but hey, they finally brought back matchmaking in PvP so you don't get stomped repeatedly (Though with Arc 3.0 broken on 2 classes, take that how you will). Their policy of updating the game once a week has seen no relief to any of these issues as of writing this a week after launching 3.0 (after patch) with no changes made. But this is nothing new, with each major update there are numerous gamebreaking bugs, while still asking for AAA prices for DLCs.

This is a game that has had entire DLC's vaulted (Taken away) that people have paid for, and while they say that they are no longer going to be doing that, I'll believe it when I see it. It's little wonder that the community is often (and for some, constantly) angry and feeling betrayed by Bungie, they've been kicked again and again by poor decisions. There's a saying that says, ""Nobody hates Destiny 2 more than Destiny 2 players."" And it's very accurate. It's the abusive relationship we want to get away from, but we keep coming back to because they show us the shiny thing and promise things will be better."

A dumpster fire of a matchmaking system for PvP 
Extreme Grind 
Tons of paywalls 
Don't even think about buying the Forsaken pack, all you get is 3 weapons and like 2 activities for $25
Can't even play the seasonal events within the game without spending $20
Awful storytelling for 90% of the game
Oh and prepare to spawn in front of people with supers in PvP"

3305,"While this game isn't very new player friendly, the depth it has is impressive. The vast amount of unique weapons and how smooth the game play feels makes me come back over and over. On xbox I have far more hours into it and the steam version of it allows me to play more on the go with my laptop. Even the previous complaint of the story being lackluster is no longer true. Fair warning though, while the game is free to play, the real meat and potatos of the game is in the dlc's."
3306,i like the arc 3.0 i run fast and the cloudstrike its good. well for me it is and i like the exotics its fun to collect them. the stats i pay close attention to them. i would recommend this game.

3323,"As a solo player you will want so badly to fall in love with this game, but it will be extremely difficult to. However, there are plans to fix that issue in the coming year, so I would try not to get turned away by that. If you can convince one other friend to enjoy this game with you, it will bring many good times whether you decide to play F2P or pay for the content."
3324,"My review is highly dependent on when you last played. I last played right when Forsaken release and i recently decided to get back into the game. Sadly for anyone with a similar experience you wont be able to play ANY of the Red War, Warmind, Osiris or Forsaken campaigns so I can't recommend it for you. If you've played since Forsaken you most likely don't need a recommendation to continue.


Revision: I actually thought of more reasons for you to never touch this game unless they add the old campaigns back in the future.

You may have hear that late last month they announced they would not be sunseting anymore old content, this is true. That does not excuse the fact that they already have. They STOLE ~$150 from millions of people when that content removed. If download size was the issue that could have been made into optional downloads for those that wanted them, and if the issue was server strain then they should have upgraded the servers. They were a billion dollar company long before sony bought them out, they had the resources to do it. Lets say they didn't though, they could have changed it to how minecraft is, if your playing alone then it's an offline experience, if you're playing with others than your fireteam leader would be hosting the server from their pc."
3325,This game is bad. They took out the most enjoyable parts and replaced them with the most poorly designed and braindead activities you could think of. I would rather slam my cock in a car door than to play this game. If you like shilling out over 120$ total for less than 80% of the content this game is for you. And if you love playing games where you can spend real money to give you an upper hand in PvP then this is also the game for you. But if you like fun you should probably play anything else. I have personally gotten more joy from some 5 dollar porn games on here
3326,is good.

3330,"yes
"
3331,"If this was Destiny 2 on release ide say stay far away. BUT Bungie has significantly improved  this game and i do think know is the best time to get into this game. 

If you like looters and PVP this game is for you. 
"
3332,its super fun if u like fps
3333,don't do it
3334,"big gun go boom, little gun go boom, stuff not gun even go boom, to conclude, BOOM GOOD"
3335,"Takes your life away, but not for free."
3336,"Can't reccomend this steaming pile of shit.

I log in, do the tutorial and now every single foe in the starter area is level ?? which renders them immortal and immune to any and all damage.

Any attempts to rectify this has failed, relog, reboot, relaunch. I figured i'd try their support only, Bungie doesn't have a support. That's right, no phone number, no email and no ticket system. You're required to ask the forums for help. I go to their forums only you can't login because you get a 500:internal server error, rendering you unable to write a forum post.

Bungie, what in the actual hell are you trying to accomplish with this?

Update: I managed to contact Bungie, explaining to them i have a game breaking bug that renders the game unplayable as ALL enemies straight from the tutorial remain ?? level and are as such unkillable and will oneshot you. They refused any and all help and decided to ""Maintain my status"". Bungie's a corrupt money swallowing scheme."
3337,It's aight I guess.
3338,
3339,"dont kill yourself

"
3340,"Lol
"
3341,This Games MID.
3342,"I finally started Destiny 2 about 5 weeks ago. I had held off because there was a lot of mixed publicity and reviews on the game over time. I definitely have issues with certain aspects, particularly content vaulting and the way armor mods are obtained, but overall I've been really enjoying my time with it. I think it's worth a shot for anyone who enjoys MMOs since the dungeons and raids are quite fun overall."
3343,its fun
3344,"This game actually fucking blows
"
3345,I dont get my paid for DLC from my console after converting to pc the game is good I just think they could at least let you keep your DLC seeing as how you need dlc for mostly everything so this kind of ruins the game for me
3346,"I hate this game, I play it all the time."
3347,Dudes and Dudes only thing i can say this game is Fucking awesome....
3348,cool
3349,"Great graphics, really fun game"
3350,if you don't mind a grind game it's extremely fun
3351,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IN 2022
This game is a mess if you want to start fresh in 2022. Over 6 quests going on at the same time, all from dubious sources and no idea of where or what to do next, this game is everything but friendly to new players. The ui is cool but unnecessarily slow, and the story is mediocre at best.

3353,This is a whole ass game with a whole half ass half the time
3354,"dlc's are too overpriced, already paid 60€ for this game at launch on ps4, and now i need to spend 100€+ to keep playing the game while i already bought some dlc's on ps4. bungie isn't what it was, fuck activision"
3355,its fun
3356,good
3357,Destiny is a great time.
3358,"So much to do, PvP and PvE content, play solo or with friends. By far one of my favorite games."
3359,yes
3360,AWESOME
3361,"I am late to the party when it comes to Destiny 2 but I started with Witch Queen and am so far hooked.
Highly recommend for some coop shenanigans."
3362,Not spending another dime on this game until they bring back all of the story content I purchased that was subsequently removed.
3363,so good
3364,good game
3365,"It's a fun game to be sure, after 783 hours on PC 500 on Xbox and 2000 hours on Destiny 1 it has gotten a bit boring in a lot of the grinding you do."
3366,only thing I wish they could somehow implement is matchmaking for raids

3371, Its the fixed version of destiny why wouldn't I recommend this game??? 10/10 bought it again.
3372,Number go up.
3373,Revert shit back to how it was before witchqueen. No one wanna see unkillable arc hunters or titans with loreley.
3374,a classic
3375,"The only reason I down vote this game is due to paying for the bungie version, playing/paying a ton for loot etc.. and they have no way to recover my account? Terrible customer data handling on Bungie's part. Great game before the port over steam an I'm sure its a fun game to play now... Just hurt feelings"
3376,"Why would any game remove it's campaign there's so much missing context, make the campaign optionally downloadable or something."
3377,i was in abhorrent shock when i purchased the legendary edition of this game. i do not recommend this to anyone. it really put my balls in a twist!SS
3378,its ok
3379,its alright
3380,friends are required :)
3381,i fucking hate psions
3382,i fail a lot and this game lets me keep failing until someone can help me
3383,"With 800 hours played, having watched the horror of sunsetting, and having participated in many seasonal events, i simply cannot recommend this game to anyone but those with nothing else to do in their lives.
This game has no respect for the palyers time, and requires an almost full time dedication to it in order to be fully enjoyed.
Not only that, but the ""meta"" is so strongly engrained in the community that you will never find a group to do pve if you don't have certain exotics, and will never find a pvp match without half the lobby rolling hunter with hand-cannon and shotgun.
And with the coming of playlist exclusive weapons, and the absurd number of rolls they have, it's almost impossible to get the roll you want on a weapon you want without full time commitment to the game, an example being gambit and strike exclusive weapons, with thousands of different perk combinations.
All of that, however, pales in comparison to the removal of PAID FOR content in-game, with Bungie completely removing almost all content that came with the ""forsaken"" expansion, one of the most beloved expansions in destiny's history.
Do yourself a favor and find something else to play. This game is shit."
3384,very gud
3385,pain.
3386,Its my favorite game
3387,its not a dam free to play game its more of a free trial cause like 80% of the games content is blocked off by dlcs and even when u buy dlcs they only took me 2-3 hrs to complete them and they cost 39 quid which is dumb as fuck dont buy anything for his game waste of money
3388,after 700 hours i finally know how not to die by my own grenades (mostly)
3389,Fun game kinda need someone to show you the ropes but is then just lotsa fun

3398,"Where am I

good game

*Now including Pirates!"
3399,"pure racism - because I am Russian, I can't buy an add-on. Bungie's statements about supporting minorities look especially ridiculous against the background of such a restriction based on nationality. but u can also buy a key from the markets
"
3400,"Very good game, I was able to play destiny 2 before it was on Steam :D"
3401,"dont join, its too much fun and I cant stop cause they keep updating the game and adding new shit"
3402,fun and torture at the same time
3403,"I love this game, and especially how they've been trying to make it new player friendly, and with every season having a new storyline it all wraps together and creates its own little world."
3404,yes
3405,I'm addicted and no one should go through this pain. Wait for a better New player Experience before you really try D2.
3406,"THIS GAME MADE ME WANNA END MY LIFE BUT ITS STILL PRETTY GOOD 
"
3407,I'm just playing this until they make VR Among US
3408,"This is coming from a primarily solo-player.  I want to like this game.  In a way, I still do; the gunplay is enjoyable and the enemies (what variety there is anyways) is engaging enough to be satisfying to shoot.  Not having been a player of Destiny 1 I lack a few gripes others may have with the lack of new enemy varieties.  When a mission or strike is good then it's really fun to play through repeatedly.

There isn't much more I can say that is positive.

Bungie seems to not care at all about the new player experience.  They seem so profit driven that when initially getting into the game there is a huge lack of content to even do.  New players don't even have a campaign to play through, the bulk of the current game is locked behind paywall after paywall.  You are instead shoveled through a short set of introductory missions that is a rehash from Destiny 1 before being dumped right in the middle of whatever is currently happening plot-wise.
Most of the destinations have so much open space that you just fly right through to get to the few Lost Sectors or current mission objectives available, or maybe some patrols or alerts.  It's such a huge missed opportunity to have so much of these locations just be filler.

Worse still, Bungie has removed content from paid expansions.  I dropped $25 at the time to access Forsaken, and aside from my usual gripes I still enjoyed it enough.  This is gone now, aside from some weapons and a single destination that now lacks any context as to its existence.  To me, personally, this is theft; a product I paid for being forcibly taken away from me.  I also bought the Deluxe edition of Shadowkeep ($60 at the time); I regret this now since they vaulted so much other content and I do not want to spend a single cent more on this game.

Presently, if a new player does wind up wanting to play the expansions (lets be honest, the rest of the game), it would cost at least $145 (including the upcoming Lightfall) for only the base expansions while not on sale.  $145 buy-in just to have actual campaigns to play through and not just a mishmash of busy-work, bouncing around between repeatable open-world tasks and barely a handful of strikes to queue up for.  New players get only a single dungeon and raid to participate in while being thrown into a world with no context as Destiny 2 tries to shovel new players towards the current new expansion to try and squeeze money out of them; it's like starting on Chapter 1 of a book before being skipped ahead to Chapter 47 while at the same time being asked to pay to read the rest; it's narrative hell.

While I mentioned I primarily play solo I was willing to randomly matchmake for strikes.  I have mixed feelings about strikes, as while some seemed okay, almost all of them devolve into speedruns of just trying to skip as many enemies as the game will allow.  This wouldn't normally be an issue on numerous repeats, but this is jarring when jumping into a strike you aren't used to for the first few times or so; you just adjust to the speed rather than taking your time on the first few plays.  While this isn't strictly a Destiny 2 problem, it becomes one when it arbitrarily sections off specific missions to *only* be co-op'd rather than allow a few more difficulty settings or team size.  They aren't raids or dungeons, so there isn't like there is a requirement for more than one person to be participating (as they need to be scaled anyways in case a strike winds up with only one player).

To further add to the multiplayer experience, the game will try *numerous* times to shovel players into doing PvP or Gambit (the PvPvE mode).  Certain exotics and catalyst unlocks require a certain number of kills/headshots/etc in either of these modes, for example.  This was especially prominent when I played before the content vaulting.  To Bungie's credit, some quests/requirements will have an option between a PvP *or* PvE requirement to fulfill, but it still isn't always the case.

Don't spend money on the expansions for this; your money is better spent on more full, complete games (ones that aren't even live-service where they can rip away massive amounts of content on a whim).  I've soured on this game and would prefer not to be burned for the nth time."
3409,"I mean, I like it. The grind is real, it's not for everyone lol."
3410,Love the new changes with the 3.0 subclasses. Great game to play solo or with a bunch of friends !
3411,I mean it's alright.
3412,Youll hate it so much youll never stop playing it

3422,"every thing is locked behind a pay wall, that is not good.
the multiplayer is ruled by pay to win sweats.
there is figuratively no playable campaign unless you pay, but then again the game is free,
if you don't like it then you can uninstall it
just get it and try it, if you don't like it don't say I didn't warn you"

3448,great game ..just try it
3449,"If you are looking for a game to dump hundreds/thousands of gameplay hours with ""just"" 100 bucks a year. This is your game :)

3472,"I've had to change my review from positive to negative specifically because I found out I purchased a campaign I can't access, by a few months. If you're not planning on reducing the price, keep the content needed to justify the price your demanding. Paying for a 2 minute quest and a handful of weapons is just pathetic. Keep your content in the game or don't make your game live service if you can't handle it. And especially if your game is story based, and continued story based, just make them new games, or MAKE YOUR SERVERS CAPABLE OF HANDLING IT."
3473,Fun game always enjoyed this series and enjoyed playing on battlenet  and still enjoying playing it on steam 10/10 fun game to grind
3474,this game is fucking dogshit its worse than warframe do not play this
3475,"This game is addictive and tons of fun to play with friends and strangers alike, find the right third party tools and it becomes really easy to find players and guides to have a blast. I warn you that once you start the hamster wheel of content it just keeps spinning and D2 becomes your only game."

Until it goes away, the review will stay like this. There are bigger problems in the game than inventing ""sKiLL BaSeD MaTcHmAkInG"".

Update as for 09.09.2022
My issue with PVP right now is not that I possibly get the people of the same skill, while it doesn't really work as intended, especially while playing Iron Banner, the problem is with connection, that was even worse at the start of the new season. Right now it might be good, but not that good to notice some quite questionable things that even the game can't understand. That's all."
3478,Fun game shoot aliens
3479,Yes
3480,Rootkit is now mandatory. Sad.
3481,They just want your money like all of it. also instead of coming up with new more interesting enemies and balancing weapons properly they were like hey our weapons are too overpowered and made enemies that just use special abilities every other second then they nerfed the weapons into the ground and was like that seems about right and frankly I've seen a frog with more balance than this game
3482,Its a good game
3483,I love what they have done with the game its almost like a reboot!

3487,"Destiny 2 is a great all around game. It's only main issue is that a  lot of the content is locked behind the various DLCs. If you have them, the game is extrememly enjoyable. It can take some getting used to as it can be overwhelming in the beginning but if you're having trouble getting started I'd recommend looking up guides from either Fallout Plays or KackisHD. There are also many other D2 youtubers with beginners guides videos."

3508,YES
3509,"Been playing for about 2 weeks now and i can only recommend it. Sure for new players its kinda hard to get into especially Story wise but i found some videos in no time explaining the lore and the basics and now im at 1575 power level with lots of stuff. In general if you have aim and you like shooting Aliens this is the game for you even without aim you can probably play any free to play or paid non legendary stuff without problems.
PvP wise i would recommend you to play the game story wise first to get a decent power level, an overall knoladge of your abilitys and get some powerfull exotics first because so many enemies will have much more powerfull weapons then you  what can be a problem, but with some good exotic weapons you will get some 4 hit or even 1 hit kills in no time. Sorry for any miss spells im no mainly English speaking person."

3543,fun... sometimes
3544,This game is like an abusive Ex
3545,"I would personally recommend this game to friends as it is a really fun game, especially if you enjoy sci-fi games, or first person shooters. I also think though that its worth trying for yourself as the game is free to play, although it is free to play most of the game is locked behind DLC which is usually a once a year buy, with the most expensive one giving you the four season passes for the year. they give you enough content for free that you can see if its worthwhile though, before buying any of the games DLC."
3546,me like
3547,Ikora :steammocking:
3548,yup
3549,good game enjoyable yes very much
3550,Help
3551,"I jumped back into D2 with Witch Queen after probably a two year break. I stopped playing it because I had nobody to play it with and found it repetitive, expensive to keep up to date and lacking in the campaign. Well, now I have some mates to play with and I find the content to be fresh and varied enough to not be as repetitive.

So… 

Positives
- Great gun play, probably the best, which is the most common positive you’ll probably see. This is Bungie after all. Halo forever 😍
- Great with mates.
- Plenty of stuff to do and quests to complete.
- Witch Queen campaign is good, their best yet, it feels like the world is coming together.
- The weekly challenges and seasons keep it reasonably fresh.
- Great graphics, world design, music, lore.
- Fun PvP.

Cons
- It is expensive. The yearly DLC + season pass is the cost of an entire game each time, and it definitely doesn’t warrant the kind of retail prices they charge. Always get it on sale!
- Very grindy. Even though the amount of content is decent these days, you’ll still find yourself doing things over and over to farm XP. 
- The RNG aspect. You could do a very hard mission by the skin of your teeth and get armour and weapons the same level as current or only minimally better.

TLDR
Great game, best enjoyed with mates, you’ll have a blast. But prepare to part with your money if you want to stay bang up to date and be frustrated with slow progression."
3552,I hate myself
3553,"dont be hunter main

fuck the meta

fun game yes?
love variks and fallen
do raids
get into lore
and have fun time
destiny = fun time if follow rule

good.

3554,THIS GAME SUCKS! First of all your forced to play PVP so you can play the story. It takes forever to load. It just throws million's of adds at you from Bungie so they can get your money! This game sucks! I could go on forever about my complaints! Whatever just don't get the game!
3555,I just hate the game
3556,fun
3557,"Always been a solid game. Great gameplay, weapon variety, and character customization. Only gripe has been the general grind that presents itself at various events, as well as for some exotic weapon related quests.  Raids have always been a blast, but are difficult to find groups for if you don't have many friends who play. Main reason i fell off was due to lack of friends, mainly lost when Destiny 2 went from Blizzard to Steam."
3558,vex=doo doo
3559,"Admittedly the new player experience is not great. Its a game that you can fall in love with, but if youre new theres a lot to take in. There will be story youve missed, in game systems to learn, and a community thats hard to find your footing in sometimes."
3560,"Conditional Reccomendation ONLY IF:

-You like Grinding
-You are willing to pay for expansions
-You have friends to play w/ or immediately seek clans to help you

3561,the witch dlc pretty fun

3565,"Its a solid game, started out with just free version back in march and got super happy it was a great game for what was available for free but then i watched a video on how much of it is behind DLC's and then got depressed and deleted the game because i was bad at the pvp too but after seeing the new sale i decided to redownload it and turns out i'm cracked at the pvp now and i have decided to buy the deluxe witch queen pack which i just got today and i'm about to check out the pay to win experience"

3568,I hate Destiny 2. It's my favorite game!
3569,y
3570,this game is a trash container. i have to go onto a 3rd party website or app to just get a lobby of guys to do a dungeon...was matchmaking too hard for the devs to understand? cant do any PvE raids or dungeons without scrounging around on another website while im trying to enjoy a game. horrible idea and a garbage concept. anyone who plays this is braindead. i should be able to que up for PvE lobbys in a first person shooter game just like every other game with a match making system. KYS
3571,fun n stuff
3572,"This guy reminds me of my last relationship.

Toxic, yet caring, and destroyed by Destiny 2."
3573,good.
3574,Better than Halo Infinite
3575,bad game
3576,"This game is great. It feels like a hybrid of Halo and No Man's Sky. I don't typically like games like this, but I'm hooked."
3577,like if destiny had a sequel
3578,SO   if you are looking for a Shooting game  Destiny is a good game to play

3593,"Too much shit behind paywall, don't lie and say this game is free to play. There's barely anything to do without having to buy the newer expansions."
3594,"costs too much too play, but has alot of content if you are a completionist"
3595,"Good.

3597,"Bring a friend, or 5. also some money, you'll loose interest in the base game very quickly."
3598,This is an amazing game! probably one of my favorites definitely recommend if you like shooter games :)
3599,The addiction isn't as strong with me as it is with others but I can definitely say that this game will keep you busy.
3600,gud game
3601,VERY FUN GAME BUT VERY ADDICTING
3602,Spent almost 1400 hours for the game to just decide to never launch again
3603,my head hurts
3604,its fun
3605,an addiction to cocaine is probably still cheaper.
3606,"this game is horrible and should never be played. this is coming from someone with over 4.5k hours on xbox

3617,The Gameplay And Speed And Overall People I've Met Are Really Fun. I Just Can't Stop Playing This Game. Like Deadass This Is Fun.
3618,"All I can say is that increased cost of the dlc's is just insane. The only reason I don't want to play the game is because there is just too much they are making you pay to play the game, I would honestly just recommend playing another game where you are not required to spend your whole free time just doing battle-pass quests."
3619,"great game.  payment structure is terrible, just charge a monthly sub already."
3620,fun buy got codoe beagle error so fuck this game
3621,"very good game, lots to do, although a lot of content is locked behind a paywall"

3624,Money grab
3625,play for months no breaks stop playing for a while repeat
3626,yes
3627,i really think this game is cool. it takes my mind off of secret hour with uncle Ray. I think everybody should find something to occupy the mind during wierd times.
3628,its good if u have all the content
3629,W game frfr
3630,Do You want an abusive relationship?? Play Destiny 2.
3631,Free from craptijizzard's management. This game is amazing and what it was meant to be: the king of mmofps & crossplay

3640,A truly unique game that sucks you into its universe
3641,Its like waterboarding but less wet. 100% recommend it
3642,"Unparalleled updates and value for content. There is no other GaaS that I know of that will give you 4 dlc updates + free gameplay updates + an entire expansion for 100 bucks. Imo, it's the high bar for never-ending games right now."
3643,"Really enjoyed this game at Launch, Decided to pick it up again and every 10 minutes I get a ""BattlEye Query Timeout Bug"" So I can't even play this game. Looked for solutions. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, Forwarded it through my firewall, Disabled Shaders and any other outside program that might be interfering with the ""Anti-Cheat"" (BattlEye). Nothing has worked. I've been fighting to play this game for 5 hours now and nothing has worked. Bungie needs to fix the basic issues before they start looking at adding more to this game. If anyone has any other suggestions on how to fix this issue please let me know because apparantly it isn't bungies fault and they refuse to release any information on this issue. I've seen many others with the same issues yet very few seem to fix it."

3656,class game
3657,It's ok.
3658,its mid
3659,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME
3660,"i dunno what it is about destiny.. but for some reason i'll play this game for hours upon hours... then play a ton of other games thinking im tire of this game i need other games in my life... but one thing is for sure. guardians always come back to destiny. its like we cant escape it or that its ""destiny"". whatever it is... something about this game always brings me back to it. the design of the maps character clothing, weapons, and effects are all visually beautiful. the ability to play co-op on pretty much anything is absolutely fantastic and always allows you to bring friends along. if you want to play solo, you can. the gameplay is awesome and the different rolls and effects make weapon collecting a lot of fun. destiny is the game i feel like i will always come back to regardless of how much time has passed. im sure most feel the same. to those of you that play and for those of you getting into destiny. hopefully we will cross paths. good luck and safe travels, guardians."
3661,"This game has taken over my life, don't play this game.

10/10 would recommend"
3662,i love this fortnite game
3663,"I've had a love/hate relationship with this game since its launch. 

Mostly hate.

Lots of questionable choices like vaulting paid content, then going F2P and gutting most of the game for free players, THEN selling dungeons separately and locking exotics behind Deluxe Editions with the upgrade for said edition only being $10-$20 cheaper than the D-Edition itself. Lot of grubby practices going on here. 

Friend of mine told me that the new season though would be centered around being a space pirate captain for a group of Eliksni Pirates (two of my favorite things) and that was really all I needed to hear, so here I am back in this abusive relationship with Destiny 2. Again. 

Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Dont settle for an abusive relationship with your games. You're worth so much more than that."
3664,Fortnite skins in this game help collect kids into my basement :)
3665,Finally-- no more vaulting.
3666,I finally get to be a space pirate in my favorite shooter RPG. 10/10 would recommend
3667,yes
3668,"ive got 4 thousand plus hours on ps but the game is just amazing for pvp,pve,campaign and exploring cool places with the realease of lightfall we will be getting a new neon city on neptune so hop in and join in"
3669,Really good game.
3670,GET READY FOR A GRIND GUARDIAN!!!!!!!!!!
3671,I like the game but the DLC are very expensive which is why I have not really continued to play it :(
3672,SBMM ruined this game
3673,The game plays terrible via xbox app so im glad I went on steam. Xbox app caused crashes nonstop.
3674,wow i hecking love destiny 2
3675,witch queen good
3676,game
3677,"If you are new, and you have friends that play the game daily and now a lot and they have no problem to help you understand the game, I highly recommend you to give it a try, a rich lore, you are not going to get tired of playing and I'm telling you say good bye to your normal life."
3678,es como comerse una napolitana mojada
3679,50/50 Idk i have no time to aply sometimes
3680,this gotta have a VR port!!
3681,"nice sex, full sex"
3682,i liek
3683,"Destiny 1 supremacy, but this one is pretty good too!"
3684,I grew addicted to the original game back in whenever it released. I can't stop this addiction. It's been years since I've seen the outside world. God how old am I now...Jesus help me goddamn it!
3685,One of my fav shooters!
3686,"When the game is fun, it really slaps but when the bad parts seep through the cracks it sucks. There are a LOT of things bungie does right but a LOT of things done wrong."
3687,"F2P experience is horrible but the expansions are great.
While you can play on your own I highly recommend finding a clan to play with, makes the game much more fun."
3688,Playing the game series since Destiny 1  and I love it.The DLC´s are definitely worth it!
3689,"Remember when Bungie was an honest company with honest business practices focused toward community and the consumer?

Pepperidge Farm remembers."
3690,"If I can switch my life into game, this definitely one of three games i want to live in."
3691,"It's not perfect, it has it's ups and downs like most games. I don't recommend for daily use due to a lack of content after a few months when a season begins but entertaining for the most part."
3692,just started... good so far
3693,nice
3694,its cool

3709,great game to just mindlessly grind
3710,"Amazing gameplay. Terrible reward system.      
My advice try it out but dont stick around longterm or you will be in a relationship with a abusive partner.      
Dont hurry towards the endgame enjoy the ride and get of the instant its not fun"
3711,love this game it can be grindy and boring at times but overall great game
3712,Spicy
3713,yeye
3714,I just don't like it
3715,"Long time no playing this game, come back with power less than the minimum power, could not even kill one bot. Got killed instantly by the weakest bot. What is the shame."
3716,Fun to play with friends
3717,mantap kali
3718,Goes hard
3719,"Awesome Game!
"
3720,"I have never played a game this grindy. It's just satisfying and cool enough to make you feel like you need the next best item and spend inhumane amounts of time attempting to get it. You'll arrive at ""wtf am I doing, with my life"" transition to ""Well i've already wasted this much time might as well see it through."" then maybe get what your looking for, or RNG still says no and you just keep wasting even more time. If you don't have a job you might have enough time to enjoy the game, otherwise you'll end up with plenty of regret knowing you spent 20 hours making literally no progress on your goal."

3730,"This game saved my life.

I am 20.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you Bungie.

PVE wise I just logged on to mess around after some time away and it immediately took me on a quest. Not unexpected but the surprise was I could do no damage to enemies (immune) while they 1 shotted me. Whoops! Well done Bungle..as always. Perhaps not the best idea to push me into a quest I cannot complete."

3752,Been playing since about Y2 and trying to keep up with the game. It's a fun way to sink time if you just want to grind.
3753,Solid game fr
3754,"I play the hell out of this game and adore it. Feels great to play and it always feels like it's improving. If you get a crew together or get involved in the (mostly) surprisingly friendly community you'll forge some serious bonds taking on the higher level content D2 has to offer. The story and lore can be totally worth the significant investment it takes from the player to get acquainted with it. I'm obviously biased but I've almost always felt good about the cost/value aspect of the expansions/season passes/ dungeon keys/ deluxe editions, etc...

Which kinda brings me to the biggest asterisk (*) I could possibly summon. I can't really recommend this game without cautioning you, dear gamer, about the FOMO. It will happen to you. No matter what. Free to play players? FOMO. But that's kind of to be expected I guess; but don't worry those who pay will also experience FOMO. If you play all the time? FOMO. Buy every microtransaction in the store? FOMO. It's endemic to D2 at this point. To enjoy it you must surrender to MO to move past the FOMO.

Ultimately, It's a lot of work to get into D2. But I think it's worth it. Play the free to play portions and try it out for yourself. If you want a great campaign as well then pick up the witch queen expansion and enjoy the ride. From there consider upgrading to the deluxe edition to save $ on season passes and the dungeon pass (a lot of passes but they're worth it). Whatever you do, don't cement a negative opinion on this game without trying one of the raids. They even have some that are free. There are people in the community who want to teach you them! Raids are the best. Don't put this game down without trying one."

3769,"Just figured out how to walk in this game. I'd been sliding around like a slug this whole time until I saw a Steam Community Guide called ""How To Walk"" that really changed my playstyle. 
Friends are good with this game. Don't have them? Make some; join a clan, a discord, even some LFG stuff if you're not feeling the first two! There's plenty of communities to choose from, so don't feel like you're stuck with the one that you first find or are currently in! Destiny 2 has some of the most notable achievements you can accomplish in a game with friends, and is sure to leave you with fond memories of your times spent together for years to come.

3785,"Destiny 2 is a very fun and interactive game that you can play with your friends, there are many things that you are able to do in the game especially when you are new and just starting out. It may be a little challenging to get to understand everything at the beginning, but once you get into it the story begins to get really fun and gets players wrapped up in the fun. There is high end game content that after you understand the game it will end up being the most fun you will have, there are things like raids and dungeons that you can do either with close friends and/or players that you may meet on lfg (looking for group) on bungies website, this allows players to not be restricted in any way of what you can do or cant do. You may meet people that could be possibly your best friend all throughout your destiny 2 journey that you randomly met patrolling destinations or on lfg! Experienced players are most of the time willing to help you out in any way that you need, (like me). I have been playing destiny since the first game and all the way until season of the plunder in the witch queen expansion and dont intend to ever stop playing this game! I try to teach people high end content if they have never done it before so that they too can get good rewards and have that fun with teaching THEIR friends. Overall it's an amazing game to meet and make new friends. Bungie does their absolute best to make the game enjoyable and listens to their playerbase. I LOVE YOU BUNGIE!"

3794,"Overall, there is stuff that like I def have my gripes with, last season the game treated me like garbage for my time. There are definitely times like that, this game franchise has been my ride or die since i was in middle school and now that I'm collage i still see that the games potential is far from hit and where it seems like its headed is great. Although there is one major issue though that i could see, the new light experience, lets cut to the chase it sucks. The experience itself isn't the worst, but after you are through the cosmodrome there is no direction basically whatsoever, the endup to the rest of the game isn't fluid, it starts to feel like that what you are doing doesn't exactly matter, strikes become mundane decently fast, crucible while can be fun doesn't really feel like somewhere to end up at, and we really don't talk about gambit. Luckily with this season the chest in the helm which boost players to 1570 definitely helps new players get to endgame content even giving them a mod build to work with and start off on to work in the end game, which happens to be the issue, abt 75% of this games content is endgame ie: gm nightfalls, normal and master raids, legend/master loss sectors and dares, normal and master dungeons, trials, survival. All of those are made to end up close or are end game content, and yes there is the destinations, crucible, strikes, gambit and what have you but nearly all of that stuff feels like it lacks bite, so for all new players trying to get into the game that don't have an experienced player on their fireteam are probably more than likely to  quit after they finish the cosmodrome if they are ftp or witchqueen if they spent the money because after that point it doesn't feel like there is any reason to do something else in the game, there is no grab, no major draw to the playlists, an experienced player could tell them that its for the loot you can get so you have a better chance in the endgame, but someone who doesn't know what light.gg, dim, or d2 gunsmith is isn't going to know that, they wont really know what they are going for unless they watch a guide which for many people rips the experience from them. Overall this game is still a great game for people who have been here for years but to a person just now coming in i really hope we make a way for experienced people who know what they are doing get a chance to help people get to know the game better so that they can also enjoy the amazing stuff this game has to offer, which i think may be coming in lightfall, hopefully."

3836,"I've played this game since it was released on Bnet, and I probably have just as many hours over there, if not more than on here. For the first few years, things were going well. Then, once the sunsetting had begun, everything you had been grinding for was suddenly useless. They fixed that, and then once things were good again, they decide to remove over half of the game to make way for new content...

Okay, that was strange, but at least we got new conten- Nope. After purchasing the new DLC, it's revealed that you need to purchase the Deluxe edition just to be able to access the new yearly dungeons. Mix all of this is with ""seasonal"" events and prizes that take a substantial grind as it is, I can no longer recommend this game. If you're not 100% dedicated to this in your free time outside of work, family, etc, you will miss out on everything this game has to offer. I can't justify spending any more money on Destiny 2 because of this."

3873,"Destiny 2 is great. It offers some of the most rewarding FPS gunplay and ability mechanics and seemingly endless opportunities to grind power each week. However, D2 has developed into a full time job that demands player time and commitment in fear of missing out or being under light for PvP and PvE power restricted activities. Content is now regularly shelved or vaulted with new weapons introduced as re-skinned versions from previous seasons. If you're on the fence, give D2 a chance with their free-to-play option, but expect to shell out roughly $100 minimum annually if you want to play and participate in all available content."
3874,"This game I've played off and on for years, occasionally it gets stale, but I love coming back to it every now and then and love how easy it is to get back into. My only complaint is that this game is not tailored towards hardcore players and you will definitely run out of stuff to do if you try to play it that way. take it slow and just enjoy it."

3903,I've been playing Destiny since I was a teen. I've been off and on since Destiny 2 came out but Beyond Light and Witch Queen have been amazing. The seasonal content has been very strong and the Bungie devs never stop trying to improve their game. It's not very new player friendly but at the start of Season 18 they out a chest full of legendary and exotic gear to help people get a foot hold in higher content. I've been very delighted by the subclass 3.0 reworks they have done. It's given a lot of power to the player to craft strong and focused builds. Thank you Papa Bungo for the thousands of hours of entertainment.

He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defences, take this beast out, and break their grip of Freehold."

"
3927,"TL:DR; I loved this game. I hate it now. I still come back, hoping Bungo get's it all together. They've certainly made progress, but it's been so long in the making and I've witnessed them destroy so much good progress at the same time. Bungo has taken my money, time, data, then literally removed DLC's I purchased, and disabled the gear I acquired from them so that it could be repackaged and sold back to me. I should stay away from this game, and I honestly think everyone should avoid Destiny 2 as well.

Currently, I have 1950+ hours on Steam and around 300 on XBox. I've put way too much time into this franchise, especially counting Destiny 1 playtime.

Destiny 2 has probably the best gunplay around. The variety, the unique feels, and the potential for wanton destruction are hard to find anywhere else. The abilities, especially after the reworks, are exciting and rewarding in the vast majority of cases (fuck melee whiffs, Bungo still can't fix them). Despite the reputation of the original game, Destiny 2 actually has a semi cohesive story. The later additions in particular, starting around the Forsaken DLC, were extremely well written. However, there are glaring issues with the story. 

Entire chapters are missing. I'm not referring to when writers jumped over a specific area of content to revisit it later, that's been done as well. I mean literal portions of the game have been removed, DLC's with complete stories that are integral to the Guardian's character. Forsaken is an emotionally charged DLC that is a catalyst for your Guardian's character development. It is literally the first time the Guardian speaks in the entire franchise, after numerous years of a monk like silence. This DLC that players purchased, not seasonal content, is no longer accessible. It has been removed along with many other parts of the original storyline. You can watch this iconic moment online, with other peoples fashion challenged Guardians. Ones that leave their helms on all the time, not because they're Mandalorian, but because they regret how their character looks too. 

You cannot experience it. You have missed out. Feel the FOMO. This game is 75% FOMO and reused assets. 

(BTW, Bungo won't let you change how your character physically looks, so anyone who regrets how they made their Guardian look 10 years ago, you are SoL. You will forever be the edgy emo looking Hunter. Think male titans are way too chonky and want a different gender? Well you can't change that in game. Also, in the character creation screen, even the Exo's (essentially robots with real human mind stored in a ""mechanical"" body) are counter-intuitively only given binary options)

When Bungo started removing DLC's, they also started ""Sunsetting"" armor and weapons. All those god rolled weapons and high start armor rolls that players spent 100's of hours obtaining,became worthless outside of activities that ignore power level. Only Crucible, PvP, ignores power level. The OP weapons that were a menace in PvP at the time, were not affected by the Sunset, only by eventual nerfs to the individual weapons. PvE was the only thing affected by sunsetting, and I'm of the opinion that it was done to extend the grind, despite Bungo's justification. After enough backlash, Bungo eventually stopped sunsetting armor. They still sunset weapons and now perks/perk combinations.

You cannot experience them. You have missed out. Feel the FOMO. This game is 75% FOMO and reused assets. 

Years later, well after being removed from the game via DLC deletion or Sunsetting, weapons started being re-released. Gjallarhorn made it's 4th release in the Destiny franchise. They keep taking it away and bringing it back, so long as you pay. Other Sunset legendary weapons received minor cosmetic changes, some got new names, a couple of perk readjustments, and usually a stat nerf in some capacity. 

It happens every new season now, it's actually one of the few reasons that I still log in at the start of the season. ""What weapons are they bringing back?"" Bungo is capitalizing on the nostalgia, after they were the ones who removed it originally. They also charged money both times. Then they used to take away all the seasonal stuff when the season ended, ramping up that FOMO. Fortunately, the last few seasonal activities and weapon/armor sets are accessible, so it seems Bungie has stepped away from that behavior. Still, R.I.P to all the other seasonal gear. I'm sure my Steelfeather Repeater and Breachlight will be released again, maybe after an identity crisis.

You cannot experience it. You have missed out. Feel the FOMO. This game is 75% FOMO and reused assets. 

Bungo is also either exceptionally neglectful or just plain awful at balancing the Crucible. It takes entire seasons for completely broken weapons/exotics to be nerfed. Then they nerf it just in time to introduce another broken exotic using very similar mechanics, just taken in the opposite direction. Looking at you Omnioculus/Lord of Wolves and Gyrfalcon's Hauberk. Not only did Bungo take forever in nerfing Omni/LoW, the literally created the meta by nerfing and disabling all forms of damage resist in the Crucible aside from Omni, The Stag (Much lower DR and is generally stationary), and Super's. They also nerfed shotguns to make them less reliable, but the Lord of Wolves said that should only apply to peasantry shotguns. Bungo made the problem and let the players stew in it. It isn't the first season, nor the last, that they will do something like this, Omni/LoW is just the most recent example.

Speaking of broken weapons in PvP, sometimes Bungo just removes weapons from the loot pool. This is different than sunsetting, as these weapons can still be used in power level enabled content without detriment. Activities like Nightfalls, Raids, the PvP portion of Gambit, and most importantly for this conversation, Trials of Osiris. Removing it from the loot pool prevents new players (and old players who missed out) from obtaining it, increasing FOMO. It also doesn't balance the PvP side of things as the weapon is still OP, plenty of players already have it, some even with absurd god rolls. Rather than nerfing the weapons individual stats, or the weapon's archetype, or a particular perk combo Bungo just removes them. 

Take Shayura's Wrath. It's an SMG, the auto rapid-fire option for CQC encounters and an option for dealing with shotgun rushers. Sidearms, for contrast, are fast RoF but not to the speed of SMG's, and are close to medium range and capable of dueling hand cannons and dealing with most shotguns, although Hand Cannon's can back pedal and play the range benefits. (FYI, Destiny literally has lore on dueling being Sidearms and Hand Cannon's only. See the Took Offense armor set for some lessons courtesy of Cayde-6.) Shayura's out ranges every sidearm except the Forerunner exotic(more of a sniper/handcannon combo lol) and can contest the majority of Hand Cannon's. Extremely strong, very deadly, completely inaccessible. There are multiple weapons in this same kind of scenario.

You cannot experience them, except as a target. You have missed out. Feel the FOMO. This game is 75% FOMO and reused assets. 

Lastly, Bungo is completely disrespectful of players time. In the last ten seasons, drops for seasonal mats began decreasing in quantity (i.e. the Dawning). Bungo removed the Tangled Shore, and Spider, the only way to trade mats in for Legendary Shards. You get between 3-5 per shards item depending Season Pass progress and Clan level. Shards are used in leveling, purchasing gear, and focusing engrams at 100 per IB/Trials engram. I had 10k at the start of S17. By the end I never had more than 500. Mats are a slog and the economy is messed up. The season pass has so many empty slots, why aren't shards there? Where are other ways to get shards? Why is focusing so expensive? Also, the only incentive to log in daily is to see if Ada has a mod you missed. It's usually a ""no."""

3975,absolute trash devs. killed a game with 100$ dlcs with very little content and removing old PAID content. monetisation of this game is  greedier than EA or activision. prepare to spend more than 200$ to play few hours of irrelevant content and wonder when it will be deleted after they got the money from players.
3976,"It's a cool game if you want to be hooked into the gun-and-run type of game with a huge grind behind it. Personally, I've had an off-and-on relationship with the game as content soon becomes repetitive until you get the next release DLC. Which DLCs are basically the price of a whole game itself, but some of them deserve to spend some money on due to some of the content being quite good as some others are pretty shitty. Even though it sounds like I have a negative point of view on the game, I think overall the game is pretty good when the developers put effort into their DLCs, instead of half-assing like Shadowkeep. Though, I've had a good time playing the game with friends, and highly recommend playing this game with a group of friends that are willing to the grind in raids."
3977,"Overall, the game is fun but parkour ruins it for me. Trolls will say it's a lack of skill, but in actuality, it is an older gamer thing. The mods on the Steam forum are also toxic, so stay off them. One last reason I do not recomend this game is that the expansion pack/DLC is priced way too high for the content."

I remember thinking Activision were holding this game back, but the monetization and content model have only gotten more aggressive and anti-consumer since Bungie broke out on their own

story is paced horribly, they constantly remove content that you've paid money to access, they do not know how to balance a weapons in either PvE or PvP content, endgame PvE is just bullet sponge enemies that will kill you just by looking in your direction

this game will suck out your soul and leave you an empty shell, you'll keep wishing it could be better but it will never improve, save your sanity, Bungie as we knew it is dead and they will not make a good game ever again

4020,"One of Destiny 2's most unique aspects is its story, which is told through the unfolding of minor or major events involving fully fleshed out characters that players learn to love. A prime example of this comes from Uldren Sov being antagonistic in his behavior in the first game, only to become Cayde's killer in the second. But his saga was not over, and the Awoken prince was resurrected as a Guardian by his new Ghost, Glint. Who once was Uldren Sov became Crow, a lovable Hunter who has always been sympathetic towards others and wants to be good."
4021,"I really want to leave a positive review because this game is so wonderful in so many aspects... It's just the main one, the main gameplay loop is so horrendous. continuously entering a large room, fighting off waves of enemies and rinsing and repeating is so incredibly off-putting and makes me want to just stop playing as soon as I've finished one fight. This isn't helped by the ideology that in order to make the game harder they just give all the enemies more health and damage rather than swapping them out for different enemies or other actually interesting difficulty tweaks. As I say, everything else is awesome, just the main gameplay really, really blows"

4039,"Writing this because Bungie just waved a bunch of flashy 80's neon aesthetics and a grappling hook in people's face and watched as people back-flipped and cart-wheeled into that pre-order bonus without a second thought.

Please remember, no matter what gets changed, no matter how long you leave for, even when you come back its still the same things you're grinding to increase a meaningless level and get guns that are 1% better than the guns you just farmed for a year ago. gameplay/build crafting and story are the only shining light the game has. Witch Queen highlighted this best, when the DLC drops it is SO good. But once that fades its ""back to your regularly scheduled grind!"" Its not even a fun grind either, its homework.

you're not playing a game, you're in a long term abusive relationship where once a year, on your anniversary, you get drunk together and have a fun night on the town that you will then use to justify staying together.

I sincerely hope Lightfall is good, but taper your expectations and leave now while you can. I promise you there are better looter/shooters out there that respect your time and money."

4051,"If *only* Bungie could make games as well as they write lore... :\


Okay, okay. The game itself is alright; the locations are scenic, the gun play is fantastic, the voice acting is good, the background story is interesting, the characters are (mostly) likable, and if you bring friends, you can have a lot of fun in this game.

... But after a while, the whole thing becomes REPETITIVE.

In many ways, it's difficult to recommend this game; there is SO MUCH that they could've done better, so much more they could add, so many tweaks, so many little things... the biggest issue is content and repetition of said content... I think Bungie accidentally made the mistake of making a shooter game with a campaign that they ended up running like an MMO. It's like they want it to be one desperately, but if you compare it to an actual MMO, there isn't *nearly* enough to do. And when they talk about the new expansion, they plan on adding... one destination. And the Lorebooks are *so* interesting, but the part you play in the game often feels lame in comparison (to me, anyway.) I get the difficulty in translating literature into gameplay, so what can you do, but... eh. :\

That being said, what they do have is fun... It's just that you can run through it pretty quick, and then, as I mentioned above, it becomes repetitive.

PvP is alright, since it's about the same as PvP in other games (although they do need to add more maps.) Gambit... needs work. :)

It has a free-to-play feature, so give it a shot and see if it's worth buying expansions and season passes. I still play it, so I guess it gets a thumbs up in this review, but I'm incredibly burnt out now; I basically only do the story anymore, *maybe* try to level up my season pass rank for the cosmetic gear.

If you join an active clan you might end up really liking this game; it really is more fun with friends.

All of that content I originally paid for is now ""Free"" and after that DLC content that was already sold was locked away to ""Not split up the community."" Now they are talking about not doing that again with this new DLC and I am uneasy about buying it to play with friends. Also the amount of DLC and price is really expensive. Three main DLC packs at Fourty bucks each is real steep when you already threw ninety dollars into it. Between the PVP being a game of ""if your not playing the meta, you will die,"" and untrustable business practices this is a great example of what not to do with DLC and your game."

I have played and paid more than $300 for its cosmetics, DLC, expansions, and seasons as the last season I played was Season of The Risen as these words I'm typing are coming from a hardcore and die-hard gamer for a franchise or whatever I'm playing. It's been fun in the early days then I stopped playing around the time the Witch Queen expansion came out. I cannot recommend spending money on this game anymore as content is most likely worth less than their asking price of $40 for the new main story expansion which is mandatory if you want to play the new seasons and an additional $10 for each season pass or if you bought the deluxe edition then it's $80 which is like a whole new game but you get some new mechanics, mode, weapon, exotic, story, dungeon, raid, etc. where they want you to play the game a certain way and maybe your content may or may not be sunsetted/vaulted as they did with everything before Beyond Light which is Season 11. I've been through sunsetting and had content deleted, I got rid of good gear I've grinded for months just for it to be useless later. They brought back refurbished places and weapons for people to do and pay for the same thing in repetition, I am not kidding they re-use assets a lot. Also not to mention the content drought and constant end-game grinding where you want to farm a god roll weapon or armor with good stats is highly unlikely as you might need to finish a Master Lost Sector, Raid, Grandmaster Nightfall, or Trials of Osiris more than at least 12 or more times in my experience just to get a gun or exotic you want to drop and have decent stats you wanted on it. BIG OOF!

Throughout my time playing Destiny 2 they have made improvements but never addressed problems the community has been begging and ranting about such as the lack of choices and challenges set out for the players to do. It has always been like you have to buy this major main story DLC to play the seasons or continue to play on leveling up your character in this game. Not only that but you would have to power grind your power level to the new power cap every single season and expansion to do all these daily and weekly challenges for a couple of weeks to eventually in a couple of months you would have to do that all over again.

This game wants you to be addicted to it and make you do time-consuming stuff in repetition to make you spend more time on it. Even if you haven't noticed it but it's not okay spending 2 or 6 hours a day just to level or grind for your character/s. Spending every single day and the weekends only for you to grind and waste your time on something that may or not guarantee something you wanted. Not to mention sunsetting, good thing they got rid of that and they listened to their player base. But you can never get back those hours or moments you had playing this game using a new gun you just grinded for just for it to be power creeped by some other gun in the new season because it can be upgraded to the new power cap or has some new special perk that may or not be better than than the gun you got.

PVE against bot enemies we've all been there when we get a new enemy type and turns out they're very hard to kill without the new subclass, mod, or weapon you just got let alone what power level you are. Like champions, new factions, or types of the hive they have their moments where at one point they're just regular storm troopers and then they become pin accurate aimbots. Their combat behavior changes from passive to a killing machine massacring all your teammates as you try to stun or escape them because they're immune. Overall the bot enemies in this game are unforgiving, especially in end-game content. My go-to load-out messing around was always Heritage, Trinity Ghoul, and Falling Guillotine.

The only thing left is PVP and oh boy this one is a real mess. The cheating by other players with aimbot or walling has become rampant as their anti-cheat has banned a lot of them but it's not enough. Sometimes you're gonna have to report them and hope for the best in most cases not to mention also taking an L in a comp or trial game. As a person who loves PVP, most of the time in this game it's not just about skill. Most of the time who's using the most broken weapon in the game as my favorite Mountaintop, you will be missed, was a player's choice of weapon getting the easiest kills like Recluse when it came out and 140-120 RPM Hand cannons breaking the meta. But I did not like how power level mattered in Iron Banner and Trials of Osiris as a guy 10-20 levels higher than you can body shot you with a sniper rifle while only making a dent on him only for him to heal or regenerate health taking cover. Even your subclass or exotic armor you wear can be a game breaker from winning a fair match to an unwinnable one.

Titans and hunters are favorably the most used among players as I'm a warlock main they certainly have unfair advantages against other classes. Back when stasis came out it was a hunter's best class for just its freezing potential and cheap tricks for easy kills by the way they're still popular with a few nerfs compared to titans and warlocks. Warlocks in my opinion are a minority and always get nerf hammered to the point of being unplayable to useless. Back when solar classes were fixed Icarus dash was fairly balanced and the community was targeting it like it's the most broken thing because they can dash 2 times and get a speed advantage with their super. While hunters can still dodge spam with a limited cooldown, shatterdive free kills, and the Mask of Bakris is still unbalanced. Even titans still barricade spam, sprint charge /w Dunemarchers capable of killing a whole team, and Ward of Dawn is still impossible to break or kill its user unless you got a high damage super or weapon that can rival it as it cannot guarantee you can kill the guy inside. Then you got warlock with its nova warp brought back to its former glory with a speed nerf, no one is mad about that, stasis turrets that you can break with a shotgun, well of radiance where they can break by shooting the top orb enough, and Dawnblade where you can now have dash and tracking with the new subclass UI where you still can't outrun a hunter running away, using it's super, and jump spamming to do a shatterdive shotgun combo.

Warlocks are also underappreciated in so many aspects as much non-warlock mains sees us as support characters for our ****ing well of radiance in raids and nightfalls they even bail because we don't use them in LFGs and they're the ones that keep dying LMAO. I rock a stasis turret build in grandmaster/master missions and nightfalls and never had anyone complain ""WHY DON'T YOU USE WELL OF RADIANCE"" because I'm freezing everyone and I have a healing rift you can use while were taking cover and I usually get it back after a few seconds. Plus I don't see anyone complain if you go full warlock in a raid and go nova bomb with empowering rift, tractor cannon, and do DPS with our weapons. Compared to any other class they can't function right in a raid team full of hunters or titans. Sometimes I wish Bungie would listen to their brains and fight them with logic. Just say no to those haters and maybe talk about what their broken things are and maybe nerf their ****.

I think I'm done rambling about this game as I am 100% done with it and moved on to a different one. This one took a huge chunk of my life but the time I spent playing this game would not be forgotten. The memories we had of the better days or good times spent will not be replaced and will have more to come. I only typed this review because I was bored as **** and this was the least I could do leaving a review for this game for people to read and think about.

More stuff in the comments ..."
4104,klkjkjj
4105,its a game that you can play
4106,big golfball fights black doritos while the player massacres everything for loot
4107,it has some issues but great game either way
4108,good game
4109,"Great game marred by an absolute cluster of story telling. Vaulting old content was a really bad decision. Even with that, its a fun game. I enjoy the PVP, but do not be fooled, there are balance issues. New expansion looks to correct a lot of mistakes and add some nice QOL changes. I recommend it."
4110,"Gets better every season 
"
4111,e
4112,pew pew go brrrrrr
4113,At the core good game but almost all the Content I was interested in and paid money for has been removed. I just wanna play red war and forsaken again ffs.
4114,cool
4115,Its D2
4116,"would recommend, is good game"
4117,This is a certified sunsetting moment
4118,good game
4119,"This game is nothing but grind. the fun part is you get to kill things, the bad part it's very repetitive and all the guns practically do the same thing depending on which ammo type. it's free to play except for some of the expansions which are pretty expensive for enabling you to do the same thing with a different texture bungie will ask you for your email even stage an event to get your phone number and all linked accounts (cross play)

Pvp mode is a big joke( like they have a good system but refuse to spend money on decent servers to make people take it seriously plus hacking is very questionable, but they reward you regardless if you win or lose with weapons and armor exclusive to those who play  just so you are forced to participate to get them

anyways this game is a lot of fun to play with friends that's what makes the game worth it to me I like shooting things on a rail it's a good break from sandbox survival games sometimes. The graphics and weapons are good, great sound effects it's an overall cool experience  you can defiantly choose if you want to spend money or not you cant pay to play you can pay to look cool and be +10 faster on a scooter that's about it"
4120,I liked everything
4121,A fate worse then death....
4122,Bruh my grandpa plays this game and hes a higher level WTF
4123,"Free to play, pay to enjoy"
4124,This game sucks dont play it
4125,Fun shooter
4126,it sucks now. jk its cool.
4127,"
I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 1920 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 2013012312312 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Furry hentai. So I decided to make a Pornhub account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had left with the fridge. This game has ever since brought me and my son farther (i deserved that godroll Widows Bite fuck you) again and now we actually spend time together inside figthing in crucible (he sucks ass). This game reminded me that there's no fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many psychotic episodes"
4128,ok
4129,You either are addicted and can't stop spending the price of a brand new game every 6 months or you used to be addicted and you want your 1000 dollars back for investing in this game since Destiny 1 and you hate your life and now bungie.
4130,yay
4131,"play for a day, and game ok"
4132,i want to fuck lord shaxx
4133,I spent too much time playing this game to call it shit and too much money to not regret it.
4134,goood gam
4135,Play Destiny Cause Its Awesome. If you Love Fighting Then This is The GAMEEE
4136,Don't recommend
4137,laggy laggy to the point of cussing and telling bungie to f off. sbmm i play people in china!!!
4138,Cool
4139,very good game
4140,make the previous expansions free when you buy the newest one you fucking hacks
4141,"The only game I can simultaneously absolutely despise with a burning passion, but also cherish and talk highly about like my newborn son."
4142,"One of the best games I have ever played, and great in-game content. I like how it has seasons, and lots of customization options. In my opinion, probably the most creative and unique part of this game is that they made it where the timeline moves on. It isn't just the same old campaign, over and over again."
4143,This game has single-handedly ruined my 16 year marriage with my wife. my kids no longer love me- but at least i have the fortnite skins now- 10/10 would recommend to others. Phenomenal/Flawless game design
4144,"If you can stick through the grind, and appreciate the impressively deep lore, you'll understand why this game has the massive cult following it does."
4145,"Window licking central, you'll be amazed at how retarded people can be. 
Oh and the devs  love to break shit. 
If you are a cheapskate the game caters for you too.
Other than that it is a fun game."
4146,yuh
4147,"It's a great game, I love it, but I understand that it doesn't scratch that itch for everyone, if you get what I mean."
4148,"Ye

4154,game is very bingleton
4155,Fun game. Play with friends.
4156,its like destiny 1 ecept money.
4157,do not
4158,"Seasons are kind of Meh sometimes, but the major expansions are always worth checking out as they consistently add more rpg mechanics and forms of progression that are really good and healthy for the game. I personally like the direction that D2 is going in, I just wish it was a little more consistent in the seasons. Although this past year has been good with the Base Subclass Reworks."
4159,"gud game 
"
4160,this game was LIT and if you do not think that then you are a piece of yak dung so PLAY Destiny2! if you do not like it then GO BACK TO THE ROCK YOU CAME FROM! >:)
4161,"game is great, a load of content, great progression systeme, good to play with friends"
4162,"This game is a non-stop adventure. I truly believe this is one of the best sci-fi story driven, action-packed, challenging game of the decade. Its very well made and seems to get better over time just like fine red wine.  This is a must play adventure for all! 
~SgtBlackGold"
4163,i realy like this game because it is realy fun and cool i think all of the characters are cool they are realy detaled   i love the art and even the titan and other characters to play as you sould dowlowd it :] ;] :] downlowd it for free or it mite cost some money cause iv bin playing for A YEAR OR 2 :<}
4164,"its a fun game, but needs alot of reading to know what is going onn."
4165,no
4166,"it gud
"
4167,"YES, I APROVE."
4168,Gameplay is awesome!
4169,Great open world with good design and addictive grind aspects. Also a good game to help get used to PC gaming!
4170,For those who wish to sell their souls
4171,hi
4172,best game
4173,"Gunplay and atmosphere are great, but otherwise a 'What the hell am I supposed to do now?' simulator. New player experience is pretty bad. Toxic community that expects you to be perfect day one. Not clear what old DLCs are worth buying or not because much of the past content has been archived, but it's still for sale. On the technical side it's really well optimized. Requires a lot of time and a lot of money, but not sure it's worth it when there are other looter shooter options out there."
4174,NOICE!
4175,i LIKE THIS GAME TBH
4176,"I played destiny 2 on console way back when it launched, i just recently built a awesome PC for gaming and thought im gonna go back to destiny 2 and experience the base campaign and all the DLC story to get up to speed with the game in my own time, then purchase new DLC expansions and have a great time. Well i was very disappointed once downloading the free to play version on steam and starting a new character, that they removed the base campaign and a bunch of DLC that the game had, i have never seen this happen with a game and has personally ruined the experience for me coming back to the game. Very unfortunate and disappointing and have to let this game go, it has truly fallen from its grace!"
4177,Game good
4178,great way to make friends.
4179,"[i][b]Disclaimer:[/b] while this is F2P, I did receive a few DLCs Free[/i]

Because of my brain disease, the combat mechanics are extremely fluid in having unlimited ammo and no strings attached.  
The story learning curve is steep for a beginner but it does get easier.

The easiest way would be having the map the right orientation in director as youre dropped in the Tower.
...that's just me...

have not touched the DLCs as of yet due to recent receipt - still learning what playstyle fits me"
4180,"As someone who has over 1000 hours on Destiny 1 and over 1000 hours on Destiny 2 but on Xbox, I love the game. I quit back in shadowkeep but I came back in beyond light and soon quit again. Now I am going to probably come back to the game due to the new expansion looking very cool and promising."
4181,Best game of 2017.
4182,Good grindy game that can soak time up.
4183,I have no clue what i'm doing but its fun
4184,worst experience
4185,Why would anyone play this
4186,Used to be good but the retard devs removed 90% of it
4187,"""I'll try this game,"" I said.
""Maybe it'll be fun for a week or two,"" I said."
4188,"it's enjoyable 
"
4189,She took the kids but at least I got to power cap
4190,Games PVE is fun but PVP is completely unbalanced 
4191,s
4192,"I quit, and then come back, and then quit, and then come back, and then quit, and then come back. Plz help"
4193,hmm
4194,There is something for everyone in this game. I have played for years and have logged over 3000 hours included on console and pc combined.
4195,"Destiny 2 is one of the best fps games i've ever played, which isn't really saying much cause it's only the third fps I've played but it's still an amazing game! Though it was definitely confusing at first, had to get help from a friend of mine cause I had no clue how anything worked. Now I am slowly learning how the game works, oh and the cape physics and animations in the game are amazing and SO satisfying to watch!"
4196,i hate this game
4197,"Despite all the missteps Bungie had made with this franchise, this is one of the most fun games I have ever played. The music,  graphics, art direction and most importantly gameplay is the best on the market, certainly eclipsing Halo and any other competition it may have. Fluid gameplay, awesome customization and fun bite sized challanges. There are many downsides, such as confusing menus, ridiculously unbalanced PVP and tons of microtransactions, but I can't help but come back to this ever-evolving universe. 

I would complain about Bungie removing content, but I have managed to play through the entire original game and all expansions for free on Game Pass and free to play week, only spending some money on Silver and a season pass. They promised to stop removing old content and sunsetting weapons, so that's a move in the right direction. Would be nice if they also added back in the main campaign along with the three expansions they removed with legendary difficulty and making them separate downloads, since the original excuse was that it's old content and the game file size is already bloated."
4198,"I have a bad case of nostalgia.

I remember playing a game telling the story of the fall of mankind. A story telling how the Last City on Earth was taken, how a Godly Machine called the ""Traveler"" was stolen away, and its Guardians inhuman powers gone.

I remember how well this game told the merciless execution of its population by the invaders. But also, how accurately it conveyed the feeling of loss and isolation as it drove you to your self-exile, through breathtaking sights and wonderful music.

I remember it telling the story of a Red War. Of brave heroes fallen from grace and putting their lives on the line to reconquer their Home and drive the enemy away. I remember the struggles, I remember all the hardships. I remember caring for every single character, seeing them strive against all odds. I remember a very much loved Robotic Hunter and his chicken pet Colonel. Fights literally too close to the sun. And one of the most epic conclusions.

This game was Destiny 2. And this game is very long gone...

All that this game used to be upon release is no more: all the content was removed, regardless to if you paid or not. And I did buy this game, and four of its extentions. Twice. Because I loved it so much that playing it only on the PlayStation was not enough and I needed it on my laptop too for when I was away from home. The 96 hours on record Steam shows merely is the tip of the iceberg since I have been accumulating the hours on the console as well as when it was coming via Battle.net

I loved that game and that story so much that I wanted to play through it from scratch with friends, to have them experience the story. Well, that will never happen, since it all got removed. They removed so many things that they were forced to completely redo the beginning, while making it as bland as possible for it not to clash with the fact that story arcs are consistantly being removed at almost every new DLCs release.

Now the game is ""free-to-play"", if you are alright with playing only a few randomly-selected missions once in a while, and if scenario and coherence are nowhere near being your priorities. But to tell you how bad this has gone: the best character (in my opinion) this game ever bore was Cayde-6. And that lovely idiot got himself killed in the expansion named ""Renegade"" which was the fourth, I believe. His death was so tragic, important and table-turning that it gave matter to an entire campaign.
Now, that character is no more. Nor is all the story around his death. And most players who never touched Destiny 2 before that will never even know that he actually ever existed unless if they can find and make sense of some easter eggs here and there.
To think and realize that this could happen with virtually anything in this game's plot...

I strongly recommend against purchasing and playing this game. It does not respect your time, it does not respect your feelings. It does not respect you as a custommer. It does not respect YOU. And I do not care if some hardcore afficionados mention that Bungie are still in their legal rights: it being legal does not make it right.
It is a game full of predatory mechanics and intentionally constantly inducing a Fear Of Missing Out to have you pay and play your life on it just to HOPE not to be left out. But taking even just a little of a break will set you back violently since literally every content is temporary and meant to be deleted at some point. To ""leave the stage to the new"", as they say...

It is a huge shame. The gameplay was one of the best First Person Shooters I experienced. I loved being a mix of a mage and a gunslinger as a Warlock. I loved the setting, the story, the sci-fi... But I HAD to step away. The disappointment was already to heady to bear without adding the constant insult this game throws as salt in the wound as they try to reel you in to pay always more.

If you are looking for a new game, I advise looking the other way. You do not want to get caught in its net. There are so many other good games to play and that will respects you infinitely more than this one.

Maybe if Bungie went back on a lot of their greedy decisions this game would be recommendable and enjoyable again. It could even shine as the best FPS once more...

I sure will keep a spark of hope burried deep inside me. But this only is how greatly and dearly I loved it..."
4199,I DIDNT GET RAID EXOTIC FIRST TRY >:(
4200,cringe
4201,Bungie is actively blocking and banning Linux and Steam Deck users for no reason. Can't give a positive review unless this is changed.
4202,"Definitely a fun game, looking forward to the new content they plan to release"
4203,"a shit hole game
i asked the support why i got banned
i didn't even play the game... only for like 1 hour and i haven't played the game since then.
and they said ""you cheated""... well what a great Anti cheat you have.
"
4204,Enable BattleEye for Linux
4205,Meh its a good turn off your brain shooter. I spent my first dollar 220 hours into the game (I played on other platforms cause of cross-save) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4206,"this game is lit , i hate destiny so much that its my favourite game :))"

The base game, as is, has a lot of different things you can do, and is really enjoyable. There's a bunch of lore and it's a continuation of Destiny 1 which is really nice for those invested in Lore. There's a lot there on terms of story! However, if you plan on playing this game more than just the seasonal campaign and bounties, it can be really annoying due to the amount of DLC's and ""pay walls"" this game has. Especially for the more expensive DLC's such as the Witch Queen. On top of that, buying the seasonal passes and buying silver can be very tempting if you'd like to get some better gear, or something that's more aesthetically pleasing. It can be a grind to get something you like, but the grind can be very enjoyable. I definitely recommend if you have a friend or two to play with. 

Solid game, fun and enjoyable for sure!"
4209,Gud
4210,"UNINSTALL WHILE YOU STILL CAN! this game is crack, once you start you cant get off. This game has pulled me from several family gatherings and holiday gatherings just to farm mediocre loot (sometimes usable if i spare another hour or two) The story is all over the place, but very entertaining and deep with lore if you have the time to watch the cutscenes or read whole novels. (THIS GAME IS FAN-FRICKEN-TASTIC! im just making it sound bad because i have over 2k hours just on pc alone, i highly recommend this to everyone XD)"
4211,p
4212,"very nice with friends, solo is cool I guess"
4213,make your game work on launch.
4214,very good
4215,"Ok, last time I played this was on battle.net (Activision). Now when I installed this on steam my owned DLCs Osiris and Warmind (Season pass) are abandoned and cannot play them. They removed payed DLCs, how can I buy any future DLC from Bungie they lost my trust, when there is possibility that they just abandon those DLCs? I cannot trust to this. Don`t be wrong I like this game it has great visuals and it is lot of fun. But I will rather invest my money to other ""Looter Shooter"" game DLC.

PS: It`s like you buy a Ford ICE car and later Ford comes and they takes your engine bcs they have a new vision and they are going all EV and they left you with basic car but no ICE.  And ZERO compensation for it:)"
4216,i'ts ok
4217,Don't.

4223,"Great music, amazing and immersive campaigns, engaging boss fights and quest lines. Destiny 2 really has it all in store."
4224,no one hates Destiny more than a person who loves Destiny.. AND I LOVE THIS GAME
4225,"Its like being addicted to crystal meth, cocaine, crack, weed and alcohol for 6 years and still being alive after a major overdose. 
Hella addictive. 
Hella expensive. 
Will drain your sanity, money and soul out. 
Worst, yet the best looter shooter I have ever played.



Yet there's one thing that keeps me from recommending this game.

Положительный отзыв не доступен в этом регионе."
4226,"I jumped on for the free weekend or however long it is because I finally wanted to give this game a try. I loved Destiny 1 but hated Activision and Bungie's business practice. I must say that the game play and graphics are impressive. However, upon learning that Bungie has decided to vault the game content I can't in good consciousness recommend this game and I want to warn new players. What the developers have said is that old content will eventually be essentially deleted from the game and you won't be able to play it (even if you've paid for it). I was about to purchase a bunch of the bundles and the Witch Queen dlc's when I say that Bungie was vaulting their content. Dumbest thing I've ever seen in video game history.

So... if you don't care that the developers will eventually lock you out of a game you've paid for... then go for it. Otherwise I highly recommend staying away from this game."
4227,"Man wtf. I played this game back at launch and it was great, nice paced story, leads you into endgame content nicely, etc. Saw the lightfall trailer and was like yo this looks dope lets give destiny another try its been a hot minute. 

Wtf is this game now man.

I go through the tutorial, great start good pace. Then BAM the game just THROWS a million pieces of content at you. vanguards, nightfalls, strikes, gambits, cruible, operations, raids, like just so muchhh. Literally got a full free armor set of like 1540 gear from 1360?? So now I can do like every piece of content in the game except the paid dlc stuff?? Wtf is this progression system man. I can run basically any new and old raid I want? Since when are raids in MMOs that low a bar to entry? And dont even get me started on the story or lack of."
4228,awesome

Game goes hard"
4232,Good Game
4233,"Although sadly you cant access the original ""the red war"" campaign from back when this game was paid it still is really fun and an overall visually pleasant game :) 7/10"
4234,"This game has awesome unique ideas to make multiplayer fun and even grinding can be super fun. One of the main hunting grounds has infinite enemies arriving on ships every few minutes, you can have a blast for a long time in any zone.

4252,"Skipped Witch Queen and took a long break from the game (much needed after grinding seasons) Came back very recent with Witch Queen being free to play this week. Must say i enjoyed this expansion, gave me Taken King vibes and i loved it. Destiny also felt good to me again might have been due to the 8 month long break i took. for new players i just jump into it for free of course, try it out see how you like it, learn it. sure Destiny has it's issues but what mmo type game doesn't. A lot of games that is social based and open world has issues but you can still have fun with it."

4273,"Bruh this games got bug furries but you have to play as boring human, weird human, or robot even though the games story has bug furries. I will change my rating to a upvote when i can play as a bug furry that they have in this game."
4274,"It is an unending void of which the sunk cost fallacy will no longer allow me to stop.

I lied, It is not just the sunk cost fallacy DMG04 Is holding my Testicle hostage, Even after 250 Dares of eternity completions I have not received the roll of Pardon our Dust I have been hoping for 67 This season and only one red border"
4275,A lot
4276,I might be an addict.
4277,This game is super fun with lots of free to play content. In just a around 30 hours i was able to get really far. And if you you go to helm you can get some free loot from bungie to help you with the kings fall raid which is out right now.
4278,"Probably one of the best open world games you can play. It has adventure, an easy to follow grind, and fun modes and activities to do."
4279,Was my childhood and  even though it's just a demo it's still a game I can put a lot of hours in.
4280,"Lets be honest nothing has been getting you that seratonin anymore you may as well try everything,"

4301,It's a pretty good game.
4302,very nice
4303,I FUCKING LOVE RECYCLED CONTENT
4304,Babaoey
4305,This game used to be a ton of fun but the studio has ruined it. Greedy money-grubbing business practices that lock tons of content behind overpriced expansions that add hardly anything to the content cycle. They sunset weapons and god only knows why. I can't use most of my purple revolvers anymore which to me where the most fun to use but now their light limit is capped. Why disable guns from being relevant but still allow you to use them? pvp? Some people don't play this game for pvp. Why can't I use the weapons i love in pve content? The new weapons feel like hot garbage to play with. I'm glad they did a free week for the dlc so I can be confident in never giving this title or this studio another dime.
4306,1
4307,like starwars but gun
4308,Its an amazing game.
4309,It's terrible to get into if you are a new player.
4310,A good game with a low floor and high ceiling
4311,good
4312,"Overall I love this game, as it blends many aspects together into a perfect mesh. There are PvP, PvE, and PvPvE modes. (PvPvE is a mix of both) The story is great once you understand it. (I recommend watching My Name Is Byf on YouTube, he helped me understand it with his videos,) The DLCs are very good, Beyond Light and Lightfall adding Darkness powers to opposite the Light powers we normally have, while The Witch Queen delivers a web of lies and mysteries, spun by Savathuun, The Witch Queen. Shadowkeep is a good DLC to start on as it's a shorter, simpler one. The weapons are amazing, and are not limited to guns. There are glaives, and bows, and swords as well. While many subclasses add to your power with designing a correlation of aspects and fragments to apply new effects to your abilities and change the fight slightly, or drastically. Sadly, with so much content being added yearly, the developers had removed some of the first campaigns and raids to prevent the game from being to large. The DLCs are worth it in my opinion but I recommend buying them on sale, as they are not going to remove anymore expansions thanks to a new announcement from the devs.

Did Bungie delete the files for the previous story missions? Why is there no way of getting that content back? Ridiculous. I'm so confused as to wth is going on in the game. Even with the announcement of no more sunsetting, so much damage has been done. Idk if I'll be able to get back into this game with so much story lost (I'm a story gamer). I'd rather not sit through 4 hrs of YT videos on a game I *plan* to play. It shouldn't have to be a prerequisite. I want to watch 4 hrs of videos because I already love the game, but now that's not possible."
4332,super good just watch out for the cross save content because they have issue with licensed
4333,"Destiny 2 has fast and fluid gameplay, a fun weapons sandbox, enthralling and thematic music, and absolutely stunning graphics and lighting.

But at the end of the day, this game is a glorified soap opera in space that serves piecemeal content behind countless paywalls. The game simply does not value your time."

4346,"Game sucks pay to win as ♥♥♥♥, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
4347,"i hate this game, great game."
4348,"First attempt with Destiny was D2 - Beyond Light.
Was going to be 3 of us, never could sync with times.  
Collapsed weeks later.

Best friend and I are talking, brings up how he is about to dive back into D2 Witch Queen.  Said oddly enough, we have not gamed since original WoW.  Lets do it.

Pre-order Witch Queen, get our play times sorted.  Absolute blast.  350 hours and I would say easily 260 of those hours are with my friend.  

Remember this is a live service game.  Due to our jobs we knew Raids/End game would not be likely.  So we set the game down knowing we have every intention to come back a few months later.  Fast forward now as we begin to prep for the release of light forge.  

From a hardcore gamer now turned boomer, the pros and cons
PROs
Beautiful graphics
Cross play is smooth in terms of game play.
Engaging and challenging content for those of us who only play casual in terms of limited time, not difficulty.
Truly shines with a duo at the very least

CONS
PVP, while I loathe it with every fiber, just maddening especially because you know there is fun to be had if they could only get the formula right of map making, balance, of classes, balance of skills in match making

Summary:   Give it a try, and while the free version has good intentions, you really are playing a demo/ultra lite version of the game.  Have zero regrets of any transactions I have put towards this game."
4349,SHOOT THE APES
4350,"Take my money, make it free, then start working on the game... Fuck you"
4351,I put a unholy amount of time in destiny 1 on my ps3 when i was younger. I then got this game when it came out on my ps4 and payed it so much i got dumped for not spending enough time with my ex at the time. i recently picked it back up on my pc and i fell in love all over again. 10/10 if you like mmo games get this one!
4352,Is just a worse version of garry modification star man roleplay
4353,muy bueno
4354,Vacuuming my room was faster and more enjoyable then the missions in this game.
4355,"The game is amazing in most aspects, except monetization. The gameplay is really fun and challenging, the graphics look really good, the story is interesting and evolving. My only problem is the monetization, the new DLCs are expensives, and when they get older, they are mostly useless; if you don't have the season pass, you can't play the new gamemodes they release every season, which means, you will get behind the meta, making PvP impossible."

This mfks have peaked in profit each time releasing a new dlc forcing you to the point of purchase just to continue playing for new content.

The game itself is enjoyable but you have to keep hold a hold of your wallet and start saying to yourself, its not that much fun to sacrifice this amount of money.

I have to resort to the rocket launcher mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with a cluster bomb, ""Tally ho, lads"" the missile shreds two dregs in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off sparrow alarms.

4371,epic
4372,I played prior to this game becoming free to play and there was a good amount of content removed but really won't really be missed all that much. I feel the improvements they have made to this game and the amount of content you do get for free is quite generous. This is definitely a game you play with your friends or with a large clan because the experience alone is crazy.
4373,Awesome getaway and immersive when you want storyline.  Amazing game to play with a close set of freinds.
4374,good raids mid seasons
4375,I HATE THIS FIUCKING GAME IT WAONT LET ME PLAY WITH MY FRENDS
4376,"1500+ hours, i dont play this"
4377,"It's a good game but it hits all the wrong notes concerning a couple of important topics.

The F2P part, while there, feels more like an extended Demo of the game, it's not a true free to play experience that lets you experience the full game through grind.
You need various DLC to access campaigns and additional content, and a season pass for accessing seasonal content which runs on a 4 seasons of 3 months cycle. Seasons are more bitesized but offer good content for the money.
Last year, you also needed to either upgrade to the Addon's Deluxe Edition or purchase a Dungeon Pass ingame, as well as purchase a 30th anniversary pack with a rather steep price tag for its contents in order to be able to play EVERYTHING. I'm going so far as to say that both of these moves are ripoffs.
While the game's campaigns are all quite enjoyable if a bit formularic, the gameplay cycle being fun for the most part, there was a drama with sunsetting weapons that emptied about half my vault of valuable loot (it won't happen again according to Bungie as they announced no further sunsetting in D2's life cycle, but it leaves a very sour note to disrespect the player's time to this amount).
There's also no ingame LFG, repetition and grind present, and you'll be dropped in with little to no explanation about game systems, mechanic, story or reason at all if you're new, if you still decide to get the game.
Don't say you haven't been warned."
4378,Its like being addicted to crack
4379,great game
4380,i love
4381,bg
4382,"After 2 days of trying out the witch queen missions for free I quickly realized why I left. The servers are still trash, wasn't holding out hope Sony was ever gonna help fix that.  I absolutely loved spending an hour and some change to get the hive worm exotic launcher then upon completion waiting on dialogue to acknowledge my completion the servers crashed. I got the exotic but received no  completion credit (I guess thats great in a sense) still annoyed. 

Witch Queen is by far my least favorite expansion like the Warlords of Draenor equivalent. All I'm doing is lazy ass puzzles like its a half-ass homage to zelda or something. I've been pondering getting deluxe to try and enjoy the new season and holding out hope friends may come back to join because thats honestly the only place this game shines. We're in a severe gaming drought right now last I played was a few days before Xm-ass then I went back to WoW for a few months then quit again for the same reasons, will probably return to check out dragonflight. Both terrible options wont even sugarcoat it but they provide the downtime needed to decompress and do some mindless killing/fetch quests in order to maintain a semblance of sanity. I'll more than likely return to my backlog of single player games to round out and distance myself once more. Still sad I missed the spooky season (Epialos Following) ornament set looked really cool but oh well.

TLDR: If you're new to franchise dont bother. If you are returning remember this joke ""What do you tell a woman with 2 black eyes?.... Nothing you already havent told her twice"". 

Destiny much like WoW is a very very abusive/toxic relationship you keep coming back to thinking things will be different but they never are.
 
Enter at your own peril.
Eyes up Guardian."
4383,Love the game. its great for any type of player.
4384,+
4385,"Are you a new player?

Unless you have a friend who can literally handhold you through every single mechanic and piece of content in the game. Then don't even bother.

The new player experience is the absolute worst of any game I've played. It starts you in a forced story ""tutorial"" that isn't actually a tutorial and then dumps you out in hub world because the original content it starts you on just doesn't exist anymore."
4386,"i like destiny its quite good u know







addictionm help me

:("
4387,","
4388,"I like that the development team continues to update the game in a way that makes it feel new. The art/graphics style are beautiful. The only thing this game really has a hard time with is the balancing of PvP (especially with the new subclass re-works), and the way the game groups teams together for matches in PvP. Besides that, this game is fun to play solo, even better co-op, and the story is always building on itself"
4389,Ohh I love spending over 100's of dollar's for dlc on each platform!! But fr tho this game is addictive
4390,"It's fun if you played Destiny One in the day or tried Destiny 2 and quit. Otherwise starting new, trying to catch up, do all the activities becomes too time consuming. The game represents the ultimate definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over expecting different outcomes. Conveniently referred to as the grind and it's very, very real."
4391,"It's got its flaws but the gameplay and movement are so good it's kindoff addicting, the loot reward cycle is great and the dungeons and raids are some of the best content i´ve played in any game, the new player onboarding is pretty rough tho so i recommend to start playing with someone who knows the ropes."
4392,its a bad game
4393,"belt
"
4394,"It took them 2 years to fix their mistake and instead of apologizing they try to peddle a new DLC. Good job Destiny. You sunset not just my favorite weapons and gear, but my desire to ever touch this game again."
4395,"Much like War Thunder, this game will soon devour many more hours of my life. I fear Zavala has already taken my soul. 10/10 game"
4396,"1. gameplay 8/10

2. graphic 9/10 (even in 2022)

3. story 6/10 (it has a good story sadly cant play the old campaign)"
4397,Why am I locked to Cerberus half the time? Perhaps Bungie should fix that.
4398,"dont play bad game, fuck you"
4399,Lorentz Driver best sound design ever
4400,"   I didn't like the fact that the Bungie removed expansions, Now players have no idea what happen at the start of the game.
I quit playing the game because it felt like I was getting better gear easily and there was less grinding, and I don't like having buy the next expansion every time just for the exotic weapons/gear, to the new raids and strikes, and the other stuff that's lock in a expansion. That's all I have to say about this game."
4401,"From the moment i played, ive been hooked. unfortunatly,  over the years it just seems bungie has run out of ideas. they just recycle things from archive; weapons, raids, ect. It's still a fun game though. Especially when you have a good group of people to play with."
4402,this game is not fun and costs way to much money. would not recommend it to a soul. PvP is stale and PvE is repetitive
4403,"Dont believe my mere 126 hours on Steam, Ive played since before this game was on Steam, taken lots of breaks but after looking at the time played on Battle.net and here on steam combined I have 525 hours. I love this game. Ive been addicted since it came out even with the first two DLCs being complete garbage, Im damn glad i stuck with it and happy to be returning."
4404,"good game, hard to get into though. Use youtube videos and stuff or have friends that play it and can sherpa you or give tips"
4405,pricing is very questionable but overall it's ok.
4406,yes

4408,game gud
4409,"Generic gameplay.
Generic story.
Less grindy than Warframe but also with less content.
Played it with two IRL friends and was still bored.

Overall, an extremely underwhelming experience."

4416,Started as a joke now i am addicted
4417,Great way to spend the time you don't have :)
4418,"This is the best game in its category. It surely has its flaws but overall good gameplay, amazing story and the overall look of the game is really good"
4419,amazing
4420,This game amazing but i wish it worked with vr
4421,its fucking awesome
4422,i hate this game
4423,been playing since Destiny 1 alpha on my ps4 way back... I still to this day can not put this thing down... love it!

4426,It's a great game. Just play it.

4429,"BEST GAME EVER DID YOU KNOW FORTNITE IS DOING A 
THING WITH THEM"
4430,"This game has a vice grip on my psyche, it is exactly the sort of game I want, an FPS MMO. I enjoy my time playing it but have shied away from the more recent DLCs (until now) due to the large upfront cost that they expect from you each year. I understand that its the same model (in a way) that WoW uses but I would appreciate if Bungie were less opaque about what expansion gives what. The fact that you need the deluxe edition to play the 2 new dungeons is frankly unacceptable. either sell the full amount of playable content in one package or none at all.

at this time I cannot reccomend the game to newcomers on principal, if you played in the first 2 years and are coming back then its a frustration but not gameplay inhibiting (as long as you buy the deluxe version of course) , but if you are a new player I would stay away from this game until the company is more transparent."
4431,LOTS OF STUFF TO DO

4440,"The most greediest game ever, the base (very very limited edition) is cool and all, you can play it for free but your gonna be gated from so much content your either going to break down and buy it or never touch it again, the amount of money it takes to avoid content walls is insane, at the time of this review it costs 122 dollars to get caught up and thats with a 33% discount, not including if you dont buy the season passes you wont get access to the full expansion... you know... the expansion you just spent 60 dollars on. To keep up with content im sure isnt really that bad, but for new players, or to people who are begging there friends to join, this price is such a hard sell. 60 bucks is hard enough to get your friends to buy in let alone 120-200 dollars. The devs need to box all old content with the new content just like any other expansion/service based games do it. Not make people pay for each expansion individualy just for it to be vaulted in the coming months. Get your **** together bungie!"

4467,good game
4468,Can cost ya money but great game to waist time on
4469,fast paced and new content every few months. My 84 year old father and I play  just about every day together. Having a great clan (Black Fire Clan) makes the game all the more enjoyable

4475,"Still cant figure out why theres 2 of these games. Destiny 1 should have never ended and this joke of a game should have been dlc. 10 years of destiny my ass, it only lasted 3 years before they made another and abandoned the first. Fun game but destiny 3 could be announced tomorrow and all the progress you've made will mean nothing. TLDR: Bungie treats this mmo like its a halo game."
4476,"very good
"
4477,컨텐츠가 없는 쓰레기겜
4478,"This game used to be cool but now it's not. I played it tons back in the day when it was still 'paid'. I didn't realize until today, that Bungie removed a bunch of content such as Red War. 

Not only that I start it up to play, and I run into an issue where on every single planet, all the enemies are 'immune' to my weapons. No idea how to fix it or what the issue is. I'd say it's Light level, but the game doesn't give any explanation of what might the problem be, and when I played a month ago, it wasn't a problem and now suddenly it is... And if it is Light level, I don't have any equipment that's a higher level. I just started replaying recently.
Now I need to what, solve bugs to play a damn game? All I want to do is relax and play a stupid video game for a bit and now it's a project, and regardless of what the issue may be I have zero interest in sleuthing it. I want to shoot aliens, not problem solve.

The new expansion announced peaked my interest but dealing with this crap, as well as the knowledge they removed a bunch of content has killed any interest I had. I'll go play video games that work properly on start-up and don't have content removed."
4479,only thing the devs are good at is PvE. They literally need to remove PvP from the game if they are just gonna leave it as is. Actual braindead game for braindead idiots
4480,Have been playing since the Destiny 1 beta!
4481,cool
4482,"oh yeah!

4483,good luck
4484,game yes
4485,great for all
4486,very good
4487,Minus paying money all t he time the games fun
4488,"The game overall isn't terrible in design or features I guess. The problem is that it is repetitive and boring. They release a new expansion and I keep paying for the same fucking game over and over. I bought it once, don't make me pay $60 again for some half ass added on story that essentially is the same style game again. I do a mission, all things go to shit, I have to save the world. It's boring. Do something new."
4489,Thanks for taking away content that I paid for <3
4490,100
4491,"This game is truly a toxic bitch. Time and time again I will say ""fuck this game"" yet here I am having 800+ hrs and a 1k on PS. But hey Its a fun game that will make u spend so much money haha..."
4492,"Destiny 1 took over my life for a long time. I know for a fact that Destiny 2 will as well since I just started playing again. I've already warned my family that they may not see me for months as I will be deployed on missions and quests, defeating enemies to keep our home safe. They gave me tearful goodbyes and have made wishes for my safe return. Go forward Guardians."
4493,haha grind go burrrrr
4494,i hate this game
4495,l
4496,nice
4497,Orxy back :) me happy
4498,"Good Time
"
4499,"I love how this game can combine single player story games and huge multiplayer FPS games seamlesly. The game only gets more complicated and immersive once you get to know the game more. You can embark on an epic quest to defeat the witch using the powers of chaos and darkness alone or with friends, or do all kinds of PVP on crucible. If you don't like either of the mentioned options then players can just perform raid strikes, figuring out how best to use their wepeans and classes for every situation called for"
4500,It is confirmed. I hate this game... but it is my favourite.
4501,Desney wants your money in exchange for fun
4502,"Not useable if you want to move to LINUX OS.
At least other game developers are allowing compatibility with steam proton.
Will not be spending more money with them."
4503,It's pretty good
4504,not bad

4518,super fun
4519,good
4520,"Gunplay is top-notch, feels good just to shoot. Very grindy, but it's an MMO so it's par for the course. Story is compelling and dungeons and raids are amazing are very fun (except for that one encounter in Garden). It's very hard to get into the game; new players will have a lot of trouble getting in because there's hardly anything to accommodate them. Veteran players need to guide them or else there's a high chance of them giving up on the game before they even began. There's issues, but personally, the pros outweigh the cons. Hated the game at first, love it now."

4528,"Since beyond light I have been apart of this concoction of friendly and hostile game, loving every moment. The feeling of achievement that you feel when you complete the difficult, it becomes an almost high. Hopefully you as well can enjoy in what we call Destiny 2"
4529,dont get pulled in its a trap and you only have a short time before your forever trapped by the grind get out while you can
4530,Game brings back memories
4531,Good
4532,da gun go boom boom
4533,It be like a game and stuff. Some guns and explosions and all that. Pretty neat
4534,I have been around since destiny 1 this series has always brought me back for more and helped me make more friends!
4535,"After playing thousands of hours on battle.net, I can’t recommend this game. I got so addicted to it that the only way out was to get perma ban. I tried uninstalling it, but the next day I’d just download it again and restart the cycle all over. I’ve been a gamer my whole life but this was the first time I actually got addicted to a game in an unhealthy way. Funny enough, I only installed ReShade and Cheat Engine and got banned in a matter of seconds as soon as I logged in, while hackers would use aimbot and wallhack everytime I was on PvP and nothing happened to them, so there’s something I won’t miss."
4536,"good game , too many DLC.s"
4537,sure
4538,"The more you put in, the more you get from it. Love it!"
4539,"This game is very addictive. I've been suck with Bungie since Destiny and I keep buying the most expensive versions of expansions. 

Absolutely fantastic game. 10/10"
4540,i hate that i love this game
4541,"dumpster fire, generator powered servers ran in a favela. hope that bitch explodes and burns these dogshit servers and every single last line of code of this game to ash and it never comes back"
4542,'s a good game
4543,good
4544,"4 loading screens and 6 popups before i was even allowed to pick my character

edit, logged in and my bungie name was force changed because my steam name says retard, incredible game

game already crashed before I could start playing"
4545,good game
4546,"very fun game to play with your friends and it has a lot of content every week for real i like the raids and stuff in this game because if you want to beat a raid or dungeons you must have friends and fireteam its not just shot to loot game it is DESTINY 
"
4547,Love this game
4548,I come from a heavy Halo background and this game blew me away with how much content there is. Not to mention that Bungie listens to its community and provides great updates. Would recommend to anybody.
4549,"You just can't put it down. I don't play games at all, and if you look at my profile you will see that. But this game has deep hooks in me as Halo fanboy. The combat loop if you are preferable to it is comparable to none in a good way. Story is meh but it doesn't matter because the presentation of the dungeons, raids, and bosses are on point. I have 300 guns in my vault, I have used them all at least once along the way and that doesn't include my exotic armors and variant roles on duplicate weapons, and even now I still find new weapons all the time. Stay away if you value your marriage or social life."
4550,"""IT SUCKS PLAYING THIS SHIT AND I'M FUCKING ADDICTED SO I CAN'T QUIT!""

-Tyler1"
4551,"Constantly kicked no matter what. I have pretty good internet. Servers are CONSTANTLY down. All error codes. Weasel, baboon, cat when theres no update. Or just Destiny 2 Servers not available. Fuck this game. Fuck Bungie."
4552,qw
4553,its okay
4554,Thousands of hours and still love this game and the friends I've made along the way.
4555,"Fun, lots to do"
4556,AWESOME GAME LOVE I
4557,the games fun but if you haven't been playing the game consistently since it came out you'll have no clue whats going on in the story
4558,GUNS
4559,the game it self is amazing! you get to meet new people that are excellent and i highly recommend this game 10 out 10
4560,"It's got great gunplay and platforming/parkour mechanics. You can also be viable in both single player and multiplayer even when using a gamepad (it provides just the right amount of bullet magnetism or aim assist to make aiming with a gamepad possible, without completely taking over the aiming controls.) 

Unfortunately, I can only recommend spending money on this if you plan to play the game actively. Destiny 2 leans heavily on [i]the Fear of Missing Out[/i]. If you are not actively playing and tend to take long breaks from the game, the things that  you spent money on might be gone by the time you come back (such as maps and quests) or they may still be there but are already made obsolete by newer content (gear and weapons).

It's also difficult to keep up if you take long breaks, as story content can disappear with no way to replay them. You need to resort to wikis and youtube videos just to brush up on where things stand and where your character is. I've actually bought all the current DLCs prior to Lightfall and at least several season passes but took a long break, and now it's a bit of a mess trying to get back, not when there are other games out there to play. It's a shame, the lore is so dense and interesting that it would be worth purchasing all the DLCs and season passes if this was a standard single player experience (with MP tacked on, of course) instead of a live service game with contantly ""Evolving"" content. I put the word ""evolving"" in quotes because the word taken at face value sounds like a positive. But in this case, it's an excuse for the devs to use FOMO as a way of milking the userbase for as much and as long as possible."
4561,I hate this game. 10/10 Thanks Bungie
4562,Just play
4563,I have a love hate relationship with this game to be honest. It's easily one of the best fps experiences available still and I have countless hours sunk on multiple platforms but the devs regularly go on a cycle of releasing amazing content and then some meh stuff after. Realistically I don't think they could only put out amazing content but it makes it hard to recommend to people on a long term basis. It get slowly better over time hopefully they figure out how sunsetting stuff is actually going to work because they go back and forth but there's so much good story content that is just unavailable to people right now and that's the stuff I would want to run a new player through to get into the game and learn the story while leveling up naturally. the way it is currently long term players can remember the stuff they love while they get new content and new players are left hearing stories of how cool stuff was while enjoying the new content but maybe without any context as to why anything is happening.
4564,They added the blue guy from fortnite. POGGERs!!!
4565,it is pretty cha cha smooth
4566,"minor hiccup with an early mission, but otherwise is a great game"
4567,Needs steamdeck compatibility
4568,Great game brings back a lot of memories (second buy) had it on the PS4
4569,"YES HOWARD HAMLIN DIES!!!!! he gets shot in the head by lalo
 NACHO AND LALO DIE IN BETTER CALL SAUL
SAUL ALSO GOES TO PRISON IN THE END LOL."
4570,its a great game to meet friends and to just have fun
4571,"A whole franchise built on ""Look!  Aliens!""   Pew-pew.

Meh.... 6/10"
4572,fun
4573,"Bungie just continues to knock it out of the park. The game is great for new players but, in my opinion, equally as great for a veteran player from D1 like myself. From the way bungie shows love to the community to how the story has developed over the years is just amazing in my opinion."
4574,Content vault lol
4575,after getting back into the game after 2 years or so... BUNGIE I KNEEL
4576,Fantastic game
4577,This game is a very solid and well rounded game. its a game of skill and not a pay to win games. it doesnt matter what level you are it matters how good you are. I wouldnt recommend this game for power based game players.
4578,"This game is like heroin. Just when I thought that I had kicked the habit, I relapse, and purchase every DLC that I have missed over my year and a half hiatus. However, when I return, it is absolute bliss. I am here for my yearly fix. I need it. I need it..."
4579,Best game of its type. Massive content with extremely low cost/content ratio.
4580,Good game :)
4581,rad game
4582,No.
4583,I sold my soul to this game.
4584,mid game
4585,good play it
4586,This is my least favorite game i love it.
4587,AMAZING
4588,"Been playing off-and-on since Destiny 1 across console and PC. Many, many hours spent collecting loot, tweaking skills and builds, shooting things with friends. PvP is amazing if you give it a chance and don't try to be too rigid. Still coming back to it this day for more and impressed by the sheer quality of the game.
It's okay I guess. You should probably try it. I mean, it's free so why not take that first hit."
4589,
4590,A love hate relationship...
4591,"Fun game, definitely some problems with replayability the farther and more hours you sink in but overall a fun game as long as you dont touch pvp"
4592,Bungie has lost there creativity they like to just reskin old stuff .And when there is a quest to do ya just go in the same area over and over and over again very annoying and monotonous . Definitely don't buy not worth your money .
4593,"Yes
"
4594,"I will say coming from someone who hated destiny and thought it was ""stupid"" i was completely wrong. i havent had this game very long and ill probably hit 1000 hours of play time before owing for a year. its so easy to get lost in time doing fun task, even buying DLC's"
4595,nicee
4596,"imagine Doom, warframe, Horizen zero dawn and forbbiden west, and a wee bit f zelda mixed into a game yet having a entire different game all in one."
4597,its okay
4598,good
4599,"Do not buy this game. Bungie will take your money for content and then just a few years will take that same content away for ""space-saving"" reasons. Fuck you, Bungie. I paid $100 dollars for your shitty collector's edition back in 2017 and more than $150 for the DLC that came after and now you want to take everything that I loved when the game released away? Fuck. You. I haven't done shit on this game (compared to my combined 2000 hours from Destiny 1 and 2 on Blizzard) since this game came to steam because you greedy fuckers have ruined it. Maybe I'll play again when you give me back the Leviathan raids."
4600,Destiny 2 Is a Grindy Game But Boy Is It Fun! You Want To Punch a Room of 90000 Enemies? Be a Titan! Want to be a Witch and Use Mage Like Magic? Be a Warlock! Want to be a Robin Hood meets Fox Like Thief? Be a Hunter! God I May Scream and Say F**K This Game I Quite! But You Can Never Quite Destiny 2 . . .

4612,GOOD
4613,AWESOME !!!!
4614,"i liked it best when it first came out 
"
4615,its a verry interactive fps game which takes alot of skill and thinking for lodout and ammunation conservation
4616,yes
4617,"In order to get the full destiny experience you need a couple things. Its extremely hard to keep busy without a DLC, which sucks but it's a reality. If you have friends to play with you can do raids, which is a big part of destiny, but if you don't you can solo dungeons and do campaigns or PvP no problem. However, the experience is more fun with friends. Destiny is a major grind if you're looking to have the most OP build for PvP or PvE. If you're willing to put time and money into the game, then it's a great experience and worth the money. The recent update to multiple aspects of the game has made it so much easier to navigate and more enjoyable. If you're interested in playing now is a great time to start, the Witch Queen is on sale and there's new content available in a couple of months. I have a love hate relationship with destiny, I stop playing for a couple months then I'm drawn back in by sales or offers. I do feel detached from the game when I don't play due to my limited budget, but I love destiny and the effort they're making for future DLCs and content."
4618,"its a fun game, has its moments thats forsure but like all games they can have those. For the best experience having friends makes it a lot more enjoyable but not everyone has those, so looking for a good clan to suit your needs will help!"
4619,very guud game
4620,shits fun
4621,Don't play if you love your significant other.
4622,Do not download this game you will only sit in the log in screen and keep getting booted back to the main screen or stay looped indefinitely. Epic fall guys no computer or connections issues on my end. They just do not want to buy new servers when player base drops so instead of just providing more servers and room they just throttle log in so way to go giving us a huge dumpster fire when it come to stable connectivity. i wont be back till they fix this.

4671,"Lots of fun to play with ample ways to upgrade your gear without having to pay. Enjoy with friends, enemies, or the lonesome company of your own presence. Play at the risk of your own fleeting time because this game pairs with adhd like wine and married mothers. I have enjoyed it."
4672,"POG game, nothing else to add besides that we need anime outfits please"
4673,"The core of this game is awesome. The problem is Bungle. they use fear of missing out as their platform. there is no longer any value in this game its just a repeated time gated grind. new DLC? just another edition of time gated grind. this game could be so incredible if they'd just stop ""adding"" to it. It's an abomination at this point just like destiny 1 when everyone stopped playing it. Feel free to enjoy the game just remember when you get to the end that any grind you do will be made worthless in 6 months when they release the next grind and that one worthless 6 months after that. I'll miss you destiny, but not that much..."

4675,awsome
4676,amazing game
4677,"This game is pog, although a decent ammount of the campaign is gone *like forsaken and red war*

main dlc's you wanna get is Beyond Light and Witch Queen :)"

4679,good
4680,gud game
4681,"great game 
keep up the good work"
4682,"its a great game. free to play? No, free to download thats really about it. every thing else just to play missions and so forth you have to buy the addons and bundles  etc. dont mark something as free to play with that isnt fully true."
4683,best game for smart players
4684,Stop removing content I paid for
4685,"Destiny is back! Great new content and most importantly, no content droughts. Sony's acquisition of Bungie seems to have given new life into the development process and they have a new roadmap defined up to 2025. Anyone who loved Destiny but always thought it needed a little more, I can now say the time is to get back into one of the greatest Sci-Fi shooters ever made."
4686,The game reminds me way to much of destiny 1 like the start mission its basically the exact same one or is the exact same and after the that theres the crashed plane sight which is also very similiar and i dont know why they changed the first mission a while ago when the game first came out the mission used to be way different but after all its still a good game
4687,"its a teribble game

4702,"Such an amazing experience, I think about it all the time"
4703,"This game has had a lot of ups and downs from lack of content and reused content along side with micro-transactions, but after the past year there has been so many exciting features that have been added to make this game as great as Destiny 1.  It's not quite at the level of Destiny 1 but it is getting their, with the release of Witch Queen this game has gotten so much better and with the future release of Lightfall It will be 10x better than what it is right now."

4736,"Great game, amazing experience, smooth gameplay, great co-op experience.
But absolute horrible management of content, straight up removal of content, constant need to stay up to date, need to buy dlc itself to keep up with relevant content cause the old stuff goes away, poor experience for someone new to even come in and list goes on and one.
One of the games which I absolutely love and hate at the same time."
4737,i cant believe this is my all time favorite game. i love it to death but it sucks!

4746,"Great game 
BUT horrible and greedy Developers
They even make you pay for an anniversary bundle, what a joke of a company!
Even RockstarGames gives things away for free and allows for the game to be played without spending money.
"
4747,"I put more than 1400 hours into this game and I loved every minute of it. But BUNGIE is a ruthless bunch of morons. They out of nowhere decided to vault like 90% of the game's content including gear people went through hell and back to get their hands on.

Afterwards their was nothing much left to do, guess they just wanted to force people to buy their DLCs. Shame.

Could have been a great game, but BUNGIE ruined it with their business strategies."
4748,"F2P Destiny 2 is basically a demo of itself, back when it was on Battle.net.

The challenging fights and gun-play are the only redeeming features left, they stripped away everything else. Can't even take a break from D2, cause once you're back, all your gear will have become useless, guess they need to do something to keep the grind going.

Can't possibly recommend a hollow game that requires DLC to enjoy."

4756,yo mama
4757,"This game is awesome and horrible at the same time. Great graphics, gunplay and weapons, the moment to moment pve action is fun as heck.

i played this game on ps4 when it released but after a year or so i stopped. a couple of years later and i began playing on pc, and this is the horrible part. they removed so much content (from DLC that people payed for) that it feels like jumping into a novel halfway through. i have no idea whats going on or what to do so the game is basically reduced to just pvp matches and doing strikes. i feel like i have no purpose or goal in the game."
4758,"I have been playing this game for 8 years, between D1 and D2 and all the expansions. It's still my number 1 game to play. Beyond the graphics and the smooth controls the game is just fun to play with tons of things to do and loot to grab. If you like looter FPS this is the game, PERIOD. Enjoy."
4759,I am but a slave to Bungie
4760,great
4761,Yes

4763,hot
4764,"This game is truly a work of art in my opinion, I feel like the campaign could use some work but chilling with your friends doing some gambits is incredibly fun, but this is also the only game that I enjoy playing by myself. I would never go and play minecraft by myself, or roblox, or any other game. If my friends aren't available, who cares, I'd still hop on destiny 2. This game is truly amazing. I'm grateful that it's free"
4765,"great game, but very not free to play friendly. I would definitely be willing to give a bad review for the not free to play friendly thing, but why don't I you ask? Because till the 29th of August as im writing this review, they
have made every expansion free to play! You can play all the way up from Destiny 2 Shadowkeep to Destiny 2 The Witch Queen! Definitely get and try out this game till the 29th!"
4766,"yes
"
4767,best mmofps
4768,"With the 'free dlc' promo I re-downloaded this game to try it out again. While the new content looks good, ALL of the legendary items i worked so hard for are now classified as ""legacy items"" and apparently cannot be upgraded, even though i am running the very same character that ground for hours to obtain said items. Not sure why i am surprised, its the same company that shut off destiny to make a new, but basically the same game. Now they change the levels and make you basically start over... not even sure i can get my legendary items again, since i already got them one time, and even if i do, its unlikely they would have the same procs again.  So could i start over AGAIN ? possibly, but with the uncertainty of wheather i can get items i already earned one time that suddenly the devs decide for no apparent reason to make useless added to the probabilty that they might just decide to ""upgrade"" again and make all the new stuff obsolete AGAIN. I would recommend skipping this one."
4769,"yes, I do look like a person who would sell their newborns to bungo for funny yellow guns"
4770,"game is a 5/10
the DLCs are EXTREMELY overpriced but you are forced to buy them if you want to see the endgame and the community is supertoxic.

just stay away from this sh*tshow"
4771,"I can't keep spending more money on this game, I- I just can't"
4772,Dont get it its a trap you can never leave someone help me
4773,"game is good for the first 2 mins until u have to buy the compain and everything else just to keep playing like make it all free

4775,STAY AWAY
4776,"If you played the first game then you've played this game. My biggest issue is the story and maybe that's because I'm a free2play player. I'm constantly trying to figure out what is going on as there doesn't seem to really be a narrative.

That being said, gameplay is solid and it is fun when teaming up with friends."
4777,"574 hrs on steam ; 460hrs on Battle net. Its a dream game for me , got all the things I like - sci-fi, fps , mmo rpg.
Destiny gunplay should be experienced atleast once, it is really fluid. Tons of activities to do. 
[b] If anyone wants to start playing this I would suggest playing it with friends , who are new or have already been playing this game. You can also try finding a clan , the community is really welcoming. [/b]"
4778,"steam: ""would you like to recommend this game?""
me: ""INDEED""
"
4779,very good game but it has an inconsistent difficulty and not a friendly game to solo players for example some main bosses like savathun are easy solo then you can spend days trying to do a quest for an exotic you wont use like vox obscura for example. End game kinda ruins the game too only being able to get better gear through weeklys so you basically get one day a week where you might improve your gear then you just gotta wait till next week and hope you get better drops. its also a pay to play.
4780,not free to play at all
4781,"beautiful graphic game with good story and plenty to do!!!!
"
4782,good game yes
4783,dont do it
4784,"amazing game
"
4785,perfect
4786,Took a long break. Came back and was like fuck this. To damn many dlc's. Cost way to damn much. I can buy tons of good games with the price it would cost me for all the dlc's I missed. Have around 700 hours on xbox. So I bought it on here so my kid could have my old account. Seen the dlc's and said hell no. Fuck you Bungie you money hungry pos.
4787,(WARNING)This is not a game. Its a black hole!
4788,"Destiny has become a second home for me. It has become something that in the past I could have never imagined. Lets face it, life is difficult and although times aren't easy, it's great to have something like Destiny to fall back on. Is it perfect? No. But the game, the community, the story and so much more allows you to immerse yourself within this fictional world. You will get burnt out, you will feel like there is nothing to do. But no matter how many times you feel like quitting. Something brings you back and you feel more engaged than you did before. 

For new lights, if you can get the hang on the game and understand the beginning few hours. You'll love it. Also (shameless plug) if you need help, want to join a clan that engages in helping new comers, or just need that beginning push. Add me. TheMuffinMan or my clan."
4789,"Grind is good, loads of content and great gun play and build variety."
4790,no comment
4791,Its an awesome off planet shooter with loads of missions to choose from including the main story
4792,"I keep coming back to this game and the evolving world is both awesome and a bummer(cause mars is gone now and I just want to grind escalation protocol forever). Still, game is fun and is multi layered depending on how deep the iceburg you want to go"

4795,DONT WASTE UR LIFE
4796,"Its a lot to understand for new players... and even as a returning veteran once every few months the struggle is a lot to LVL up otherwise in many many activities i am completely useless. I spent hundreds of hours hitting hard cap LVL on this game and 3 months later i am back down at the level of someone who just finished the Tutorial yesterday. I still think the game, in its core is incredible."
4797,"This game is beginner friendly, even with low level aim, you can still land your shots and survive. Also, pvp is turned off in the main world (idk if there's an arena), so no getting bullied. Great game."
4798,Its a game

4811,No vaulted content anymore. I´m back and take my money!
4812,Cool game
4813,gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
4814,I am clinically insane please save me
4815,"this will most likely be an unpopular opinion, but here we go

the games great, its a looter shooter at its core with an emphasis on story, the dungeons are great and the raids are even better!, you do need to know what you are doing though, and as in all online games you do get your quitters when you wipe for the first time because you are still learning the mechanics

IF!!!! you love shooters, play the free version, try it out, you have nothing to lose, some of my friends cant play becuase of motion sickness so i highly recommend you stop if you feel nautious, if you dont, theres alot to explore and play!, they did a great job releasing all the free content to play that you have access to in the free version, the dungeon in this game are fantastic btw, some of the best dungeoneering ive done in games yet

if you love, and i do emphesise love, fork over the money, but realise 1 thing, youll be forking over ALOT!!! of money, theres no pay to win in this game, however the season pass will definately be something you want to get which is just another 20-30 bux you have to spend on top of the expension which is 40 on its own, 

personally, i have enjoyed my time playing back when it was still on the blizzard launcher, but as someone who doesnt have alot of money to spend in the first place i fell out of love with the game, i will return every now and then for special moments like the 25/08/2022 free midweek for all expensions to finish the story uptill the end of witch queen, but other then that, i cant and wont spend money on this way to expensive game

now dont get me wrong, this is just a single aspect that i personally cant get behind because ""im poor"" the shooting is great, the looting is great, the lore is great, the enemies are great!, the collectibles (ships, armor, cosmetics, ghosts, sparrows) are all absolutely great!, the guns are all great!, its all just good, they got the base down, and they are building a wonderfull world on top of it!

TLDR:
play this if you like shooters, or looter shooters, if you want something to burn time with, if you want a new world and lore to dive into

buy this, if you loved what you played in the free version and want to keep playing, the season pass is completely optional!!, but there have been season passes where entire content and mechanics have been locked behind it, so be prepared to fork over some money, which is well worth it!!! but still

need to stress again, the season pass is completely optional!

steer away if you dont have money but get addicted easily, unless you have patience like me, and just play whenever its either free (like at the time of writing) or your fine with just playing the new light version"
4816,"Always was looking for some MMOFPS and this one dose it! PVE, PVP, Raids, Dungeons, Arenas, Skins you name it Destiny has it!"
4817,"The game itself its awesome, good mechanics, graphs and all stuff, but Bungie should be less mercenary, DLCS prices are over abusive and you can't evolve in the game without them, as good equipment drop in nightfall for example, i couldn't play the nightfall because it was one of the DLC missions"
4818,gh
4819,this game is balls
4820,"no.
"
4821,
4822,"Absolutely love the game, it's so fun! especially with friends
"
4823,good.
4824,"Pros:
There is an extensive amount of content to enjoy in Destiny, with the caveat of being poorly structured for new players to understand. 
Consistent balance and content updates to keep the game fresh & enjoyable
When they do ask for money for something that isn't a cosmetic its generally worth it, expanding the exposition of the ongoing story

Cons:
PvP kinda always sucks to play no matter the meta
there are 6 factions of enemies that do get repetitive to fight
an exorbitant amount of FOMO for seasonal content, questlines and guns tied to the seasons just get tossed out and aren't attainable anymore after the next expansion comes out unless explicitly brought back to carry a lesser quality season."
4825,its ok
4826,Best game ever made
4827,No
4828,Imagine playing Destiny 2 lol
4829,gun go burrrrrrrrrrrrrr
4830,"its like runescape you play hard for 6 months and you dont touch the game for 2 years
been playing since Destiny 1 great game raids is where it is at if you dont have friends to do the raid dont play"
4831,Added the game to c drive fixed the log in issues with the anti-cheat for me.
4832,Its like starwars but with more racism
4833,"Don't play Gambit
"
4834,fun is all i can say
4835,"play this game if you've been in, & are used to toxic relationships"
4836,Nice Game
4837,Save yourself
4838,"This game has everything , it is the longest game I have played in my Steam Library. It has puzzle solving, a great story line and is good at bringing in new content. And it's future looks very promising"
4839,"i stopped playing for like two years, then i got a PC, and now im addicted again
"
4840,"Bergs recommended this game to me, honestly best game ever, 10 out of 10 will play with bergs again <3"
4841,"It's a very fun game, albeit very time consuming to get any of the ""good"" stuff. The mmo aspect regarding expansions and rng is very upfront (idk why people still complain about it, bungie made it clear that was their goal since before base release.) Long story short if you don't mind tedious grinding or spending a fair amount on expansions, this game is a blast especially with a good group of friends."
4842,good game
4843,One of the most consistently entertaining MMOs I can always come back to
4844,fun
4845,I've made so many good life friends through playing this game. I would highly recommend it even if you are a solo player.
4846,the game is good but do not play it.
4847,"It's like that one mate that you used to be super close with but now you only see them once a year,  to see what's new with them.  That's the best way I can put it."
4848,i like poop
4849,"I might recommend this game if new players had a chance to catch up with veteran players. But the simple fact of the matter is you have to put in a minimum of 1000-1300 hours playing no other games to catch up on activities, weapon mastery's, exotics, raids, and crucible.

This game is fun. If you have everything you need to make if fun. Time, Time, and finally, more Time. That's something that a lot of people don't have. It's by no means a bad game, it's just not something you should play if your not willing to sacrifice other things in your life. Like people, school/job, sleep.

If you want to play it, go ahead. But don't expect to reach endgame activities in a week. It'll take about a month of playing 6-8 hours a day. And that's just unrealistic."
4850,"Requires $100 /Year Subscription to play and also has brain-stimulating micro-transactions to show off to your friends.

Good game to play."
4851,"Just download it. You know you want to, there's always free stuff, and you're tired of the other stuff you're doing. It's good with friends, decent solo, you might as well. Come join the dark side, eyes up Guardian"

4878,"good game, would recommend"
4879,legendary game but bad sometimes
4880,"It's my favorite game, I hate it."
4881,I enjoy it but it is annoying that I bought this game on ps4 when it was a 60 dollar disc and I literally got no DLC or anything for getting it on disc and then they made it free so waste of 60 dollars for 5 hours of gameplay cause the other 100 hours of gameplay is locked behind bout like 150 dollars maybe in money to be able to play the game
4882,I have genuinely no idea why anyone would play this terrible game.

4904,"Combining the Halo style of combat with a vast array of weaponry, armor, playmodes, and enviornments, Destiny 2 has been an immersive experience that you won't regret getting lost in. Far from perfect, but refined to a level that is massively engaging, it offers an experience unlike any Action RPG Shooter out there. Many have reviewed this game across its numerous iterations both singing its praises and criticizing its shortcomings. One thing many have agreed on is that it's worth the price of admission. Don't take my word for it. Select your class, arm yourself, and prepare to be immensely engrossed."
4905,"best shoot, best loot"
4906,Vaulting paid content
4907,fun
4908,"Would've rated this game a 9/10 before beyond light came out, now, it's a hard 1/10 for me, 90% of my time in this game was messing around with friends, 2% was playing through the campaigns, 8% was being confused out of my mind. Bought Shadowkeep back when it was on sale and I was starting to enjoy the game. Beyond Light dropped and ruined all that fun. You can't play Red War, which I never was able to finish, but always wanted to, which I could go back and actually finish it, all the cool weapons and equipment I was always thinking about getting by buying the other DLCs, got vaulted so I can't get those anymore. You have to spend $30+ to actually enjoy playing a free to play game. Multiplayer at least involved some skill, even as a former f2p, but then stasis was introduced. If you are interested in a fun, futuristic, first person shooter, I guarantee you can find something better than this flaming pile of garbage."

4924,Very Very Fun ;)
4925,"With the new expansion being announced I got reminded of Destiny 2, and specifically how much it pisses me off. Not that it plays bad or anything wrong with the actual game, but because the game I paid $100 for is completely missing. Yeah, this is another review complaining about the content vault, but I can't do much about it besides write a stupid negative review on Steam. Ignore my hours on here, I put in A LOT of hours back when it was on Blizzard's launcher and my time here was trying it out when it went F2P. 

I originally fell in love with Destiny when The Taken King released, and put enough trust into Bungie after that to have Destiny 2 be the first, and now the only game, that I preordered at full price with the expansion pass. I thought the base game was really good, just lacking an endgame, but was severely disappointed by the Osiris DLC and only kept playing because the PVP and activities were still really fun up until the release of Forsaken and quit there because I didn't feel like buying it. A couple years later the first year was released as F2P, and while I was a bit salty that I spent $100 for something that was free, all in all I was still fine with it because it could allow Destiny 2 to grow more and I definitely got my money's worth. But now? I can't play the fully-fleshed out AAA game that I paid for, along with a major story expansion that I hadn't been able to get to, and now that game is gone forever. It only lasted for 3 years, and it's the first time I've ever heard of a game doing that, especially in such a short amount of time. Online-only and multiplayer games that have lost their fanbase and the servers are shut-down usually at least a decade later are one thing, it's the nature of the genre. But completely gutting a game for a problem that Bungie didn't want to take the time or money to fix despite the issue the vaulting was meant to ""address"" being entirely their fault is just appalling. And not even just because I paid for it, especially under the F2P model it served as a GREAT tutorial and first jump into Destiny 2. All you have now are people utterly confused with what's going on, with the F2P section now being little more than a demo, and a story that's missing the entire first half.

Am I really late complaining about something that has been talked about ad nauseum? Sure. Am I shaking my fist at the sky? Definitely. But this is pretty much all I can do with the $100 I have spent now, seeing as I can't go back and replay what was there. As of right now, ON SALE, getting the currently available content is $93, and that's not including the upcoming expansion next year. So essentially, the game I bought was recalled with no way of playing it, and this is Destiny 3 with a minimum $80/year subscription. Hey, I guess it fully lives up to the MMO name (in pricing) now! If you're going to play this F2P, don't bother unless you only care about PVP, and even if you're not going F2P you better be sure this is the only game you spend money on or you have a disposable income. Otherwise for people like me that spend money on a variety of games and a bunch of other hobbies, this is just simply not worth it. Which is a huge shame, because I LOVE the base of how Destiny 2 plays. It's probably the best feeling shooter I've played, I love how the loot and activities work. It's just that it's been so horribly managed over the years that I can't justify putting any more time or money into it."
4926,"Destiny 2 has its ups and downs, for sure, but overall I think it's one of the better games I've played ever. It has a good mix of pvp and pve, and while some people think certain hard to get weapons and stuff like that breaks the pvp, I think it's just a way of getting pvp players to do the pve, and to give the pve players a step up in pvp. It all works out in the end. All I can say is to give it a shot, because Destiny 2 just clicks with some people, and  I am most certainly one of them."
4927,Amazing graphics and a storyline that would be worthy of a movie. Truly the best first person shooter all things considered. Constantly adding new things and the story line will keep you up at night it's so good.
4928,PvP sucks.
4929,"Played witch queen as my first true destiny 2 dive.

4933,"PvP aint enjoyable with the reintroduction of SBMM which almost killed Crucible playlist during shadowkeep dark age , what seemed to be a 9/10 season with Arc 3.0 and Kind's fall return turned into a super bad experience for whoever invested and enjoyed pvp. A wasted opportunity since now lot of recently added weapons archetype viability and build crafting was helping to get the sandbox in an healthy direction

PvE is good (aside difficulties and seasonal activities getting repetitive) but never been able to stand alone in the gameplay loop without chilling in control trying the loot you aquired.

Revert SBMM into CBMM which already once proven to be the better choice for the game health , introduce a novice playlist instead to protect the new lights"
4934,"Let me first start off by saying, I hate this game. BUT, if its the kind of game you like, its a love hate relationship, I play this game every day and I hate to love it, and I love to hate it. Great gunplay, except the pvp meta is frustrating sometimes."
4935,"Would love to give this a good review but vaulting content people have paid for is not a good move. The original campaign from 2017 all the way to Forsaken is completely gone, and as someone who never got to experience them it's unfortunate."
4936,I love it
4937,NOTHING
4938,its ok
4939,"Destiny 2 is a great way to get into steam, since it is free. Honestly a banger for a free game, great with friends or going solo. The game is beautiful and fun, a for sure 10/10."
4940,Only dorks play this game.
4941,wonderful but need to have some money and all the free time
4942,shoot space monster with gun
4943,Great game! =)
4944,cripplingly addictive :(
4945,"Destiny 2 has had it's ups and downs. When Destiny 2 first came out I poured hours into it, just as I did Destiny 1. The story wasn't extremely engaging or what really drew me in. What did draw me in was playing with my friends, getting those really good rng rolls on a favorite weapon. This game is my comfort game. Whether I need to jump on for a match of pvp, run around in one of the open areas or simply do a daily. Destiny 2 can be jumped on for a little bit of time or several hours. Being a solo player as well I'm always engaged to try and beat the things that normally would take three people, it's something that's always drawn me in. I don't find myself not playing Destiny 2 anytime soon."
4946,Fun and enjoyable
4947,fun
4948,"DONT DO IT

4951,"Its a very good game that has three classes Hunter, Titan, & Warlock what I like about the game is how its constantly improving but what I dislike is some of the older content is put away so you need to at least read the timeline to find out whats going on."
4952,FUN...... that's it
4953,i have about 3k+ hours on xbox so would i recommend this game yes and no. yes because i enjoy the game and it woul dbe fun having more players to play with. But also no because it is a very grindy game and if you dont like those kind of games its nor for you.
4954,my goldfish likes this game
4955,"(note: I did play Destiny 1 for 800+ hours, so my review *may* be a bit tinted)
Destiny has been with me for ages, seen me through different stages of my life. And now I return, because the depth of lore, warmth of community, satisfaction of gameplay, and creation of the perfect space-opera feeling is unparalleled - and that's not mentioning all the aspects of the game that are on par with others.
If you like FPS, stories, space, lore, interesting worlds, and tight communities, this is the game for you.
Honestly, anyone looking at this is probably already playing. I'm preaching to the choir here. I've been back for a week at the time of writing and... I love this game folks :')"
4956,"i get to be blue, great game"
4957,good
4958,.
4959,"To be fair, the game in general is excellent.
Graphics, game-play, sound, music, environmental design etc.

However taking out years of content that we already payed for is just a nono.
Completely lost confidence both on Bungie and Destiny.

Destiny has always being in controversy with their content, initially what was sold was a 10 year plan for Destiny 1 in reality was buzz words for a partnership with Activision.
3 years later Destiny 2 was released which at the time was a step down compared to where Destiny 1 ended.

Then they ended the partnership with Activision and went free to play.
I, and I guess a lot of other people hearing this bought the expansions available to show support of the decision.

About a year later they implemented the Vault system where instead of growing they will start cutting old content that we paid for.

And when I was writing this review I found that it was not a one time thing, it will be a yearly thing where each year they will start vaulting previous content.
So guess what? Better play the crap out of what you buy otherwise in a year it may no longer be available even though you bought it.

While in general I don't find the idea of vaulting content, it is supposed to be a way of releasing space on old content and better develop new content.

Vaulting temporal events? Yeah sure why waste space on events that are only played once or twice a year? 
Yeah sure, but I don't sympathize at all with the idea of cutting story content, zones, raids etc.


In the other hand we have FFXIV that just released a new patch full of content, story, even completely new games modes and all 9 years worth of content are still there to be played at any time (with the exception of seasonal events but well they are seasonal).
GW2 just released on steam and all content is there, even they started to bring back older content that was supposed to be a one time event."
4960,"Destiny 2 current state is much improved (not perfect) over D2 even as recent as a year ago. The devs work hard to improve all aspects of the game. Sometimes they miss the mark but you can see the passion and love that they put in the game. Ignore the pure hate posts.... no game as successful as D2 can suck as bad as those would lead you to believe. 

The good: 
Gun play is the best in genre. 
Abilities and builds can make you feel extremely powerful with a decent amount of time and resource investment. 
Most content (even raids/dungeons) do not require perfect builds and execution. 
There is a good amount of content to do on a weekly basis each season so gone are the days of massive content droughts.

The bad: Eververse....... it's not the worst thing in the world but too much dev time is devoted to the cash shop. Hard to blame them... they are a business after all.... 
Seasonal content feed can feel samey after enough seasons in a row. 
FOMO.... they claim they are trying to eliminate FOMO but there is still an (imo) unhealthy amount in the game. 
New Light experience is really bad. If at all possible, find at least one other person to play with who knows the game to help guide you (Big promises made for Lightfall expansion that could drastically improve this). 
Balance in PVP is an impossibility if you ask me. The very nature of the game being heavily focused on customization and variability means that there will be an ever shifting meta that is nearly impossible to balance. Just don't take PVP too seriously and it should be fine."
4961,awesome mmorpg
4962,"From Xbox player, to PC nerd, Picking up Destiny 1 from watching early Dream team, Mr Fruit and Chibirobo, going through the raids, grinding for hours just to get tanik's cloak or a flayer cloak, attempting to use no land beyond in the crucible and rage quitting, and then after years, hopping on to Destiny 2 on the Xbox, Enjoying the Red war, going through all the DLC's, some I liked, some I hated, but always coming back just for that Destiny feeling. The game might not always be perfect with every update, every season and every mess-up that they do, but it'll always be 10/10."
4963,yes
4964,Destiny 2 (o_o)b
4965,No DLC = Demo mode
4966,"Defo new to the game but very good very nice, hello chicken nugget!"
4967,"no matter how much you play the game its ultimately meaningless because they increase the base light level every year so new players can be at the same level as you even though they just came out of the womb, content vault exists because bungie doesn't know how to make content which you pay atleast 50$ for yearly meaningful, overall waste of time and money at this point."
4968,"Right now its the best time to jump into destiny, the game is full of content and is obviously great with friends, this season we get to be pirates :3
"
4969,"I hate this game, but theyre getting my 50 bucks for lightfall anyway cuz strand looks cool :("
4970,"good

4971,soooooooo gooooood
4972,"great teamplay and questing lines, a game you can really dive into with friends"
4973,"I am a 59 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 13 and 1/2 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
4974,funny giant ping pong ball

4982,Worst game ive ever played... I love it
4983,dssdtsadfgafgr
4984,I like that this game is different
4985,"I love this game, it is definitely fun playing it! I started playing on a different platform in September and then game to steam in late May, it’s definitely a game worth trying out, but I would say that to experience it more after going through the tutorial you will probably have to consider buying an expansion like witch queen, beyond light, or something else because you can’t really do anything else after the tutorial, I would still definitely recommend this to friends and family"
4986,"The game in of itself is fine, story is fine and the gameplay is of a looter-shooter, but the only issue is playing F2P doesn't get much to do as most activities are locked behind the pay wall of expansions. Yes, you can get a teaser of the campaign of each expansion and explore the open-world of the expansion, but considering for how long the game is out for, it would be a nice to see an expansion become free-to-keep, like Foresaken or Shadowkeep.

Otherwise the game is fine, but just not too much to do as a F2P"
4987,"Back in my day, Destiny 2 wasn't available on steam, only battle.net, and I was a guild leader. That's why I will not come back to this game, not for now or the foreseeable future. Subpar update after update left me and my guild wanting and it drove us apart. These devs aren't making a game to make a game, they're making it to make money and drive numbers like player engagement time and sacrificing game elements to appeal to the most people they possibly can. This is what I call a ginger game, because sure gingers can be hot and look pretty but at the end of the day they don't have soul."
4988,Better than its ever been still money grubby but hey what game isint now adays
4989,good game
4990,"126 hours doesn't begin to cover the amount I've played on Console, and I can confidently say there has never been a better time to get into the game as of the time of this review."
4991,it good
4992,"Played for years, stayed at max light for the longest time. Took a 2+ year break and FINALLY decided to get back into it. Except it doesn't support the Steam Deck. Because of the anti-cheat, which is a horribly lazy excuse. EAC can run on Proton. They should work on making it compatible or allow for alternative AC software. This game is dead to me."
4993,no no no no no no no no no no cayde 6 is fucking dead no no no no no no no
4994,fusion rifles
4995,"There's a lot of shit to shoot at, tons of worthless loot to sift through while looking for that god-roll.  It's a good time waster franchise with decent PvE content.  The PvP is a joke, aim-assist cranked to 11, broken builds, etc.  Don't take the PvP seriously and it can be fun sometimes.  Take it seriously and everyone will wonder why you're not getting sweaty in a real competitive FPS game.  :)"
4996,"10/10 would highly recommend to anyone that wants a high action packed game to endure with both with freinds and or alone , so much content to be involved in and many many different activities to keep u busy and keen to play also love the fact that unlike most games nowadays destiny 2 is not pay 2 win"

5002,I FUCKING LOVE HAM AND CHEESE
5003,"The worst and I mean worst part about this game is the game itself. The core game play loop is so boring and and tedious It makes watching paint dry interesting. Across both ps3, ps4 and PC I have around 300 to 400 hours total, absolutely no clue why. After the first 10 hours you already feel like you've done everything. Raids are boring, PVP is boring, the loot system sucks honestly. This is a game that I would recommend simply if you have nothing better to do. It has content, that is probably the nicest thing I have to say and all of this fails to mention the way the game handles seasons, new story content, complete lack of new enemy factions (that's more personal tbh) and much much more. overall this game is eh, that is all."
5004,good game and nice story
5005,"its destiny, welcome to your new life. like it? tough go grind for 46 hours straight then get lost doing some dumbass mission that you dont want to do and you dont remember when you got it your just doing it now. half of the game you will be confused and the other half you'll be wishing they didnt vault your favorite dungeon/raid. and why the hell would you do that bungie??? thats such a silly thing to do. anyways go buy the DLC 10/10"
5006,"As much as the grind can suck a little, it looks great, plays great, sounds great, and generally speaking, is great. Seriously, go listen to some Destiny Music, and you'll see what I mean."

5012,this game is like crack its great and i can stop anytime
5013,Destiny is in the best place it's ever been. I love this game so much despite it's pitfalls. Looking forward to Lightfall!
5014,double life pretty much
5015,"I've been playing Destiny since D1 Rise of Iron, and honestly I love the changes that keep coming (and are coming) to D2! It's a great game to just sit down and binge on a day off, I love the customization they're implementing, and overall it's a 10/10 game :D"
5016,honesty its gotta be one of the best games ive ever played
5017,"great game,lot of content to purchase, that are real good expansion packs"
5018,its a GOOD game
5019,Buen juego para pasar el rato y si te gustan los juegos de farm este es tu juego.
5020,I would recommend to people who have played in the past with the red war campaign as it doesn't just throw you into the game i used to play on console 24/7 but moved onto PC after a while and realized they removed red war and it just puts you into a boring area and is awful for new players no real context destiny at this moment isn't worth playing it feels like half of the game it used to be not worth spending your time downloading it.
5021,"super chill game to play alone or with friends....great shooter game..pay to win tho but thats cool

5052,"This is a amazing game, it has an amazing and active community! If you like sci-fi shooter games with multiplayer aspects then this is a MUST TRY.  There are clans that you can join, it can consist from close friends from real life to friends you make in the game. However, this game isn't exactly paradise, no game can be absolutely perfect. These are some problems I've had with the game: If you AFK, it brings you to orbit, which is fine but you'll have to redo the mission, strike, and or raid and it could skip the seasonal intro mission, which as of now I haven't found a way to redo the mission. It isn't exactly easy to find parties, a fireteam, but in the Destiny 2 Showcase yesterday (8/23/22) they're gonna add a system to fix that, besides that there is the occasional bug or two, but they aren't game breaking bugs. TL;DR Amazing game, would recommend"

5061,Destiny 2 has come a long way since launch. i use to play destiny one and loved it and since Bungies take over they have done everything they can to make this game enjoyable .. In game lore is easy to follow and easy to feel for. i really with a fire team for simple tasks could be raised but it seems they are working on better things
5062,I have sold my kidney to Bungie
5063,Said they are done removing expansions and sunsetting... This is the best thing they could have done! AND loadouts and in game LFG... Deadstiny no more!!!! Very excited to get back into this
5064,"reason to play:
1. it's free
2. it's good
3. right now all the DLC are free for a week (23-30/8)
try it yourself"
5065,"Pretty cool, I would say."

5070,"Awesome!
"
5071,Great mixture of gun play and looting
5072,"Well after this many hours and about 200 hours when it was on Blizzard Ill have to say I recommend this game due to the fact it runs great and just feels great probably the best feeling FPS ive played if you count how well I find it runs.

The story is a major cringefest and im sure you will enjoy it if your 10 years of age or 20 with a mental age of 10 with belters such as SABATHOON...HASHLADOON...I LOVE THE TOON and 1980s PAT BOON...The Ghost is probably the most irritating thing i've ever listened to in a game he reminds me of someone at work who most people in the office dont really like...but after all said and done i keep coming back every odd new season or expansion to pick it up and dont regret paying for a Season at all or the expansion as I saved up my pocket money from Mammy and Daddy!"
5073,"There have been a few dull spots in the game, but what long running games doesn't have those in its history. I keep coming back...

Get half way through a game, I wonder whats happening in Destiny. Play destiny. Go back to other game, have to re-learn all of the controls.

Rinse and repeat."
5074,this game should be a movie 10/10
5075,"Game was expensive, but good.

Now even more expensive, and bad."
5076,"After 270+ hours (First played it on PlayStation), I am officially done with Destiny 2, probably the franchise as a whole as well.

The game itself was quite fun my first time around, and the gameplay did feel amazing for a while. However, after reaching the heights of my power that I could reach alone and with some people I know doing a Raid here and there, after the last few seasons the game simply just did not feel the same. At least not for me, or rather that itself is the problem. That being the game feels the same but simply looks different. Same thing just a different coat of paint so to speak.

That is not a bad thing really, least depending on ones perspective. However for me it is as once I got my 'power level' to the height I wanted, earned the gear I wanted, and had things the way I wanted such as builds, mods, cosmetics and such. Even doing what stories I was interested in, I looked back only to see I kept doing the same dam thing over and over. Some things that I would not mind to progress such as the bounties, quest and such are time gated to an extent, materials take time to earn (depending on which ones), and even when a new story is available, it is time gated as well. In the sense that you can only do so much each week, at least currently that is how it is upon starting a new season.

This is a game that I could recommend if one had a good size group of friends already, or is capable of trying to make some within game, if not then I advise to look elsewhere unless you wish not to do certain portions of content. 

It is free to play so trying it is not a bad idea I would say. Though if it sounds like it, I have not had a bad time up until this point really, just that I wish to move on. After all the time I put into this adventure, I have made many fine memories and am grateful  for the good ones as well as the bad. Truly, I wish there was a 'neutral' option rather than a thumbs up or thumbs down.

I lean more towards not recommending it simply because I do not believe there is enough variety of content at end game, and replayablility. Content such as ya have PVP, Raids, Dungeons, little open world zones to explore, and some other activities that is just more kill this, then kill these. I would like more variety such as something different than just more kill/damage bounties. Perhaps something like a race with our ships, mini-games or something. 

Replayability wise as in while you can be 3 different classes, there is not any real difference as far as them going on their own progression journey so to speak. Such as not what they can offer at Endgame so to speak, but rather the journey 'to Endgame' if that makes sense. More options to how to journey through the world, handle quest and allowing what we decide have visual and impacting changes to the world would be something I at least would find more interesting as otherwise I see no reason to do another character when the one I have is all I need, and anymore just means more grind.

This just be my own perspective on it all though, could even add more, go more in depth but honestly I rather not. If anyone should try the game, then I do hope you can enjoy your time and make grand memories, and that I appreciate ya reading all the way through to this point."
5077,"No, that's it. I hate this game. Just uninstalled. Bungie, I have just lost a customer/gamer."
5078,the game is good
5079,"i reley dont wan to say this, but i have to now.
this game is so esey. i mean, all you do is hit the spacebar. thats it! how is this an RPG anyway? you cant contrail anything but what it says on the screen! what if i didnt want to buy the potion? what apout quests? all you can upgrade is stranth? there is no way you can lose to the boss at the end! this game is crap! its not even an RPG at all! i mean look at it! in what way is this supposed to be an RPG if you can do quests and stuff? all you do is press one butten the entier time! explain to me! the athore coments al totol lies! is it supposed to be stick dudes? i dont even know how this damn game got the daily 3rd prize, or a rating of 4.26!
pepole think this review is worthles.
go ahead! say it! i dont care! im just trying to make a point here!
blam this piece of crap!!!!

P.S the only reson im giving this a 1 is beacuase the voices where pretty good. but thats it!"
5080,meh
5081,pog
5082,good game
5083,its very addictive
5084,"so much fun very enjoyable
"
5085,"I have tried with this game but, no matter how I try, it is just repetitive as hell and meaningless.  I find it very difficult to actually ever get into any kind of group, it is an anonymous experience and, as I click aimlessly, finding something to do, the actual game play is just repetitive and meaningless.  I have looked to buy into it on various occasions but when I look at the price and then read user comments I realise it is a pointless chasing of perpetually shifting strata that differentiate the players making it anonymous for anyone who isn't a serious player.  It is too complicated so as to extort income from players.  There seems to be no simple way, these days, to just play cooperatively with others, simply, you know, just for the pleasure of being-with other players, playing cooperatively towards some goal.  Everything is so tied up with lineages of time-sunk into things.
  I tried the demo and after having to log in and endure the confusion of all the screens, and then the perpetual load-screen with the ship, I played for fifteen minutes and felt overwhelmed by tedium and surrendered."
5086,very nice
5087,"I was always a Borderlands fan because the shooting and ability mechanics were quite fun, but since Borderlands does not really get ""updates"" or new things, Destiny 2 fills the slot nicely. Gun handling and mechanics are solid, and I just find running around blowing things up quite fun."
5088,"Good stuff, can be grindy most of the time, but they have been making good progress with adding new stuff. Reworked sub-classes is great."
5089,its A good game
5090,Give Luke Smith your money and shut up.
5091,yeah
5092,Play Borderlands 2 instead.
5093,"shit game, hit some decent clips tho. never fucking mind they let the damn make a wish kids write the updates
"
5094,I hate this game and ill see you tomorrow
5095,god game
5096,This game gave me depression and made me broke
5097,"Ripoff simulator. Know that the content you pay for now, will be removed in a year. At that moment, you will have to pay once again for rehashed content and artificial grind for it to be removed once again the next year, pay again,have it removed again, ...

You get the jist."
5098,This game has destroyed my social life irl. I love it like my unborn offspring.
5099,"I just cant recommend Destiny 2 to new players at all.

the ONE good point is the gunplay.

the story is good. but i can only say that as i've played on and off since CoO so i got to play it all before they deleted most of it from the game."
5100,"it good but at same time bad, enjoy!"
5101,"Very in depth with lots to do and unlock, whilst still maintaining a great sense of freedom and player priority."
5102,fire game would recomend
5103,"No Linux/Steam Deck support, no interest in spending a dime on it. Try next time, Bungie."
5104,"Nice game, if ye bored of guns and swords the wardrobe still gonna suck your soul in for the lords know how long. It's a good game, but addictive fo sho I got 225 hrs in just a month so yeah have fun all you want, just leave your loved one out of this. Make sure no one you love ever know of this shit"
5105,"I highly recommend this game even tho it's a little hard to understand at the beginning!
"
5106,"yea
"
5107,Haha Hunter go brrr game fun
5108,"Some great story, if you like fps and looting this is it a bit grindy at times however once you find some friends you can then have fun and tackle on it toughest challenges it has to offer with end game loot, PvP is fun not the best there is a competitive side to it."
5109,The best game that I can't actually recommend to any newcomers.
5110,"No forks, 4/10"
5111,"I'm addicted to this, I have no girlfriend, no job, no life.

"
5112,Arc 3.0 is quite possibly the most fun i've had in this game.
5113,good
5114,"Wasn't big fan of the Vaulting Contents Bungie took, so did not want to spend shite for the game. Lol oh my poor soul, the devs just announced they will stop vaulting older contents, and guess who's purse will bleed now :)"
5115,"good game good raids
"
5116,ye
5117,i came
5118,no
5119,Not looking forward to all the Fortnite bullshit and kids coming over because of a questionable decision

5124,"I grew up on this franchise, and I can't recommend it enough."
5125,mid.
5126,i lost my arms playing this game. :)
5127,its a col game i love how the guns feel and how u can play like a multiplayer caimpaign  with ur freinds and with other ppl for backup and how the cosmetics look and gaernades look
5128,"they donm't fix their game, they just release more broken stuff to fix the old broken stuff"
5129,I love destiny. been playin since d1 release
5130,sucks balls
5131,good
5132,Every year you buy the game again & again & again..... Its worth it every time absolutely addicted
5133,No Steam deck Linux Support; so now I can't continue the game or start over because Bungie are dicks.
5134,"Shooter - Looter, lots of free to play content"
5135,very goooood
5136,awesome
5137,"This game constantly disappoints me i have played for years and the same issues are prevalent today, and new ones come in and sour the experience, I want to like Destiny again like I used to but I cant see past the consistency of mediocrity and reused content"
5138,"much monez spnt,no recommend 
"
5139,"I'm having a lot of fun with the game it's just very pay to win
"
5140,Great game. Been playing Destiny for years.
5141,"bungie is Always adding more content, the game is hard to get into at first but worth the time and energy!"
5142,good
5143,Absolutely love this game. Loved the first one as well. This game never fails to amaze me. Always has me coming back.
5144,"it has a noticeable aim assist happening but, there is so much going on and so many enemies it doesn't really matter. the levels are huge and look amazing. hard team oriented end game content. its a really big game once you have all the content."
5145,"the design of sbmm in control is just next stupid level. Imagine if I wanna try hard in pvp, why cant I choose survival or trials instead. Why would I join in a control game and try my ass off? just imagine the design of it. no shit destiny 2 pvp is fading every season, no shit, bungie."
5146,Elsies bray tiddies keep me coming back.
5147,Love this game since the birth of Destiny!!
5148,"gay
"
5149,turn boss into gun hehe
5150,"Well shit's good, but you'll go through extreme levels of mental torture"
5151,"Steadily getting better, but still full of uh ohs. Take it with a grain of salt."
5152,Good amount of content worth the money spent
5153,"Honestly super fun game. Yeah some of the paywall stuff that happened in the past is shitty to say the least [I'm not all too familiar with what exactly happened]. But it seems to be pretty fun for F2P players giving them a good handful of content. The new DLC's and seasons are doing quite well and I would say they are well worth the money. I was fortunate to have been gifted most of the DLC's from a friend and that's what's kept me playing.

Overall fun time killer and good fun to get together with friends and do raids and dungeons."

5155,"I never reviewed this before? Well, I hate it. You'll just have to imagine I wrote this with 500 hours played and provided updates a few times since to reiterate that my stance has not changed. The prompt for my review right now? Noticing that I hadn't reviewed it yet while going to pre-order the next expansion. I haven't pre-ordered any other game in over 6 years now. But Destiny DLCs? Yep. It is like that.

I know I'm not remotely alone here. I'm part of a deserved stereotype about long time Destiny players even. Which leads me to conclude that psychologists are sleeping on this game. How people develop an para-interdependent relationship with a game is some kind of breakthrough in understanding modern online and interactive media related behavior waiting to happen.

So are you a psychologist? Recommended (just...keep your eyes up). Are you not a psychologist? Run away now (welcome). Look elsewhere (the ramen, grenades and crayons are all tasty). Maybe just go outside and see the sky for a bit (you will drown in the deep)."
5156,worst game in histroy
5157,I like game very much
5158,From D1-D2 I have always enjoyed this game.
5159,They've deleted over $120 worth of content I paid for with no plans of bringing it back.
5160,great story
5161,"Game good, get used to mechanics and you will have a good time"
5162,"at first i thought that the missions would just fly by and you wont have enough time to enjoy them, but the missions are pretty long the events are sick even doing the events alone is cool tons of loot worth the 86gb 100%"
5163,"This is game is fun at least until you finished the endgame content and then it's just endless power level grinding that is boring. I think the problem it has is that it's trying to focus on gear grinding and build crafting at the same time. While you can infuse to increase the light level of the armor and weapons, it feels like a chore each season. The balancing is another issue both in pvp and pve. It either takes too long to patch/nerf something broken or they unnecessarily nerf builds and/or skills that are fun.

TL:DR- Power leveling hell and devs destroying fun things"
5164,Bungie you fell off
5165,It will take your soul.
5166,"Game good, better with friends, play 2500 hours across all platforms."
5167,played for well over 1k hours on ps4 about a year ago decided to stop playing then the other day a friend of mine told me to play with him and some of his friends now im gonna dive back into this shit game ://///
5168,not very good
5169,dyu
5170,mid
5171,ok
5172,"I play this game 24/7 for 3 months straight, then drop it for the next 2. I find myself watching YouTube videos on ""Things you missed in Season of the ****"" more often than ever. Yet, I never have any regrets. This game is amazing."
5173,"This game has taken up 6 years of my life. ive been a console player the whole time, so steam is not accurate. ""
I hate this game so much its my favorite"" is a very real and true statement"
5174,Sunk cost fallacy.
5175,I like shooting and decimating entire species just for a gun. This game enables me to do that without violating real-life laws
5176,"The game looks good, plays well, there's classes and there's guns! lots and lots of guns!!!"
5177,"J.I.D back in the city with it

Jiddy done been all across the globe"
5178,fuck you
5179,trash content trash game
5180,"good
"
5181,trabalho em equipe = meme!
5182,GREAT 70% OF THE TIME
5183,"Am i really supposed to buy all the expansions, just to be able to play all the content. No other MMO does this, putting in at least 100 dollars just to get back into this game is insane to me. Wont be returning."
5184,"uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh uhmmmmmm yeah sure*

*WITH FRIENDS"
5185,goot
5186,this shit sucks
5187,"As an ex-addict, I would say this game is not worth the 100+ usd required to get any sort of valuable playtime. Will this stop me from wasting money? no. Should I go to a better game? Yes. Will I? No comment."
5188, .
5189,"i hate this game with every fiber of my being.]

yet i cant stop
"
5190,gud
5191,Bungie Take my fucking money no questions asked
5192,shooty shooty looty looty
5193,Balancing team mia
5194,Very fun.
5195,Run while you still can.
5196,"excellent campaign which can be won in co-op, very good PVP and a ton of content"
5197,"Great story telling (if you have the time to follow it every week), Awesome gun play, PVP is still up in the air for me but if thats your cup of tea its there as well."
5198,"I mean, its ight"
5199,bestt
5200,fun with friends
5201,"I loved this game, but bungie refuses to let people on linux / steam deck play. Big shame. I won't recommend this until we get compatibility on linux."
5202,Recommend
5203,"Please, I want to stop playing this game. Send help."
5204,shit game
5205,"play it for the PVE, trust me the PVP will only make you toxic and Gambit is a waste of time"
5206,"fine bungie, screw you take my money."
5207,"Good game, terrible company.  When Activision owned it, all everyone wanted was for Bungie to take over.  Now that they have taken over, they are actually much worse than Activision.  Deleting things you paid for with stupid excuses, as well as an extremely prohibitive cost to rejoin the game and be able to do all the things you want/need to do.  You can stay uninstalled.   Imagine being more scummy than Activision.  That's quite a feat."
5208,I love this MMO because the best in slot gear is totally dependent on your playstyle.  Leveling up weapons is a blast
5209,ch
5210,"pp
"
5211,Is that Zavala from fortnite?
5212,great
5213,If you like Halo (who doesn't) then you will love this game.
5214,"Don't get into this game, you'll end up selling the rest of your life for the hype train you can never get off. Run. Get away now. why are you still here. Do what I cant, escape"
5215,game is shit. play it.
5216,its ok i guess
5217,i enjoyed highly recommend
5218,It's pretty. It's fun learning about all the various weapons and abilities and the various beautiful environments. There are fun little quests to focus on short term objectives. There is certainly a collector-satisfying sea of achievements to go after. People tell me the Lore is very deep but I have not yet got into that and I suspect that the endless variation for the sake of itself may become unrewarding.
5219,I honestly hate this game but i cant stop
5220,"I quit, see ya'll next season."
5221,Best Story Game to good
5222,this game pretty mid tbh
5223,"Great game.
Solid amount of play with friends, locals or by yourself.
Dont give up early if you arent a high level  it takes time to get good gear"
5224,No
5225,"shoot aliens
"
5226,Good game if you buy everything LOL
5227,'
5228,I hate this game.
5229,its good :)
5230,"I don't think it is physically possible to make a game this grindy and boring. You want a cool chestpiece? WELL YOU HAVE TO GRIND THE SAME CHALLENGE FOR 3 WEEKS STRAIGHT JUST TO GET A PIECE OF ARMOR WITHOUT THE BUFFS YOU NEED. This is the game you play if you die and go into limbo. It feels like my soul leaves my body every time this game gets booted up. This game is very cringe, 0/10 Among Us sussy balls."
5231,I've played this game on xbox for years and only recently moved to pc a few months ago. I've always loved Destiny and i always will. This game can have all the money i can give it
5232,"best game
"
5233,"Dont play this game, I miss my family. 
Good game tho"
5234,its a really fun game for just having fun
5235,It's like crack but no one tells me to go to rehab
5236,Its a love hate relationship.
5237,"love it, im addicted"
5238,"I joined the Destiny community back in early 2015. Its definitely been a wild ride unlike any other since then. With many ups, downs, and some sideways, its always been a game i can go back to for a break or to play with friends."
5239,"if you have people to play with it is an okay game but if you're a solo player like me and work a full timed job stay away from this game, you will pay for content and not be high enough to play it alone plus some content you need a small team for and don't get me started on raids. avoid at all cost if you a solo player plus the community is toxic as heck to low light players"
5240,"its fun 
"
5241,Grindy but good
5242,gud
5243,my favorite and best ive ever played. Love all hard work from Bungie
5244,Dont buy this
5245,i hate destiny it's my favorite game
5246,"Great game play for both PVE and PVP.  Try playing all 3 classes for the most fun.  All have different play styles, and playing all 3 helps you power up faster as well.  easy for solo players, and teams alike."
5247,Great but pricey
5248,I'm too addicted to this loot shooter
5249,gud game
5250,It's fun to play both solo and with friends. The story lines are super interesting.
5251,just play it its fun
5252,my bf made me play it
5253,"اللي ما يلعبها خنيثء وشكرًا
"
5254,Halo in space
5255,this game is absolute dog shit and i hate playing it 24/7.10/10 game would play again
5256,get help
5257,man why old dlc's are still expensive asf??
5258,Based
5259,everything about the game is beautiful. only thing i can suggest is in PVP it needs better skill based match making.
5260,"Best looter shooter ever made.  Got its hooks in me from hour 1.  Its been grindy at times for sure, but when you get your build singing the song of 1000 explosions...man...it feels awesome."
5261,
5262,pvp exists
5263,"used to play it before i had to be forced onto steam.. lost my characters i think due to a reset they had. its a good game....except paying a crap ton for the expansions. even right now on the deal you pay $23.99 for 3 of them butttttt....


you still need to pay for 2 other ones and than another new one is coming soon. so you end up spending $200+ a year on expansions."
5264,On my actual account I have over 4200 hours. Help.
5265,"good
"
5266,I hate this game... anyway I just pre ordered lightfall
5267,"good game
"
5268,ZAVALA
5269,This game just doesn't seem to die. Love the action and weapons. Love some of the story telling.
5270,
5271,This game is fucking amazing.
5272,"Gas, big boom explosion."
5273,"Pay 2 Win. But even worse than that, Pay to have fun."
5274,"You spend 100dollar on game then it becomes free when next 100dollar dlc come out, and dont even try playing game without dlc cuz then you dont have anything to do"
5275,"This game is excellent, IF you have enough disposable income to buy every season and every expansion, you have already played Destiny for years, and have a 15TB hard drive. If ANY of these things are not true for you, do not buy this game.
 (Yes i said buy, this game is not free, steam is lying to you.)"
5276,pretty solid
5277,"My favorie game of all time, the gameplay, the community, and the story all amazing."
5278,"Worst WTF PVP  I've ever seen. I just had to LOL . NOT new player friendly in the slightest. guess they dont want / need  new players . As a new player  its kinda like your a puppy and they throw you into competition with MMA fighters with sledge hammers that come at you from everywhere and then beat the shit out of you.
You will get the shit kicked out you from all directions by veteran players and wont hardly be able to tell friend from foe. The PVE is good if you can figure it out but honestly why bother if you dont know if your taking the right path or not.  layers on layers of legacy worthlessness and confusion.

Wow . I""ve played them all  since Everquest. Its a time  ""waste"". imho. DELETE"
5279,Good
5280,erherhgegegwegwgwg
5281,this game is a fat cash grab only play if you're willing to keep spending money on DLCs
5282,"Its like crack, but like, everything bad about crack"
5283,owns my free time and my soul
5284,Very Fun
5285,I would and I wouldn't I am more of a yes. Fun with friends and the start is great. PVP needs help and guns need some more balancing. I love PVE and it is a joy to play new events every year.
5286,its annoying sometimes but its fun to play with friends.
5287,this game is the reason ive failed algebra and i dont regret it
5288,Halo x Power Rangers x The Expanse = Destiny 2
5289,destiny 2
5290,This new season isn't bad its something new but this $120 lightfall plus anual pass is dumb it falls into a pay to win category and is way over priced for what you actually get. again this game has a $400 worth of DLC's and one of them you can't even play its just weapons.
5291,uoyghfvuiotyvjhniolyhu
5292,Alpha Vet here.... its free try it
5293,I love this game!
5294,The most boring and lifeless looter shooter I've ever played. The good gunplay doesn't save it.
5295,For new players it will take some time to get in so you must be dedicated as many things will be hard to explain without destiny 1 knowledge and early destiny 2 knowledge. However one understanding comes in it will become one of if not the most addicting game you have ever played.
5296,its cool
5297,it fun
5298,"30th anniversary pack is free on epic games right now 
Dont waste your money
"
5299,great
5300,If u want to lose your life yes play this
5301,ITS VERY FUN
5302,"its niceeeee
"
5303,"I didn't purchase any DLC or nothing in Game, but still I'm fan of this game now. I played this game on live stream and boom, now I have a mini community for this game. So, I'm making Whole Destiny Franchise as my main stream Game. Now you can understand How good this game is and How desperate I'm to play whole game.
I strongly recommend this game to everyone, cause this is not just a free game, it can be your mind exploring game and develop co-operative skills with your friends."
5304,it's like drugs but slightly cheaper (probably)
5305,"fuck you bungie.

genuinely.



fuck you."
5306,"Warlock best class
Hunter is fast
Titan sucks a.."
5307,"Pay to win, and when you waste your time getting the new over powered weapon, Bungie just nerfs it in the next update. Not only that, but Bungie somehow also adds a new over powered weapon for you to sink in hours to get. It's a never ending cycle and it's sad."
5308,"This game is gorgeous, constantly content-loaded, filled with community, fun to play, and as non-toxic as they come these days."
5309,"Destiny 2 is very in depth game, if you want it to be. So many options for upgrading weapons and armour it can be a little overwhelming at first. Story line is great and sucks you in. The gameplay is fairly easy to get to grips with but PvP can be difficult if you are new. The community around this game seem to be helpful."
5310,"I pre-purchased this game. I missed out on Destiny and bought in to the hype the second time around. I loaded in with everyone else and endured some hiccups at launch like new games struggle with... I loved the system they had in place that got me up to speed. Running missions with my little AI friend - it was a shooter without a bunch of toxic people. I loved it. Then - Bungie was like lets move it over to Steam and strip all of that stuff out? I am so confused. I have been waiting for years hoping that Bungie would make this right but they just want me to pretend like it never happened and by their expansions. Bungie, you are why I have trust issues."
5311,"good game 
"
5312,not fun but i play anyways
5313,is good
5314,"5000 hours and way more this game is dogshit don't play it. I dislike the direction they took Destiny, I had amazing memories in Leviathan, Scourge, GoS. This game sucks and it hurts my soul."
5315,so much content
5316,"Love The Game Been Plauing Destiny Since D1 and love it good gaming to grind for armor and exotics

5317,This Game 0/1000 Stars. YOUR dlcs are 100 dollars from what SHIT. That What This game should burn in hell.
5318,"[Insert ""Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars"" Meme here]"
5319,ye its fun but it can be hard
5320,Bungie has truly lost their touch over the years.
5321,"Thanks for taking away things i grinded my ass off for pre blizzard split.. douche devs, and now charging for access to instanced content, what a scummy studio"
5322,sucks
5323,Destiny 2 sucks its my favorite game.
5324,"After 600 hours on Steam and 400 hours on Battle.net, it's sad to say I cant recommend this game. Destiny 2 has some of the best creative minds working behind it, with beautiful art and level design, incredible music, superb gunplay, sometimes great story, and extremely deep lore. PVP can also be enjoyable as long as you play small amounts of it at a stretch. So why a negative review?

The problem is that its management team is so pigheaded and arrogant that they are choking the game out with unfathomably stupid business decisions, from lying about content upkeep in their engine to nickle and diming their players. This game is Free 2 Play, but its Pay 2 Enjoy—as a free player you get next to do next to nothing worthwhile, and it costs a ridiculous amount to catch up on content, and even more to keep up with content. Even then, the game straight up DOES NOT HAVE a story catch up mechanic—as a new player, you have no idea what is going on and your ONLY choice is to catch up by watching 3 hour long YouTube videos made by loyal members of the community. On the bright side, Bungie has finally realized they can't steal from people in broad daylight anymore and have cancelled sunsetting (which hilariously proves they lied about it being an engine limitation before), so at least the game is on an upswing now, but it won't last long. Destiny has a long history of taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back, so it's only a matter of time until Bungie ruin the 'goodwill' after this move. If you have loads of cash to burn and are depressed, there is a good game buried in here somewhere, but you then have to live with the reality that Bungie can -and will- ruin it somehow every year."
5325,it is good
5326,"Destiny has gotten better and better over the years. It has a plethora of content and some of the best raid content of any MMO. It's music and sound effects are top notch, and its environmental storytelling is outstanding.  While its New Light content is a bit complex and hard to navigate, Bungie has progressively been making changes to make the game more accessible, and hopefully within the next year or two it will be even easier to access for new players.

I find it ironic when people with 1900 hours complain about the game and tell people to not play it. Its worth trying out, and you should give it a shot."
5327,why is arc staff good?
5328,very good
5329,caca
5330,I've played destiny all the way till destiny 2 came out for beta and I've played it ever since I just love the game play and the story line that goes with it and if anyone starts off and meets the vanguard they will immediately fall in love with Cayde-6
5331,this game is champ i think it good for you to play it and its so fun to play...
5332,good
5333,PLEASE SPARE YOURSELF THE MENTAL TORTURE FROM THIS GAME

5335,meh
5336,Fire.
5337,Totally a 10/10. On god fr fr.
5338,It is a really cool game and you hangout with your clan mates and have fun.
5339,"if i had to say soemthing about this magnioficant game is that, what you could of been my beloved omg!, this is my story and my journey through this vast universe we call destine: let me just start this out with a song i wrote about this game when i was just a youngin.... there once was a dog his name was frog he died nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, anywyas this game is pretty good 7.6/10"
5340,"Easily the best-feeling FPS I've ever played. Game plays like butter.
But, uh... Yeah, I can't really recommend it. Game's a long-term grind to get your number gradually bigger, and, as many other reviewers here have noted, Bungie periodically removes and/or deprecates old content so it's either not practically usable (e.g., legacy weapons with a power cap low enough that you just can't use them for high-level content) or no longer accessible outright. I played the game at launch way back when, and the campaign I remember doesn't exist anymore. Epiiiiiiiiiic.
BUT, they largely replaced the loot boxes with a seasonal battle pass like every other game in existence, so that's technically kinda better. More or less."
5341,"https://youtu.be/dmkFk_PAsGA

Game stinks.
No good content everything feels the same after a few days of playing 
havent hated a purchase like this game ever in my whole life.
I genuinely wanted to come back to this game and enjoy it but it feels thin and devoid of purpose and intent and feels as though they are trying to grift every cent from its player base at this point.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
5342,IT'S ALL I PLAY NOW
5343,aWESOME GAME HAD alot OF FUN OM IT
5344,The Recent claim that you can play all expansions for free is false. Blatently and outright
5345,bungie took my money & my soul but at least i get to throw a lot of knives
5346,"Great, so they finally figured out Vaulting was a bad move.  Now they need to bring back everything they stole.  Not another dime till then...if ever again."
5347,"great game, especially with friends. lot of hours to grind though and some money can be spent on it just to keep up with the current content
"
5348,Maybe
5349,Very fun and grindy but also mine is stuckk in windowed mode and i dont know how to fix it

5356,"It can be an intimidating game at first, but get yourself a fireteam ( group of 3 ) and this games level of fun opens up to whole new levels. Easily on of my all time favourite games, 30 hrs on steam doesnt do justice to the time ive dropped on ps4 before switching over to pc."

5368,"It is a beautiful game.  Gameplay is good and the lore is deep as heck.

Server connectivity and player toxicity happens but that's the case in every online game"
5369,at 3000 hours I think this game is kinda like a litterbox that you just add more too instead of scooping it out but I love it
5370,"still getting better but overall fun game. friends made me spend $140.00 just to get better stuff soooo, you might have to buy stuff to get better. But I don't think that's the case"

5373,Great game now. Extremely fun with friends. 10/10 after recent DLC and changes.

5375,Takes stuff you pay for and throws it away. They just announced they will stop doing that. Far too late for that.
5376,Absolute Banger 10/10

5378,Great time sink for when your bored but you should stop if you ever feel bored. Destiny is very annoying when you need to re grind all of your pinnacles and such

5383,jiggling big booty psychics
5384,"This is a subpar game that engages in most of the predatory practices that less robust teams get crucified for by gamers and games journalists, but happens to have enough capital behind it that it can afford strong marketing. Bungie respects neither your money or your time, evidenced by the fact that their strongest expansion to date was created by a Blizzard b-team that was brought in to un-screw their mess of a game.

It's only ever gotten worse since the split from Blizzard, and its success in hooking a reliable stream of crack addicts guarantees it won't get better."

5392,"Sick game fun to game with friends as well a raid, Good easy combat for players who wish to look for the story mode. But hardcore players will have a fun time on legacy and doing raids."
5393,"Positive feedback is not available in your country! 
P.S. And this is not remembering that there were no bonuses for those who bought the main game."
5394,"Pros:
Huge amount of content and new content rollouts (compared to back when it was first released)
Base game is FREE
Fun to play solo/with friends
Good developer communication
LOOT! LOOT! LOOT! 

Cons:
New Player on-boarding is INCREDIBLY confusing. Had no idea where to start and what content was seasonal, endgame, story, or what was sunset. Good thing they are doing away with Sunsetting.
Vault system and loadout organizing is very time consuming (Use 3rd Party Destiny Item Manager).
GRIND! GRIND! GRIND!"

5406,"Used to be good. But they they started stripping content from the game to sell it at a premium. Sure, its free now, cool! You wont get to enjoy it as it was at launch on steam/pc. It's an empty sad shell of itself I cannot bear to play anymore because it breaks my heart how much this game has gone downhill. Not to mention removing three paid dlcs and not giving back the money or anything similar of value, and instead of lore its ""Taken by the darkness"". Taken by the darkness, more like lazy writing. new players avoid, its just a cash grab of a game that overprices its DLCs and tries to rip off it's players. and to any who still play, abandon this game, let it finally rest in peace."
5407,Like warfrme but better
5408,having played D1 and played through some of the rough early seasons after Bungie's independence. D2 is in a good place.

5424,fucking garbage...
5425,"I've never been scammed harder in my entire life. Get out while you still can, as the Free-2-Play model is just a trick. 

Everyone playing this game probably has some sort of weird Stockholm Syndrome because their game's content is held captive and vaulted by Bungie. Players are indulging in a sunk cost fallacy with how much the DLCs overall cost & time invested, but don't realize all their purchased content and gear will be vaulted anyways. It's an absurd paradox, that I don't see how people can continue to partake in. Power/Light level grind was always bull-*BLAM* to begin with. Especially when they would just boost everyone's light level every major expansion. Everything about the game is FOMO and illusionary, that I wouldn't doubt the Devs be magicians. They can make your money AND content disappear!

Bungie is so good at scamming, they were even able to get Playstation/Sony to buy them out for 3.5 Billion dollars (Look up Bungie's ""World domination plan"" and see Step 6.)[/url] When not too long ago, their quality control (Activision) was dismissed & blamed as the root of all MTX evil. They relocated to Steam, positive reviews flowed in, recycled content from Destiny 1 was churned out, and [i]then[/i] It was later revealed that Bungie was the problem all along. If you like magic tricks, I wouldn't look into this too much. Just disregard this negative review! - I mean, you wouldn't like to know the secret behind a magic trick right? It'd just ruin the surprise : )

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me 7 times, and I must be Destiny fan.

[b]Edit:[/b] Around the time this review was posted, it was revealed that future content will no longer be vaulted, [b]ALL[/b] DLCs will be currently free for a week, & the 30th anniversary pack is free to keep on Epic Games Store! I'm sure fans who paid for that pack don't feel upset, and I'm positive all previous purchasers of vaulted content don't mind that content may not be returning! 
How nice of Bungie to ensure players that their future paid content won't be removed.

Also, don't mind how the Fortnite collab & the Free-2-Try DLC is just another trick to rope in new players to get caught in the cycle. Just keep in mind that FOMO is present, your gear will be vaulted, and that Bungie doesn't respect your time & money."

5451,"this game had me hooked with its lore, if you can find yourself some friends in game (which will become much easier with the coming expansion,) you will have a game that can keep you hooked with a great story, awsome lore, and great gunplay. 

just look out for those damned telesto bugs."
5452,"so good
"
5453,Always something to do. Great gun play. well supported by Bungie and the community. LIGHTFALL!
5454,"This is basically a ""Pay to Play"" game. Yes there's boatload of free content, but there are season passes to purchase if you want access to specific quests or parts of the game, there are cases and in-game currency, etc. The list of stuff you can spend money on is ENDLESS. The game can get addictive and become an endless grind. 

Fun for a while but now I remember why I quit playing after D1."

5456,Space guns and high fashion.
5457,"Damn Bungie must be down bad. Time to sell out and pander to the Fortnite kids. I mean most of they have been doing is just re-skinning old content and selling it back to us so I'm not all that surprised d2 has been on the way out for a long time now. They don't discount old DLC that isn't even in the game anymore, a lot of good exotics are locked behind them as well. Fortnite pandering ruined Borderlands 3 for me and I'm not letting it ruin Destiny for me as well."
5458,Story is good and now what we are moving towards the end of the light vs. dark saga to a new saga
5459,"The game is plenty fun, but very expensive having to buy expansions all the time, Bungie is working on this when Lightfall comes out and it should be more fun for free to play players since you need to pay to play and there is also cosmetic items that you can pay for."
5460,Its ok
5461,I have played this game since the beta of Destiny 1. It has only gotten better and more expansive. The longer I play the game the more I love it.

5464,Fun if you like to shooty stuff
5465,"Good game! Looking forward to the last couple of seasons leading up to Lightfall.

5470,"I've been a Guardian since the Red War. I never played the original Destiny and was completely new to Destiny 2. I remember when I first used my super, I felt like a god. I have seen how this game developed over the years. I missed many season, but I I've played every dlc. I absolutely fell in love with the story and the gameplay. The weapons and the Armor. The exotics and the quests. This game taught me both behind the screen and in the real world that some of the greatest things we can accomplish are never done alone. Yes, there are moments in this game when I curse at it, such as when I moved from Console to PC. But the money spent buying the dlcs again was worth it. At least I get to help the developers with the building of this masterpiece of a game. So, after seeing the stream for Lightfall and the next season, I must conclude this review.
Destiny 2 may not be the best game in the world...
but it sure as hell is one of them."

Seems to me that Bungie is working hard and doubling down on new and exciting content - I have not been able to set this game down in recent history. Destiny is home for me, it the game that i always come back to and i always have a great time. So for anyone that is thinking about playing this game. Do it. the base content is free, get in and try it. but be warned ALOT of newer stuff is locked behind pay walls. In the End this game is worth the money that i have put into it. Take it for what its worth. ( i wrote this to get the steam notification to stop popping up as well. )"

5543,its ok
5544,Game was pretty awesome on release but the way they monetize it is HORRENDOUS.
5545,"This is a game that you really have to take at face value. 

It's constantly evolving and changing. It's had some low points, and some high points for sure. As a player from the D1 days, I've been pretty committed to the story of the game.

The gameplay is some of the best for the FPS genre and has been enjoyable at every point of this game. 

I've definitely taken my fair share of breaks from the game, (whether it be from lack of content some DLCs/seasons, or frustration with the economic structure) but I've always come back to enjoy new content, and especially for the social aspect of the game which you won't find in most games. Having a solid fireteam or clan to play with absolutely changes the experience of the game. Doing end game content is extremely rewarding, and raids have been some of the most fun experiences. I've made some great friends playing this game, so in this aspect, this game is amazing. 

This is not a game you buy expecting the content you would get from a top title game that is completed. It has a yearly bundle/DLC + season pay model, so you have to weigh out whether the cost of the game is worth the experience, social aspect, and time you're willing to put into it."

Played pretty much all of D1, didn't really miss anything. Loved Raids, especially Kings Fall. Played all the expansions and yeah like I said pretty much did everything on PS3 and eventually on PS4. As my first ever online game, I loved it. As a game overall, loved it. So I'm a hardcore D1 veteran. D2, pre ordered, played at launch, lot of fun, but I got burnt out at least twice before I moved to PC and got burnt out again once or twice more. And this is where the review starts. Ya know the game, there is tons to do both PVP and PVE but that is something that makes it great and terrible at the same time, I truly do enjoy all D2 content. Chilling against aliens, or smoking Guardians in PVP, great guns and puzzles and soo many different game modes to chose from and planets to explore and quests to try to complete. All sounds fun, and it is. But once you do all that, in order to level up. or continue through a season comes the repeats. That's Destiny's negative for me. Sure strikes and gambit and bounties and stuff like that are chill and fun, but it quickly gets boring doing the same strike over and over again. That's the case with many activities, ESPECIALLY the season stuff, oh my word can you be more creative besides running the same season playlist over and over. Not to mention if you play all 3 classes, oh boy, the repeats is 3 times as bad. Again, it's fun and chill at first but the boring grind comes faster than you think. So, long story short. I love the game, will always have a special place in my heart and I truly enjoying playing it, raiding with buddies, getting new exotics, trying to get to max light level and high stats, ya know tons of stuff that makes Destiny great to new and old players like myself. But eventually, it won't take long for even new players to go, ""Haven't I done this already?"" And for me, that's when the burn outs start. But when you have so much to do, places to explore, items to collects, raids and pinnacle activities to do. The game is at its best and still my favorite online game today. You'll either love it or you'll hate it, and the free version offers you enough to answer that question. There is so much more to do and I barely scratched the surface, but if you want to see more, you'll have to see for yourself! Good luck Guardians!"
5550,"This is an amazing game that combines your ability to work as a team, first-person shooter skill, and puzzle solving skill with a backdrop of fantastic lore, evocative music, and classic perfect Bungie gun-feel.

This game is best played with friends - grab yourself two people who are willing to play with you and sit back for an endless co-op power fantasy. Although purchase isn't required, they provide paid inclusions which enhance the game. I recommend making your preferred archetype and then purchase items to make this the perfect embodiment of this character through either real money or in-game currencies that you work for. In my mind, there is nothing better than seeing your avatar kicking butt in peak style."
5551,dont
5552,"This game is very, very good. The only condition to it being one of the best games and communities you ever join is the struggle of entry. As of the current writing of this, new player experience, especially solo, is very bad. However, the showcase of Lightfall- an expansion coming in (probably) early 2023 shows massive strides in new player experience, LFG systems in game, and so much more for everyone. The investment into this game is steep, but youll have fun doing it, and youll be rewarded by accessing the endgame after the time investment at the start. Hit me anytime to play, I'll be around for years to come. 

This you for playing:

5553,Very fun however the new player experience isnt great. I had to have some friends explain everything to me and show me what to do as the Cosmodrome is the most boring thing i've ever played. If you have friends who already play ask them to help you out because the game is so much fun once you leave the terrible starting area.

5587,"I'm not generally a fan of first person shooters, but I have enjoyed the fact that this game adds different ways that guns function to make your load-out more unique. It's not only a point and shoot game, it's a game where you get superpowers, your bullets may explode if they find someone nearby, your gun may drop an orb if you defeat enemies which you can use to suck the life out of those same enemies."
5588,"played since 2014, love the game, great story, great memories. excited to see whats next"

5597,game is ass
5598,"I have played destiny since launch of D1, while I love the game with a burning passion, I advise you to use caution when getting into this game. BEFORE YOU SPEND ANY MONEY - play the base game for free and if you enjoy it, buy a season and if you enjoy that, then wait for expansions to go on sale and get them then. The paywalls are pretty annoying, the gun play is AMAZING though and the content and story telling has become out of this world. Destiny is in one of the best spots its ever been in my opinion and I can't put it down. I love this game with a passion and playing it with friends is one of my favorite things to do. No game really does it like destiny and if you have the time, money and are interested in the game style I HIGHLY suggest getting into the game, but be warned once you get hooked it' extremely hard to put down!!

Do you like fantastic environments?
Do you like blowing stuff up?
Do you like a live service game that isn't a complete rip off and actually provides real content?
Do you like a story that is easy to follow, but rewards you if you dig deeper?

If you answered yes to most of those questions, then you will almost certainly like Destiny 2."

5701,fun
5702,"541 hours well spent. some of it do be afk menu time.

Game is good and fun. But not for everyone.
New player experience is truly one of the worst you will encounter

Gunplay is some of the best. Super (pun unintended) fun & engaging, so long as you can tolerate/get past the brutal learning curve and have an itch for longterm grinding. the fun mostly comes from buildcrafting and character progression, and blowing shit up after finally having established characters. but the game really pops off when you start to get to this point (maybe 100 hours or a bit less).

Ultimately kind of like runescape where it is an absolutely gargantuan time sink but ultimately deeply rewarding and worthwhile.
I *strongly* recommend using Destiny Item Manager. Can't understate its QoL vs. playing without.

oh, and pvp for the most part is fucking fuck fuck; best of luck going in as a fresh player. if you're skilled enough you can compete somewhat, but the players are mostly hardcore Destiny uber veterans and as of this review there is still a lack of skill-based matchmaking (most of the time you'll vs. hyper sweaty 3+ KD players w/ 1000s of hours' experience). even 500 hours in I don't play Trails (this game's competitive pvp mode). trials can fuck off"
5703,it fun and enjoyable when you play with other friend

5709,"great game, great experioence"
5710,"This game is very good if the year is 2002 and you've only played Sega games.

Don't waste your time"
5711,"Love the game overall. Super fun play style paired with a very intriguing story and world building. The graphics are gorgeous and the game maintains a combat system that feels so satisfying to play. I only have two complaints:

1) This game caters mainly towards veteran players in the sense that old pieces of story are not playable at this point, so getting started as someone who hasn't explored this series before can be tricky. That being said, if you either a) don't care about the story and just want to have fun, or b) are willing to take extra measures to learn the story via codex entries and research, then this shouldn't be a problem for you. However, if you expect to walk through an incredibly cohesive story with unfragmented knowledge about the lore, prepare to be disappointed.

2) The DLC is expensive. The DLC for this game, (Foresaken, Shadowkeep, Beyond Light, Witch Queen, and however more they add) while very worth while to purchase since it gives you the full experience of the game, is a little pricey. I would be lying if I said I didn't complain about the price for any expansion content. That being said, the base game is free. While the base game doesn't have a story worth anything, it at least allows you to get a hang of the play style of the game and decide for yourself whether or not it is worth it to buy the full game. I also recommend waiting for a sale to buy all the DLC because it is crazy expensive otherwise if you buy it all at once.

Last thing to keep in mind is that THIS GAME IS AN MMO! A lot of people complain about the nature of Destiny 2 because they're expecting something different. MMO's are notoriously money-grab-y, so expect pay walls for some content. (Bungie separated from Activision during the Destiny 2 project early on, and that caused prices to go up. Just be happy you aren't putting all that money into a company like Activision that is a lot more problematic.)"
5712,A different experience from the usual.
5713,"h1] Best FPS to play with friends [/h1]

One of my favorite games and like the mix of an MMO and FPS. Lots to do and in some ways is an issue for people who wouldn't have time to invest. 

I don't often like how much time it can take to get an exotic item or the random rolls that are garbage. Overall, the game itself is fun and entertaining with different game types and modes for playing with friends or solo."
5714,ja
5715,Sunk-cost fallacy
5716,"Its grindy, its tedious at time even. But it's also rewarding and just plain satisfying. 
It's not for everyone and I'm still mad about how the Eververse has been pushed in, but I think it's a good game if you want a mmo'ish looter shooter with just plain excellent game/gun play."
5717,"other than the starting mission, overall i really like this game. of course grinding is needed to be better but the thing i like is you dont have to grind if you dont want to. you get less rewards but you can still very well do whatever you want playing a few hours a week.

5726,"Once you start to play and enjoy destiny there is no return and i mean LITRALLY! you'll keep getting sucked back to this game as there's so much content and more being included. so if you wanna waste your time, money and life destiny is the perfect game for you."
5727,funni dance
5728,"if half the game wasn't behind a paywall, i would probably play it more. Otherwise, its a Halo game without Master Chief and includes dancing catboys and catgirls that cosplay as robots."

5741,"I've played for 1100 hours and I can say with confidence I hate this game.
Update: I have put an additional 70 hours in and I can say with confidence I still hate this game, but it's fun."
5742,game = epic fun = happy = destiny fun time hehe haha
5743,"Oh Destiny... such a vast body of work, its hard to find the single best reason to recommend it. Oh wait, its FREE! If something about it piques your interest, having no fiscal barrier to entry is more than reason enough to just download it. The next reason (IMO the most important) is of course, the game-play. For an FPS, I don't think it is the GOAT, but its backed by a pedigree that literally (combat) evolved the genre. Overall, SOLID game-play mechanics that are ""easy to learn, hard to master"". I could go on for days about specific features like character classes, their sub-classes, the ""current"" meta legendary/exotic weapons and armor, and their perk combinations to really make your character(s) shine BUT figuring that all out for yourself is just another reason you should check it out. All of this can be done alone or with friends, or if you feel up to it loads of strangers who are more than willing to chase that next piece of loot with you. If you have never played Destiny, or are having difficulty returning to it, I would say to you, ""check it out"", because its worth it!

TLDR;

PROS -
*Solid FPS game-play with colorful magic explosions show big damage #s on bad guys and/or other players
*Easy to pick up and play with Friends, and Foes. Great PvE or PvP content 
*Hyper Active Discord Community, never hard to find players participating in ANY content (intro-endgame).
*The shifting sandbox keeps the game fresh, frequent patches and hot fixes are geared towards balancing.
*Audio - The music of course, but also the legacy of voices in every aspect of the game, SFX, everything...
*Narrative - It took a little while for the franchise to gel, but ever since the Beyond Light Expansion... I dig it!

CONS - 
*GRINDY - Some loot is better suited for certain things. Getting that loot ""might"" require doing a lot of some activity over and over. Sometimes its your first try... sometimes its your last.
*A ->LOT<- OF STUFF - this can be overwhelming... focus on small bites, take your time, have fun.
*MONEY - Some of the best content in the game which also carries the better loot with it is released as DLC. -- This means a small pool of viable loot is accessible to the strict F2P, or ""New Light"" player.
 
Overall - Check it out"
5744,"This game sucks, very cool very swag i like it"
5745,"started rough years ago but if you have a bit of money to spend, this is a phenomenal game now"
5746,Crucible was such fun I can get crushed almost every match!
5747,"The best game to play with friends to not RAGE. Can play casually while 4 shots in, and it has so much content and triumphs for the whole family. Play Destiny 2. If you're bad a multiplayer, go play multiplayer so I have an easier time :)"

5752,dont play its a trap
5753,free and fun only thing i dont like is that they got rid of my favorite place the tangled shore and my favorite campain
5754,"This game is phenomenal, unless you play alone. To enjoy this game, you need at least 3-5 friends that play consistently in order to do dungeons, raids, high level crucible, and missions on hero difficulty. There is lfg that exists on discord, and for the most part it can be helpful, but if you need someone to teach you how to do a raid or dungeon, then you will have a hard time finding those willing to help you, since mistakes take time and people are not patient. If you have friends, this game is so much fun. You can waste hours and hours laughing with friends trying to get a weapon, or grinding to level up. This game has been my favorite for years and years. I feel lucky to have experienced this unique masterpiece Bungie has given us."
5755,destiny like das tiny like  u have small peepee heehe
5756,"Overall a really good game, over 2,000 hours on Xbox and now playing on Steam. If you haven't tried it yet, there is tons to do and so many hours of fun and frustration lol. The best looter shooter I've ever played."
5757,Destiny is a fantastic game on pc. I have played over 4 thousand hours collective of destiny 2 on pc and console and I wouldn't trade that for anything. I'm always entertained and I think Bungie deserves more credit than most people give them. I will always look forward to new content and always play whatever is currently out.
5758,"I hate Destiny 2, it's my favorite game."

5764,Great game
5765,"Destiny 2...I picked up this game in July/August of 2021... It's been a little over a year and I have 2000 hours. uh. I'm addicted, either you want to play it or you don't. No in between. Thanks."
5766,you can finally sex the thralls
5767,"Look, before anything else, this is a review stating how absolute shit the loading process has begun. Every single day I play it there is a crash while loading, not a matter of if. It was not until the last season update that this was a problem for me. Though I have a slight over 300 hours over in Steam I have been playing this game on xbox for countless hours. Crashes while loading have only been a problem on PC.
Aside from that current nonsense that seems to be gaining no attention by Bungie this has been one of the best shooters I have played in a long time that I can just load up - decide playstyle for certain activities - bust heads and enjoy for hours at a time. Seriously can't tell you how many times I thought I would be playing for an hour at most and forget to cook dinner. Now I do enjoy DOOM Eternal, Borderlands series, and some more like that but I know each has its own playstyle to succeed at. That in mind the variety of modes and activities has always brought something to my attention that I could dive into and have fun playing for multiple session with some other mode to come back to for enjoyment again. It is a good game with plenty to do, grind aside. BUT THIS DAM LOADING CRASH IS F@KIN UP EVERYTHING FOR ME. I tried all they have posted to fix it with no avail. the new season launches tomorrow so hopefully that fixes it. anyhoooo off to shoot Cabal till night falls, back on xbox though."

5785,c
5786,This is my favorite game. Don't buy it
5787,game suck get maidens
5788,I want more but without going bankrupt please
5789,"The game is really fun once you get to max light level. Grinding for light CAN be fun but usually is just mundane. Grinding for good rolls on weapons can be fun, but can get old if you're unlucky. Playing with friends makes the game vastly better and can make those nostalgic gaming memories all you gigachads and turbovirgs are looking for. The problem is the path for new players is tough. This game says it's free but really isn't, you can't truly enjoy it without dlc, but running through campaigns so long after they release feels like you have play hours and hours of catch up just to play the low level activities with friends. Great game if you're committed or have played before. The best time to buy is when the dlc drops, as all players will start at the same light level. Wait for lightfall."
5790,its terrible
5791,rocket + sandbag
5792,This game is good if you hate yourself.
5793,good
5794,HELP i cant stop myself I CANT stop playing this masterpiece
5795,fun game by yourself or with friends
5796,"love it
"
5797,
5798,"Stopped playing before beyond light came out. Jumped back in and loving almost every second of it.
Just doing Last wish and other raids again was very nice."
5799,Good game until no one shoots the ads
5800,Very nice shooter to play with friends especially if you're into Halo
5801,"Do you have 10,000 hours you'd like to put into a game?  This one has you covered, plus 10,000 more added every year."
5802,Great game
5803,me like d2
5804,"The melee, super, motorcycle and ship make it better than any other shooter, plus you can use bows and swords!"
5805,I still want to shoot myself after I bought the DLCs
5806,"peepee
"
5807,You'd have to play it to believe me!!
5808,destiny is a game just chiling and having fun with your friends
5809,Epic Game
5810,SAVATHUN
5811,"This game really ticks me off because of all the time I spent within the game off this platform and also on steam now that it is on here.... and all of my progress gets ruined and I get reset to literal trash light level because they made an ""expansion"" but in reality it's just a PAYWALL. They gate my FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT THE GAME. Such as Trials of Osiris.. behind this crappy expansion and new giant grind through the terrible story. I can't stand PVE. I just want to shoot other players. I don't want to be gated by PVE content, ever. Destiny 2 developers need to understand there are people who do not want to play PVE at all and we only enjoy PVP. It really kills the game. I don't want to give them 1 damn cent for their expansions. I don't like it."
5812,"Very fast paced and addicting. Little confusing on all that you can do and whats available, but otherwise a fun game."
5813,Good game
5814,"Until Bungie starts respecting the player and their time, I can't recommend this game to anyone, despite loving most of the actual gameplay. This isn't even to comment on the ridiculous way they've handled MTX, which is far worse than any other AAA I've ever seen."
5815,Fun shooter but i want to be able to take my armor off and relax in an apartment too
5816,Joyful
5817,"took $500 from my cousin, i sweat. good"
5818,really good looter shooter experience dont be fooled by the amount of hours i played a lot on PS4 great game content is expensive tho so if you can affoprd it go for it
5819,Can't get past tutorial:(
5820,wow very ape oo oo aa aa
5821,"Damn bro, you only played for 600 hours? That's not even 10% of your life lol, get your light level up nerd"
5822,meow
5823,"playing this game is a worse financial decision than having a girlfriend which is ironic because no one who plays this game has ever had one unless you play raids on lfg, in that case everyone is 40 years old in a wonky marriage, has 3 kids who are always screaming and 20 years left on their mortgage."
5824,yes
5825,Lots of guns in this game.  Also there's lots of blinking lights and loud sounds.  I like to run over the aliens with the rocket powered scooter bike.  Sometimes I get bored and take a nap.  Other times I play too much and forget to pee.  That's bad.  This game costs more than a LOT of Kentucky fried chicken buckets.  And tea.  I can't find the end boss.  No matter how many I kill there's always another one.  Grrrrr...
5826,"yess
"
5827,m
5828,K
5829,Best worst game I've ever played... Daddy Calus needs to suck my balls
5830,AMAZING GAME
5831,"titen funni monke, hunter edgy needs less ppl, warlock god"
5832,it good
5833,big bad thing get dead. gud game
5834,good
5835,"The beginning levels are slow, but once you get your guy leveled up a bit and collect some decent loot, PVE and PVP are an absolute blast."
5836,best game ever
5837,"I first played it awhile ago, without purchasing any of the dlcs or content, and admittadly i didnt enjoy it. Fast forwarding to now i bought all the dlcs and content and stuff and honestly seriously enjoy the game. Being able to smash out witch queen the second you open up the game was a massive game changing. I would recommend this game to other players but just keep in mind the other content that is available and how much you could have."
5838,Shoot aliens good game
5839,"good
"
5840,"To start off with, lots to learn but defiantly enjoyable with friends."
5841,i hate this game
5842,"The only reason why I don't advise people playing Destiny 2 is if you stopped playing Warframe thinking this is a good alternative go back while you still can because they feel nearly similar.. 

Just in short here are the things that are different compare the two..

The Frames themselves
The POV (And I mean 1st person to 3rd person)
And The Abilities.

Now to the compare the two for what they have

Guns that feels really op or just need to have another rework
Super that last way to long or way to short
Mods (seriously Destiny mods feel way to similar to Warframe mods just in a different way)
Builds (This one is not a joke these builds are to similar to can do one job or can do everything)
The way you can make your character look (Not as much as Warframes but could soon get there)
and last to be honest is gonna get there the movement options either stay on the floor or be in the sky it doesn't matter which you'll destroy anything in your path (Unless its PvP for Destiny then it can be either or for you..)

See the Similarities?"
5843,ive had fun for the time ive played so far.
5844,its not worth it
5845,Good game
5846,after playing this game for six years with 1500 hours across multiple platforms i am proud to say that i still do not understand the story or point of the game. there is no game that gives me less satisfaction to play. 10/10 would recommend. great game
5847,"Raids and game play are great, But Bungie still does not deal with the cheaters in pvp, if you only play pve then yes I could recommend the game, but until the cheaters and way over tuned controller assist (aimbot) are removed I cannot recommend the game as a whole."
5848,"Highly Recommend, Top Tier FPS."
5849,FORTNITE COLAB I LOVE FORTNITE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
5850,10/10 game would smack zavalas fat juicy buttcheek again
5851,amazing game
5852,You goin for f2p? meh. Buying dlcs? GO FOR IT!
5853,don't
5854,I need to touch grass
5855,"nice game
"
5856,"Too much frustrating paywalls. If you expect to play this as a f2p, get out, the f2p is just a demo for a subscription based mmorpg."
5857,fire
5858,wtf there are no tractors in this farming simulator
5859,its pay to play
5860,"pvp is dogshit, only reason to play this is because of pve"
5861,yes
5862,gazoongas
5863,Get out while you can.
5864,Warframe better fr
5865,"Destiny have it's up and downs but overall It is an excellent game which I always come back to.
There is something about it's game play that pulls me in."
5866,"Good game, but not much replayability. Max 100 hours of gameplay."
5867,"Great game overall.

Pros:
Probably the best feeling shooter on the market in terms of gameplay and mechanics.
Great Lore and story.
Great art design (the signature Bungie skyboxes we love from Halo).
Tons of stuff to do.

Cons:
One of the worst monetization models. Don't be fooled by the f2p tag, a lot of the most important stuff is paywalled. Also the system is so convoluted and frustrating between season passes, legacy stuff, dungeon passes and other things. it seems like each year Bungie takes out something from the expansion and slap an extra price tag on it (like dungeons)

All that aside, I suggest you try the f2p, if you liked it, get the latest expansion, if you liked that too, get the other stuff but beware, the pricing is predatory af."
5868,I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes fps games with an extra twist with all the different abilities that you can unlock and all the different weapons and armor there are to collect. I have probably around 800 hours in this game on my Playstation and I thought it would be fun to try on pc and trust me... it is.
5869,good soup
5870,as someone with over 10k hours on console this game sucks i hate it
5871,rubbish
5872,Is good
5873,Great game after about $900 on dlcs
5874,"not worth the time tbh 
"
5875,yes.
5876,c
5877,"Amazing game with alot of content in difrent tags (like RPG, PVE, PVP, MM, Open world, FPS) 
it has it all. 
downsides are: you have to be ""a student of the game"" and also its not REALLY free to play for full experience and OCD players gonna have struggles with too much info and quests. 
require discord, english/ group of same lang playing in order to fill the ful experience but deffinatly enjoyable solo roaming free to play as well."
5878,Give back the main quest with the red legion
5879,It's a trap
5880,noice
5881,"I don't have much to say, but I adore the absolute fuck out of this game; and I would 100% recommend anyone who enjoys FPS, MMO, or RPG type games such as Borderlands, Outriders, Halo, or even movement (funnily enough) games in general!

If you like Movement, Momentum, OOBing and doing glitches, and anything of that sort, you'll love this game too. Momentum and Movement in this game can get incredibly crazy and make the game infinitely more fun to play once you figure it all out :3 

Don't judge a book by it's cover with characters as each character will net you a different experience perse. But in all honestly 90% of my playtime is warlock as they're the fastest and just overall strongest in multiple ways; but they're all relatively similar in strength

Have fun, and don't shy away (If you're a solo player) from enjoying or getting into the game if you're finding things difficult or boring. Trust me, I regret not being able to get into the game the earlier times I've tried because of this. LFG servers or getting friends to play is the only small downside to the game, but if you have that then it's a perfect experience IMO."
5882,It was my destiny..
5883,"Its one of those 10/10 games that I would not recommend to a friend.
"
5884,"I have a couple hundred hours from console and PC combined, I have around 1500 hours on Destiny 1, if not more. I have been playing Bungie games since I was a child. Halo CE was the first game I became obsessed with. I made beautiful memories with that game and many subsequent games with my friends and family and still (can) go back to play them from time to time if I choose to do so. I cannot, and will not be able to do that with Destiny 2 and it absolutely crushes my soul to see this company turn out peoples pockets and rob them blind. I understand the EULA agreement. It's a license that you pay for. But this... this is just despicable.

 This game, Bungie specifically, are blatantly stealing-- absolute fraud. You pay top dollar for the newest DLC (or even the base game for that matter, just for it to become free and its content removed with no reimbursement to you) and the content gets wiped from history and sent into the ""Destiny Content Vault"" where it may or may not ever be seen again. You are paying full price for content that will not exist in the future... 

P.S.- Not to mention that whenever you get the game, there is a soft level cap, your character is essentially useless in many modes (that is, if you can even access those modes) because you are at a massive disadvantage to other players that have purchased and played the current DLC. So if you don't play into their trap and buy the current DLC (which will eventually get taken away) you get severely left behind. It pains me greatly to see this."
5885,But also no.
5886,The ONLY 10/10 game I wouldn't recommend to a friend.
5887,gud game
5888,Great FTP game to throw on and shoot stuff to
5889,really goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood fps
5890,i
5891,this game fucking sucks its like gambling but worse takes all ya money but makes you cant stop playin g
5892,The entire free campaign is now gone. Taking out these key story missions was a bad move. It does nothing but leave new players hopelessly confused.
5893,Stay away from this game. I can't regain my 800 hours from my life. Sadge
5894,its honestly an incredible game plz try it you wont regret it
5895,I hate this game
5896,"15 and unemployed, this is the closest thing I have to a full time job"
5897,bueno
5898,this game is pretty good for it being free to play. it offers alot of content for being free and continues to have tons of replay value
5899,This game is ass
5900,god
5901,amazing if your into a pvp competive and pve game
5902,"On old quest no matter what weapon I use the game make sure I can't win. If that's the way Bungie wants the game to be I rather get ALL MY MONEY BACK because the game sucks. My friends don't want to play it anymore, sick of the Super Mario jumping. If you can't fix the problem I will never play Destiny again. If there's a lawsuit I will join to get the MONEY back that I've wasted on this pathetic game, even though I've lost 309 hrs. Thank you for messing up the game when it was good in the beginning."
5903,honestly really fun
5904,"This game is the single-most intoxicating game to play. Worse than alcoholism.

Highly Recommend
9.7/10 

"
5905,i like it
5906,"I played D2 at launch. Quit playing before the warmind update or whatever. Came back at the end of season of opulence. Put 3000hrs into the game up until this point. I'm officially burnt out. Burnt out on spending $80+ a year just to keep up with content, etc. First time I feel like gunplay is in a really good spot but how many times can we keep running Exodus fucking Crash or Arms Dealer? At this point everything feels like the same strike no matter the planet, event, whatever it is. Other than raids and dungeons."
5907,good game I liked the part when u play as a guardian
5908,yes
5909,"I don't recommend microtransaction hells for any reason.
This is no exception."
5910,Funny space gun shoot funny bullets.
5911,Most of the community are kind and considerate to new player - like all games you get the odd pratt.  PVE is expansive and large - PVP is aggressive and demanding.  Overall experience is a hugh Plus.
5912,I hate this game
5913,THE BEST GAME EVER MMG MMK
5914,"Played it when it first came out, it was okay, started playing again recently, its gotten a lot better, enjoying it so much!"
5915,muy beano
5916,1st mission is ridiculos says u cant respawn and if u do u have to restart you run in to run heavy guys kills u after 7 attempts u get heavey guy and then anthoer spawns you take the mick bungie
5917,Gay people make me hard.
5918,game sucks
5919,Great game i cant spoil the awesome story
5920,good
5921,Destiny 2 is an amazing game for beginner i will say try finding people to teach u how to optimize ur leveling at the beginning u will progress way faster if u play destiny u need all dlc or u gonna get block at some point and having friend to play with is so cool too and try getting up to date with the story it will get u more into the game take a lot of time but this game is so much fun and grinding is not to bad
5922,it's fun if you don't mind the grind
5923,density
5924,Zavalas milk dud head lookin ass got me acting foolish
5925,"Ups and downs, but I've played for the entire lifespan of the 2 games so obviously it's worth it"
5926,"been a very long player love the game but of course like everything it has its ups and downs
"
5927,100% if you like having depression then this game is for you.
5928,Dont Download it.
5929,its destiny its a good game grind have fun and dont play gambit
5930," I have another account with over 500 hours. Its addicting, especially when you get with a raid team and kill some bosses with a purple nuke or a flaming sword."
5931,Grass? Is that a new exotic?
5932,.
5933,its ok if youre stupid
5934,Game is boring not fun anymore!!!! doing everything over and over and over again to maybe get the gun that i want? nah
5935,This game sucks. Dont play it
5936,"With so many hours invested in this game its difficult to review.
 It has been a very worthwhile journey and I think the Dev's have done a awesome job bringing the game this far.  

For veteran players or returning players the sub class updates have been really good, having that extra customisation is a huge step forward. However some (Aspects/fragments)  have been overpowered at launch but time should balance this out.

For new players it can be difficult to work through all the armour and weapon systems and get a understanding of all the mechanics and meta. Persevere and it will pay off. There are lots of people willing and able to help if you seek out the help. 

Something that does bug me about the game, time gated triumphs. 

Really looking forward to what the future holds for Destiny and would highly recommend the game."
5937,Fun game
5938,Silly game. played the piss out of it
5939,Giant time sink at the mercy of a bunch of braindead money hungry parasites for developers.
5940,boring
5941,"it's a good game with a side of good game.

"
5942,"i like it :D gameplay is nice, story interesting and IT'S FREE"
5943,Love the game
5944,I swear they made this game free to charge $40 for a dlc and barely any content in the game itself without dlc 😂
5945,blah blah blah  play it
5946,"Im addicted to this game :), the story telling is getting better"
5947,Nope.
5948,"It's everyone's favorite game that we love to hate but it's really fun. I've sold my soul hundreds of times and purchased many things I didn't need but at the end of the day I will not stop playing and it will be worth every penny.

I'll still call it a bad game until the end of my days.
I'll never truly mean it"
5949,harrdddd game
5950,Pretty good game just crucible is very very sweaty other than that its pretty good
5951,its good
5952,"Re installed Destiny 2 recently, wanted to see how the game was nowdays. Long time since I played last time. New Anti cheat called Battle eye....... Logs me out after 5 mins with error code Plum have not been able to find any way to make this work. And I am not gonna run my computer bare bone just to be able to play 1 single game. So Bye bye Destiny  2 Hope u get a working anti cheat. Probably a good game if it lets u play it."
5953,"its buggy tho
"
5954,great
5955,its a good game
5956,"This game has a lot of garbage around, so let me give you some reasons you might look into this game. #1. Most importantly friends, this game is 1000 times better w people you know. Although there are a lot of good ways to find groups/clans too (to make said friends). #2. Make sure you enjoy to grind, it’s less of an issue now days but, getting up to speed will take some time. #3. The gameplay is what most people enjoy about this game, yeah there’s a story but, I haven’t had speech text on in months. #4. This game has a LOT to offer so just do what you like doing (even gambit) #5. Just like any community there are some good, some bad, and some whatever’s but, in my experience the goods definitely outweigh the bads/whatever’s. That’s it, now just to give it a try (it’s free until it’s not you’ll know what I mean) lol have fun guardian"
5957,if you hate your free time play D2
5958,"GOOD GAME
"
5959,It's alright I guess... :(
5960,"Mid experience, 10/10 would play again."
5961,i hate that i love this game
5962,"I don't play as regularly as I did at launch, but I always return for new content drops and the gunplay in Destiny 2 is still some of the best in gaming."
5963,"hunter or else
"
5964,love it!!!!!
5965,this game fun
5966,thanks for everything destiny 2. greatest game ive ever played even tho i hate it sometimes
5967,Is good
5968,"Probably the worst and scummiest business model in any live-service game i have ever experienced
Sure, play the free version, it is kinda fun
Just dont buy any of the DLC, they will just ""vault it"" in like 2 years, making it inaccessible to play anymore
and you will probably be angry and regretting your purchase, like I do"
5969,this game is absolutely horrendous everythinga bout it sucks ass and if you play it you are a masochist
5970,very time consuming but its fun
5971,pretty fun
5972,Was not a big fan of this game at launch. I've checked in here and there to play content. Came back for season 17 and have really enjoyed returning. Will main this until something better comes along.
5973,"well, i've got part of a college degree as far as time goes into this game, just pay the hundo up front for all the shit, it's worth it.   The game is basicly HALO with ADS.   SO........pvp is sweaty as fuck, but amazing,  the game is great, just need new guns not any more RESKINS  like NEW GUNS, NEW ANIMATIONS.............CMON YA'LLL, WHERE MY SEMI AUTO SHOTTYS, AND PUMP ACTION NADE LAUNCHERS IT'S THE FUTURE......CMON BRUH."
5974,I love lamp
5975,"the game is extremely convoluted and not nice to new players. Good luck figuring out what you have to do when you first load in. The game also forcesyou to use certain equipment. So go right ahead and use whatever you want but if you want to clear certain content or farm particular sets of gear you have to use certain weapons. So have fun sucking it up and playing the game not how you want to play it so you can farm gear through their bad time sinks and arbitrary gates on things. This game is not friendly to new players and it is not friendly to your time. Let me use the guns I want to use to farm stuff. Stop locking gear behind content that the community as a whole thinks is tedious, not fun, and poorly designed (looking at you lost sectors). I'll keep playing for now because its what my friends play. but I can't wait for them to also get bored so we can play something else. If you don't like grindy games dont play this game. If you do like grindy games go play something else where the grind is actually beneficial instead of just there to buff player numbers."
5976,good
5977,its gud very gud actually
5978,Naw
5979,Titan Hammer Go Bonk! 10/10
5980,the game always get crashed although I have 3080 GC and ryzr9 processor. I reinstall the game twice but still the same problem.
5981,ive actually got a lot more time on the ps4 but d2 is one of the best games ive played in recent years top 5 easy
5982,"I've been an on again, off again player for years ever since the original Destiny beta. Something about this game no matter how much it pisses you off, makes you come back for more. The grind is addicting and trying to farm for weapons and armor is like a drug. Being a solo player isn't bad, but you'll want to find a clan to join or find some friends to play with. If not, you can always use Bungie.net and use the fireteam option to find randoms to join in the more difficult game types. I like that the seasons add something new every few months, though the game can get expensive with each new major add-on. Definitely try the free option before you buy."
5983,"its very fun and you can always improve
"
5984,"i love this game
"
5985,she's a 10 but...
5986,NO WAY TO understand THE PROGRESS OF THE GAME. I'm stoke even using the interned as a Guide.
5987,destiny is simple the best game created. miss d1 wish it was on steam
5988,grindy
5989,constantly evolving game that adds new content every season.
5990,Great game! 100% recommend.
5991,"The game itself is a fun, good game but my problem is with its monetization. Bungie is asking to much money for almost every aspect of the game. At first were the DLCs like CoO and Warmind with the 30-40 dollars anual expension, the first 2 were  pretty pricey but ok i guess. Then from the beginning there was the cashshop with really expensive stuff (stuff not being required to play the game but still) and the seasonal system, there being 4 seasons each costing like 10 dollars, the overall price of the season pass being 30 dollars so it became 30-40$ annual expension and the 30$ seasson pass. And not to mention the first season that comes with every new expension is sold SEPARATELY so you are enjoying the expension with its campaiing and other stuff, you finnish all those things and see there is more to do but the season pass not active box pops up and it turns me off immediately so might you. And lately with the 30$ anniversary and the 20$ duality dungeon being sold separately they really reached new levels of greediness.
So unfortunetly if you like the game and you do agree with these things, i recommend you buying the expension or the deluxe or whatever from G2A, it's way cheaper there and won't feel scammed if you are tight with money."
5992,"Worst game I've ever played in my life
I love it"
5993,awesome game
5994,"I love Destiny... I do.

But it's probably the most unfriendly game for new players ever... A real learning cliff to figure out what the hell is happening.."
5995,not vr supported
5996,bungie jumping is fun
5997,.
5998,"Before you install this game, don't. :)"
5999,centipede
6000,noice
6001,YES
6002,game
6003,"nice for now
need a lot time
"
6004,I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!
6005,"EVERYTHING
"
6006,"game is fun when there is content. otherwise it is the same thing over and over and over again and it gets very boring. i love the game when there is something to do, but the periods in between are stale. the pvp is annoying but im not a fan of pvp either way and stay away from it typically. some things need nerfs in pvp like the glaive shield, and other weapons probably. but is fun game! recommend<3"
6007,best game 2017
6008,enjoyable game just everything is behind a paywall
6009,"idk this game is just trying to make me pay a large amount of money to progress in the game and i dont really enjoy that too much, also they completely got rid of the red war and that was just dumb to do because i wanted to replay that again but ig not. they should let new players play the original campaign atleast so that they would understand better and enjoy a good grind at the same time."
6010,I found very entising but I did have to give them my credit card details alot.
6011,cool game would reccomend and its free too except will always ask you to pearchase witch queen
6012,it good.
6013,"either hate it or love it
"
6014,its good...

6048,"Game cab be daunting at first, but it is fun in the sense that you can make your own input in your journey as a guardian."
6049,its alright
6050,"I want to start by saying that I do enjoy the game. I have over 800 hours on xbox alone and have given Bungie more money than I would like to admit. But that's one of the main issues. Unless you spend money you are severely limited on what you can do. Want to do Nightfalls, Raids, or the seasonal activity with rewards? Sorry, no can do. Want to craft the DLC guns despite being able to find them in the world? Nope, gotta pay that $40 fee. If you're wanting to play without paying, look elsewhere. Destiny 2 has a similar system to a lot of mobile games and eastern MMO's. You get to play to a certain point and then paywall.

Next I want to touch on balance, which is something that Bungie doesn't seem to understand. I get the concept of releasing something new and making it overpowered to get attention back to your game then nerfing it down to what you actually intended, but that's not the only issue. Bungie nerfs items/abilities based on usage rates rather than actual strength. The Heavy GL Anarchy is a perfect example. Though it was very good for endgame content, the reason they nerfed it was because of how high the usage rates were. The same thing happened with the Hunter class, though most of those nerfs have been reversed with the subclass 3.0 system. There's also the very obvious favoritism within the company in terms of classes. Just a reminder that it took them 4 YEARS to nerf top tree Dawnblade, and don't even get me started on Chaos Reach and Shadebinder. I don't have any real issues with Hunters or Titans, though Thundercrash and Invisibility can be mildly irritating.

I am aware that making a game is no easy thing, and occasionally things slip through the cracks. But the fact that they very rarely listen to the community and opt for graphs instead has been making their forward progress almost zero. I would like to also point out that comments are turned of for a reason. I posted this as a warning to new player and for players looking to jump back in, and I know for a fact that me dunking on Warlocks is bound to summon the Warlock mains to complain about the dodge mechanic (which they also have btw). This isn't meant to be disrespectful in any way, this is meant to point out the shortcomings of the company in hopes that they find a way to fix them. So if anyone at Bungie is reading this, for the love of god please check yourself, because I don't want to see your ship sink from something that could have been prevented.

Why the 1001 special terms, and complicated bs. No one - including the developers - understands what the heck is going on, what are we supposed to do with all of the available modifications, shields, armor, stones, whatever. It feels like managing an inventory in a company where you don't know what business the company is in. Secondly, really, there is no story. There is no arch, there is nowhere I am supposed to go. All I do is add destinations, add quests, go shoot some bad boys (some of which are literally IMPOSSIBLE to kill btw) and then I am done. What am I seeking? What is my goal in the game? what am I supposed to do other than shooting and killing aliens, or whatever term you use for them? There could be a goal, it's just not even remotely clear. Tune down the terminology. Introduce a plot that takes the player from one level to another, with possible side quests. And for heaven's sake, why do you not restock my heavy ammo after I get killed in respawn restricted zones? If you are going to make me start the whole thing from the beginning, you SHOULD put me back in the same status I was in at that time. Otherwise, just allow me to respawn with my ammo depleted. For God's sake."

6096,It's just a really good game.
6097,"I had an odd week off of work so I decided to get back into destiny after dropping it in year one. I had all my characters maxed out, I finished everything thrice over, god rolls on most stuff, perfect stat distributions, so I figured, ""hey, I'll just pop back in and cruise to the new light cap, I've already got my builds figured out so I can just infuse a couple things and be right back at the top."" NOPE, all my stuff has been ""sunset"" or locked at base light level, none of the base content is still in the game, all my exotics I spent hours getting are worthless because the perks don't exist anymore.

 So I took it from the top, watched some youtube vids on the new mechanics, what was meta, and started over. It's been 80 hours and I'm just getting all my characters to 1530. (I've seen people at 1600 so I'm still a ways off) But I'm getting there. 

The game is still fun, matchmaking on trials and Nightfalls is something I never thought I'd see, and the witch queen is a blast, I got all the available content after a little bit of messing around and I like it a lot. the grind is still a killer but if you take it one character at a time it's a good bit of fun. I'm a forever solo player and there's still a lot of content, but those absolute end game activities are still just as agonizingly out of reach for me. No Raids, No GM Nightfalls, but that's always been the case so I guess it's ok. 

All in all, a great looter Shooter, If you solo I'd say 8/10, but on those few occasions I get a Fireteam together, 10/10."

Buy this game now. You want to keep playing it. I can't stop. I can't stop playing destiny 2. Before the season of the haunted I had three dogs an d two kids, now all I have is my godroll fatebringer (much better).

I got chee on it, chicken, salsa verde, and also I got the pico de gallo too. Becayse of that this game has my upvote, if the gameplay were any different I wouldnt be so inclined to not leave my house and order that burrito. I hope you find this game as I did.

6124,"How the mighty have fallen.

The current state of Destiny is dire. If you are a newcomer, you are going to have a bad time. If you are a returning player, you better get ready to pay Bungie for a season pass which will give you a slow drip story combined with a weekly quest grind that is just copy and pasted each season.

Content is constantly vaulted, lowering the actual content in the game. Planets are barren, underwhelming with the most mundane and basic things to do. Rise and repeat yearly events which are usually broken each time too. There is just no reason to invest time into this game when your time is not rewarded.

Never buy an expansion for this game as there is a good chance it will just got vaulted and you won't have access to it again for a long time. Bungie will tell you it is their way of keeping things fresh but when content gets vaulted for so long with no worthy substitute stepping in to replace it then what is the point?

I put in an ungodly amount of time into Destiny 1 back on PlayStation and it was worth it at the time. I never put in as much time on Destiny 2 and aforementioned reasons are just a few why.

At this point, I'm not sure Bungie even knows what they want to do with Destiny and frankly, I'm glad Bungie no longer develop Halo as I dread to think how it would have turned out these days. The golden age of Destiny (if there truly was one) is definitely over and I am saddened to think that the name Bungie doesn't mean much anymore."
6125,"Major patch : game good

3 day after major patch : heavy repetitive garbage

repeat"
6126,"[h1]TLDR: Please stop being a naive consumer. Don't support horrendous business practices within the gaming industry.[/h1]

Over 2000 hours into the Destiny 2, most of my hours not tracked from the other launcher and my Playstation. I was a day 1 Destiny 1 guardian, was in love with everything about the universe. I am so sad to see how far Bungie has fallen with their horrendous monetization, locking paid content, constantly forcing their ""fans"" to fund the latest installment that will promise to make everything you have previously paid for, obsolete. 

I am honestly head scratching confused how any member of the gaming community defends the locking of paid content. The only reason Bungie didn't receive legal lash-back from withdrawing the content that most had already paid for, was the switch to free to play, which they carefully did in order to not receive a class action lawsuit.

The introduction of the Eververse microtransaction store to the destiny universe was supposed to be temporary to continue help the development of D1. In Destiny 2, when you level up they will give you a loot-box ""engram"" that you must physically walk to the in-game microtransaction store to open, its extremely predatory to get you to constantly return to the store, trying to milk more money from the consumer.

Every season has an influx of massive store updates, armors skins, weapon skins, vehicles, paints, armors, TONS AND TONS of content that should have been added to the game through a DLC, not micro-transactions.

This is before even touching the new TERRIBLE experience new players get when experiencing this universe for the first time. Just tossed into a universe, hardly any explanation of the setting, proper explanation of any previous altercations and events, the characters you do meet you will have 0 connection with. After you finish a mission or two they already will try to get you to upgrade to the most recent DLC in order to progress the story. Which..... will be obsolete and completely removed come the next DLC....

The current trend in Destiny and other games is really sad to see.
Never forget that Bungie is, first and foremost a business. A business' job is to make money."
6127,"750 hours so far.

My only coherent thoughts...

Gud game."
6128,yes.
6129,its good
6130,mid
6131,"bought content for 40 USD 2 years ago; that content is now removed entirely with no way to access anything out of it

in addition, they removed 4 areas that existed (and was free to play). so the game went from having 6-7 distinct and explorable worlds with their own quest lines and stories, to having 2. we played through the cosmodrome questline in 2 hours, and reached the end of free to play content in about 10 hours.

despite having already spent over 40 USD on the game, this is all the content available to me.

i genuinely feel this is robbery, and i would not be surprised if this sort of thing would be outlawed in my country.

i highly recommend NOT BUYING anything, as content you buy will be removed to force you to buy new content in order to play the game. it is not free to play, it is just a demo enticed to make you buy content. i was tricked by it once a few years ago; very disappointed to see that this is the way they handle their userbase and paying customers.

it's a disgrace and is far worse than anything scummy i've ever seen on steam; i'm surprised steam allow them on their platform with this scummy design around DLC."
6132,"Love the game. It's a total shitshow for new players, though, and I therefore do not recommend it unless you have someone very patient with hundreds of hours across activities to walk you through things.

Enemies teleport, maps don't load, UI lags, names on killfeeds are blank, etc etc etc. Right now the UI issues are bad enough it's keeping me from doing activities I really enjoy. To say nothing about well-reported balancing issues, tedious grind and all the rest.

A great game that you should not play."

6136,"Destiny 2 is a good game but it will be the developers own doing if the games player base falls buy pushing for that extra cash out of your pockets and in to there`s.
I had this on Battle.net before steam so my hours are not correct .

DLC love it or hate it buy or don`t. 

Not to include MMO Titles here because they were always linked to SUBS and additional expansions so Video Games 1st pay DLC i can remember caused massive gaming political splits and conversations . Don`t buy DLC as we set a president / or Buy DLC to expand the game you love to play . And much more.

 So in this Game we have a lot of in game real money spending along with optional PAY for DLC ..... but
The developers have removed some of the DLC content witch costed us money so you can not replay the content if you wish to nor can new gamers experience some DLC that the veterans have. 

This is a dangerous gaming model to support in my opinion and brings back the gaming politics of DLC from years ago only to a new level. 
It maybe because the games content would require more and more HD space but ive brought games witch state hardware maybe be required to be graded in future updates. 

And if consoles cant keep up then the content should just remain in tact in 100% on PC platform so at least on PC there would be a go to platform to experience everything."

6150,"I would say yes, but ever since I upgraded to the Radeon Rx 6800xt, honestly, the game has become unplayable. I have virtually no problems playing other games, but Destiny 2 seems to be the only bad egg in the basket. It sucks, because I played this game a lot up until this season. Would I say the game is worth the play though? Yes. Would I say that one should go through the struggle of trying to stop the game from stuttering with crazy methods, including overclocking or even reinstalling windows? No. 

Honestly, at that point, cut your losses and maybe look into cloud gaming just for this game, or go to another game. 

Maybe if Bungie fixes this stuttering issue with the AMD Drivers, then I would give this a thumbs up."

The annual DLC's are always stunning and the seasonal events can be so much fun. I highly recommend it to people who like FPS but aren't a huge fan of things like CoD and Battlefield. The world of Destiny is every changing/evolving as time goes on and there are always people willing to help new lights get started.
6178,"so i heard destiny was bad from my friends who have played so i didnt play it when i could originally, so when i played it i found out its similar to halo mixed with a demon slayer feel its fun to play but 1 thing i would change is tone back on multiplayer needed quests not everyone has people to play with as i reached a part where i cant continue in such a short time cause i dont have people to play with"

6184,"i like it, but after a while it gets boring. a very grindy game"
6185,"As fun and beautiful and just plain cool as this game is I simply can't recommend a title, particularly one of such high quality and such a large budget in the Triple A space, that feels its acceptable in any way or even healthy as they've claimed; to delete paid content frequently. Do NOT purchase expansions of any kind in Destiny, as they WILL be deleted from the game and removed from play. You read that right, the stuff you paid for? especially at the absurd premiums Bungie demand? Yep, they get thrown in the trash and usually not all that long after release in retrospect. Don't know the story? Bungie doesn't care, they deleted it all and won't elaborate whatsoever on what you're supposed to be doing, why you're doing it, who the characters you're interacting with are, why you are, and what this universe in general is about. Because they've deleted any and all ways of understanding, caring for, and becoming a part of the game's universe all you know is ""big white ball nice, I have floating robot, blue man cool, many microtransactions."" And that's it. That's YOUR knowledge of Destiny. Why these decisions have been made, and continue to be, are beyond me. Makes it nigh impossible to get into the game as a new or returning player and hits you in the face every few months with one of the most anti-consumer practices I've ever seen in a game. Destiny 2 is a ton of fun and looks great but man, these negatives are just far too glaring to ignore and beyond what I might be able to recommend to others."
6186,Not a game meant for someone who doesn't want to focos on one game. Coming back even after two seaons means i have to pay for a completely new piece of content as the game vaults all old content (even purchased). Not bad to play casually but annoying when looking to jump back into a once good narrative experience.
6187,I officially have no life thanks to this game. 10/10 will play again.
6188,fun

6190,"Destiny two is one of the most inspirational and amazing games I've ever played.In my entire life. There's just nothing like it! They just put every little aspect in. Whether you're on Mars flying.Your ship attacking aliens.Or fighting off demons in a pocket dimension. It's just too good.And it's free.This is just revolutionary. This really shows everything you could do with computers. I read this game legitimately, 100 out of 10. The graphics are also absolutely amazing.I've played this game with my friends and they were so blown away about every little aspect about this game. And they do daily updates like more than once a week. In my opinion, this game is better than GTA Roblox, literally every game on Steam.It's just revolutionary.I think this will play a big role in our future.This is my.Type of game. I've searched every single game for a game like this.The only other game that's close to how good this game is is No Man's Sky.But it's $60 :/And Destiny two is free and better. :) And I am very picky in this game, just takes the cake by far. 

–Must read–
Everyone that's reading this must download this game.I'm telling you! Go!
-hey devs Appreciate what you're doing so much. I wish you the best of luck. Have an amazing weekend. Bye-
"
6191,"DLC are ridiculously overpriced, but the free base game is great and has plenty of content!"
6192,AWSOME
6193,Bad game
6194,I do not like it but my friends do. It just not the looter shooter for me.
6195,"absolute thrash and i love it
should be renamed ""¿who can spend more?"""
6196,Really fun wih friends
6197,Fashion is the true end game.
6198,I've no idea whats going on but I could play the game with my friend pretty much instantly and that's fucking mint
6199,damn good gunplay ong
6200,"The PvP is the most unbalanced, unfun experience I have ever seen in a multiplayer game."
6201,its a fun multi player story based game
6202,Took me 6 hours to download but it was worth it. Great game and less laggy then fortnite
6203,Very fun free features. Gets a little repetitive without  the dlc
6204,very fun and lots to do not to mention all the cool armor and weapons plus being able to upgrade and color them! :)
6205,bollz
6206,"So that's a game that's not at all easy to get into, things ranging from story to basic mechanics are not well explained and you'll more than likely have to do your own research to understand how the game works and what's going on in the game in general by going to youtube or just google it (or if you're fortunate enough just get someone that plays it already to help you). HOWEVER I cannot see myself not recommending this game ! The guns and movement both feel really good compared to other games, the devs are really open when it comes to communication with the community while updating the game year after year, the story, yeah sure it's hard to get into at first but the world Bungie has built is just incredible and is the main reason I keep coming back to this game. 
TL;DR 
It's a game that you'll need some time to get into but I definitely recommend to at least give it a try (the free part gives you an idea of what the rest of the game has to offer) and not give up after like an hour :)"
6207,its been active this long for a reason. Bungie knows how to make a fun online shooter and with cross save you dont have to start over if you played the game on console like I did
6208,ye
6209,Dont bother spending $ and time on such a hallow game ! all they want is youre $ they have gotten so lazy for what they want you to buy! hell you cant even play this on the deck! but play if you like looking at the same thing and same boring loot to be honest this isnt a looter its more like picking up trash form the sidewalk and droping it in the trash can lol
6210,Best game ever made
6211,no
6212,yes
6213,good
6214,"good game

6215,"I have around 1800 hours in this game across PS5 and PC. Love the gameplay, new super rework is goood, gun play is great. Yes it can be a bit grindy, and not all the seasons have amazing content but its a good solid game that I always come back to."
6216,"I have a love hate relationship with this game. Some aspects are really good, and others a major pain in the rear. At this point unless you want to grind I would wait a couple more years to get into the game. Really solid game overall though."
6217,super cool
6218,"Confusing Early Game Experience, all the content that friends raved about is gone, the only thing that remains is the Grind and PvP, unless you want to pay of course. Waste your time with literally anything else, and don't support Bungie."
6219,"definitely one of the games of all time
"
6220,"its 85 gigs you beter have a big hard drive
"
6221,destiny 2
6222,im addicted
6223,great game!
6224,I recently tried to come back into this game only to find literally everything I've ever played of it GONE. None of the lore makes sense with the new player experience. It's like looking into a mirror and seeing a withered old man in return.
6225,This game sucks
6226,GUNPLAY IS ALWAYS SOLID PLUS I ALWAYS FIND MYSELF COMING BACK TO THE GAME TIME AND TIME AGAIN!!!! Also its Brads favorite game of all time because of the beers!!!
6227,"DONT GET THIS
"
6228,help me.
6229,"FOR MORONS! The game as stupid as possible without stable multiplayer and without a proper plot. How much hype, how much inflated rating. And the game, as shit is, remained for the repulse("
6230,very fun multiplayer and single player. some parts that are scary as well. it is a great game
6231,Fun game
6232,"s u n s h o t   =   p o c k e t   n u k e   i n   P v E

6234,Great community game. Can play f2p or get expansions
6235,"Even if you are a god that can perdikt the futur somebody in the crucible is still better than you.
But all together a good game, the best part is the ammunt of warcriems that you commit against the alliens.
Well NATO doesn´t exsist any more."
6236,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
6237,Save yourself
6238,good
6239,"good
"
6240,"For a new player:
-The guns feel and look great to use. Bungie still have the magic touch with crafting memorable weapons in video games. 
-The abilities are visually stunning and have enough impact in the PvE arenas to make you feel like badass. 
-Art & Sound is stellar. Skyboxes going this hard should be illegal.
-The game has gotten very easy to get whatever it is you're searching for, with weapon crafting and powerful drops. Which means it is easy for anyone to pick up and join in on the fun quickly.
But:
-The story is lacklustre season to season.
-The PvP experience is stale with a lack of maps in live rotation, and is often dominated by the seasonal mod/exotic item that goes unchallenged for months. 
-You'll have to pay money to experience the best of what Destiny can offer. Yearly, story-driven DLC & Dungeons are some of Destiny's best content. (I'm unsure if some of the older content is free or not, if they aren't yet removed entirely.)
-If you're a solo player, you'll only experience slices of what the game offers. Raids are the End Game PvE content which requires 5 additional players to complete & higher difficulty activities (Dungeons-pve, Nightfalls-pve, Trials of Osiris-pvp) recommend 2 extra players (unless you're highly skilled).
-FOMO is definitely present in the cash shop & season pass.

Joining the franchise late, you've missed some pivotal storylines to the Destiny Universe and the game doesn't really help to catch you up on what has happened, they just expect you to know everything that is going on without it actually being in the game. Oh.
Content is removed from the game after a few years. Bungie credit storage/bloat as the culprit but the game is getting more and more unstable on PC as the years go on, even with removal of large swathes of content.

TL:DR
I hate that I love this game/franchise. It's a tedious grind solo & some content gets stale far too quickly. 
Try it with some buddies to fully enjoy your time with it. Otherwise, the new player experience sucks.

*May edit in the future as the content of game changes over time."
6241,"Chicken Nuggets baby, lots of chicken nuggets"
6242,"Great Game easy to get sucked into and spend alot of time playing
"
6243,"Like: I love the way the character moves and jumps. 
Really nice shooting mechanics. Interesting lore. Nice graphics. 

Dislike: A bit glitchy/buggy at times. The menu system is confusing. The lore is a bit hard to follow at times and needs to be explained by a third party. 

Overall: A really nice game if you can live with a few drawbacks. I would recommend! 
"
6244,very nice
6245,Looter shooter and a good one at that.
6246,"good game, it is a little annoying to buy everything."
6247,very nice
6248,"Space ninjas, Titan Smash!"
6249,i have 54 days of play time on xbox i will never get that time back.
6250,"It's a pretty fun game. Getting new powerful items feels so exciting. But you have to work hard for em. Trust me, you'll experience cock and ball torture while grinding for Exotic gear. But it's worth it tho. You can still get good items without buying the Season Pass."
6251,Games Mid
6252,"Destiny 2 is awesome! Personally, I cannot count the number of times my friends and I have commented to one another about the stunning graphics and the mesmerizing amount of imagination that has been put into this game. Sure, it can be overwhelming for newcomers because of the extreme amount of content and entire worlds to explore, but that's also what makes it so great. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is greatness. It's obvious that a lot of time and effort has gone into the development of this ever expending game. New content just keeps coming and it is extremely impressive!"

6261,"The most grindy neckbeard game yet, stay away if you like grass."
6262,"dont recommend starting, lots of repetitive grinding, every activity feels the same, just opening the game feels like a chore"
6263,"Excellent looter-shooter with decent progress/ grinding. Cross save is great, apart from having to purchase all DLCs on the platforms you play on if you want to access everything. This is not because of Bungie, the platform providers just want their cut.

Crossplay works flawlessly, very happy with that as we play as a group via PS, PC and Xbox!"
6264,no
6265,good game. boost vex drop rate tho.
6266,It is your Destiny 2 play this game
6267,"""Who’s joe?"" a distant voice asks.

Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location.

The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself split open and a horrific creature crawled from the ground, covered in mucus and tar.

”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered.

The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in fear.

""I did a little trolling."" the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth."
6268,"Honestly you're not missing anything if you skip this. I'm sure it used to have something great going for it but just save yourself the drive space at this point. Also, returning players if you're reading this, I only just found out they scrapped all the original content and the first two paid DLCs so, I guess you can look forward to maybe looking at the moon and a little bit fo mars and Europa.

This is just a cash cow, it's kinda sad honestly."
6269,".
"
6270,game kinda mid ngl
6271,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this game until....I had enough of....
force people to play multi player to get some weapons
best PvP weapons (for me) are all from multi player activities.
do not allow people to match randomly to get multi player weapons or cool looking weapons
quit after 1500+ hours"
6272,"Loving the game, always find myself getting sucked in. It does get a little boring sometime but I always come back
"
6273,Yes
6274,"Its alright.
"
6275,"While I have sunk in a lot of hours into this game, and have enjoyed time spent with my best friend in it because of the experience with him, I cannot in good moral consciousness recommend this game to anyone as it currently is. It is a horrifically unstable game that constantly kicks you out because the servers are garbage, and despite the raving some people give it for the story for this season, it is lack luster at best. The best comparison to give it is being given drops of water between days and days of content drought, but it tastes of stagnation or dust. The Season Pass was the worst cost of play I have ever made given the promises to results tendered. If you're already in, then whatever dude enjoy it fully, but if you're new you'd best think five times before booting this piece of software."

6283,this game its sickkkkk
6284,gods game
6285,The game is fun with a group of people. The concept for the story is more relevant than in the first. You don't need to spend countless hours looking up lore for the game to make sense.
6286,its fun
6287,This game sucks.
6288,Its alright. Got bored pretty quick.
6289,Would not recommend
6290,"Was gonna hop back in, linked my Xbox save to steam, I gotta re-buy DLC.  Try downloading D2 on the Xbox PC app, have to re-buy the DLC.  Go fuck yourself bungie/whoever made the call to not let the licenses transfer"

6297,YES
6298,"Unless you're willing to spend 30$ to 400$ for DLCs dont download it.

They deleted the whole Story of Destiny 2. You create a character, play the 2h long imported first mission of Destiny 1 on the imported map of Destiny 1 and then you get to the HUB and can do either PvP or verry limited PvE.

It still gets a 5/10 from me - the actual shooting is that good."

6334,: /
6335,"Just play Warframe, it has more content and doesn't try to take your entire bank account.
The reason why I say this is I have 117 hours on pc and over 100 days on Xbox and I regret every second of it as the gameplay just isn't fun and barely passable as there is every so often a half decent update such as Witch queen but then there isn't anymore content for another 3-4 months, whereas with Warframe there are constant updates adding in new content that's fun to play but at times it can be extremely grindy and time consuming but the grind isn't a pain, and the rewards are always super unique such as a weapon that can either fire single shots or just dump it's entire magazine in just one super burst. Warframe also has far more classes with each Warframe feeling like a entirely new class while D2 at best has 12 different classes (3 primary classes with 4 subclasses). Overall warframe is a much better game and is free too."

In fact, 1 in 42,069 players touch grass after playing this game for 60 minutes. To put that into perspective, 96% of the playerbase have unfortunately never seen sun light unless it was that of a hammer wielding titan or accidentally got through their window and onto their skin.

6366,"I played destiny 1 and destiny 2 for a good while than I left. I am back to the game since a month and I can see that many things changed. All the weapons and armors from the previous years are gone to a category called The legacy which you cant raise the light of above 1350. I believe it's a negative move and the only goal of that move is to force players to pay to get new armors from the new DLCs . I don't mind paying but are you telling me I have to pay for the weapons that you brought from destiny 1 ? these weapons were free in the first place and we earned them but we have to pay to get them. ill give you an example. Bungie gave the players a new dlc called the 30th for 20$ or something like that only to get the gallarhorn. How funny is that? is that the way you are telling us you are out of content? cant you make new weapons? I don't care if it was the longest quest on earth? most of the new weapons cannot be compared to destiny 1. Destiny 1 died peacefully, but the developers are not happy with destiny 2 so they will kill it as well. I am dissapointed with what destiny 2 has came to. It's a unique game, but it died. Rest in piece D2"

fuck gambit tho"
6414,Love the difficulty of this game and that you need a good team. but I can become tedious and boring at times.
6415,"game is a love hate relationship

you'll keep playing til you're in pain :D!"
6416,good
6417,"A seriously fun game, i'd recommend trying it to see if you like it (because it's free to play) and then buy the DLC which basically makes a full game. DLC is great. The game overall is similar to Destiny 1 where the DLC's made the game so much better. Very enjoyable gameplay. I'd give it a solid 9/10 (Including DLC)."
6418,very epic
6419,Good but grindy. Fun if you have friends to play with. Decently balanced in crucible until a new weapon gets buffed.
6420,the worst game i have ever played filled with bugs and the map sistem/track its complete dogshit
6421,Pretty nice. Would play again.

I HAVE SPENT OVER £100 ON THIS GAME, BUT I'M GLAD IT HASN'T GONE OVER THAT"
6426,yes
6427,not for beginners
6428,Try it :3 or not its garbage.
6429,I haven't touched grass in years. Best Game Ever!
6430,YES
6431,Rlly gud
6432,good
6433,"This game is driving me insane, I hate it but I can’t stop spending my time and money on it. I’ve dropped well over $150 on this game and I regret it every time I look at my bank account. I make minimum wage and this game takes half of it. The first thing I do when I wake up or get off of school is launch this game. I have 230 hours in this game and I’ve only owned it since late May. The game is hard to get into because they are trying to protect you from the money and time-leeching trap this game becomes after you make the mistake of deciding to buy a DLC. This game is rewiring my brain to depend on it and I am allowing it to.

Fun game tho, 10/10"
6434,good
6435,"good expansion well designed and artistry is incredible
"
6436,very good game hard to find out how to stay on the campaign though.
6437,nice

6439,my wife left me
6440,"Well, it's the game that I spend so much time in.

The game I love but also loathe.
The ways you can enjoy the game, the fun with other players, and for sure an amazing story.
If you are into lore, than this one will devour you, because there are a lot of great characters and villains, either the Goddess of Deceit, the Kell of Dark alliance or Heretic Emperor of once Dominant Empire.
[b] However[/b], the biggest down is probably the accecibility to some activities. It's due to the expansion system. I don't say I like it. But the reveals and plot twists here are really keeping great. Do not hate me because of my opinion, I'm only mortal man, just like you, Oh reader mine.

I'd say everyone can find his way of playing it. But trust me, don't try PvP ;)

If you will try it, and whether you will like it or not, we are all gonna become witnessed."
6441,really fun
6442,

6444,the combat and minimaxing of your carater feel amazing definitly feel like space wizards as you play and the story is quite intresting especially if you look into the lore stories.

6452,"It's okey, I guess"
6453,Have been playing the game for a long time now and can say the game has seen a lot of love from the team. The story keeps bringing me back and seeing what they have hidden has always keep me looking for the next one to help connect the universe.

6457,Insanely fun addicted game that is very hard to get into. Past that barrier you'll experience the best shooting you've ever had in a game by far.
6458,"When it comes to story and missions, Destiny 2 is a literal masterpiece. Online PVP is very unbalanced and hard, you really gotta grind for it when you want to be good at it"
6459,"Easily one of the worst money pits ive ever taken part of. I love it :)

(shout out to all of my friends who helped get me dlc's on both xbox and steam <3 )"
6460,FIX YOUR CURRENT BUG WITH MOST PLAYERS BUNGIE!!!!!  Current issue of Nightingale makes me hate this game at the moment.
6461,Was good when I first played it but now without buying the expansions there is no point. The story is all convoluted and doesn't make any sense. Ends up feeling like Destiny 1 expansions with some game play fixes.
6462,"Just don't.....Your life will prematurely end as you're sucked into endless hours of farming for exotics that will eventually be nerfed next season, and the cycle begins again. That's it, there's a few fun moments as you goof around, but don't expect good pvp content. The PVE, is alright."

6464,good

6471,i feel myself slipping back into this black hole of a game
6472,game go brr when you get kill. I like
6473,I highly recommend it. I've been playing it on Xbox for a while and recently switched to Steam. I wish I could play Red War again though. Not a fan of New Light.

6477,"Do you have a life? If so, don't touch this game. Do you not? Great! Right this way. Seriously though, do [i]not[/i] play this if you want to have free time and be able to enjoy it. You get one."
6478,"This game is like a caffeine addiction. When you're riding the buzz you can't get enough, but as soon as the crash hits you want it to get as far away from you as possible."
6479,GOOD
6480,great game
6481,"Fun Gameplay and Graphics.
All Around Great Game to mess around with friends and yknow...to shoot people when you're in that kind of mood.
I haven't explored much of the game other than the 3V3 but I have heard great things about the quests and such so I'm off to do those next"
6482,"This game has one thing and only one thing going for it. The gun play is stellar. The downside to this game is that a new player will be completely lost for months while the figure out all the ins and outs. The developers have removed so much of this game over time that the tiny morsels they left in to tell you about the game are insufficient. You would be better off watching a 4 hour lore film from YouTuber ""My Name Is Byf"" to get brought up to speed. 

Additionally, the developer, does not care about your time. So much time gated material. So much FOMO borrowed powers every season. The developers want you to experiment with different loadouts and builds, yet all of their mods to make these builds are locked behind an RNG NPC vendor. Some mods this vendor sells only once every 6 to 9 months. Sounds fund doesn't it. Honestly if you are on the fence, I'd say try it, its free. But don't expect to know what is going on for months. Or to be able to try out the really fun builds because all the mods are locked away from you for most likely an entire year."

6496,Love/hate relationship with this game.
6497,"been playing since Destiny 1 on PS4, there is no other shooter game as high quality as this that is multiplayer open world and also PvE focused
the loot system and events are fun and keeps it going 
solid mechanics , fun sci fi elements/themes
better than playing Battle arena games just to get stomped on by sweats who have nothing better to do all day"
6498,"Yes! For a game thats free to play, even though there are expansion packs, the game doesn't require expansion packs in order to be fun!"
6499,i dont need drugs when i have terrible exotic drop rates
6500,"If you're looking for a proper, established MMO the beginning of this game is quite fun. I don't have a lot of money to spend but am considering using my big $40 on the newest expansion, 'The Witch Lady has A Zombie Posse'. I don't spend much time on the storyline.

The gameplay is satisfying, cool moments are frequent, and the controls are mostly intuitive. Explosions feel big and guns feel powerful. Getting your quests for 'Arc' and 'Solar' subclasses unlocked early is key to happiness. PvP is for adults, I die instantly and often. If you're good I imagine you'll do better than me, but gear seems to matter. I'm terrible but I hide behind the more experienced players and try to apply damage, and that's fun long enough to get my quests done!

Xur the legendary shard seller is your friend when he comes out of his nap. Use the internet to find him.

I'm not sure how to find a clan yet.

That's all from my 19 hours of played time. I'm going back to it. If you want an update of my opinion leave a comment.

"
6501,"I used to remember destiny fondly as being really immersive and took a chunk of my time as a teen... so then like several yrs go by and i finally say fck it the game free now why not give a whirl....I really regret my decision i played through the same tutorial i do believe that was in the original destiny and was ready to grind my ass away but then i figure out THAT IS IT 2hr introduction and the rest of the main storyline is behind a paywall or whatever the "" vault "" is. Its really a shame tho this is a really great game if they didnt ruin it with going overboard with the dlc thing.... go play ffxiv tho at least u get what u pay for lololololol"
6502,"game is rlly good like it alot

What's more to love?"
6509,"d2 is a great game, I hate it"
6510,"TL;DR
(My opinion) Had the most fun when playing with friends. Solo is fun at times. There is a bit too much pay DLC and Grindy game is Grindy. (And if you want to compete. YOU WILL GRIND.)

Opinion Cont..
I wish steam would add a Meh Button for games. But had enough enjoyment to barely kickit to a thumbs up.
Too much catering to the PVP crowd in my opinion, but if thats what you came for Bungie got yer back!
Not a fan of all the nickle and dimeing DLC that at times prevents you from playing with friends that have more disposable income. 
Good graphics and the scale of things is good. 
"
6511,why is a 2 year dlc thats getting removed $30 USD
6512,hammer go bonk and make things explode
6513,"Logged in for the first time since 2019 to see what has become of this game, maybe try a raid and check out some of the ""new content"". What a shocker it's all ctrl + c, ctrl + v Destiny 1 stuff. Three of the $40 paid expansions have been deleted from the game and replaced with Destiny 1 planets, strikes, and raids. Don't be fooled by the people wearing rose-colored glasses, nostalgia is no excuse for ""vaulting"" or ""sunsetting"" or whatever the mentally ill schizophrenics sick with Stockholm's Syndrome will tell you."
6514,"Very bad game. 
Absolutely a pain in the a**. 

I will never stop playing."
6515,They remove expansions and content you paid for from the game.

6526,"Before I started playing this game, there was quite the divide between my wife and I. She wasn't a big fan of video games, but I spend a decent amount of time playing them. I always tried to get her to play with me, but she always refused. She'd say, ""It's just not fun for me. I'm not good.""

But then I downloaded ""Destiny 2"" and everything immediately changed.

The gameplay is smooth, and the graphics are much better than I expected. The gun mechanics are the most satisfying I've ever seen in a game. There is a surprising variety in types of enemies and gear. It's always a rush when you have to make a split second decision on whether you're about to kill the boss alone, or revive your teammate. It has been a long time since I enjoyed a game this much.

My wife and I are getting a divorce"
6527,"If you like something it will be nerfed till you don't like it anymore, but you'll keep playing anyways."
6528,Amazing game the farm is ugh but amazing
6529,"Halo Infinite, but good."
6530,Good game
6531,"Game play is fun but the games overall cost is way too much. To play the game as of right now without any issues you need to buy the legacy collection ($75), forsaken pack ($25), shadowkeep ($32), beyond light ($37), and whatever current DLC's deluxe edition ($100) for seasons content and to access the new dungeons. Sadly the devs made it so owning the base DLC is not enough as they lock access to season content behind 1000 silver each season and added a new 2000 silver barrier for new dungeons which are both included in deluxe editions. All outdated DLC should be included in the newest DLC or at least the old dungeons so there are no issues with things such as not being able to complete nightfalls on multiple weeks as they are in a previous DLC you didn't want to buy. The devs have 0 respect for their players and are now the worst gaming company in my eyes, even below activision blizzard some how.




The content you get from buying everything isn't even worth it. If you enjoy the gameplay, stick to F2P as there is essentially no difference in game play and if you want to know more about the story, i can guarantee any lore recap youtuber will be more entertaining than playing this games story missions."
6532,"Mmmm, Good game"
6533,AHHHHH!!!!!!
6534,Its addicting
6535,very cool pp
6536,A great deal of fun without having to buy the DLC or microtransaction crap.

6546,completely captivating
6547,great game

6549,played it a bit it's not fun
6550,pay walls of plenty
6551,"Amazing game, wonderful story line, however the further you get into the game, you will find that there is not much to do until you own the DLC packs for this game. All in all, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoy shoot to loot games."

6559,"Bungie is ignoring their game breaking bug for months now. So if you never played this game and want to play it, you can't because they just don't care about new players.

To be exact, if you're a new player, you will never unlock your subclasses so basically you can't play the game as you're extremely underpowered and can't compete in anything.

Uninstalled after tutorial as as I cannot do any progress and can't play the game.

Well done Bungie, well done."
6560,Has absorbed my life for years 10/10

6563,Fun.  It is like Halo and World of World Craft combined to make a very fun game.

6565,I LOVE SPENDING MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!
6566,Dope not bad at all
6567,"Game has no direction now. The entire story has been retconned to the point where one doesn't exist. Each DLC practically forces you to dedicate your wallet to the game, which again has no clear future.

PvP is horrible, often consisting of 1 or 2 most used weapons, with almost all other weapons being inadequate. PvE is ok i guess, but the lack of story, direction, clear goals/objectives, and so on, make it difficult to find a reason to even play the game at all for me.

Overall? 3/10, has decent enough gameplay, with variety between pvp/pve depending on what you enjoy, but no reasons to play the game."
6568,"Buggiest, most expensive anti-player cheater ridden piece of shit game do not waste your money I promise you it isn't worth it."
6569,Its aight
6570,"Fantastic looter shooter
"
6571,"First and foremost if the tutorial had been put together as good as it is now, at launch this game would be doing better then great. As stated Destiny 2 is allot easier to pick up now, each of the starting missions shows you something new so you can get a feel for the game. Please note do not get over whelmed by the tips when your trying to go from one planet to the next. I am hooked this game is exactly what I have been searching for.

A few odds and ends. The first blue barrier you will encounter, if your just starting out, you have to get a few items to bring down. The second you will find you can shoot and destroy it, however there is a catch. If you are not on a mission to go to a hidden area, that you find, the barrier can not be brought down. Further catch  you need to look closely at your map to see where these hidden areas are. The next part is also important jumping in destiny 2 is key. The major mistake I made was jumping then tapping my space bar as quickly as possible. What you want to get used to doing is jumping then tapping your space bar once while your in the air. This will send your toon on a bit of a floating jump. This is very very helpful on many missions. I hope this review helps. Have fun!"
6572,GReat game
6573,"It's a brilliant game, until you get into it.. then you'll forget the meaning of grass. Game itself is 7.8/10"
6574,Fun with friends!
6575,Said I'd never get into it but here we are LMAO. Is it pricey? Yeah. Is it time consuming? If you let it be. Nonetheless this game is super fun and I'd recommend at least the vanilla version to anyone interested in it. Give it a shot and see if you like it!
6576,"I don't know if I like this game or not 
"
6577,fortjit
6578,"A Tier game: 
- Satisfying 
- non stop content
- has both PvP and PvP [also PvPvE]
- amazing landscapes
- lots of amazing items 

Negatives
- bad free to play story
- PvP can be a little unfair to new players
- Lots of DLCs
- big 

The game is quite impressive, from the all the weapons, activitys, maps and more the game really stands out. 
I have to say tho i played the game with some friends who have never played. They both got the game for free and the starting campaign is the most boring shit ive ever watched. 
But if you are looking for a really good destiny 2 experience and want to skip past the boring bull shit get forsaken or beyond light DLC. 

Its a good game with even better artist behind making the game look beautiful. (no joke the game has some of the most amazing art and concepts)

"
6579,pretty solid game
6580,"I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS GAME I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD OR BAD THING SHIT!!!!

But man do I love this game so much."
6584,this game takes up all my time and i still dont know how to shoot my gun
6585,Lots of content - always good to come back to
6586,If u love to grind a game and not get bored then this is it dont listen to the people who say its a dead game they are just brain dead themselves.
6587,:THUMBS UP:
6588,
6589,Mmmm Destiny
6590,only fun after buying content.
6591,RETURNING PLAYER FROM XBOX WOW SO DISORGANIZED DOES NOT GIVE ANY GOOD SENSE OF DIRECTION FOR STORY AND IT AUTO LOADED ME INTO AN AREA WHEN I LOGGED IN I AM VERY DISAPOINTED IN THE STATE OF THE GAME IT MAKES IT A PAIN FOR RETURNING OR NEW PLAYERS
6592, this game sucks dont play it.
6593,"im going to kill myself because of this game

very good"
6594,"I've played this game since it came out. Of course I go through phases of playing since it wears me out at the end of each season or expansion; however, I thoroughly enjoy the process of leveling, filling out my loot collection, finding new DPS metas, etc. The feel with the guns and most weapon types in this game is like no other game. I recommend everyone try this game, especially to the point of finishing your first raid with a group of randos. 99% of players I match with on LFG are super helpful and have a great attitude towards helping achieve the goal. Great game, and I hope the next expansions keep getting better."
6595,Great game. i am also gay for the men
6596,This game caused me to kill both my parents and run away into hiding. This isn't a review its a confession. My family is buried at Andrew's house. Find him and kill him please. btw this game is shit
6597,very nice game but i left it as its constructed in a way to only grab money constantly from you
6598,Nice
6599,"This game is worse than old school runescape, and that's saying a lot."
6600,I don't know why i am addicted to this game i hate it so much content is slow and dry  but yeah over 2000 hours would recommended for people who want to slowly leak time away also fun gun go bang bang so makes game worth it no matter what 77/77
6601,Very cool
6602,Game was clearely made and is currently being developed by either 6 year olds or clones of hellen keller
6603,My only regret is that it took so long for me to try this game out. This is the most fun I have had in years!
6604,im too far gone
6605,"ive played destiny since the destiny 1 beta release on my xbox 360 and i have played and loved this game since 2017, i grew up in high school with this game so i have lots and lots of fun memories in this game! only played on pc for 2 years while the rest was xbox 360 / xbox one and now also my xbox series x. would recommend to any people who like fps games!"
6606,yes
6607,good
6608,"Love, hate relationship tbh"
6609,"I fucking hate this game. I've been in a toxic love hate relationship with Destiny and Destiny 2 for 6 years and I've been complaining ever since during my entire grind.






10/10 would dump another 1200 hours in to the grind."
6610,I have 20 hrs on record right now and i have had so much fun just meting people and doing missions.
6611,Very good game
6612,"Destiny 2 is an beautiful fps game with great campaigns. There is so much diversity in the weapons and armor you can use, and the cosmetics look amazing, letting you really have a guardian of your own. But there are always a couple downsides to anything. For me, the only downside is the large prices of the DLCs, and a lot of things always saying that you need Forsaken for this, and Beyond Light for that. Overall, the game is amazing, and I am simply obsessed with this game, and is worth every gig."
6613,"Been playing this game since the Forsaken release. Lots of fun. Better with friends. Even though I say I hate the PvP, I find my self playing it the next day."
6614,"It's very hard to get started, but once your settled in, the game is very fun and rewarding."
6615,good
6616,Not a dead game
6617,"Its alright, if youre new i wouldnt get into it though"
6618,i love this game it is SO ADDICTING
6619,"Beautiful visually, cool weapons and abilities, but multiplayer pve is not fun. As a brand new player you get thrown in with experienced players that all seem to sprint to the end of the map; you're left trying to figure out what's going on and not really able to enjoy the game. Feels like the objective is to rush to the end, not really play."
6620,"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold."
6621,"Bungie continues to repeat the same mistakes they made with the first game. Bungie chooses to listen to the minority of super casual players in terms of balancing the PvP in this game. As someone who has put thousands of hours into this game across multiple platforms, I can say that I will not be continuing to support this company. If Bungie were to turn around tomorrow and fix all the problems with the game, I still would not come back to this game, simply because I do not trust the company anymore. If you want to bring the PvP players back, if you want the game to not die out 3 weeks after the start of each season, the design team responsible for the in air accuracy changes should be fired. It's incredible that such a colossal mistake could be made with no repercussions, and with the dev team continuing to push a narrative that they know is false to the playerbase. 'If you're accurate, you'll still hit your shots'. Some of the biggest content creators for the game proved in a LAN event that this was a complete lie. To see a company lie to their entire playerbase with such a bold face, even now not admitting to their mistakes, is deplorable at best. If it weren't for the dedicated fan base stuck in a constant loop of sunk cost fallacy, this game would have already died out. I hope Bungie makes some serious internal changes to fix the game, or else Destiny 2 won't survive much longer."

6630,"OK, I will simply say that overall this is a fun game, IF you have a lot of time to play it, and/or if you have friends to play with. If neither of those fit you, don't play it. If you don't drop a ton of time into this thing, you're always going to be low level and can't really compete with the high up people, and some quests really work best with friends, but if you don't have any friends you can search online for people to help you with the same thing you're doing. Huge problem is, Bungie will not stop upgrading everyone's light (power) level, so if you were decently good, and you come back a year or two later, you're not complete garbage. Otherwise, pretty good game, has a good soundtrack, a lot to do, multiple worlds to explore, PvP, PvE, and PvPvE, and plenty of variety so you can choose your style of gameplay."
6631,"I hate it, its my favorite game."
6632,"removes paid content after some time, this is insane that people let developers get away with this"
6633,Free content really only goes so far. This game is best when you have friends to play with and if you have the money for all the DLC's that come out.
6634,"amazing game but d2 servers are really bad

Unnecessary flashes, confusing navigation in UI/ it checks all this marks from the start.

6641,FUN FPS
6642,"they made a good game, and then fucked it, for some reason the took out the most memorable moments for me, or broke them ;/ I'm talking about that part where the track ""journey"" plays..."
6643,"I'll try to be as objective as possible about this as it's really difficult to sell this game to people. Would definitely suggest reading though this if you're considering picking up this game.

Pros:
[list]
   [*] Great Visuals and Sound Design
   [*] Outstanding gunplay and movement that's hard to beat when it comes to FPS games
   [*] A LOT of variety when it comes to activities and loot to chase
   [*] Largely positive and extremely helpful community (there are dark areas too but it's really overblown)
   [*] YouTube coverage of the game is very thorough and you can easily find guides for literally everything
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
   [*] Awful onboarding experience that will likely require watching a full YouTube video to make sense of (Datto and KackisHD are great content creators for starters with many guides). If you're serious about starting this game, join a couple community discords and ask for help. Maybe even ask on the r/DestinyTheGame subreddit. 
   [*] Solo players can really only access 50-60% of the game without resorting to 3rd party LFG (Looking For Group) options so don't expect much forgiveness in that aspect. The [url=discord.com/invite/destiny2lfg] Destiny 2 LFG Discord [/url] is a great place to start, however.
   [*] The leveling system is extremely aged and quickly gets old for everyone involved.
[/list]

And some other bits of info that aren't necessarily pros or cons but you should know:
[list]
   [*] To get a general grasp of the game's mechanics, expect to invest 1-300 hours of playtime before you figure out what to do and what you like about the game. Heavy upfront investment, I know.
   [*] While the game is ""Free to Play"" you should really just think of that as like a 30 day free trial. The best parts of the game like dungeons (3 player end-game activity) and raids (6 player end-game activity) as well as the campaigns are locked behind DLC purchases. But you can at least play some dungeons (Prophecy) and raids (like The Vault of Glass) for free to get a feel for them.
   [*] If a friend got you into the game, bombard them with questions constantly and have them drag you into every activity that comes to their mind. Trust me.
   [*] Bungie has an ongoing weekly blog called 'This Week At Bungie' that releases every Thursday. You won't want to miss those if you're serious about playing Destiny 2.
[/list]

So that's about it for what you need to know about Destiny 2. Overall, I think it's the most fun game I've played and I genuinely love the community around it as that's the biggest reason I still continue playing.
I highly recommend the game but it's definitely not for everyone. I would only recommend starting it if you know you can put in the hours necessary to explore all parts of the game.

Good luck on your journey, fellow Guardian. Per audacia ad astra."
6644,"8/6 Recommended - Why you ask? Because you can add ""ussy"" to the end of every enemy and it's canon, you silly ""Risenussy"". Don't believe me? Just look at the fan-fiction ... We've got everything from [SPOILER] ""Thrallussy"" [/SPOILER] all the way up to their [SPOILER] ""Savathussy"" [/SPOILER] and every ""ussy"" in between. Hell, I'm pretty sure in about six months we're gonna have some [SPOILER] ""Travelerussy"" [/SPOILER] vs. [SPOILER] ""Witnessussy"" [/SPOILER] for the next expansion. The final battle of the [SPOILER] ""Lightussy"" [/SPOILER] vs. the [SPOILER] ""Darknessussy"" [/SPOILER] which I expect to have quite a bit of the ""ussy"" wars continue.

Either way - Get your clan together and throw questionable amounts of money at [STRIKE] SONY [/STRIKE] Bungie for cosmetics for your Cosplay Cosmodrome and some cool emotes to flex when you want to be stupid with your friends and finally attempt that Year 1 Raid that's still floating around - But now you're at Max Power Level and you [U] STILL CAN'T FLAWLESS IT [/U] because you're one friend keeps dying to the architects ... Yeah, thanks for ruining the flawless, [B] TYLER [/B]!

Anyhow - The base game is $Free.99 - Best price ever. The expansions run more, but damn do they make it fun. Jump in, do some space magic that everyone you fight is better at than you, and shoot even though everyone else in PvP will have better aim, loot the shit-ton of blue gear that will just be scrapped into useless materials that you'll complain about when your Vault, Post Master, and Inventory are filled up, and grind for 48 hours to get that one piece of Pinnacle Gear for your Kinetic Slot, only to end up getting another bloody Class Item at Max Power Level that you don't need and will just turn into Legendary Shards because the economy in the game is worse than being 14 y/o working at 1990's McDonald's in 2022's economy ... That is until you question your life choices when you realize you have 800+ hours in the game and still can't outgun any of your friends  because when you should be training, you're working a 40+ hour a week retail management job to support your lifestyle and realize - Crap, I'm an adult and cry yourself to sleep in your shower, after eating cold Chef Boyardee Spaghetti and Meatballs straight out of the can with a plastic spork every night while listening to My Name is Byf on Youtube to better understand the Lore that your one friend is super hyper-fixated on and you just want to keep up in the conversation because you value them as another human being. 8/6 Recommended."
6645,Good pew pews and bang bangs
6646,nice game
6647,I hate this game
6648,ITS GOOD
6649,fun game
6650,"What the Fuck am i supposed to do.. there are no quests and no guide .. xd
and every activites i want to start.. it just sends me to store page..what the fuck"
6651,So far I only have the base game but it’s a really fun game by yourself or with others it’s enjoyable to be played.
6652,"Game has become trash, discontinue immediately for own well-being."
6653,"very few hours on steam but over 2000 on ps4, this game when you first play and are able to figure out what your even supposed to do with the terrible tutorial this can suck away alot of your time and give you some great experiences. However, if you play enough of this game you will find yourself 4 weeks into a season with like 30 hrs playtime in the season already having finished all the content and gotten all the god rolls you need unless your doing the pinical grind for grand masters but once you've done it for a few seasons you'll have enough masterwork materials anyway so whats the point"
6654,The price and the management is enough for me to not even want to try to like it. No thanks.
6655,"Destiny 2 is a weird game. All I know is I put a lotta time into this franchise, and I can't say I enjoyed it. Am I slightly insane? maybe. I'd recommend learning a new hobby instead."
6656,"(Coming from personal experience) Do not play this game if you are seeking to ""complete"" a grind. The grind for weapons alone is borderline impossible. You will burn yourself out and end up making this game a chore that destroys everything good about the game. If you are looking for a casual PvE/PvP game with endless content, a great story with endless amounts for lore to read and unique weapons and perks then perhaps give it a try."
6657,By far the worst game I've ever played
6658,I hate this game
6659,Can't obtain certain mods unless playing during a certain time period.
6660,"Nice Raids, Nice Story by new DLC
PvP Matchmaking feels bad."
6661,it's a fun game but it's also fucking stopid and dumd fucking ennoying you wil smach your pc for the stupid shit they put in this shit game but for the rest it's a fun game
6662,cayde is the only reason the game is good
6663,"Plays like a space-opera version of Skyrim, the running mechanics remind me a bit of WoW, and you can also endlessly shoot aliens on the side if you so desire. Character customization is pretty good and as a sucker for graphics, I of course loved those, down to the high-tech appearance of the maps and loading screens. I have yet to get very far through the storyline, but all around an awesome game."
6664,best game ever
6665,Good little game having to buy all expac's sucks a little why not just the latest and that's all of them bad system for new players. Fun while it lasted i guess 7.5/10
6666,"TLDR; Got disconnects back in 2019 ""due to my side"", forgot about it, reinstalled the game in 2022 (different ISP) still get disconnects, also NEW PLAYER experience worse than before, no quest order, story all over the place.

I've played Destiny 2 back in 2019 and i was blown away with how the gunplay was tight and how beautiful the visuals were. I really did enjoy the combat and the story was interesting i enjoyed my time...up until i started getting errors, getting disconnects during mission runs mid fight. Troubleshooting pointed to me and my ISP, funny enough that was the ONLY game that blamed me and my ISP and i've been playing online since 2005. So yeah...i uninstalled the game.

Years had passed, i've forgotten about the errors and just retained good memories of gunplay and visuals. Now i've reinstalled the game and had a smile on my face with a question mark on my mind...why did i uninstall the game...who knows, no matter i continued on.
Quickly enough i started having trouble figuring out what to do ingame and HOW THE HELL am i supposed to follow the story line, the quest order ? It was all so convoluted and annoying. Nothing made sense while i was following the ""new light"" quests, but i kept pushing through.
And ON TOP of all that i encounter a error that made me redo the whole mission, at that time i didn't yet remember the errors of my first encounter with Destiny 2. I replay it and moved on. And it happened again...and again and again...
Troubleshooting it pointed back at me and my ISP, i get a flashback from before...but but...i've changed my ISP in the meanwhile. Can't deal with it now...
I lay off the game for a day or two and get in to do a Vanguard mission and BAM ! I get an error, i click to rejon and i was unable, got another error.
And AT THAT MOMENT it all came back...the frustration from before, now renewed...no more.

I am DONE with this buggy ass game."

I played since the first one. Its fun, yes its a grind, I enjoy every second of it. 470 hours on this one alone and still have only seen half of what the game has to offer (thats based on my own play choice, not because the game is too hard or something like that) 

NOW is the PERFECT time to get into Destiny. Witch Queen Expansion and Light Fall are going to be GOAT and all MUST try it out and get into it to experience this beautiful story and game. GIVE IT A TRY its free (kinda, you need to buy the Expansions if you actually wanna enjoy what this has to offer or play with your friends outside of regular story stuff)"

also hunter= bad"
6684,"It's a fun game but it isn't free to play I played this back on console closer to launch and used cross-save to bring my account to PC which is a very nice feature. However the focus on pvp the game currently has I personally don't enjoy as much compared to back when I played D1. I would recommend you try this as a mostly pvp game. It has pve content to do here and there but for how expensive the game is I personally wouldn't recommend this for pve. The balance is always kind of shit in Destiny with the current thing seeming to be Dead Man's Tale a scout rifle that can two tap being very strong. None of the weapons I have could challenge Dead Man's Tale users. Generally if you want gear pvp is faster to grind in but playing against people with proper setups using blues isn't very fun. If you don't want to play pvp this isn't the game for you now and if you plan on playing by yourself doing no pvp there is very little content worth doing that won't require you to find randoms to do stuff with.

All that being said it's Destiny it's good for the right people but Destiny 2 isn't made for the audience Destiny 1 was."

6711,The best game. Dream come true for me.
6712,One of the best Multiplayer PVE games out there. Very fun for grinding with friends. They give players a chance to see whether they enjoy the game-play before they buy the DLCs to unlock full access to the game.

6722,"Peerless in terms of gunplay. The build craft and variety of weaponry, armor, mods, abilities, etc., provide endless tinkering and optimization if you're into that sort of thing. The story has gotten increasingly more personal and compelling over the years, albeit still far too fragmented among lore books and content no longer accessible in the game. The art direction, music, and overall feel of the game are just top-notch.

The actual moment to moment gameplay is usually great fun, even if the actual tasks you're completing are often repetitive. This is due in large part to the absolutely incredible feel of controlling your guardian. Weapons are dynamic, varied, and a dream to wield. Abilities and various mods, alongside the litany of armor sets, provide a ton of variety and potential for synergies.  

The game itself is simply tremendous. No other shooter provides the quality and quantity of content that D2 provides. PVP/PVE, you got it. However.. as most D2 fans would tell you, when recommending this game, it's complicated. The new player experience is absolute chaos. The sheer volume of information, content, systems, pricing models, currencies, storylines, locations, categories of weapons, armors, abilities, classes, etc. you're thrown all at once is just.. staggering. To have even a fighting chance of understanding the story of the game, you'll most likely need to watch hours, yes, hours of lore catch-up videos on YouTube. I took a few years off, and a few months ago after navigating the various DLC bundles and loading into the game, I was thrown headfirst into a seasonal activity where I had absolutely no clue what was happening, what I was supposed to do, or how I was supposed to do it. I alongside other new players were underleveled and were getting absolutely crushed. This was just.. a thing that happened to new/returning players for weeks. After I made it out of the activity, I stared at the daunting, endless list of questlines, activities, and currencies that had been introduced since I last played. If you're going to hop into the game for the first time, or haven't played in awhile, get ready to do some homework.

So yeah, it's complicated. But if you're willing to deal with the initial anxiety that is the new player experience, this game is fantastic and will provide endless hours of fun and ever-evolving content. If they ever figure out the new player experience, content vaulting, and the annoyingly fragmented (yet very good) story, D2 will be a true masterclass of a live service shooter. In the meantime, try out the F2P experience and see if the gameplay hooks you. If it does, I personally think the game is worth the potential headaches.

Also, I have many hours on D2 split among multiple platforms, the crossplay is very convenient, although having to buy your DLC on each separate platform is a bit annoying, but understandable. The PC version is great, only downside is the potential for cheaters in PVP.

6743,Destiny is a beautiful game! Feel like a single player adventure at time but includes various open-world aspects and team events. The alien worlds are so cool to see and explore :)
6744,"absolute class, the loot make my brain go woooooooooooooooooo!!"
6745,As a new player almost nothing feels self explanatory. Required to download an app on my phone to not solo through majority of the game?
6746,I didnt want to like this game but I do.  I beat the vanilla campaign the week of launch and didnt touch it again till two seasons ago.  I love it.. it is worth every penny of the free to play cost as well as the cost of the expansions.  Finally a game with a season pass that feels worth it.

6753,"good game however lots of the content is locked behind a paywall, be prepared to spend some money on the dlcs and other stuff"
6754,"This has to be the most frustrating game I have ever played, bugs that keep notifications on screen permanently, bugs that lock progression, quest design so unclear you start to doubt your own intelligence, an interface straight out of hell/ some mobile pay2win game with countless systems and currencies/materials.. PVP.. is absolute aids and should not be played.

I still had fun doing the dungeons but man, this game needs a complete overhaul from the ground up because underneath all that is actually fun game."

6756,If you have the money....This game is good. Some of the DLCs are questionable purchases. Really wish it wasn't so. Great coop content.
6757,"Destiny 2 is one of the best games I have ever played! By far one of the best F2P titles in the Looter-Shooter Genre, this game has a lot to offer. From epic, sanity-shredding boss battles, to PVP less balanced than my lifestyle, This game has everything a person could want, whether they like it or not! play today, and sacrifice your sanity to RNJesus, and enjoy every moment of it!

TLDR: game good."
6758,Been playing Destiny since D1 1st came out. Love the game and story line. You have endless lore to get lost in and the soundtrack is amazing. I love the PvP and the graphics are amazing. Highly Recommend this game to others!
6759,"Although the game can be very much enjoyed by a casual player the game shines when the player takes it appon himself to get deep and i mean very deep into the games culture and gameplay.For both sides of PvE and PvP it takes a lot of dedication knowledge and skill to master the game.The grind and mastery that the games offers is what ha kept me.In my opinion though the in order to fully enjoy the game you need to have very thick skin.However i cant even count the amount of nights were i couldnt sleep,only to start the game put music in the backround and grind for hours and hours."
6760,fun
6761,"I’ve been playing the Destiny franchise since the Destiny 1 Beta (so about 8 years since release) and I’ve always loved the games. I have too many hours on console over both destiny 1 and 2. If I’ve stuck around for 8 years, then the game must be worth a try. 

Sure, Bungie has made some poor decisions during the development of Destiny 2 (The launch was absolutely terrible and most people quit the game after the first month) but over the years Bungie has definitely improved upon the issues had arise - and the game is still going strong 5 years later. 

If you’re a free to play player, the grind to level up your power can be quite disheartening, but persevere and you’ll climb in power! The grind for this game has always been a “Love, Hate” relationship for many people, but if you ultimately enjoy the game, you’re going to be grinding no matter what. 

With the addition of the newest expansion The Witch Queen. Getting to end game content has been made even easier if you complete the Legendary campaign. 

Overall - this game isn’t for everyone, but personally I love this franchise and quite honestly always will! 

If I was to rate the game out of 10. I’d have to give it a 9.5/10
"
6762,"after 1000+ hours of gameplay, i can safely state that this is one of, if not the highest quality games in terms of content. it's quite sad to see your favorite destination gone, or favorite gun sunset, but sometimes you need to clean up a little. 9.9/10, favorite game."
6763,The game is okay... i guess
6764,"This game is beautiful, but horribly convoluted. I'm nowhere near tempted to spend money on this game because I have zero clue as to what it'll actually buy me. Again, beautiful game. Horribly execution on getting new players to buy the rest of it. I absolutely do not recommend this game."
6765,I bought the game 3 days ago and I've played for 37 hours. This is more addictive than any drug I've ever used.

6782,"Let me preface this off by saying i love this game. it's fun, engaging, addicting even. I actively play it on xbox, where as of writing this review, i have 92 hours.

However, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this to others, due to the amount of anti-consumer practices they have.

""Free to play"" more like free to get told to buy DLC. 80% of the game is behind a paywall, and some of that paywalled content can even get taken away.

Compound that with the issue of not being allowed to run on the steam deck, it's a clusterfuck. (I'd like to believe they're waiting for the deck/linux to be a more proven platform before allowing, and once that changes, i'll consider changing this review.)"

Pros: It is easily picked up and played by someone who has little time. I have verified this by getting my whole family on game nights playing together. We all don't play games normally. I got my 5 year old to play with me enthusiastically. The action is satisfying and has a lot to keep you coming back.
Cons: Like other have said, it is a bit repetitive, but they keep coming out with more content, expansions, and seasonal events to make it feel fresh."
6803,yea sure
6804,"could not recommend this game in its current state, ive put well over 2000 hours into d1 and enjoyed almost every minute of it but d2 just feels like a constant fetch quest to get a higher power ranking and not as much about the actual gameplay, it is clear bungie has decided to choose money over listening to the overwhelming voices of their fan base, sunsetting aside, charging hundreds of dollars for dlcs that are barley worth of half of their price, getting rid of entire story lines for some of the most boring plots this side of french indie film, pay walling every single last piece of viable gear, never fixing stasis supers, the list goes on and on, while i still continue to occasionally play, i can not confidently say that i would recommend this game to new lights and absolutely not to og d1 players"
6805,"My favorite game that I will never recommend to anyone who isn't already playing.

SEE: New Player Experience, Seasonal Content Removal, Content Vaulting

But for those who have kept up with the game since then, it has been an absolute pleasure to see it grow into what it is currently. I just wish there were things that could make the game more palatable for a new player."

You spend all your time in this game working towards a level where you can actually start having fun, but the thing is, that level doesn't exist. This game will never be fun. Do not get it."

6828,this has got too be one of if not the worst game I've ever played. I wouldn't recommend this game if someone had a gun to my head.
6829,destiny stom.
6830,The game has changed so much that they removed the the main storyline and the game is not fun anymore you can start the game playing the regular quest and then suddenly they pull you off to some sidequest you can't even play because you gotta buy it. The game's just not fun anymore you can't just go to earth and do all the earth quests like you did before you can't go to Mars or you can't go to the other places because they removed all the good stuff the original storyline has been thrown out I may own the game but I will not play it any longer
6831,"The game feels great but lacks its original foundation, having played destiny one and many hours of destiny 2 on xbox the game has lost it's touch. The constant dlc and money grabs make it impossible to play competitively without paying money. Bungie does not care about player feedback just how much revenue it gets."
6832,"this game made me cry one time in frustration and i punched the shit out my pc, 10/10 would recommend."
6833,pog
6834,"Destiny 2 is the best game you shouldn't play.

I know how that sounds, but it's true.

While Destiny 2 is a fantastic game, with amazing gunplay, vast customization and plenty to chase after, one simply cannot overlook the structural problems of the game as it is now.

Pros:
- Vast amount of weapons and powers
- Fun PvE and PvP
- Great End-game content
- Lots of customization
- Meaningful rewards and way to obtain them
- Great gunplay, likely the best out of any Looter-shooter

Cons:
- Cost of the game ramps up with each new expansion
- Content you pay for gets vaulted and removed from the game after a while
- Seasonal content requires you to play every day; if you don't, you fall behind
- MASSIVE amounts of FOMO (Fear of missing out) in the seasonal design of the game
- Being F2P, can encounter cheaters in PvP
- No inherent way to get into end-game content without using 3rd party software like Discord, etc.
- The game does not value your time. If you intend on playing other games alongside D2, don't bother playing D2


All in all, Destiny 2 is a very polished and fun game, but the amount of time it *forces* you to spend on it is absurd and borderline criminal. You cannot play any other live-service game alongside Destiny 2, because Destiny 2 requires you to play it at least 4 hours a day, every day. Someone with a job should seriously look away.

I wish Bungie took it down a notch with the FOMO and seasonal content, as well as stop removing content we've already paid for. I simply cannot return to the game knowing all of the things I have mentioned will likely never be addressed."
6835,Save me
6836,"Genuinely one of the best games I have ever played. The story is utterly fantastic, the gunplay is by far the best of any MMOFPS, the aesthetics and soundtracks are incredibly immersive, the quests-journeys-raids-world events are all very well put together and fun. Raids are absolutely the best content in the game, very fun and challenging at times especially when you don't have friends. PvP is really the only content that is bad. All around just an amazing game, genuinely one of a kind. 10/10"
6837,I like shooting things and this game is free and lets me shoot things
6838,I'm in too deep at this point to stop playing now.
6839,I like the shooter action. I do not like that controls are significantly varied between different shooter games. Destiny  has a mission progression that is not clearly viewed. direction arrows are intermittent. Appears to be aan assumption that if one is playing D2 one has played D1 and is familiar with controls - needs to have a tutor. Providing instructions as game progresses is good but a tutor/trainning at the onset would make the playing smoother and allow focus on the game rather than controls.
6840,Good
6841,bungie
6842,yes
6843,The game I fell in love with is in there somewhere.

6846,"Bungie does an incredible job of listening to the community and does their best to connect with their player base rountinely. Furthermore the game play and mechanics of the game are easy and fun, and the campaign and story line are well worth the grind. the hours you put into the game feel rewarding and valuable and the creativity of missions and mechanics keeps the game engaging and fun for both new and long standing players."
6847,"As an actual guardian (not a hunter or warlock), my power animal is slamming into aliens with my head and reducing them to glowing balls of light which I then use to become the LITERAL GOD and rain fire down upon their unfortunate kin. I then pillage their empty homes and take the loot back to Banshee and tell the demented gunsmith to forge SOME OF THAT GOOD GOOD. Rinse, Repeat. 

All complaints about bright dust and strict metas just come down to how much we all love the game."
6848,It took all of my friends and made them into tryhards :(
6849,Good
6850,It's nice but Warframe is better.
6851,pvp changes more then it should. it can go from slow and weird from meta change all the way to hey i can one shot someone by blowing on them! its a constant grind and that grind will be worthless in weeks or less. pve is way to grindy just to enjoy the story. useless addons to keep the game from going dry. pvp is impossible alone because everyone is slow and useless relying on there meta build instead of skill or fun. its all meta nothing more and nothing less and it changes constantly. i do not recommend dedicating your time to this because the stopry is already behind vaults and in destiny 1 mostly.
6852,"good game

6858,"This game used to be a lot of fun. Once they made it free and started having us pay to have 80% of the stuff removed just to get one destination and a couple of guns, it started to go down hill. I’m a PvP player. If you like pve, you’ll probably like this raid, but make sure you watch YouTube videos before joining a raid because 99% of the players want you do know what to do before hoping into a raid. For PvP we went a few years without any new maps. Then they removed I think 8, and then gave us one maybe a year later. Then finally gave us one back a couple months ago. Overall, this game died 2 expansions ago. Right now, they’re just milking a dead cow for all it’s worth. Not spending $80 for another mediocre expansion to get stuff removed."
6859,been playing since year 1 of Destiny 1. Still havent balanced pvp in all that time:/ still gonna play tho
6860,Its best when you play with friends
6861,"I love the gun play. I have looked for other games like this one, but I always find myself coming back to it. I definitely recommend it to other gamers."
6862,"it will steal your free time and then you will find out its all you wanna do any more.. thinking about playing, dreaming about playing.. i think there is an issue here. can you find waldo"
6863,Lots of missions and side quests to do solo and with your friend(s). Bungie keeps updating their games weekly so there is always something new to do.
6864,"So, is it worth playing Destiny 2 in 2022? Well, yes, very much yes. The graphics are still stunning compared to some newer releases, the campaign and game modes offer a ton of fun activities, and you can play it with your friends."
6865,"don't play PvP, very broken unless you have grinded  for 1000 hours and gotten god rolls and broken exotics "

6874,"Very significant amounts of content - large amounts of it paid - removed, including some of my favourite bits. ""Game"" is absolute mess if you didn't play from launch. Absurd grindfest that resets often and makes your gear worthless. No pretensions of balance. Third party applications effectively required, but not because of the game's complexity but because of pisspoor documentation and QoL. Very and consistently buggy. Expansions priced like full games with extremely poor value for money, 10 euro season pass with considerable material rewards as well as a majority of new cosmetics combined with a premium currency store (and that currency cannot be obtained ingame, nor does a completed pass pay for the next one). Extreme amounts of unobtainable and unplayable content, with every season introducing more timegated shit. As a returning player, I think I saw 5 large paywalls in 10 minutes. Gameplay focused on completing arbitrary daily and weekly quests that prevent you from playing what you want how you want: kill x y:s with weapon type z in place å, run boring content a, do things in pvp which are actively detrimental to your teams chances. Gear and content timegated - need to check in every day to see if the shit you need is in rotation. Terrible, immature writing comparable to what you'd expect in a local tv childrens cartoon. PvP is mobile game tier (autoaim is a weapon stat, undodgeable unpreventable oneshots on cooldown). Core combat is mediocre but acceptable, I guess. Aim, knowledge and character control matters less than stats and build. The FPS part of the game suffers from common issues - jittery animations with dramatic and unpredictable transitions, enemies hiding behind terrain forever, arbitrarily easy or hard to access crit spots, more-or-less unavoidable damage, missions making you stand in a circle with no cover for minutes et c.

Shameful. Everything wrong with the industry. Stay away - this is not a game but a money draining addiction program."
6875,Great
6876,"good gameplay 
good visuals and free"
6877,"it's fun and there's stuff to do as long as you don't play EVERY DAMN SEASON EVERY DAMN DAY, let it recharge content"
6878,Great memories. All of the raids are so memorable with the different puzzles. I've always had a blast whenever i play the PVE in this game.
6879,"Do yourself a favor and don't get into it, try warframe instead. It took me 4 years to realize this game is so half baked a methhead makes more sense 70% of the time. Destiny 1 was way better. How far the mighty have fallen.

Put 13 more hours into my steam version and it asked me if I wanted to revise my review. If anything the further time has only proven my point, if only I wasn't addicted."

its always the same loop
but gunplay is fun
story is intriguing
raids are awesome"
6881,"awesome, spectacular story, amazing graphics. great game"
6882,hehe hammer go brr
6883,Cant recommend it because to many hackers and pier to pier connection is god awful. To many lag switchers and DCing in comp and trials. Imagine Patting your self on the back going flawless in trials after hacking and cheesing your way there thinking that you actually won that on your own... lol! what a joke... sleep well knowing you'll never succeed in life to all you hackers and cheesers out there. I've already made it in life with out all that and moving on where as you never will LOL!!! Feels good actually.

6890,"I'm not one to write many review for things, especially games. Seems these days a lot of games are just about the same and many of them are stressful to play because some of the controls suck.
I mostly play this game on my Play Station rather than on here. Overall it has amazing artwork, a great story line and wonderful characters. I love the amount of weapon options and the variety of weapon types. I usually avoid shooting games because of the fact that the controls and movement suck when you are using the weapons. This game is a completely different story.
Yes they continually make changes to this game for some people that is a turn off, but I love the variety and the continual improvements.
I understand that not all games are for everyone, but I would highly recommend giving this one a shot."

This game is completely neglected in pvp with zero balancing changes and new content, no new maps for years they have completely given up on the one part of this game i enjoyed i doubt almost anyone that plays the pvp in its current state is having fun."

6904,"Other games do PvP better
Other games do PvE better
Other games do QoL better

6913,"Amazing game, favourite of all-time.  The shooting mechanics, RPG elements and amazing Raid and dungeon content have kept me coming back for years and years."
6914,Futuristic Zombie game but your the zombie
6915,"I play this game a lot, and I have started to write a review several times, but whether or not you will also enjoy this game seems a little bit more complex to me than just whether the game is “good"" or delivers on what it seems to promise on the store page. I think that how much or how little you will like this game comes mostly down to which elements of a game like this you feel are the most important for your enjoyment.

Of all the FPS games I've played, this one is definitely my favorite when it comes to all of the core mechanics of just running around killing stuff. The guns are fun to use, movement is fast paced and interesting, especially the jump mechanics, character classes feel distinct and there are lots of ways to customize your character and your gear to your own playstyle or just change things up for fun sometimes. If you enjoy ""running and gunning"", collecting lots of random loot, high mobility, and don’t mind giving up some of the tactical detail of more “serious” shooters for a faster paced playstyle, you'll probably like this game.

Unfortunately, when it comes to actual activities, I feel like this game is much more of a mixed bag. There is a lot of content, but it’s poorly organized and won’t all be relevant to many players. There are story missions, but for various reasons, it’s surprisingly hard to play through them in a way that feels like an actual story. There are several reasons for this, but the biggest one is that replaying random missions from all of the different campaigns on shuffle is one of the primary game modes and actually playing through the story missions in order is only available if you purchase expansions and, even with the expansions, you have to do various other tasks between missions, making it very easy to lose the thread of what’s supposedly happening in the overall story arc. There are other game modes, some PVE, some PVP, some mixed; there are 3 and 6 player activities, some matchmade and some not (which is also kind of annoying if you don’t have 5 friends who can get together to play that content on a regular basis), but I feel like the number of activity types actually contributes to a lack of variety within each of the game modes themselves. You won’t lack for something to do, there are very many individual activities to participate in and lots of weekly and seasonal objectives to work your way through, but it doesn’t take long for any particular activity to feel pretty repetitive due to lack of variety within that particular type of content. If you’re a person who likes replaying content over and over again until you can master it, you’ll probably be fine with this aspect of the game, but if you like a little bit more novelty in your game, you will quickly start to feel bored with what this game has to offer.

For me, while I get bored by the repetitiveness sometimes, I keep coming back to this game because it offers a particularly enjoyable style of fast-paced, high mobility gameplay that I haven't found in other games and I enjoy collecting loot and tweaking my character and, to a lesser extent, “mastering” some of the content I find most enjoyable. If that's enough to keep you interested, you'll probably like this game too. If you're looking for a long story driven narrative or a highly social MMO with lots of sidequests and fun filler activity, you might want to look somewhere else."

6932,"Used to be good...went down the hill when they started all of their ""balancing"" and removal of game systems.  Then they decided to repeat the same worn out trope of ""vaulting content"".  Basically repeating the same bad idea from D1 that ruined that game in this sequel.
It got a little better with Witch Queen, but honestly, it's just the same content over and over and over and over again.  Nothing really new.  Not many new weapons unless you call bringing back weapons from the launch of D2 as new...

Honestly, Bungie is just turning into another Rockstar games hungry for money and too lazy to really earn it."

6945,"Good game
"
6946,Bad game
6947,"I HATE THE HIVE
I HATE THE HIVE"
6948,"The only people left playing this game have severe stockholm syndrome, the best days of Destiny are behind us and it only gets worse each and every season. Don't bother getting invested."
6949,"I hate Destiny, though i love it <3"
6950,"Was a good game before, but became too much p2w. Still a good game to spend time on"
6951,yes
6952,caballs
6953,"i have not slept for 3 days, my social life is a mess, and i eat like shit.  would recomend"
6954,"I played through all of Destiny 1 and played through vanilla Destiny 2 on drop. I was extremely disappointed with the direction Activision provided for Destiny as a whole. I recently came back to the game after multiple friend recommendations. I'm so glad that I gave it another chance. The game is completely different from where it was in 2017. There is continually updated content each season. Legacy content for OG players. A wide range of class abilities, weapons, armor sets, and cosmetics provide a unique build experience for everyone. I highly recommend this if you're interested in an MMO FPS to play with up to 5 other friends."
6955,it is a game and the game is killing my social life
6956,Idk something about being stepped on and touching grass
6957,It’s a funny game to play with friends and family great story
6958,verry good game
6959,It's okay.
6960,"The number/variance of enemies have not really changed in about a decade. You are telling me that in all the universe that we are stuck with these species of ""intelligent"" life? Yikes!"
6961,"I heard the game has been through a lot recently, something like they removed 70% of content and placed it behind a paywall, and i kinda saw that. One cool thing was there actually is pvp, but besides that one aspect, warframe is still better game."
6962,After 1 day of playing I have decided that I hate this game
6963,it is a videogame for sure
6964,Bagza
6965,"The story is nice and rich
The npcs are really impressive
Graphic are good
Performance as well 
PVP is okay (not so good but maybe I am just a noob)

It's nice especially with friends"
6966,fun game
6967,Good game. Bad business model.
6968,"This game is not recommended for players that want to play something for quite a long time, if your a F2P like me this game is not for you since most of the content in this game is mostly exclusive for P2P players which I don't really like so yea, defo wouldn't recommend."
6969,gud gam
6970,Basically a halo rip off
6971,its great
6972,g
6973,"Story rich Multiplayer . Even though buggy at times , it the gameplay and mechanics are fun and interesting . Microtransactions are only cosmetic and not cash grab schemes . For better experience play with friends and buy all expansions"
6974,"yes the story is great and the graphics are amazing, dont listen to the haters lol"
6975,"yes'
"
6976,"good game, but the drop rates pls over hale them"
6977,love destiny
6978,"Destiny has some of the best shooting game play of all time but is severely hindered from being a Masterpiece. Several activities without matchmaking when the game has been out for years. I would easily have hundreds more hours in this game if it had some better end game matchmaking and activities. Once you complete story/side missions its just grinding the same activities over and over for a slight boost in power and it can get old pretty quick. 

I like to come back when new expansions are released but IMO they need to stop supporting this game and release Destiny 3 as a non F2P next gen only title. Enough of this PS4, Xbone support its 2022 and those consoles need to die off and a new generation of FPS games need to come out as the F2P BR games are ruining this industry."
6979,no
6980,The game has its ups and downs but if you like a Sci-Fi/Fantasy Looter Shooter you're most likely going to enjoy it.
6981,very cool game I played it before but was not very intressted in it but now I gave it anoter shot and it quite fun.
6982,"Very fun game, with great transitions into beginning, middle, and endgame. Also being able to decide how you want to play whether you enjoy pvp, pve, or the combination (Gambit) is a great aspect."
6983,"Although the progression is somewhat grind and there tends to content droughts near the end of seasons now the game is absolutely worth playing. the movement and controls are great once you get the hang of them and  the abundance of different pvp and pve game modes means that there is always something for everyone no matter their playstyle. The DLCs means that you have to spend some money to get the most of the game but it is very worth it just make sure if you buy a DLC make sure to buy the Deluxe edition otherwise there is still a lot you aren't going to get. My personal Favorite part of the game is the LORE, it is relatively easy to understand but there are also a lot you can dig for. 9/10 great game"
6984,"Whole game is dogshit, would rather play Escape from Tarkov for 100 days straight or be kidnapped by the KGB.
+rep Putin"
6985,"Bought this game at launch on Xbox and PC. Was a pretty good game back then. Now it's just weird getting into for new players/new accounts. (Lost my account because of the transfer from b.net btw. Really pog. Even though I remember doing the transfer back when they were doing it)

Vaulting the base game (1.0 campaign) is just so unheard of. I do not understand. Red War was pretty great imo and had decent progression feel. Why not just let people play the game from the start with no light level or w/e, then earn their way up to the current content? Like the game used to be..? Throwing people into the end-game stuff practically instantly is so scuffed. Not to mention you can only do like 1 mission from Forsaken? Forsaken was good and impactful to the player, but let's just skip half of the expansion, let you do 1 random mission with no significance and force the player to move on to Shadowkeep. ?????

I don't get it bungie."

6996,Destiny 2 is like a drug addiction: getting that god roll is the hit and it can empty your bank account if you're into it long enough
6997,The servers suck. But good when it wants to be ig
6998,good
6999,"I had not played in years, and had no trouble recovering my progression from PS to PC. It was hella easy to get back into as well. Ive been having a blast!"
7000,"No other game like this. Want PVP? Crucible, with many different game modes including rotating modes. Want PVE? Vanguard, Dungeons, Raids, Eternity, Public Events, and so many more options. Maybe you want to play both PVP and PVE at the same time? GAMBIT! So many things to do and I will say I do love the light grind. Overall 9.7/10 LOVE THIS GAME!"

7018,"Been Addicted to this Franchise for 8 Years
11/10 Better than Crack"
7019,10/10 bring felwinters back <3
7020,"I don't know how this franchise went from ""frustrating but decent"" to worse. Out comes destiny 2  and mee and a buddy of mine just burn through the content easy pz. The grind is weirdly easy with challenges stringed through out to keep you grinding. Gameplay is not as challenging as it was in the first game. Butt clenching moments have yet to happen but we have more triggering experiences of wtf? We dropped the game because we got bored.

Fast forward a few years and I don't understand what is going on, where I originally was. Audio is bugging out, cutscenes glitch, enemies aren't loading in, and game crashes. I'm thrown into a....dungeon? instance? mission? I run in a building and then run out and then load into a zone I have no idea what's going on and suddenly we have a cabal as an ally? For crying out loud, have the story be linear instead of throwing people into some strange mess.

Future war cult, Dead Orbit and the other faction are gone, or at least they haven't loaded in if they exist still.

Genuinely, I am bummed for this game...I should say franchise. It had so many good things at the start and now it's just.....something that is just bums me out."
7021,my Destiny was to spend too much money on this game
7022,blame lumio
7023,"good, great even, but i have gt730 and it needs gtx 1060/1080. lowest graphics=50 fps for me. but i also played on xbox so thats fine. 9/10 game 100%."

7028,Just no
7029,OG destiny was way better.
7030,"You want a review game destiny 2=bad destiny 1=better at least 
READ BELOW FOR A QUICK HONEST BREAKDOWN REVIEW!!!!!!

Community : they are terrible and lie, literally half of my game time is spent trying to find people and the people you do find are toxic basement dwellers.

Dev team : what team? 

Game itself : its alright just gets worse every expansion.

Worth it? : hell to the naw naw naw, your wasting your time friend at least waste your money on a game like world of warcraft at least you get to keep the content you paid for.

Overall review : they sucker in new players but really its just a very bad RNG game that claims to be an MMO, go watch any streamer they look depressed playing this.

Bonus review Cosmetics : they all look like the garbage people from the walking dead like it's a fashion show of literal trash, the only decent one ever release is the titans lion armor ( Empyrean Titan Armor Set ) kinda cool not gonna lie. 

THIS GAME IS JUST A CASH GRAB PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOU TIME!!!!!"
7031,"cool shooter, seasons tend to get a bit repetitive but overal great game!"
7032,I haven't seen my family in a week
7033,Space Wizards
7034,"i hate destiny 2, its my favorite game

Pros:
[list]
[*]Deep, interesting lore
[*]Funny space magic abilities
[*]Activities for everyone
[*]Plenty of buildcrafting options 
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]New player experience is absolutely horrendous (read: nonexistant)
[*]Previous content is unplayable, leaving a huge gap in the story for new players
[*]This game will take over your life
[*]Community can be toxic at times
[/list]

tl;dr: Good game, just dont take it too seriously, especially the pvp side."

7045,"Played this game for like 5 minutes, it seems ok but warframe is better"
7046,"only complaint is that they remove dlc's rather then just letting us download the campainges ourselves
"
7047,This game is a lot of fun when you play with people you know... I had less fun with random players but was still fun... gets kinda old quick though since it is really repetitive... story wasnt bad...
7048,its like cocaine but better

7076,yes
7077,good
7078,"Played from Day 1, first on ps4 and then PC. If you are looking for 1 game where you invest time and the rewards are permanent this is it. You cant buy progress but have to earn it. Plus it receives major updates every 2 months. The PVP is pretty bad tho."
7079,its ok
7080,Good game
7081,why do people actually play this ffs
7082,Perfect and stable .
7083,dope game
7084,worst game ever

7086,"The grind is all consuming
The Lore is amazing
The Worlds are beautiful 
The Loot, weapons and armor are great

8/10, would even recommend for F2P players"
7087,"You do the same content multiple times to get a good weapon then you do that content more times to get the weapon with good perks. You do something similar for good armor too. 
Having said that raids are fun and doesn't require much grind to get into (but there are damage checks so you need to grind certain weapons to go through them) if you can get 5 people to play with."
7088,"best game ive ever played, has so much to it and you dont get bored"
7089,There is a very steep learning curve. Things are not obvious. But it's a great time once you work out what's going on.
7090,"i like 
"
7091,this game bustin
7092,"You'll enjoy it if you're a masochist. 

I played on console up until last week and have several hundreds of hours poured into this god awful game and you'll most likely hate it but keep coming back for some reason over and over grinding pinnacles, farming weapons, and just shooting aliens. The community is great depending on where you look (avoid Twitter and like 80% of the Reddit) but person to person encounters are always great."

7108,it's okay
7109,"out of all the games, destiny 2 is definitely one of them"

7112,its ok
7113,w gaem
7114,good game love it is much fun.
7115,An overall improvement from the original. Mostly enjoy playing through the story and don't fancy the other content. Story pretty good for the most part.
7116,"I wouldn't recommend this addiction to my worst enemies. I love this game so much, I will likely never stop playing, and neither will you."
7117,Good game
7118,woah
7119,Good game but new players are going to have a hard time.
7120,"Don't play this game

With that out of the way;

Things to look forward to
smooth gunplay
collecting guns
drip
raids (if you don't value your sanity)

Things to avoid
Crucible (unless you enjoy toxic and sweaty players, as well as constricting metas) 
Gambit (unless you play super casually and/or are with friends)
I still do both of these for the pinnacles though

Overall it is a fun game that I recommend to others except those I care about"
7121,with queen
7122,Just not fun.
7123, favorite gamem
7124,"pretty shit, pay to win and almost everything is obsolete, no room for fun builds its meta or nothing"
7125,"Thank u Bungie, for filling the hole, 343 has left me with.

...but also you suck for removing such large pieces of content.

I'll still hand over my money tho"
7126,"good shooter
"
7127,sick game but to mutch talking... xD
7128,Amazing game!
7129,If you enjoy paying for the same game over and over again get destiny 2. Bungie needs to stop. I paid for this game multiple times for each new iteration. I'm tired of it. Sc rew you Bungie!
7130,expensive
7131,"Wow I hate Destiny 2





It's my favorite game and I play it every day."
7132,I hate this game but I always come back to it
7133,the game is
7134,"definitely a fun game, just don't overdo it or you'll burn out hard"
7135,Send help
7136,play this right now
7137,very gud time
7138,"It is a fun game at first, learning about the game is great, but its the farming, and the grinding that makes you not want to play as much, non the less it is a very enjoyable game to play with friends!"
7139,Its amazing i like the loot system and its fun when getting high ranking loot when traveling and killing enemies
7140,If you dont play it your a weeb simple as that
7141,hi
7142,played probably around 1000 hours of d1 and d2 combined and every new dlc just restarts your characters power and you have to pay to be strong pretty much. raids are the only good part about the game (played on console)
7143,n1
7144,I enjoy the scenery and the atmosphere in this game which is the main reason I play it. There are a lot of things to go into about this game but all I will say is my rate of it and I think it's an 8/10 there are just so much beautiful work in it.
7145,It's not the worst
7146,"I played the game for a few hours and it didn't catch my interest. At the base, it's a shared world shooter game with a story. The problem with it is, I don't ever manage to understand where to go and what's going on! Three classes to choose from, the choice based on a couple of lines of lore. A terribly confusing map, and the quest tracker which loves to disappear. Tons of different screens of abilities, artifacts, etc etc.. I've been playing RPGs and shooters for years, I've hardly seen anything more complicated and without a single tooltip! Plus all the abilities looked so similar I could not find a point in getting them. Some actions trigger tutorials which force you through some menus in the order they want, otherwise you can't get rid of their annoying overlay windows. Worst thing ever, I think at a certain point an event started. Logged in, watched a video with some lore that made no sense to me, and the game forced me into some game area I totally did not want to go to. In the end, it looks like a mess where developers added over the course of time feature over feature, screen over screen just to keep long-time players logging in and completely forgetting about newcomers. A real pity, as this is a technically sound game otherwise with nice graphics."
7147,"This game is very fun for a player who has started from the start of destiny 1. although I do believe even for new players it's very hard to get into and there are a lot of really good and fun things that are money. Although this game is very grindy, lot's of rewards are behind those grinding sessions. Overall I would recommend this game if you really think you want to commit into 1 game in specific."
7148,It's ok
7149,Yes
7150,I swear I'm not addicted to this game.
7151,I've spend 150 quid played for almost 1500hrs 10 pence per hr ain't bad i guess
7152,help
7153,Desdiny
7154,NICE
7155,Very skillful game!
7156,"enemies look like half life very funny
"
7157,"BEST GAM E EVER
"
7158,Destiny is truly one of the games ever made
7159,this game take your soul... dont do it unless you have time to devote like any other MMO out there
7160,"do not take this very ultra serious when i say this. but this is a game for rich people and even when you're rich enough to get the most out of this game it still has it's flaws; monotonous ways of grinding, content being shafted and characters of questionable nature.

although i admit that the world of destiny is very interesting and worth looking into, aesthetics that are very pleasing and gun-play that is satisfying to carry out with feedback that is well built.

another added note (this does not detract anything in terms of how i review this game). I will never understand the inherent reddit dudebro ""classism"" for this game, though the devs don't help considering the classes/subclasses are polarizing in sense of balance. but come on. just because i pick 1 out of the 3 classes in the game does not make me any less human for doing so. i am playing a VIDEO GAME that is not REAL and not REAL LIFE. this shit makes friends turn on eachother.

PVP is okay, i never really cared for it but likewise this doesn't affect my review considering that's a whole different world

It's was once a good game for me. it might be still good for you, i will not call you out on it.  I will not deny the fact that i have had fun with it, i was interested in the lore; i was enthralled by all of it's positive aspects and furthermore it has given me alot of joy. i have invested way more hours into battlenet version than the steam version of this game.



 i just wish there was an ""okay"" option for steam reviews."
7161,firrrrreeeeeeeeeee
7162,"I've never hated something I enjoy more
10/10 would LFG with no mic again"
7163,"love this game
"
7164,this game is just as fun as it is on console
7165,"Destiny definitely has it's ups and downs when it comes to shooter looter experience, but I'd say it's a great game to play with a group of friends and even meet/make some new ones along the way."
7166,eh
7167,"The still have a decent amount of things you can do for free, but I would recommend getting at least the current DLC. Game looks great and plays better on PC than console. Did have a nice kill that the enemy was pushed into the wall. I found it entertaining."
7168,yes

7171,Very solid and fun mechanics ruined with collect endless and meaningless kill 10 things and find 15 things missions.
7172,"I've been playing destiny since d1 alpha so I feel like I've really been with this game since the start, and it has to be my favourite game. It's quite a grindy game and if that is an appeal to you then its worth giving it a shot. Sometimes the game can become somewhat repetitive, especially in between seasons when the content isn't always being pumped out. But I take that as an opportunity to replay some of the older content throughout the year or challenge myself to some hard challenges.

Storytelling has been a big thing that us players have asked to be integrated into the game more throughout the past few years and Bungie have definitely delivered on that front, While it isn't perfect in some people's eyes. It definitely is good and helps keep me, and others interested to see the developments within the game week after week. I would argue that this is the most exciting time to get into playing the game as the storytelling potential and development of content continues to improve with each season and major DLC.

However, I do have to mention that gamemodes like crucible and gambit do not receive nearly as much attention as their PVE counterparts, whether its from the lack of new maps or repetitive gameplay. There are certainly factors that could be improved to draw more people into these gamemodes. And i will credit Bungie for recognising this and creating freelance for trials to give the solo players a chance to earn some of the more lucrative loot in the game. But i do somewhat play PVP, and will say that it is largely enjoyable as it is fast paced and dynamic, even if the meta largely stays the same for months at a time.

Raids, dungeons and grandmaster nightfalls provide some of the most challenging and fun content in the game, as these really push the player and teammates to communicate and think outside of the box. However, i do know that not everyone is able to do these. Which is why i feel that it is nice that bungie created the preservation mission in witch queen as it allows the normal player to be involved with the story of the raid and still gives them access to the areas which are largely raid-only.

Finally, this game is one that requires your time. With the story constantly changing, it can become very easy to lose catch of what's happening in the game and especially for new players entering the game they will have no clue whats happening. I think Bungie could do a better job summarising what happened until the start of the DLC launch at the point new players join. But thankfully youtubers within the community do an amazing covering all the story. I do think this game is great fun and has its strengths as both a single player and multiplayer game.     :)"
7173,Need some new player freindliness otherthan that solid game.
7174,"its a shit game don""t download"
7175,don't do it to yourself.

7185,amazing game

7187,"Don't play this, The game is boring, DLC's are getting hidden just because.
On top of that this game is just... small, Open worlds are travellable by car (Sparrow) in mere minute.
Story is non-existent, and most of it is hidden behind seasons and other P2P garbage anyway.
0/10 Would NOT recommend, even free to play is meh."
7188,gay game

The small and artistic looking hedges were the only thing that sort of kept my megalophobia in check but now i constantly have to live in fear whilst being in the main city of the game. Thanks bungie."

7198,"Awesome game, but very unfriendly to new players. Takes quite a while to understand the game mechanics and the intricacies of weapons and armor as nothing is explained. However, the gunplay is second to none, and the creativity behind the weapons and armor builds are insanely great. If you have the time and desire to have a time sink, this is definitely a great one, and much more reasonably priced compared to some other MMOs."

7228,its a good game
7229,Conetent does not cross transfer between platfoms. Season grind bring down QOL of gameplay.

7263,"For starters, this game is great. The game it's self is not the issue. It has the most comfortable and fun movement and ability mechanics and the greatest gun play I've ever felt in a shooter. It's the only FPS PVP game that I haven't uninstalled all together. I have played CoD, Battlefield, Halo, and just about every FPS game that had come out up until CoD: MW. No game has ever felt as good as this game has. And I may force myself to play it until the end of it's days, I even go back to D1 every now and then. Nothing compares to Destiny.

That being said, this negative review is not about the game it self, but for the community that comes with it. There isn't a single person who can hate this game more than the people who play it, and some are just not afraid to show it. In all areas, no matter where you play, Crucible, Raids, Gambit, it will never fail that within the first hour of playing, someone ELSE will come to ruin your day to play it. It doesn't matter how they do it, through voice chat or in game ways to continuously rub salt in your wounds. The term ""ego"" would fall far short of an explanation towards the community. In Crucible, you will have the solo elitists who only live their PVP life aiming to be the very best. Since there is no SBMM (yet), you will always run into at least one person who quite literally need to play a new game. They hop on strictly aiming to gun down the whole lobby because they literally have nothing else to do. They've played the PVE, it didn't sit well with them so they stuck to PVP unless they needed the next God Roll to give them the edge in PVP. Which spreads essentially like a virus, then everyone has to use THE God Roll or else they'll be bad, and followed by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). They'll take that God Roll and hop in to the match and aim to never let you kill them. Which sure, that's great that you are that good, but without SBMM, you're quite literally ruining other peoples games. Primarily in Rumble (the FFA mode) is where they go, and before you have even gotten your super, they've ended the game. And then if they're toxic, they're make sure to express how bad YOU are, the person hopping in TO GET BETTER, and then loop that Juice WRLD song right on over again. None of the PVP community supports each other, not one of them. It doesn't matter if you found an off meta gun that you're comfortable with, if you do good enough to keep up, they'll pull out whatever means necessary to shift the tides back to a Mercy (The game ends by a call from the announcer to end the game early due to it being unfair) and win the game and go back with their ego inflated and your confidence shrunk. Oh, and Stacks (3 or more players in a group queuing up together) are a huge thing. Don't get on Destiny on Trials (Competitive) weekend with the intention to have fun in Crucible, you'll run into at least one 3 stack every other game who will inevitably Mercy you with the weapons they used to win in Trials and will cause your whole team to just head back to orbit because they no longer can leave spawn. Speaking of teammates leaving, there's no punishment! So everyone can do it with nothing but a quick message from Shaxx just reminding you that 3 seconds ago you left the game and your friends might not like that. Well with Teammates leaving, comes people Joining In Progress. Well that CAN be a good thing. but what about when you're searching for Guardians and suddenly it goes from (0/12) to (12/12) and without hesitation, just connects you and throws you right on in. Best case scenario? Someone accidentally queued up for the wrong mode and left and you get to start right into the match with maybe a few points behind. But most common? It's usually the subtitles showing up, saying that Zone B is lost, to spawn in to a [ 24 | 98 ] match already about to Mercy rule. You know what would fix this? A FUCKING FREELANCE VERSION OF ALL MODES. Let stacks fight stacks and let solos fight solos. Every stack you come across will already have their ego's inflated because all they have fought is a 4 solo's and a duo every game. So of course they'll win. 

In Gambit, you'll either have a bunch of PVE or Gambit nuts who are just there to have fun, but then there's always a team of people with that one or two super good PVP hooking them up with an easy win as they invade and drop your whole team, over and over until you somehow kill them or the timer runs out and it sends them back. And I don't mean that they have to run around the map to get you. Chances are, you'll spawn in the same spot you started the match at. And after that invader hits 4 headshots and sends you back to spawn, they'll just shoot their  Gjalli and wipe your whole team right off spawn. OH, when you die, you give the boss health :) further resetting your progress as they clean up and go. Gambit teams themselves don't have to emote or anything. Nothing sucks more than hopping into gambit, needing to collect 100 motes for a quest and yet for a whole game you banked 8. It's disheartening because a lot of people play this game solo, simply because they might be too ignorant to all of the game and are trying to learn, or they have trouble talking to new people and can't approach the people in the community. (Hmmm, wonder why?) Nothing too awful about the community in Gambit, really. Just the teams that come in the end the game as fast as possible. It's just not fun.

Dang, all those PVP nerds are really getting to you, huh? How about we just chill with the PVE people who will regularly Raid? Yeah! The multiple doses of Dopamine that I was LOOKING FOR when I wanted to improve my shot in PVP clearly isn't working, we can just go do some PVE and get some of that from the sick loot we could finally get from Raids and Dungeons. ...Right..? Good luck finding new people to Raid with. It's hard to find Nice people and It's hard to find good people, let alone, both. No one wants to just DO a Raid. They want to Flawless it, they wanna' do the Raid Challenges, they want to do it on Master, and if you haven't done it before ever meeting anyone on here, how dare you. You should be able to have the whole Raid memorized, no matter how new you are. You better not die, you better not be goofy, you better not have FUN. No one who's already far enough in the game wants to help anyone. Very few people will literally do it for their job. They have people pay them to do it. But that's even harder to deal with because then that person is just as much of a wildcard as simple randoms. 

All in all, I do love the game. The game it self is a blast. But the only possible way I can even enjoy playing this game solo, and as a PVP main, is if the Boke a Smowl. The only way I can play for more than a couple hours.

There isn't a community that I've ever experienced that is more toxic than the Destiny Community. It's all ego's, all distruction, harassment, degrading, bullying, ect. Oh, did I mention that the 3 classes in the game are all essentially Racers (use your brain)? Worlocks are the best, no Hunters are, no Titans! Speaking of Titans, they bullied a Dev off of Twitter because they weren't bringing back an exotic. OH, the community targets you if you use the LGBTQ+ Emblem or any Emblem that supports a minority. 

There you go. That's the actual reason there's really anything negative about the game. Everyone wants only what THEY want and if you say no, cancelled. If you can get passed that, many people can, then I promise you that you will have fun. Screw anyone who tells you NOT to use a weapon because they don't like it. Listen to the ones who tell you WHY you shouldn't use it. That goes for anything about your build. Do what YOU want. Ignore the rest."

7272,"Destiny 2 is an astounding MMO game. It's more or less free to play, but you definitely get more perks by putting some money into it. I think this game is good for rather young tweens too, not just teenagers. I mean, if your kid can handle violence and slightly scary scenes, then definitely let them have a try at Destiny. There isn't any harsh language or explicit themes.
Destiny is a bit confusing to navigate at first, at least for many, but once you figure everything out the game can be a very enjoyable and entertaining one to play. It's a good way to bust down some time, especially if you play a few Crucible or Gambit matches, or maybe some Nightfall. Overall very enjoyable! Would recommend."
7273,I hate it
7274,"This game is epic. 5 years later and I still boot it up everyday. Between the movement, the gunplay and the abilities and supers.. This game delivers the ultimate pvp experience testing your skill, strategy, timing, execution. I love this game and enjoy the reward system, aesthetics, etc. It's fire."
7275,Good
7276,"Solstice event should of been longer or the armour should be able to be rerolled after the event with glimmer + upgrade modules or other materials.    The store version also should apply to all three classes if its bought.

Also now that i've got my glowing armour what will i bother to do? cause all of the story has been vaulted / deleted so its mostly just online pvp or a wave shooter pve so quite dull, I still enjoy halo's story mode better or there online pvp probably cause there vehicles to run people over with."

7282,"im gonna level with you, im finally writing this review so it stops popping up for me

destiny 2. its a game. you are either going to despise its continued existence and hope for its end, usually after rage quitting in the tutorial. obvs that sounds like a nice experience but youd be surprised how often ive seen it. the flipside obviously is you getting drawn in and becoming one of us lmao.

at the end of the day, destiny brings something very unique to the table that no other looter shooter has truly been able to do, the gunplay is crisp- the pvp, while infuriating, is also... well. its hit or miss for every player, but im of the opinion that this game lives and breathes because of its existence. without pvp, or any alternate modes other than killing random aliens, the allure would be lost. the idea of taking down a massive raid boss with 5 buds, or maybe 5 random strangers you just met, and then taking the gun it dropped and ruining another video gamer's day with it is something not many games offer. and that, is the highlight of this game. it has a unique, and while janky at times, social aspect. you can be chilling in the tower, dancing like the world is ending, and get a message from a person asking you to join. hell, if youre set to open, people can just join on you and you can drag them kicking and screaming into a nightfall if you really wanted. d2 is a burgeoning mmo, and is it flourishes, itll only cement its place as THE looter shooter with space magic of all time. thanks for coming to my ted talk, play the game- dont judge it based on the tutorial the tutorial is HORRIBLE. gear up, go do a raid. try some pvp with the new toys you get. dont give up before the good part. just trust us on this one, promise


(although if you really want to, you could wait until they overhaul the tutorial. its gonna happen eventually, because they cant in their right mind think its good right now. its horrible. power through it, or wait. take your pick)"
7283,"run
plz run"
7284,god
7285,It's cool so far
7286,"The game is cool but the PvP is to be less than desired. Broken builds paired with armor and abilities with little to no balancing for the mode. Their top PvP game mode being Trials of Osiris really shines on a light of the current state of this side of the game. To cap it off, the community is even worse.  Toxicity and egos run rampant as well as constant drama on social media, which looks even worse. The PvE things are okay if you have a group of friends, the LFG is filled with toxic players who yell and belittle players who don't know the mechanics of said raid. Toxicity and lack of meaningful PvP changes and spamming elements. I would recommend League of Legends as even that games toxicity doesn't reach the magnitude of the Destiny 2."
7287,"If you're looking to be FULLY free to play, The game isn't as nearly as fun, not enough actually fun or interesting content - just recycled resources.
If you're looking to buy everything prepare for your purchases to become free content after a year, unless it is campaign content. 
Seasonal events are reused year on year, with only cosmetics being new and refreshing.
Exotics are not rare or even particularly hard to get unless it is a raid exotic. 
The endgame content such as seasonal quests are far superior to most other games, but can lack depth.
But enough with the negatives.
As many problems as this game has, the gameplay loop is very enjoyable depending on whether you pay pve or pvp, with pve being the focus and therefore being more engaging, yet pvp offering the occaisional slaughterfest to quench your blood thirst.
I have 2000+ hours on the ps4 version of this game, if you are concerned about whether to play pc or console, there are not many non-graphical differences.
The classes are a 10/10, each one giving a unique experience with a massive variety of builds.
Gunplay is 10/10, again a lot of variety with pretty much any weapon being usable and strong.
Bought DLC campaigns are a 9/10, Shadowkeep is alright, Beyond light is very fun and Witch Queen is even better - Forsaken i believe is no longer playable but was a 10.
Characters/NPCs are super great a 9/10. i love blueberry man.
The lore is 100/10, so much to unpack with secrets and new stories around every corner.
Should you give this game a try even if you aren't willing to spend money? Absolutely.
Will you like it? Probably.
Have I spent too many hours of my youth grinding this game? Hell yeah."

7307,"fuck this game, fuck the devs, fuck the players"
7308,"PvP is still in a rough spot, SBMM should be a thing in all PVP modes. This game caters too much to the streamers. Trials is especially in a rough spot, the matchmaking makes no sense. Don't get me wrong it should be a tough mode, but the top 1% players need to play against themselves, they should have to earn their lighthouse run same as everyone else. If they can go to the lighthouse easily multiple times per weekend, seems like something if off on the matchmaking.

When people are obvious hackers, and get reported by everyone, Bungie should use the same methods as other games and notify players ""someone they reported was banned"". ALSO Bungie should actually ban the hackers...Since stats are tracked, players with 100% hit ratios with weapons that have 1000s of kills... it should just be an auto ban...Show the Community that you care about pvp and hackers.

Fix PVP, Fix Trials, and Fix SBMM. Please DO NOT Tell me its connection based, SOOOO MANY Times I get matched with people with TERRIBLE LAG. I do not know how the Trials matchmaking is being done, but its definitely OFF.
"
7309,Good game to play with friends
7310,3/5
7311,"The game got better after its first year but it is once again deteriorating into a big fomo time sink. Either Bungie has completely lost touch with its players or all its ambition has dried up. I should have un-installed sooner but I sunk alot of time into this game and felt like it would be a waste to leave. The game now feels like enough of a chore to play that I can't stay anymore. The biggest contributor to my grief is the multiplayer components and the sunsetting of DLC's and Bungies slow response time to adress bugs. Most of all, I hate the Trials of osiris. Hiding some of the best guns and better looking armors behind such a detestable game mode with ridiculous win conditions was a huge mistake. Especially on top of Destiny 2's weak map designs the match maker is a massive downgrade from D1."
7312,erm
7313,my friend samartinski and marco circle k made me get this SHIT game do not play it the DLCS are SHIT and SCAM
7314,game of the millennia
7315,i don't know what the fuck is going on
7316,Destiny 1 was better
7317,"best game ever
"
7318,"I recommend Destiny 2 as a great free play experience.
One of the best shooter gameplay experiences around today. Great character movement and gun play. Excellent world environments and art style. Interesting evolving story line.

I do not recommend Destiny 2 as a paid experience.
The paid for content is not owned by the customer, it is effectively a ""medium term rental"". 
All the content will at some point be taken away, as most of the previous paid content, including the original story arc has been removed. Rewards and earned equipment will be made redundant and virtually useless, or unusable. 

You, the paying customer are expected to rent the new content when it is released, and go without the older content that you had previously paid for.

You are expected to re-buy the game every year at a premium price. 

As of 2022, the content is now divided and pay-walled. Choose your price. Gaming and gambling addicts beware, this is pure predatory consumerism."
7319,pee pee poo poo
7320,It's pretty alright
7321,"If you have bad luck don't play this game
"
7322,"My friends like to play this game a lot, so I have to keep playing. It's good but sometimes I miss going outside and the touch of another human being. 10/10"
7323,Was good until i took away content
7324,its alriht
7325,ily avy! <3
7326,This game is very cool and I love the movement.
7327,This game has its moments but the lore is so good and the new 3.0 sub classes have made it so much better. Highly recommend for people that are into fps open world.
7328,good i guess
7329,Definitely one of the games of all time
7330,"Despite its issues I find it fun
"
7331,its ok

7333,great game
7334,gun shoot
7335,"After playing Destiny 2 for about 5 years on Blizzard and migrating to Steam with about 3,000+ hours combined I cannot recommend this game anymore as I have invested a lot of my time and money in this game. I have played and paid more than $300 for its cosmetics, all DLC expansions since 2017, and seasons as the last season I played was Season 16 (Risen) as these words I'm typing are coming from a hardcore and die-hard gamer for whatever I'm playing. It's been fun in the early days then I stopped playing around the time the Witch Queen expansion came out.

I cannot recommend spending money on this game anymore as content is most likely not worth their asking price of $40 for the new main story expansion which is mandatory if you want to play the new seasons and an additional $10 for each season pass you want or if you bought the deluxe edition then it's $80 which is like a whole new game, instead you get some new mechanics, mode, weapon, exotic, story, dungeon, raid, etc. where they want you to play the game a certain way and maybe your content may or not be sunsetted/vaulted like everything before Beyond Light which is season 11 (Arrivals). RIP

I've been through sunsetting and had content deleted, I got rid of good gear I've grinded for months just for it to be useless later. They brought back refurbished places and weapons for people to do and pay for the same thing in repetition. BTW I am not kidding they re-use assets a lot. Also not to mention the content drought and constant end-game grinding where you want to farm a god roll weapon or armor with good stats is highly unlikely as you might need to finish a Master Lost Sector, Raid, Grandmaster Nightfall, or Trials more than at least 12 or more times in my experience just to get a gun or exotic you want to drop and have decent stats you wanted on it. BIG OOF

Throughout my time playing Destiny 2 they have made improvements but never addressed problems the community has been begging and ranting about such as the lack of choices and challenges set out for the players to do. It has always been like you have to buy this major main story DLC to play the seasons or continue to play on leveling up your character in this game. Not only that but you would have to power grind your power level to the new power cap every single season and expansion to do all these daily and weekly challenges for a couple of weeks to eventually in a couple of months you would have to do that all over again.

This game wants you to be addicted to it and make you do time-consuming stuff in repetition to make you spend more time on it. Even if you haven't noticed it but it's not okay spending 2 to 12+ hours a day just to level or grind for your character/s. Spending every single day and the weekends only for you to grind and waste your time on something that may or not guarantee something you wanted. Not to mention sunsetting, good thing they paused that and they listened to their player base right? But you can never get back those hours or moments you had playing this game using a new gun you just grinded just for it to be power creeped by some other gun in the new season because it can be upgraded to the new power cap or has some new special perk that may or not be better than than the gun you got.

PVE against bot enemies we've all been there when we get a new enemy type and turns out they're very hard to kill without the new subclass, mod, or weapon you just got let alone what power level you are. Like champions, new factions, or types of the hive they have their moments where at one point they're just regular storm troopers and then they become pin accurate aimbots. Their combat behavior changes from passive to a killing machine massacring all your teammates as you try to stun or escape them because they're immune. Overall the bot enemies in this game are unforgiving, especially in end-game content. My go to loadout messing around was always Heritage, Trinity Ghoul, and Falling Guillotine.

The only thing left is PVP and oh boy this one is a real mess. The cheating by other players with aimbot or walling has become rampant as their anti-cheat has banned a lot of them but it's not enough. Sometimes you're gonna have to report them and hope for the best in most cases not to mention also taking an L in a comp or trial game. As a person who loves PVP, most of the time in this game it's not just about skill. Most of the time who's using the most broken weapon in the game as my favorite Mountaintop, you will be missed, was a player's choice of weapon getting the easiest kills like Recluse when it came out and 140-120 RPM Hand cannons breaking the meta. But I did not like how power level mattered in Iron Banner and Trials of Osiris as a guy 10-20 levels higher than you can body shot you with a sniper rifle while only making a dent on him only for him to heal or regenerate health taking cover. Even your subclass or exotic armor you wear can be a game breaker from winning a fair match to an unwinnable one.

Titans and hunters are favorably the most used among players as I'm a warlock main they certainly have unfair advantages against other classes. Back when stasis came out it was a hunter's best class for just its freezing potential and cheap tricks for easy kills by the way they're still popular with a few nerfs compared to titans and warlocks. Warlocks in my opinion are a minority and always get nerf hammered to the point of being unplayable to useless.

Back when solar classes were fixed Icarus dash was fairly balanced and the community was targeting it like it's the most broken thing because they can dash 2 times and get a speed advantage with their super. While hunters can still dodge spam with a limited cooldown, shatterdive free kills, and the Mask of Bakris is still unbalanced. Even titans still barricade spam, sprint charge /w Dunemarchers capable of killing a whole team, and Ward of Dawn is still impossible to break or kill its user unless you got a high damage super or weapon that can rival it as it cannot guarantee you can kill the guy inside. Then you got warlock with its nova warp brought back to its former glory with a speed nerf, no one is mad about that, stasis turrets that you can break with a shotgun, well of radiance where they can break by shooting the top orb enough, and Dawnblade where you can now have dash and tracking with the new subclass UI where you still can't outrun a hunter running away, using it's super, and jump spamming to do a shatterdive shotgun combo.

Warlocks are underappreciated in so many aspects as much non-warlock mains sees us as support characters for our ****ing well of radiance in raids and nightfalls they even bail because we don't use them in LFGs and they're the ones that keep dying LMAO. I rock a stasis turret build in grandmaster/master missions and nightfalls and never had anyone complain ""WHY DON'T YOU USE WELL OF RADIANCE"" because I'm freezing everyone and I have a healing rift you can use while were taking cover and I usually get it back after a few seconds. Plus I don't see anyone complain if you go full warlock in a raid and go nova bomb with empowering rift, tractor cannon, and do DPS with our weapons. Compared to any other class they can't function right in a raid team full of hunters or titans. Sometimes I wish Bungie would listen to their brains and fight them with logic. Just say no to those haters and maybe talk about what their broken things are and maybe nerf their ****.

I think I'm done rambling about this game as I am 100% done with it and moved on to a different one. This one took a huge chunk of my life but the time I spent playing this game will not be forgotten. The memories of vaulted content and how I loved this game before will no longer be experienced by new players. I only typed this review because I was bored as **** and this was the least I could do leaving a review for this game for people to read and think about. GLHF

More stuff in the comments..."
7336,I spent 1400+ hours of my life playing this game. It's good.
7337,too manyhnerdas
7338,Decent game

7340,"I didn't really get to play this on my old PC but i did just buy a new one and there are quite a few pay walls in the game but the game also offers FTP (free to play) players alot for a free title. a Raid and a Dungeon. after all the paywalls the game can be very fun (access to all new and old content such a exotics, raids, and dungeons and many more)"
7341,"redownload, play for a few days, realize you wasted your money on yet another expansion, repeat every new expansion. this is the destiny experience."
7342,haha hoverbike go brrrrrr
7343,"Developed testicular cancer playing this game, I love it!!!"
7344,its aight
7345,"Juego de mierda me arruino la vida, lo amo."
7346,Way better than I thought this game was going to be PC.
7347,It's a game that you can literally waste hours playing killing the same things over and over while you sink further and further into your depression. But it feels good
7348,Destiny 1 2 is the best game since 2015
7349,it's very good game
7350,"Complete and total dumpster fire. Trials is broken. PVP in general is broken. New chat exploit where you can kick players to orbit during trials matches which gives them a loss and then if it happens again flaws their cards and bans them for 30 mins because they didn't complete the match. Gatekeepers and K/D farmers resetting their cards so they don't go flawless and have to play in the flawless pool Sunday and Monday. Literally have top 0.1% Elo and top 500 players who are clearly cheating (100% head shot kills with auto rifle and smg out of 5,000 kills, sniping you when they are looking 180 degrees in the opposite direction (yup saved clips but who cares? they are just better), sniping you while you jump over them invis and they immediately snap up and head shot you in 1ms (again they are just better) even top streamers (who cry about matching making being too hard for carries) are reporting these guys. The streamers have 3.5 KD in trials seasonal and Bungie still does nothing about it. They cheaters still have their accounts as well as everyone paying for recovs, last seaon they were 0.5KD but this season they are 2.5KD totally doable. SBMM doesn't exist, there is no rhyme or reason why you at bottom 30-90% elo are matching up against 0.1% elo and top 500 players....just deal with it? or get good? Absolutely broken. 

Also Bungie continually goes after companies who are selling ""cheats and hacks"" because they cant create and Anti-Cheat software to stop them. Feels bad man."
7351,Amazing...
7352,good
7353,"Oh sh+t, the game is stuck again!
The game has interesting content(raids, contracts, a lot of weapons, etc.) which you need to buy))
But this is a not main minus
The game is stuck many times at the start or when a mission is loading, and you have to reload the game again and again and this is not related to hardware
This is just glitch in the game and the main MINUS of this game
Not recommend this game"

7362,"Big bummer that old content is inaccessible but the new stuff is very good. I've dipped in and out of this game since they were under Bobby K's thumb, and its only since Witch Queen and reconnecting with an old friend that I've gotten much more into it.

I still have plenty to do and collect in the game. very much looking forward to it and coming expansions etc."
7363,"Destiny 2 is a good game, don't get me wrong. 

BUT the performance and ram eating is awful. I have to turn my settings all the way down so it that looks like a Nintendo DS. And not even that helps the issue. 

If you have a good computer, go ahead. but you better have atleast 16GB of RAM to run it properly

(GPU doesnt help if your ram is being eaten.)

I reccomend the game. But fix the memory leak."
7364,"If you're looking for a rewarding looter/shooter with engaging gameplay and a high skill ceiling, then Destiny is for you! The writing has only gotten better season over season as well. Some cons: the game IS free to play, but in my opinion, it's pay to enjoy, so take that as you will. I personally find it worth the investment on both a time and money front. I look forward to even more time with this franchise!"
7365,"this game is cool
this game is still cool 16 hours later
still cool after 71 hours"
7366,great time sink game if you have friends. a bit repetitive. if your solo you can kinda get by but its def a lot less fun
7367,good
7368,"meh
"
7369,"this game is like crack
update: still crack"
7370,"This is a yes i would and no i would not recommend. I have about 1900 hours played over 2 steam accounts and PS4 account. I would recommend if you have played D1 and D2 prevoiusly, have friends to play with and if you have the entire game, dlc's and season. But I would tell you NO do not play this game if your a solo player and do not plan on purchasing DLC's. If you are just going to play the free version your wasting your time, your locked out of a lot of content and this game does not assist you in how to level up efficiently. Bungie has crammed 15 pounds of C@#p in a 2 pound bag. The game is bloated and unless you like spending time on a video platform watching other players tell you how to grind gear and level up, walk away, do not buy this game."
7371,nice game
7372,"i like lore, i like universe, i no play for too long, i no burn out

bad design choices here and there, no angry but needs change to be fun thruout full seasons

game good, be careful"

7392,cool game

7404,Since release I've seen myself come back each expansion to play some more.
7405,"Horrible game. Forced at gun point to buy every DLC known to man kind, wasn't my decision."
7406,good
7407,This is a amazing video game that i highly recommend. In 50 hours of playing i was very far in the game. This game isn't a pay to play or even progress fast. All you need i decent First person shooter skills and you are golden.
7408,It's changed. It's fun again. Only change I would recommend is making it easier for new players and adding a LFG for Raids and such. Not every one has active clans.
7409,i like the missions and combat

7413,Dogshit Garbage
7414,"Beautiful to look at, horrible to play.

An unfortunate poorly functioning mess. Along side broken boss battles, dying more than once means a total loss. And not just that, dying once shatters all Ghost interaction all together. Breaking reviving of teammates and finishing some bosses. This makes missions essentially a once chance deal while not telling you such.

So much fun... When it f*cking works, which it often doesn't."
7415,ITS FUN
7416,destiny 2 can be summed up in two words “touch grass” if you want to do anything thing in destiny you better be prepared to never touch grass again because in this amazing game you can spend 40 hours just to get one piece of loot and still lose or ofc spend your entire life savings or just pull out your moms trusty credit card because with the new update you can just buy everything
7417,great game with great visuals and immersing storyline and character building
7418,"Pvp is pretty fun, sunsetting is bad. If you wanna waste hundreds of hours on the funky space man game its kinda fun."
7419,"Really liked the game, now I have a life and not enough time to play it though. If you’ve got time to burn then spend it grinding on d2, it’ll be fun while it lasts."
7420,Great game over all

7422,yes
7423,"I DO NOT know, if it's a good or bad game. But what I DO know the fact, that if you can't play the game, it's bad (marmot bug, if you ask).

...I got it working. At first, delete Steam Destiny 2 folder and BattlEye with commands. Then reinstall it and it should work."
7424,good soup
7425,"Been playing since destiny 1 on PS3, then PS4 and Destiny 2 on PS4 until i made the switch to PC. 10/10 would recommend this game to anyone competitive or not"
7426,"Game still sucks,"
7427,"This game is awful, I only play it because my friends do and i bet most players feel the same way.
The amount of money you are expected to invest to play this game is unreal and it just keeps asking for more. The amount of time to get anywhere in this game is quite unreal as well.

Originally I played on console and it seems the majority of players are too stupid to understand how most of the raid mechanics work so you have to sit there and struggle to learn for hours and often players just back out until the group dies without clearing. 

Coming back to this game i felt overwhelmed, lost and confused. I had partially finished quests i couldn't complete because of paywall expansions I didn't feel were necessary to RE-PURCHASE. Nothing in this game makes any sense to a new player not even if you play through the campaign.

The PVP is mostly untouched by me and for good reason, nothing more to say here.

Probably the worst game I've ever played in my entire life don't ever spend any money on this game, don't ever let your friends convince you its a good idea to play this game.

Great soundtrack though! 5/5"

7431,Its a ok game
7432,"Fun game.  Love Warframe, but this is very enjoyable."
7433,it  a nice game
7434,"Trash game. Hell, even the updating music is extremely loud and obnoxious. Can't even watch a video while waiting! Not new user friendly at all. Punishes you for being a newer player. Even older players are punished behind paywalls. So many hurdles to jump through with little gain."
7435,very good
7436,Please add sex option with ADA-1 and BDSM with Savathun after defeating her.
7437,"This game requires time and a tonne of knowledge to enter but once you are in, you've found a great game. I've loved this franchise since D1 and it's only getting better."

7439,0/10 would not recommend.
7440,"Fun game. The best part of the whole game is Gambit. Man i love gambit! It's so fun and interactive. The community also seems to love it just as much as i do. Nothing quite like loading into a match of gambit and feeling satisfied with how the devs made it. Honestly they should make a gambit event or a gambit like game mode. The enemies are really tanky and do a lot of damage but it's so rewarding to get that crispy 1 mote! Then the game becomes a horror game when SpecialSock2718 invades and kills your whole team. The endgame is kinda difficult since it relies on the pvp aspect for you to win, but every game mode needs to take inspiration from gambit so they can compete with the glorious mode called gambit. You also get to meet the funny Drifter who is a 100% without a doubt pantie slinging chad. 10/10 needs more gambit"

7455,"This game is not free, and if someone recommends it to you, you should take the price as somewhere around 80$ to 160$ depending on which expansions are still buyable.

Besides that, the story is disjointed, especially if you ever take a few months off from it, a lot of the story is no longer accessible, and the new player experience is currently bafflingly bad for a game this well-reviewed.

The gameplay itself is pretty solid, but the game will expect you to grind without end for low RNG chances at usable items, will inflict FOMO on you in multiple ways, and would really like you to play extra money on top of the asking price for cosmetics. The only reason it's not as panned as Marvel's Avengers - which might even be [i]overall cheaper[/i] - is a solid heaping of nostalgia for Destiny 1 and story content that has since been removed from Destiny 2. Also the FOMO.

Seriously, the Fear Of Missing Out is so strong in Destiny 2 that I'm just going to list every current source of it that I can remember right now. This list is absolutely not exhaustive:
[list]
    [*]Banshee, who sells randomized, and occasionally good, guns that [b]Rotate Daily[/b].
    [*]Ada, who sells a very small selection from a much larger pool of necessary mods that [b]Rotate Daily[/b], with some mods only appearing once every couple months.
    [*]Xur, who appears [b]Each Week, Friday to Monday[/b] with randomized powerful gear that [b]Rotates Each Appearance[/b].
    [*]Eververse, which sells cosmetics for an earnable currency with a selection that [b]Rotates Weekly[/b].
    [*]The earnable currency is obtained, among other ways, from a [b]Weekly Activity[/b] that can be missed.
    [*]Seasons, which are selections of story content that drop [b]Every Three Months[/b], and are [b]Removed Each Expansion[/b].
    [*]The Season Pass, which is a 100-rank reward track attached to each Season that must be completed before the Season ends, ie; within [b]Three Months[/b] or all the rewards you could have earned are lost.
    [*]You can earn up to ten Transmog Materials per character [b]Each Season[/b], and unearned materials are lost.
    [*]Whatever the oldest content in the game is, which might be removed('Content Vaulted') to make space for new content [b]Each Expansion[/b], which is about [b]Once A Year[/b].

7467,"Between two platforms; on Destiny 2 I have 1,961 hours, and I CONFIDENTLY cannot recommend this game to any potentially new players. I have been playing the destiny franchise since release in 2014, I was in the fourth grade at the time and it was the most enthralling game I'd ever played, Destiny 1 was a groundbreaking title that revolutionized the first person shooter genre and became the household name behind 'looter shooter', and for good reason. Fast forward, the year is 2022 and Bungie has entirely lost their way. A triple A studio powered no longer by the interests of their craft but instead the corporate greed of monetary gain. THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE UNLESS YOU HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL SUM OF MONEY TO GET THROUGH PAYWALLS. The game is free now I guess, but what you receive are barren landscapes to mindlessly wander with seemingly no objective except increase your 'power', which is impossible because everything is behind a paywall, anything that actually gives the game any sort of playable value has a price, a steep one at that, g2a doesn't even budge from steam prices seemingly at all at points. You have a strike playlist activity that rewards virtually nothing, a dead game mode they haven't hardly touched or bothered fixing at all since the year it released in, and PVP. CRUCIBLE (PVP) IS UNENJOYABLE AND UNPLAYABLE FOR NEW PLAYERS. The PVP landscape is harsh and monotone, the balancing (or rather lack thereof) is abysmal in all departments with SOME CLASSES INTRINSICALLY HAVING INNATE ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER CLASSES and that to change that fact the foundation of the game would practically have to be uprooted entirely. Without being able to pay substantial volumes of money you will not be able to experience a good quality of gameplay or competitiveness at all in PVP gameplay as the weapons and abilities you need to perform even moderately are again locked behind paywalls. And the balancing is the epitome of failure of Bungie's attempt to create a healthy PVP environment. PVP IS AND HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY NEGLECTED AND UNBALANCED SINCE RELEASE. There are roughly 10 give or take broken weapons at any given point since the games release, and if you do not use them you will pay the price in every game. They are leaps and bounds above the standard catalog of weapons and as you probably guessed, they're locked behind paywalls. Typically falling into either requiring a yearly expansion (60$) or a seasonal (10$). THE SEASONAL MODEL THEY HAVE BEEN RUNNING WITH SINCE SHADOWKEEP (2019) IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED AND THEY DO NOT PLAN TO CHANGE IT. The content you pay for will be completely irrelevant at best next year, at worst and much more frequently? Next season. As they intentionally release increasingly more powerful weapons to INTENTIONALLY DECREASE THE VALUE OF EXISTING LOADOUTS AND STRATEGIES (POWER CREEP). They intentionally curate power creep in their games so you keep forking over your money for the latest meta in PVP or PVE so you can even enjoy the game at all past the paywalls, because without it no raid team or fireteam will take you, especially if you haven't dedicated egregious volumes of hours to power grinding to even be able to play relevant content. And in PVP you'll always lose your fights to someone who payed more money than you. Think they'll balance it? Get on your knees and pray like the rest of us. And finally, power grinding. POWER GRINDING IS AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF THE GAME THAT IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR REWARDING AND IS UNREASONABLE FOR CASUAL PLAYERS. To stay competitive in any sense you must spend hours at a time performing activities that you don't like over and over again for WEEKS AT A TIME. As a lot of content is virtually unplayable under the recommended power level. DIFFICULT CONTENT DOES NOT INCREASE IN DIFFICULTY THROUGH GAME MECHANICS BUT INSTEAD THROUGH MAKING YOU THE PLAYER WEAKER (ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY). Bungie's idea of a difficulty tweak is to raise the power of an activity essentially only making you and your abilities have weaker damage output while making the enemies do more damage and have larger health pools and is not at all entertaining. CHAMPIONS ARE AN OLD BANDAID FOR AN ANCIENT WOUND. Champions are in all slightly difficult content and are abundant in endgame content around every corner. Every season (Every three months) they force you to change your loadout with seasonal mods so you can combat these champions (which are minibosses with very large health pools). YOU WILL BE FORCED TO CHANGE YOUR LOADOUT TO WEAPONS YOU DO NOT LIKE TO SEE ANY MODICUM OF SUCCESS IN MID TIER TO ENDGAME CONTENT. Without the correct seasonal mods champions are un-killable and will ruin your runs, it does not feel good to go against and is unsatisfactory artifical difficulty. NOT TO MENTION YOU ARE GREATLY PUNISHED IF YOU OPT TO NOT KILL THEM IN YOUR LOOT REWARDS AT THE END OF YOUR ACTIVITY. That's all off the top of my head, this franchise has failed me, what happened Bungie? You were beautiful."

7480,Good
7481,"I paid $70 when this first came out, original campaign and 2 DLC, then another $30 for another DLC, a great story.......then they took it all out of the game.  I will never spend another penny on a bungie product, They broke my trust"
7482,One of my favorite games to play with friends. Bungie continues to get better within the game's lifecycle making the experience worthwhile
7483,I loved destiny 1 on the ps3 and have loved destiny ever since. ive only just got back into destiny 2 so im getting used to all the new stuff. destiny 2 is free to play but if you want to make the game even more fun then you'll need to buy DLCs some dlcs are a waste of money so be careful on what you choose :)

Yeah, they deserved every single bit of their recent harassment.

People are tired of being stolen from and having their PAID CONTENT removed because ""Haha we want to resell it to you later"".

The people who work at the offices of Bungie: You asked for that. You abused people and they're going to abuse you back for wronging them. That's the only thing you've truly earned with this monstrosity of a sales-scam.

You can ban people and hide in your subredit where people send death threats to your customers when they're upset, despite how ""Seriously"" you take it when someone mentions you had it coming from your treatment of your customers, but I digress.... You can't undo the damage you've already done to your customer base.

7518,"Of all the dying simulators on Steam, gameplay-wise Destiny 2 is easily one of the best. Movement, gunplay and hitboxes are all like butter.

My gripes come from the impressively unbalanced PVP which isn't so much based on skill as it is grinding to get better weapons and equipment meaning hello getting frequently two-shotted or one-shotted from an unseen enemy with OP weapons and/or specials that you ain't got. There's a great PvP in here for sure but the reliance on cheap tactics with OP weapons and specials ruins it unfortunately."
7519,"this game is very good i like the bosses and the customization most

7524,Goated game
7525,dont start playing its gonna f*ck up your social life
7526,"Dont buy this shit, they keep removing everything from when the game first launched so you cant get the whole story... i get it you come out with new stuff and that's great but keep everything else for fuck sake"
7527,"**Abysmally Boring**

TLDR; If you want to be thrown in to an incomprehensible world (because Bungie have removed so much content that understanding the who, what, and why questions is literally impossible) then go ahead.

As a new player to the Destiny franchise, I am severely disappointed by my experience. We start rising from a grave and we get told to fight these alien guys. Don't expect to ever get more context than that, as apparently Bungie (in their infinite wisdom) have removed all of the content that would give us any motivation or backstory to this world. The new player experience is one of confusion and frustration. Then, when googling ""why isn't Destiny 2 fun?"" you discover that Bungie have seemingly removed more content than currently exists in the entire game. I can't help but feel like even if I purchased the current DLCs I'd still lack context for the **MULTIPLE** campaigns that came before and that are currently literally unplayable.

The shooting is quite good, and I enjoyed using a bow and a sword. You'll never stop fighting the same 3 enemies, which shouldn't be a problem *per se* (just look at the Covenant in Halo), but at least you knew *why* you were fighting against the Covenent. You know, because the campaigns of the Halo games explains it to you.

There's only so much mindless running around and killing the same enemies that we could take before my friend and I asked ourselves ""what's the point in any of this?"" and uninstalled the game out of boredom. Call this a game demo, because there's **Literally Nothing To Do** if you don't buy DLCs. Bungie's ""living and evolving game"" ends up alienating new players with removed content and a lack of context."
7528,"top game, loads of challenges to keep you busy"
7529,"just didn't like the shooter mmo gameplay when i tried it

7535,"W Game, gave me anger issues and now my Nans on Life Support"
7536,Played and loved the game for some time. But when the DLC which I've purchased previously gets removed I become very disappointed with the direction of the game took. I mean removing the planets from around the solar system (they don't know what happened to them?!) it becomes complete BS!!! When I purchase something I expect it to be there until I stop playing it. Would not recommend this game due to the changes pushed on the players.

new players eehhhhh, hard to say. it does a terrible job for new players, not really directing you the best way past the new light questline. you really have to play it for a solid few months to understand what to do (plus all the lore to understand where the hell we are storywise)."

7565,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

I wanted to have a storyline to follow in this game, one like the first destiny, but its all locked behind dlc now, you only get about an hour or so of story before you are thrust into a game of a lot of basically open world possibility but little direction or reason to do what is provided.  If you plan on getting the DLC, go for it, they are good (or so ive heard), but if you are looking to play a good free storyline, unfortunately this isnt the one.  Also content has been vaulted from the game over the years, which with how massive the game is, makes sense, but it is still really not cool to see entire planets basically disappear from being able to be played at all."

7592,"WARNING: Just because a game is free does not mean it doesn't cost anything!!!!

Because of Destiny 2 I have lost my wife, my kids, my job, and, above all else, my happiness. I can't even remember waking up anymore as I spend all hours of my day on Destiny in a mindless limbo. I rarely leave the house, but when I do I boot the game on my Stadia (That I bought specifically for Destiny). When I launch the game I don't find the will to play it anymore. I watch my ship rock lazily in orbit. Back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And, despite my hatred for this game, the rest of my life seems dull when Destiny is not booted. The tool of language has broken in my 'real life'. My mom frequently tries to check on me (as I am soon being evicted), but her words are slurred in a certain Charlie Brown Adult style of speech. It's unfair; I want my life back. 

So I ask,

What is the meaning of our pointless existence? What cruel god put us on this rock? And to that same god, why can't I reset my life as easily as my Warlock, my Hunter, or my Titan?"

I haven't played Destiny since the ''Forsaken'' DLC. Now I really felt like playing Destiny 2 again and since my girlfriend is just discovering the first-person shooter genre for herself, it was the perfect time to show her Destiny and play it co-op with her. And then I found out THAT ALL THE FU***** CONTENT IS JUST GONE?! I bought Destiny 2 back then, bought the DLC's and even the deluxe edition of the Forsaken DLC because I really liked the game and I was happy to put money into it. My goodness the DLC's were expensive back then, but it was worth it to me... We're talking about a lot more than 150€ if you include the price of the main game... And now it's all gone! There is no story mode, neither main campaign nor side quests nor the campaigns of the DLC's? WHY CAN'T I PLAY THE MAIN GAME AND DLC'S THAT I !!!!BUYED!!!! ? What's left now? Running around stupid and only grind? Why are people still playing this? Why do people buy the current DLC's even though they know that they will also be removed from the game soon and that you will never be able to play them again afterwards? Why are the current DLC's so absurdly expensive again if you can't even keep them/can't play them again later? WHY THE FU** IS THIS S*** SUPPORTED BY CURRENT PLAYERS? I wish I could hold back, could say I'm disappointed in Bungie. But no, I'm angry! I want my money back, every damn penny! And not because I am dependent on it, but simply as a matter of principle. Then make a s*** Destiny 3 free to play where it's all about pointless banging around, repetitive, soulless and boring ''content'' BUT GIVE ME MY DAMN DESTINY 2 BACK THAT I INCL. DLC's PURCHASED! That's an absolute SCAM, I've never experienced anything like it in all my years of gaming. And I just don't understand why others like EA (e.g. Battlefield, Anthem), CD Projekt Red (e.g. Cyberpunk 2077), Ubisoft (e.g. Ghost Recon Wildlands) and others have really fallen on their faces because they made stupid decisions and then got punished with review bombing, bad PR etc. and this what Bungie did is just accepted?! It's just as if your favorite game that you bought at full price had been irrevocably removed from your Steam library for no reason (Steam is of course not to blame for Destiny 2, it's just an example)

If you still want to play Destiny 2 now, you should do it. BUT DON'T PUT MONEY DOWN BUNGIE'S A** THROUGH DLC OR COSMETICS PURCHASES! Also if you play Destiny 2 now as a new player, you will never experience the game as it was some years ago. At the start you will have the highest lvl and you will be forced to play End-Game content because the whole normal content got removed.

Deutsche Review Version:

Seit dem DLC ''Forsaken'' habe ich Destiny nicht mehr gespielt und eine lange Pause gemacht. Jetzt hatte ich mal wieder richtig lust bekommen Destiny 2 zu spielen und da meine Freundin gerade dabei ist das Ego-Shooter Genre für sich zu entdecken war das der perfekte Zeitpunkt ihr Destiny zu zeigen und es mit ihr Koop zu spielen. Und dann bekomme ich mit DAS DER GANZE VERDAMMTE CONTENT EINFACH WEG IST?! Ich habe Destiny 2 damals gekauft, habe die DLC's gekauft und sogar die Deluxe Edition vom Forsaken DLC da ich das Spiel wirklich mochte und ich gerne Geld investiert habe. Meine güte waren die DLC's damals teuer, aber das war es mir wert... Wir reden hier von weit aus mehr als 150€ wenn man den Preis vom Hauptspiel dazu zählt.. Und jetzt ist einfach alles weg! Es gibt keinen Story Modus, weder Hauptkampagne noch Nebenquests noch die Kampagnen der DLC's? WIESO DARF ICH DAS HAUPTSPIEL SOWIE DLC's DIE ICH !!!!GEKAUFT!!!! HABE NICHT SPIELEN? Was ist denn jetzt noch übrig? Dummes rumgelaufe und nur noch grind? Wieso spielen das Leute eigentlich noch? Wieso kaufen Leute die aktuellen DLC's obwohl sie wissen das diese ebenfalls demnächst aus dem Spiel entfernt werden und man sie danach ebenfalls nie wieder spielen kann? Wieso sind die Aktuellen DLC's dann erneut so absurd teuer wenn man sie dann nicht mal behalten darf/später erneut spielen kann? WIESO VERDAMMT NOCHMAL WIRD DIESER MIST VON AKTUELLEN SPIELERN UNTERSTÜTZT? Ich wünschte ich könnte mich zurück halten, könnte sagen das ich enttäuscht bin von Bungie. Aber nein ich bin verdammt nochmal wütend! Ich will mein Geld zurück, jeden verdammten Cent! Und das nicht weil ich darauf angewiesen bin, sondern einfach aus Prinzip. Dann macht doch nen Sch*** Destiny 3 free to Play wo es nur noch um sinnloses Rumgeballer, wiederholenden, Seelenlosen und langweiligen ''Content'' geht ABER GEBT MIR MEIN VERDAMMTES DESTINY 2 ZURÜCK DAS ICH INKL. DLC's GEKAUFT HABE! Das ist eine absolute Frechheit, so etwas habe ich noch nie erlebt in all den Jahren Gaming. Und ich verstehe einfach nicht warum andere wie EA (z.B. Battlefield, Anthem), CD Projekt Red (z.B. Cyberpunk 2077), Ubisoft (z.B. Ghost Recon Wildlands) und co so richtig auf die Nase gefallen sind weil sie dummen Entscheidungen getroffen hatten und dann abgestraft wurden mit Review Bombing, schlechter PR usw. und das hier wird einfach akzeptiert?! Es ist halt einfach so als hätte man dein Lieblingsspiel das du damals zum Vollpreis gekauft hast aus deiner Steam Bibliothek ohne Grund unwiderruflich entfernt (Bei Destiny 2 trifft Steam natürlich keine Schuld, es ist nur ein beispiel) 

Wer Destiny 2 jetzt noch spielen will, soll es machen. ABER SCHIEBT BUNGIE KEIN GELD IN DEN A**** DURCH DLC ODER COSMETICS KÄUFE! Als neuer Spieler der Destiny 2 zum ersten mal spielt wirst du das Spiel komplett anders erleben als das Destiny 2 wie es damals war. Keine Story, keine Kampagne, was geblieben ist ist ausschließlich der end game content. Du wirst also direkt zum start des spielst das höchste lvl haben und nur noch nach besserer Ausrüstung grinden mit immer wiederholenden ''missionen'' und einer hand voll extrem langweiliger raids."
7599,gud game 8/10 would grind again
7600,Fun adventuring. Good way for me to get back into FPS's
7601,don't buy forsaken
7602,good
7603,"Fun game, if you can stay connected to the servers."
7604,no
7605,its okay for a free game
7606,good game
7607,"Its fun for a few weeks, but gets repetitive doing the same daily challenges. you visit the same people each day to pick up your daily tasks and repeat. The dungeons can be fun but when you're matched with a player who nukes every enemy as they run through the dungeon, the game becomes a walking simulator. The solo story is enjoyable but really confusing. The developers delete DLC you bought later down the line. I dont think this is worth spending money on. There are games like Outriders that provide a better story and combat than Destiny 2."
7608,It's Aight.
7609,i would stop playing but i cant

7611,"I played this game for years now and the content they come out sometimes are pretty cool, but when it comes to the endgame stuff there's really not too much things to do. For new players that have never played this game before and just now starting, you have a lot of content to play and its good for several weeks, once you get familiar with everything it starts to become,'' what else can I do in this game,''. My tip is, Don't ever play alone, this game is meant to play with other people and to have fun. Hope this helps"
7612,Its a good game with friends
7613,The game is super fun but you have to grind a ton to get a small boost in power. and it has a lot of micro transactions to get a more game play out of it. but the free to play players can still do a lot in this game. the graphics are good but the ui is a bit confusing for the new or returning plays and can be a lot for them to memorize.
7614,"Its a great game for mindless grinding or multiplayer, but. The problem is the dlcs. My experience went like this; do the first mission that took 8 hours. But then i went around a bit and saw. Every 30 minutes of gameplay i saw something that needed a dlc. Did a fun mission on a beautiful planet? Too bad the whole thing is dlc except the first mission. Bungie has enough money already this is just plain greed. And the worst thing its advertised as completely free. A game where half of the stuff you see is dlc. Like bruh. 
So for that reason (unless you really like spending money for a lotta dlcs) i would not recommend it."
7615,no
7616,"After spending 1000 hours in this game at this point, i can say its alright. The new player experience can use some work but once you get the hang of mods for your armor then the game shines. My advice to new players don't try and speedrun everything that comes out with a season because you WILL get burnt out and have nothing to do because you grinded through an event that is supposed to take 3 weeks but you did it in 3 days. Also if you like to bonk things go Titan(big hammer and punches go BRRRRR) and if you are a whiny boii  go the other classes."
7617,"I played it back when it became f2p in 2019 or so and enjoyed it so i thought about giving it another chance (i had to restart because it used to be played in battle net althought i didn't mind it).

Gameplay feels the same which is good but for some reason i just can move to the sides with the mouse instead of A or D keys which feels super weird.

I am level currently level 6 (i won't play any longer) because even thought i was enjoying the game, it doesn't tracks you into a ""main campaign"", instead, it gives you many of them only to tell you after 1 mission that you need to buy X to progress further and it's confusing and discourages you to keep progressing, why would you make a menu with every single campaign to someone who knows nothing about the game instead of doing it at max level when i'm more comfortable with the interface of the game.
"
7618,i like it atm
7619,Always something to do
7620,I played only once but i think its ok.
7621,Waste of time. Grind level epic. Watching trees growing is much more fun.
7622,Its dope

7630,"I don’t know anything about Destiny 2 except that the next expansion (“Lightfall”) has something to do with squaring a circle, while the last one in the Light vs Dark saga (“The Final Shape”) will involve doubling the cube and/or trisecting the angle, but again, I don’t know anything about Destiny 2. You didn’t hear it from me. I’m just a guy who likes polygonal objects with double digit numbers that pew pew five digit numbers at health-gated polygonal objects so I can get more polygonal objects with higher double digit numbers so I can… That’s right, you guessed it! Scramble my head with geometry and alchemy and numbers… Lots and lots of numbers. Mostly with $$$ attached to them. Whatever those mean? Must be another raid symbol for VoD."
7631,"I honestly adore this game...but I can't recommend it to new players. While the story is amazing and the world is captivating, with the current seasonal model of the game going on makes it so that a majority of the content is gone after a year. This is all fine and dandy for someone who has been playing since the start, but the content for new players story wise do not have recaps. You get in when you get in and hope to catch up on the years of story through either online or looking it up on Youtube. The guns feel amazing, the inherent gameplay mechanics are satisfying, but Bungie has fallen into a loop of repeating the same modes and activities for years now only really refreshing things with major content releases like Witch Queen. So while I play the hell out of it(I cross-save so I play between many platforms.) I can't give it a thumbs-up to new people.

PvP is in a really dire spot right now due to many, many things. FTP players only have access to so little content that it might as well be a free trial and the tutorial quest is outright awful, giving new lights nothing to go off of after it. They're thrown into the deep dark skies of the unforgiving space. 

I want to recommend it, but can't."
7632,mmmm. Good soup.
7633,good
7634,keeps crashing
7635,"After taking a break few a year, I decided to step back into Destiny 2 The Witch Queen and see what Bungie had been up to. The feel and overall solid fps gameplay is still here. But lots of new content, raids, events, pvp, and just a truly fun overall game play experience. My few grips have still been the lack of a raid finder, especially since Im coming back with zero friends and or a guild which means taking myself past the gear cap to harder parts of the game become difficult. I looking for guild option would be a fantasic addition to a already solid experience."
7636,I hate Destiny 2. Its my favorite game!
7637,"Honestly one of the most addicting games. I don't have as many hours on steam as I do on console and the fact I bought this shit twice was stupid of me. It's a money grab at this point with it's constantly locking off items and quests, making you purchase the new DLC, that costs as much as a whole new game, just to play the game for this season.

Anyway, I'll see you in the crucible. We both know we are going to keep playing no matter how much we complain"
7638,"My wife left me and she took the kids
Good"
7639,"easily one of, if not the best FPS game ever. its definitely the best free one... kinda... i mean a lot of the game is f2p, but then a lot of actions you try to perform need an expansion. i mean, it doesn't just shove the expansions in ur face every now and then, u have to perform an action to do it so its not that bad. overall though, my favourite game right now."
7640,"go for it

If you're looking for an action-packed MMO that lets you and your friends jump into an ever-evolving world from anywhere, then look no further than Destiny 2. PvP, raids, and dungeons abound in this expansive MMO. There are a lot of paid DLCs in the game, but the main game itself is free.
 
Rating: 7/10. There are a few drawbacks that I can't overlook.
The question is whether or not it's worth it.
Yes, since there is no initial outlay. However, if you intend to play the game further, you'll have to pony up at least $80. Is it worth it to buy the DLCS? In my opinion, it all comes down to the individual. A new game would be a better option for a casual player, but for those who enjoy Destiny, it is worth it to spend a little extra money on extra content.
Content & Replay Value: The replay value of the story is close to zero, but the replay value of the pvp and raids is excellent. If you're a fan of the game, you can expect to spend at least 100+ hours here.
 
Pros
1.
It's a blast to watch the action unfold. The power of a gun is undeniable. There is nothing better than sniping a fellow guardian in the head with this weapon. As a result of the variety of dodges and jumps, there is a wider range of abilities between classes. While some fine-tuning is required, the gunplay is excellent as a whole.
 
2.
Descent and Raid missions are a great mix of puzzles, combat, and parkour. To complete a raid, you'll need a microphone to communicate with your teammates, but as long as you're playing with your friends, you'll have a great time. As a result, you should expect a terrible time when your team is made up of random people.
 
3.
Exotic benefits, with their one-of-a-kindness, are where destiny truly shines. Melee kills restore health for a short time. "" and ""Sliding reflects projectiles."" are examples of abilities that can be applied. In addition to making the game more fun to play again and again, these rare cards can completely change the way you play.
 
Cons
1.
Yes, it's completely free. The only catch is that you'll have to shell out cash for DLC if you want to access the game's full potential or obtain any of the game's cool or unique weapons or armor. It's possible to play this game without purchasing any add-on content, but are you okay?
 
2.
If no one you know plays Destiny 2, best of luck in the final stages of the game. In this course, you'll be constantly reminded of just how stupid random people can be. Furthermore, if you're playing destiny by yourself, it can get quite monotonous very quickly. I never start a game if no one wants to play with me. I know this is a very personal thing, but I can't play this game by myself without going crazy.
 
3.
Generally, the destiny community has a good reputation. ""Without a doubt, I've made some wonderful friends in raids and dungeons, but the illusion of a welcoming, non-toxic community quickly dissipates the moment you engage in ranked PvP of any kind. I've come across an insane number of entitled bottom faggots. People join, don't say anything during the game, and end up rage-inducing when they lose. PvP can be a lot of fun, but it's extremely unlikely to happen with a random group of players. There are, of course, some exceptions to this rule, but they're extremely uncommon.
 
4.
Vaulting content, as it is known in Destiny, is a fun feature that removes content you've paid for. This is a major source of aggravation. Using the excuse of ""maybe re-using"" content paid for by players is not an acceptable excuse and is a sure way to lose them. Several weapons and armor pieces are no longer available, as are entire planets and extensive storylines. Sadly, new players will almost certainly miss out on these missions and the coveted items because they'll never get a chance to complete them.
 
5.
This game's matchmaking is out of this world. While our teammates are getting 0–25 damage per round, every enemy has at least 3K hours in the game and hits you the second you peek. The whole process is a farce. You can't take this game seriously if you don't have other players lined up before you even start.
 
Bugs and issues
When the revive feature and the ghost melee don't work, it's easy to figure out why. When you hit someone with a melee, sometimes nothing happens, and when you revive someone, sometimes nothing happens. As a result of something that shouldn't have happened, you may lose a very intense argument, which can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and even sadness.
 
Good, but not outstanding.
Overall, PvP in Destiny 2 is satisfying and fun; the armor and weapons are unique; and the raids and dungeons are fantastic. The positive aspects of Destiny 2 outweigh the negative ones. I'd give it a 7/10 rating."

7656,"Man, what happened Bungie? You've become the very thing you sought to destroy so long ago! D2 is plagued with problems, PvP metas, extreme balance changes, and an underwhelming ""expanding"" story in the form of ""content"" updates which really is just another $60 season pass or DLC. Buy if you enjoy wasting money on microscopic ""content"" sizes that only make the game worse and barely fix any of the huge problems. Just close your eyes and look back on Bungie and the beginning of Destiny with fond warm memories...."

That shit is stupid. Change my view. lol"

The only thing that kept me playing this game until I bought the dlcs was the nostalgia from D1, so unless you really liked D1, I cannot recommend playing this game without the 30-40 dollar dlc's cause lets be honest, shadowkeep was a complete flop and a letdown, simply not worth $25."

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

7734,"Why? No seriously, why? This is the shit that annoys me that, like, streamers and other people will do, where they'll ""break the game"", that way only two people or one person, or they'll ""speedrun"" a raid, and break the game and do stuff that Bungie doesn't want you to do. Do you think you're cool because you forced your sparrow to do something to push you out of bound? Do you think you're cool because you ""oobed"" out of the map? (For those who don't know, ""oobing"" is something like a short-term for something - that shhblh you're basically breaking out of the map.) People have been doing this in Destiny for so long, people do this for other games to break out of maps and it's not cool! Just because there's been a cultivation of uh, like, community around breaking out of bounds in games to speedrun, doesn't mean it's cool. Like not everybody is Arkane and is comfortable with you just breaking their game like how Dishonored and Deathloop get spedrun. They actively patch this so you don't do it. So don't do it!"
7735,Always updating
7736,it awsome
7737,Increadible game
7738,"yes me love yes, savathussssssyyyyy yes please me want. please yes game good"
7739,great mmo if you have alot of hours to grind!
7740,"It’s like Warframe, actually pretty much the same general thing now it’s free. 

Warframe = much quicker missions but more repeats for the grind.

Destiny = much slower movement/missions. Maybe less overall grind.

Warframe has a ton of systems, some of which are literally abandoned. So more busy work. But pvp is pointlessly unbalanced.

Destiny has better pvp. 

Warframe is third person with an absolute ton of weapon variations, most of which can be viable. Both melee and guns. It has dozens of frames/powers on top of this.

Destiny is first person with a ton of weapons, most very similar. Classes are different but no way near as varied as Warframe.

Destiny 2 has great gun play. Destiny seems to have a decent story.

Look the fuck thing is free, just try it out already ffs."

7758,"greatly enjoy this game, and the original...
however, being over 300 usd into this game ""series"", and I am still having to pay more to get what I have already purchased!

do I recommend it?
no, and yes.

no, it is extremely expensive, regularly requires further funding to continue previously purchased aspects, and is miss leading with their intentions since DAY ONE!

... and yes, it is a very fun game. visuals, abilities, the gun play, all top notch.
cant comment on the community or the developers as I still have a sour taste from them both."

7775,pretty fun
7776,GOOD
7777,"A very solid, well polished game. Great amounts of content, and many hours of fun play before it feels 'grindy'"
7778,"Destiny 2 is a game that I immensely enjoy and will be continuing to play for hundreds if not thousands of more hours. That being said I felt the need to make a review for one reason. I cannot recommend this game. From Content Vaulting, where Bungie removes paid content from the game on a yearly basis, to a terrible onboard process for new players, to a lack of content in the PvP and PvPvE gamemodes, I simply cannot recommend this game.
"
7779,this game sucks
7780,"If you don't have any DLC's the game is extremely boring, don't get addicted to it if you don't want to spend good money on the DLC's"
7781,"if you can get past the scummy business model and the terrible new player experience, hidden underneath is the best looter shooter on the market. Destiny always had amazing gun-play and  now with actual build-crafting and reasons to log in week after week. If you can get 2 or more friends to sell their credit cards soul to Bungie (as MOST Lfg groups will kick you for making even 1 mistake) you are in for some fun times and shenanagins and if your ever make it to a destiny raid with some friends you will make some of your fondest gaming memories"
7782,i hate this game
7783,Great mmo with amazing gunplay
7784,"Most unbalanced pvp I've ever witnessed in any game.  The Pve is dope but if you wanna pvp and not punch your monitor, then this is not the game. Way to go Bungie.. NOT."
7785,"Decided to come back and replay,  since the campaign was a lot of fun. gone. The dlc about Cayde that i paid for? gone. this isn't a season pass, its the base game! Fuck bungie, they are never getting my money again."
7786,Game is very fun
7787,"very fun but you will get mad and then say this game sucks but then play for 1,000 hours"

7825,it good much fun
7826,its a good game but you are going to need money to enjoy it so its up to you. very much a cash grab
7827,Bungie
7828,i played this game until my hands bled and had fun all the way
7829,"Jesus christ, do i even have to begin to explain. The game starts off with the most boring missions, then you gotta grind like 80 hours to reach the actually fun activities. will never ever recommend this to somebody unless they are hopeless addicts"
7830,"Don't play this game, it does not value your time. 

You might as well call it FOMO the game. The sheer amount of time-limited content, and the ever creeping power level means that you either constantly grind, or miss out on all the seasonal activities and events. I already hate battlepass systems in other games, but this takes it to a whole new extreme. You can never get to a point where you can take a break, there's always a constant onslaught of new time limited content. I've bought some DLC which I haven't even finished the campaign for, because any time I do put into playing is spent prioritizing time limited-content. If you plan on playing endgame content, be prepared to grind every new season, because your power level will continually fall behind. It genuinely feels less like a game, and more like a job; complete with 40 hr work week.

The only reason I keep playing is because it's what my friends play. 


Although FOMO content is probably my main issue with the game, there are plenty of other issues. 

-Bungie has been slowly putting more content into the ""Content Vault."" This essentially boils down to huge swaths of content no long being playable, including the original main story campaign, and full DLCs you may have bought in the past. If you're a new player, good luck understanding anything in the story without looking up a playthrough of the past content.

-Most of the guns outside of exotics feel extremely similar, just with slight variations on fire-rate and damage. It's really more about what perks can roll on which guns, which is more of an extrinsic effect rather than the gun itself being inherently good/fun. Much of this is likely due to the focus on PVP limiting the design space even in PVE.

-Grinding for specific perks to drop on a gun can take an extremely long time, and in some cases is practically impossible (as anyone who tried to get a godrolled Multimach could attest). Bungie has recently implemented a weapon crafting system to somewhat alleviate this problem, but they only let you craft certain specific guns. The vast majority of guns are still completely left to chance whether you'll actually be able to get something good. 
To be fair, they've also implemented a system for certain vendors (Iron Banner, Trials, Gambit) that lets you pick which weapon you'd like to drop from an Engram. This helps to significantly increase the chances of getting the roll you want, but in its current implementation its far too resource intensive for anyone other than veteran players to afford.

-Most of my playtime in the game is spent using guns I don't like, either due to bounty/quest requirements forcing you to use a certain type/element of gun, or seasonal Champion mods outright forcing you to use a certain weapon type or else certain enemies are essentially unkillable.

7841,"I have been playing the Destiny franchise since the beginning of the first game and have always loved the franchise. The game absolutely has its flaws and issues, but to ignore the brilliance of Bungie would be criminal. I, personally, have never been disappointed by the direction of the overarching story line Bungie has decided to take over the years, nor their methods for introducing new plot. The game has always felt silky smooth to play mechanically, and it continues to feel satisfying and rewarding after completing activities. That being said, I would like to point out some issues that I, personally, have with the game. 

First, we have to talk about Crucible. Crucible has always had a history of being ""unplayable"" to a lot of people and, although I disagree with the obvious exaggeration to this statement, I will concede that Crucible is not for everyone, and it seems as though the circle of players that can compete and enjoy the experience seems to dwindle every season and year. Although the game is still playable technically speaking, many struggle to find a foothold against that circle of players, and have an even harder time actually beating and competing with them. And, anyone who has played crucible can tell you, crucible is a ""snowball effect"" game where forfeiting a small foothold at the start means having a rough experience for the entire game. That being said, there isn't really a whole lot Bungie can do to mitigate this situation, given that the issue just happens to be a skill gap between the ""circle at the top"" and everyone else. 

Next, I would have to say the only other issue I really have with Destiny is the fact that Bungie, in my opinion, has lost the ability and pride to really take a risk on the franchise. Now, before I continue with this point, I want to point out that this is entirely subjective, so please don't let this factor in to your decision about buying the game or whether or not you want to play. When it comes to updates and yearly releases for the game, you will see many people complain about the simplicity and lack of content for such a hefty price. Typically, I have not really had an issue paying for an expansion pack in the past, I don't feel as though Bungie is really taking the risks they once did, justifying the price each year. Each year meant a ""groundbreaking"" change to the entire system, whether it was a whole new light level system with the Taken King, or the Artifact system with Rise of Iron, or even the change at the start of Destiny 2 where players would have to use 2 kinetic weapons and one power weapon. Although the last one was widely despised, you cannot deny the ingenuity and bravery in that decision. Bungie was not afraid to make a controversial decision and adjust based on the feedback. Now, each expansion is just a raid, a story, some new exotics, and maybe a new subclass/change to existing subclasses. And, the deluxe addition of The Witch Queen cost twice as much as the Taken King expansion. I want Bungie to make changes to the game. Ones that wipe things clean. That is how to minimize the gap between the ""circle"" I was talking about with crucible and the casuals. You start over with a new system while using your previous success as a guide. I want Bungie to take risks again.

I will always love Bungie and the Destiny franchise because of what they and it have done for my life. Destiny was a safe place for me where I could always find peace when I came home. Although I do take breaks from the game from time to time, I will always recommend the game whenever anyone asks. This game and its vision is too beautiful to deny from people. And, while I do want to break my monitor from time to time (everyday), I can wholeheartedly say that the joy this game has brought to my life will always outweigh the frustration. Please download the game, and enjoy with others. That was always the best way to play the game :)"
7842,dongle dos
7843,"Very fun if you're into grindy games, but a bit hard to get into as a new player, as the starting missions and mod systems are not very intuitive. Also, if you are planning to play this game, be aware that most of the content is locked behind DLCs that are around 40$ for the non deluxe and 80$ for the deluxe, except for DLCs with removed, or sunset content, such as Forsaken and Shadowkeep. It also has very dry periods near the ends of seasons, but overall a great game and one of my favorite games to play."
7844,"bruh i have been getting on every single day since april 27th for the fricking fire power mod what did i do wrong to insult rngesus
nvm they sold it but still dont recommend"
7845,Fun Game.

7847,"Fan of the destiny franchise since Destiny 1 trailer hit. Yes Destiny 2 is free to download but if you wanna play it at a atleast decently high level you will have to invest upwards of 200€ (unless you get a deal with mulitiple DLC´s and stuff at a rediculously low price). Even if you get the season passes for the entire year they will suck out more of your money during all the events that happen during the year. If you are the slightest fan of cosmetics you will easily dump another 200€ or more into the game every year. If you aren´t a high skill player much of the content in this game is not for you.[Legendary Raids, PvP(Iron Banner, Trials of Osiris), Grandmaster Nightfall Strikes]. Even if you are above average skill level, to play the true Endgame content of Destiny 2 you need to invest upwards of 500h per season(90days) to be a high enough light level to JUST acces(and see how far you get in) this content. In short i cannot recommend to get this game unless you are or have been a Destiny player and you were going to buy it regardless of what you´ve read or will read.

P.s. The 1000h playtime i have, i accumulated in basically one season(S16). Before i played on steam i played on PS and the palytime i had there didn´t get transferred."
7848,I piss when a fart
7849,"Yeah, its pretty ight."
7850,"bad game, lost everything i love because of this game."
7851,"I've been playing Destiny since the beta of Destiny 1. I fell in love with the combat and the story right from the start and I let myself sink many many hours of fun into the original. The sequel was no different. I played mostly on the console at first and loved it from the start but fell out of love because of the lack of content at launch. However, Bungie really delivered with their post launch expansions and I found myself coming back to try most of them out. There is enough now in the game for hundreds of hours of gameplay if you want to put in that much. Even if you just want to try it a little bit you won't be disappointed.  Highly recommend Destiny to anyone that values good gunplay, customization, and originality with a bit of grind thrown in for good measure."
7852,fun
7853,boo
7854,Only ~4 hrs of free content until DLC. Disappointed in money hungry tactics like this being pushed out. After ~4 hrs of having fun with the missions until you'll get soft-locked and expected to spend $60 for the first 3 DLC. $60 and not even all the content. Destiny 1's success just wasn't enough for them.
7855,money grab. pushes expansions in your face. free bit offers at best 4 hours of content. unless you enjoy doing patrols and bountys for fun. cluttered garbage. destiny 1 is undefeated.
7856,fun mmo to play with friends if you like the fps genre as well.
7857,"I love Destiny

7858,i have been playing this game on ps4 for years just switched to pc so much better.
7859,"First off I love this game and put 1900 hours in on my old Xbox account and recently decided to get back into it when I switched to PC only to find out they completely removed the older expansions and they are unplayable now as I did previously purchase all that content to not even be able to play it anymore essentially is a blow. Very disappointing to find that out as I really enjoyed the Red War campaign and intro and felt it was a smoother transition into the game for newcomers versus the grindy intro that is now in place. Definitely would recommend this game as it's very enjoyable, especially with friends but as an old D2 veteran trying to get back into the game and starting fresh it's upsetting to not be able to enjoy the old content as well"

7871,"Barely functions, convoluted to all hell, and my girlfriend left me because i play this"
7872,"If the game studio Bungie makes you think of Halo, this is nothing like it. Destiny is most definitely an MMORPG/MMOFPS. There is a story/campaign but you can just login to fight NPC enemies in various situations e.g., PvE, team vs boss battles, etc. to level up and collect better gear.

Pros:
-Base game is free to play
-Nice looking and easy to play
-Long and interesting story/campaign from [console only] Destiny 1 to Destiny 2
---Continously added story parts and environments

Cons:
-Strange game stability issues. *At the time when I played the game, I had a fairly powerful custom built PC. More than enough RAM, high-end CPU, overclocked CPU, fast game drive.
---Would crash often during loading
---Would freeze and require a ctl+alt+dlt during several major team vs boss battles
-Unpleasant 'sunset' mechanic implemented by Bungie every once in a while, where the current roster of gear was downgraded to allow for more level grinding.
---Much hated by gamers (just check the forums) but didn't stop Bungie.
-Can get a little too big, even before the 1st 'sunset' implementation
---Tons of special weapons, gear that could only be obtained by convoluted methods (check YouTube)

Final verdict: I can't believe I and my bros wasted almost 300 hours on this. I'm glad I stopped before the 1st major 'sunset'."

Fully recommended!!!"
7878,"Apparently Bungie doesn't care about their players.  Sure, I've played for seven hours.  I'd have played a lot more if the game wouldn't keep giving me CTDs randomly.  Apparently this has been occurring with many players for months now and Bungie insists the players troubleshoot their own computers, turn off fan controls, antivirus, etc.  I've tried everything suggested and then some and now can't even get past the loading screen to play the game.  Heck, I've literally spent more than twice as many hours ""troubleshooting my computer"" than I have playing the game.  It's not worth the frustration or risking having my $1700 graphics card fry because it's running too hot because I was told to turn off my fan controllers and such.  Lots of other games.  If you can run this one without problems, have fun.  If not, don't waste your time and energy  tracking down false issues created by the makers of this game."

7900,Good.
7901,"[h1]Rating:[/h1] [b]9/10[/b]
[h1]The reason the game isn't 10/10:[/h1] [b]After grinding the game for about let's say for 50-100 hours, the game start's to lack content which can only be purchased through buying DLC's, so in short, it's a free-to-play game (a very good one indeed), but you need to pay to experience the wholeness of the game[/b]
[h1]My own feelings:[/h1] [b]I had a lot of fun playing the game for free-to-play for the first 50-70 hours, after which I decided to buy the 10€ Season Pass, which was for the most part, one of the most worth-it-buys in a while. If you manage to raise your Season Rank all the way to 100, you get many Exotic items + cool cosmetics for your armors + materials etc. Great game.[/b]

7902,Great game

7904,They got rid of Heart of the pack. bad choice.
7905,gud
7906,the best shit game ever
7907,This game is really something else ngl
7908,"I have played this game on and off.  Sometimes I am in the mood and other times I would rather play something else, but this is a game that you can enjoy playing casually, but also rewards you for putting time into it.  You can have fun solo or with friends and it honestly can be enjoyed by anyone."
7909,I hate this game because I love it (playtime is misleading I have over 300+ hours on the psn version)
7910,2000 thousand hours ish across consoles game bad
7911,"Not a game for everyone, but if it clicks with you, it REALLY clicks with you. 

Space magic go brrrrrrrr"
7912,good but cba to buy the DLC
7913,Good game :)
7914,This game has gotten better.  Its pretty fun!
7915,game good
7916,Boring ngl
7917,"They removed the old campaigns, but not only that, they actually retconned the player into not having taken part in it. When you return, you have to replay a tutorial that introduces you as a newly revived Guardian, and they mention how Cayde died in some random place that you had nothing to do with as well.  This is completely unacceptable and you should have made Destiny 3 if you wanted to save on storage space. Bring the campaign back, re-retcon the player to being who you used to be."
7918,BEST GAME OF THE YEAR
7919,fun
7920,"Buggy, buggy, buggy, expensive, expensive, expensive. Bungie, in their infinite financial ""wisdom"", finds a way to make everything some sort of premium battle pass on top of all the microtransactions. Meta weapons like Gjallahorn are locked behind $20 ""expansions"" that give one dungeon and some cosmetics. If the gunplay weren't so good, Destiny 2 would be an absolute joke. I've been chasing the high from the original Vault of Glass, and have been roundly disappointed for years and years now."
7921,:]
7922,Amazing Lore and game-play
7923,"Just like the first destiny, NO story just a back log of quests, the quests are so unfair, as you HAVE to do crucible (PVP) so im level 10 vs level 100 plus, the quests make no sense as its just small areas, with boring enemies most from the first game, it also seems you have to do the same place multiple times, im glad i got it free, i just feel there is No continuity in the story, even when i got the witch queen it is an area no guidelines, with an unkillable boss like you kill it then a few seconds later its back,its a heartless shooter NO story, same areas as the last one, NO quest guidance, NO NPC hearts they tell you go here do this do that, if you like it go a head, if you HATED the first one dont bother buying anything from this souless franchise, and one other thing they have put the dlc into parts e.g: the witch queen dlc, i bought the standard edition (by mistake) and now to continue the dlc i have to buy the deluxe edition so watch out for that."
7924,Destiny 2 continues to be the pinnacle experience for looter shooters.
7925,loot
7926,"Nice game, can't complain it's quality.
But think twice before bringing your friends, you may lose your friendship."
7927,Yeah it's good. Nothing else to say.
7928,"Would rather watch grass grow than play this game for another minute. The game was perfect from Forsaken to Opulence, then after Shadowkeep came out it was just downhill from there. It's one of those games you want nothing more than for it to be good, but somehow one way or another it just gets worse with each season. PvP requires no skill, it's literally just a bunch of fat dads sitting at the back of their spawn with pulses, scouts, and grenade launchers. God forbid you jump in a game that gives multiple jump abilities because your bullets will end up killing you before they kill the enemy, PvP in this game has literally just turned into space CS:GO. The only redeeming qualities this game has is it's raids, and story, all the other PvE content is a snoozefest. Overall this game just does everything poorly, if I wanted to play a PvE game, I'd go play Borderlands, If I wanted a PvP game (where I'm not punished for pressing my spacebar) I'd play TitanFall, if I wanted both in the same game, I'd wait for another game to come out. Uninstalling this dumpster fire of a game has to be the best decision of my life honestly, just wish I did it sooner."
7929,GREAT GAME
7930,yes sir
7931,warframe is better but this has nicer pacing
7932,fun game but need to pay a lot to play a lot

7936,Best game ever made.
7937,it's alright...
7938,Good
7939,it is gud
7940,"gave game to my cat, he liked it. 10/10"
7941,"Fun if you have the friends to join up with and the solo play is still enjoyable. Grinding for the same stuff can get old, but the game has been becoming less of a grind with every update and have a TON of weapons/armor to collect and use. Graphics are amazing and it runs very well on most PC builds. While it has one of the best music scores in modern gaming, the story is rather sub par. Has a great world. Just does a poor job of making me care about the people and the problems in that world. The core of Destiny gameplay is to loot and shoot aliens with friends while seeing who can combine the best pieces armor to look the coolest while trying to keep their sanity in a raid... But it's fun"
7942,BEST GAME EVER
7943,"This game stole my soul and i cant stop playing it
"
7944,"very fun

7945,its an amazing game
7946,I feel like this whole game is a demo and the DLCs are the real deal. Never bought a DLC but they look cool so ye.
7947,"Overall great game, been playing for years since beta of d1, so interactive and storyline got you playin forever"
7948,My favourite game that I hate with all my soul
7949,help

7951,"Despite the weird bugs the game is pretty fun and it's made by people that I think, care about you and have some empathy. Some seriously annoying bugs and an annoying Fynch. Other than that, I love the game."
7952,I hate Destiny 2. It's my favorite game.
7953,fix your servers. How does optimization in a game get worse over time? *update* Still trash
7954,I hate this game. It's god awful. 10/10 would continue to play again.
7955,good game
7956,"The game is good but it kills you everytime you play it. Its like touch of malace but just you playing the game kills a small part of you in the inside. Discord will be your friend to find people to play with and trust me you will need to play with others to get through stuff. Pretty good but grindy

7968,"Estaba bueno lo que jugué, espero tener espacio para jugarlo de nuevo xd"
7969,FUN
7970,Yeah pretty good I guess. . .
7971,"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold"
7972,after like 200+ hours it get's kinda fun (If you have Friends)
7973,"I hate this game and don't want to play it, but it's my favorite game and I love it."
7974,Fun.. until you finish the F2P part of the game and realise that its practically a demo for the payed part.
7975,Game is dope as hell for free.
7976,depression
7977,"I spent so much time on this damn game only for it to constantly kick me out of pvp and gambit matches then lock me out of the matches as if i quit the matches but it was the fucking game kicking me out every single time with Weasel, and all other sorts of bullshit animal nonsense over and over and over and over again. im tired of this shit."
7978,"this game has decreased my testosterone and has made me more feminine as a man, this is the best game in the world but be careful and dont be a pussy bitch who smokes pots and grinds redbar weapons all day"
7979,I don't play the game but feel mad when you don't shoot those aliens I guess.
7980,]'
7981,i dont play it on pc but i play on ps4 so i can confidently say that this is the most sigma game in ever
7982,glitchy

7985,Game.
7986,Dogshit game
7987,ye
7988,"See, Destiny 2 is by no means a bad game, but frankly.. I just can't get back into it. I got D2 when it first dropped and I was an avid Destiny 1 fangirl back in the day, but just seeing how just the base game content has changed has soured me."
7989,"don't crutch and you'll get better, gg"
7990,shit game
7991,"If you value your sanity whatsoever, AVOID THE CRUCIBLE."
7992,"yes
"
7993,"Let's be honest, Destiny is my most played game, because it's my favorite game.
I enjoy the grind. I enjoy the evolving metas. And it is a ""time waster"" that lets me shut my brain off and just jump into the universe.
I recognize that it is a hard game for new players to join, but if they can get into it is a fun game to play."
7994,cool
7995,"God this game is amazing, ive spent far too many hours than I ever intended and god have i hated every second of it, its eaten away my life and Id do it again in a heartbeat, best game to waste away playing, 10/10"

8003,"I truly love destiny 2 overall, i love the universe, the gameplay and the music, but sometimes i wonder what goes tru bungie design philosophy when they makes ""new"" content, if you are like me you are probably already pretty involved in the game but i wouldnt recommend the game to new players unless you are ready to grind a lot to get to the point where a lot of vetrans players are. P.D. fuck gambit , Transmat firing."
8004,rather go outside
8005,is cool
8006,good
8007,"As much as I truly hate this game at times, I don't think I've had more fun than I have with Destiny. I started playing D1 a month after it's release, so I'm not a complete veteran of the series, nor do I consider myself to be one. Over the years I grew more attached to the series as I made more and more long lasting friends because of LFG back on console. The friends I've made have been with me since we met back in 2016, When Rise of Iron was released and Destiny 1 was at it's peak. Even though I am frustrated that D2 became free to play after having to buy all the DLC's, it still has remained one of my favorite games to play. It may be rage-inducing more times than most, but it's a game that has brought me comfort over the years. I am in love with the entire series, and I strongly recommend this game on the aspect of PvE, but if you're solely looking at this game from a PvP aspect, you definitely won't enjoy it. The raids and dungeons are still satisfying to complete even years after their release. Yes, it can be quite grindy but it really isn't that necessary to spend the rest of your life grinding for one piece of gear or a god roll stat armor piece. You put in as many hours into the game, and most of the time you'll get exactly what you put into the game back in the form of exotics or even a full raid completion. It's had it's definite flaws, [i]cough cough[/i] Curse of Osiris [i]cough[/i] but it is still a great game to play if you have time to waste or if you have friends to play it with."

8024,"Sorry, you need the witch queen DLC."
8025,Good if you love games with endless grinding. Not much do play until you buy the DLC as well
8026,"I will never recommend another Bungie game after this. I got this game at release and took a break for quite a while. Come to find out they are removing content....REMOVING CONTENT!!! if you are picking this game up for the st time, don't. you start with max gear, on the newest mission, and then they jam all the expansions down your thought only to find....it will be gone in a few months.  
if we keep supporting behavior like this it will only continue. Stop these greedy corps!"
8027,i am being held against my will they have my family
8028,Way too many separate ingame purchases for content
8029,"I like the game, but I don't like the fact that they place in PVP low level players agains high level players, that is not fair and a stupid game idea, I hope they can fix it"
8030,good game
8031,"If your ready to have a toxic relationship with this game then this is it. Your endlessly grinding for a number level just to gain access to activities to get loot. This game straight up hates solo players unless you join a clan or discord community on twitch. Enough said this is mostly focus on PvE, PvP have less attention like a two sided coin being flip, yin and yang. In a word, get ready to lose tons of hair and pointless malding."
8032,Cmon man. Where is the sex !?!?
8033,"Fun for a while gets boring without DLC but with DLC there is alot to do 
"
8034,grrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnndy
8035,This game is basically like a toxic girlfriend. Except that girlfriend has the best head in the country. Do you stop dating her? No cause the head is worth it. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
8036,its fun until u get to the pvp stage
8037,good
8038,"Shoot and loot, whats not to like?"
8039,I've had to buy all the dlc moving over to pc and the deluxe edition is still bugged for me but this game somehow gets me to play it

8041,10000% RECOMMENDED
8042,I like it
8043,red guy bad
8044,"i rate this game its my go to game just hate when have to pay for new stuff every time i leave it cost me like 70.00 pounds a time a total rip off for such a small story same guns same everything ?????
i no longer change my weapons just power them up !!! only use no more than 3 exotics the rest to me are whach and i have never completed raid , dungeon, or anything why never anyone to play with or end up with a bad team that  kiks me out of game when about to win so they can give there friend my rewards.

so if you like a basic but fun shooting game this is for you cost loads of money but hey who cares its all about gaming right ????"

8081,painfully exciting and can be addicting
8082,This game is a genuine addiction
8083,ITS BETTER THAN I REMEMBER.
8084,"its fun
"
8085,"I was not an FPS player. I am a puzzle/relax/sandbox kind of gamer. My better half, however, had no friends to play the Forsaken expansion with. I told him that if he bought the game for me, I would learn how to play it so we could do missions together and he could enjoy some of the game's multiplayer functions.

Nearly four years later and I have been taken completely captive by this fantastic game. I am a semi-casual player, though will tend to grind a bit more when events are around. I have purchased the various passes for the seasons, and pre-ordered most of the expansions for those various goodies.

Positives: Excellent storyline, immersive world, most standard PvE experiences make sense and are handle-able by new and old players alike. Fun emotes, new content regularly introduced, a multiltude of ways to tweak your gear to make it match how you play the game.

Negatives: Very steep learning curve for new players - it is difficult to maximize your potential without a guide to tell you which things you need to look for. There are a -lot- of things you can play with. With some of the new content, if you haven't been around since the beginning, you may miss some very fun jokes/story/information.

But hey, you can try it for free?"
8086,"It's a fun game, but it's a shame you have to buy rest the campaign."
8087,love playing the game
8088,"its free so its always worth your money
one of the best free steam games out there"
8089,"Not really a game that suits me, but if you do not feel sorry for your personal time and are willing to spend a few hundred hours of personal life on, admittedly, a pretty good MMORPG (sort of) - welcome."
8090,good game

I havent been able to concentrate like this since the middle of the pandemic and that was with apex. this game has me hooked, it is currently almost 3am and all i can think about is playing it tomorrow, good night. 

play this game at your own risk..."
8104,Best game ever made. Not a single thing could improve it. There are zero issues/bugs. It is literally the perfect game.
8105,Perfect game for cute anime girls!

8114,I've played this game since launch on my PS4 and all I can say is I hate this game. I hate it so much that I'd rather eat a rather large box of crayons while being immortal. This is my favorite game!
8115,"If your looking for a game with lots of progression to be made then this it it!! Wide variaty of Quests, challenges, storymode, PvP and more..."
8116,"Guilty pleasure. I've been playing since D1 on XBOX and made the switch to PC. For some reason, I keep coming back. I consistently have a good time while playing. D2 keeps on improving and getting better."

8118,"Don't have a sex mechanic, bad game"
8119,"Free to play player except for the forsaken campaign which was gifted to me. Despite some things being locked behind a pay wall, I have a lot of fun with this game and highly recommend it."
8120,pain in the ass to install this game when it was done i couldnt even play cus it kept saying there was problems with the install after it took about 2 days cut in half to install.
8121,very good game great community with loong lasting friendships
8122,Game good
8123,waste of time
8124,yep
8125,monkey brain like loot
8126,"I won't lie... the game is fun.  It is not new player friendly though.  Plenty of things are gated for F2P, but the big issue is the mod system.  All the cool builds you see on YouTube you cannot do as new player.  All of those builds are reliant on armor modifications that new players do not have.  The only way to acquire them is an RNG rotation on a single vendor.  If you miss a day and the mod you needed was sold, it could be months before it comes back up in the rotation."
8127,"I'm in way too deep. This game has taken everything from me and given me nothing in return.
Absolutely a pleasure to play."
8128,"It's the best game I've ever hated to my very core. I cant stop playing, it's like cocaine in video game form. Don't play this game if you have addictive tendencies and have money. This game will take both your money and your mental health. Easiest recommend of my life."
8129,"I find Destiny to be a great game for both people who want to spend they're time grinding for end game rewards and for people who just go on every now and then. Story is fantastic, every exotic (for the most part) has its own uniqueness and flavor and though some of the Destiny community can be very toxic and rude, most of the community is very nice and its fun to lfg with randoms in end game content and interact with new people. Buying every DLC can be a bit costly, but it's still a great game that id highly recommend to give a try."
8130,Destiny 2
8131,tricky but fun
8132,Me love game
8133,"Longtime Destiny2 Player.  Was on PS4, now on a Corsair Vengeance i7300.  Love the new PC, the game is much different on it now.  Even though I'm terrible at the game, I enjoy it tremendously and recommend to everyone."
8134,"Good game, bit confusing now for new players. Not a fan of PvP and some stuff is locked behind it. Gets a bit Repetitive near the end of the seasons. When you reach pinnacle grinds it becomes a chore. But it goes alright."

8142,"Don't buy DLCs it will eat a hole in your wallet. Gonna make me pay for the season pass then gonna make me pay for the activities that link with the season pass. $17 for 2 dungeons after paying $8 for season pass and $30 for DLC. Payed for the game when it came out and over half of my purchases have been wiped from existence, people say its to make room for more content but I don't want more content that is behind a paywall if I've already payed for something. The only reason I will play this game is because I have spent a stupid amount of money into it already"

8157,"I never thought I would ever play any type of multi-player game but I decided to take a chance, and am very glad I did.  There's more than enough content for solo play and the stuff you do with other players--Gambit, Vanguard Strikes, Dungeons, etc.--is actually a lot of fun...but I do avoid PvP like the plague."

8165,"Fun game play but...

Content keeps getting ""Sunset"" (Removed) even if its been payed for. no way to play the single player mode without connecting to a server. I have played this game since day 1 (on Battle.net) and half of the content that I payed for and enjoyed has been removed with no way to play it. unless you continue to pay Bungie £80+ every 6 months the game keeps getting smaller and smaller until your experience on an account that has over £300 worth of DLC and 1000+ hours is no different that a free to play account started 5 minutes ago.

Cant even launch the game due to the files not matching even after verifying the files through steam"
8166,w game
8167,I m Sad about this game was expecting to play a game that had good story and fun quest i played both games to long break from it and want to start the story over so i was hyped to play it only to find out all the content that i had bough was gone and replaced so something i payed for is now gone and cant be played then they scrubbed the game to a point its both Destiny 1 and 2 combined but not in good way the quest line are broken you cant follow some even though its on your map i am very disappointed and sad that this game has been trashed for a pay to play form and they dont even have a story anymore probably wont buy any of the DLCs and if they put out Destiny 3 wont be following the story on what sad day for Bungie and Destiny franchise
8168,"its destiny 2, what else should i say?"
8169,its boring
8170,"I decided to get back to Destiny 2 after a 3 year break. And they really just deleted all the content i loved and i payed for??? I liked the period of the warmind dlc but now we just can't play anything of those events, stories or even visit the planets anymore. I still love the game a lot but it feels empty and dead with removal of so many worlds... I hope we can see some more content coming soon because this is just sad! Like other games keep content from even 10 years old but Bugie just said, yeeeeet! What a joke lol.

8204,"man. where do i start with this review. i was a day one destiny 1 player. i have over 2100 hrs on it, that game was such a great game. so many memories. before switching to pc i had roughly 1800 hrs on d2 for xbox. when i switched to pc i was happy to hear d2 was going f2p. i held out until it did. i didnt have ppl to play with on pc so i solo'd what i could and was matchmaking the rest. i have over 500 hrs on pc now. since crossplay i havent played an insane amount, havent gotten the newest dlc but plan to do so. i streamed it a bit over on twitch where i plan to do so again. it runs real nicely through obs. i 100% recommend this game only IF you have the bodies to to the content. otherwise doing the end game content is tough.  8/10. if you've read this far much love! have a blessed day!"
8205,"They made the game Free to play and then remove every single campaign that was free to play so now, you can stare at the store for free, if you wanna buy something, great! <3"

8211,"Very original and brilliant game, make me wonder how did I played cs so long"
8212,"Kinda upset with this ngl :c
As a old Destiny 1 launch Vet Destiny 2 is not at all what I imagined it would be, When your starting from scratch after a year long break due to confusion in the first place the game is confusing, I was thrown into mission prior to just launching the game which I had no idea what  was even happening nore who the Villains were or what was going on. I had to  abort both the missions due to not knowing the controls. Since I played Destiny One on PS4 an am finally able to play it on pc ! (was very excited for this) HOWEVER even after sitting for a hot minute an looking over etc took me a bit to get used to however the missions were still strange to me especially to  be forced into them without say, Even when I first started Destiny 2 almost a year or so now It was still confusing the quests were hard to figure out where I was supposed to go, Destiny 1 made it more of a ""priority"" to make it a point to  show ""hey you go to the moon, kill thrall that come out of the doorway, then you enter an kill some other guys after scanning an artifact"" was very easy going especially for a starter player, now Destiny 2 im struggling a bit with there are too many things going on an the story of the game doesnt wait for new players which is annoying when your returning an have no idea where to go or how to jump back into the game, been looking at cosmetics past 30 mins and all the stuff thats on the tower trying to figure out what to do. the quests dont even show as story quests or the main quest-line unless im completely missing something. In the long run the moral of this review is that as a returnee and technically a new player on Destiny 2 (since rusty af new to pc an restarted due to not knowing what i was doing) I find this game confusing at a frustrating level at that I still recommend didnt play Destiny 1 for all those years for nothing however, I do not like the way this game is at the time for players who are starting out or etc, even some friends have agreed that starting up again is tricky an confusing, think it need tweaking but we shall see the game is already way past fixes so unsure how that would play out."
8213,"LONG REVIEW:
I have around 3000 hours on the PS4 version of this game. I first played Destiny at a friends house around the 'Taken King' era and was immediately intrigued by its world and atmosphere. On Christmas day 2017 I received the sequel, and have played it on and off ever since.

At first the game has a great sense of wonder and adventure, exploring the various locations (all of which are notably well realised and detailed) and learning about the world and characters is great fun. The design of the patrol zone maps is somewhat segmented, with distinct transitional and open spaces, with a lot of area being left unfortunately unused and somewhat empty, although still very well detailed.
For me it took quite some time before I had even somewhat wrapped my head around the series' overall plot and setting, although that likely had more to do with the old campaign's vague and frankly poor storytelling than anything else. I am unsure what the new campaign is like, however I am aware that it is now different.
However at a certain point the game feels like it has few mysteries left to uncover, which is sadly unavoidable due to the nature of such a medium.

The gameplay itself is compelling and ever evolving, the pace of the game speeds up and slows down variably with each balance patch, as well as the constantly shifting build meta. There are always items and tactics which are strong, and others which are weak. However the individual items in the spotlight themselves change drastically season to season, which keeps both the pvp and pve content fresh. 
Although this strength can also double as the series' most crippling weakness; the advantage of these ever changing gameplay eras is that it keeps the game interesting, and that if you do not like the current state of the game, you can simply wait until it is different enough to interest you again. But this also means that the reverse is true. If you are particularly fond of a certain pvp balancing era or raid dps meta, you must bear in mind that its days are numbered before Bungie decides to artificially interfere, and your beloved weapon will be inevitably dethroned, cast down like Icarus.
The overall gameplay feel as of late is in my opinion making some steps forward, and others backward, leaning more heavily into the mmo buildcrafting type aspects of gameplay rather than the shooter elements which I enjoy the most, but that is just my opinion.

The game's graphics and art design are mostly fantastic, as well as the music and sound design, however the aesthetic is inconsistent at best, and incoherent at worst. There exists, within the game's aesthetic sensibilities and themes, some great dichotomies; futuristic vs ancient, scientific vs paracausal, simplistic vs complex. However there is also an internal conflict within the game's stylistic approach which is not intended or clever, but instead rather jarring. That is; the contrast between the serious and silly aspects of the game, the developer team can never seem to make their mind up, and the two cannot properly co-exist.
It is simply too much of an ask to request that I suspend my disbelief and immerse myself in a raid when my allies have chosen to don bright pink armour and other such ridiculousness. Or when the hub zone 'The Tower' is decorated in some gaudy and unfitting manner. This is a shame to me, seeing as how the problem is so easily avoidable, without even losing money; just make the cosmetic purchases and seasonal events fit in line with the game's aesthetic, for god's sake! (Which in this case should not be as hard as it sounds, as this game features every style known to man in one way or another) 

This point moves on nicely to the matter of the game's monetisation. The game is free to play, and the content which is free of charge (not a comprehensive list) is as follows: almost all PvP modes (the most important and replayable), all year one strikes, mucking around in patrol zones, public events, exotic quests, and one raid. This set of content serves as a good free trial, and was a suspiciously generous decision from Bungie at the time of release (I will get back to this later) but if you intend to get invested into the various proprietary campaigns, play high level pve, or simply have fun with all the different DLC exotics then you will need to pay. My personal opinion on the value of the currently available dlc content is as follows: Forsaken > Beyond Light > Witch Queen > Shadowkeep > Current Season > Cosmetics (take this with a grain of salt, and get whichever you want, if anything)

However the free to play model of profit brought some unhealthy and downright predatory practices from Bungie, (not that they'd ever been saints in this regard) the cosmetic items for example are ridiculously priced, and the currency to get them for free is grindy to aquire. The entire game is grindy, in fact. If you are at all interested in playing high level pve content or even some pvp modes like 'trials' or 'iron banner' then expect to invest a lot of time, energy, and money into the game. This is the main reason that I stopped playing high level content; the constant pursuit of an ever increasing 'light level' on your gear means that you can never make permanent progress. As the next content release will once again raise the 'power cap', forcing you to make your way from the previous pinnacle to the new pinnacle, although this treadmill style of player investment nonsense is to be expected from all mmo type games.
Also worth note is that when I transferred my account from ps4 over to steam, they made me re-purchase the dlc content which I had already paid for years prior (and it wasn't cheap either) so for that I am still a bit miffed >:/

In short, the game is overall a positive experience. Gameplay and audio / visuals are both very polished, and there's no real reason not to try it out seeing as how it's free. If you like it, then you could consider buying some of the dlc. Destiny is fun and bunger pls buff hunters."
8214,i also wouldnt but thats just how destiny is. Its my favorite worst game thats really fun and good but also bad
8215,If Halo and WoW had a baby it would be Destiny. plays like Halo but with super powers while being surrounded with other players and being able to join and invite people to join you in activities is wonderful.
8216,game is good but to meany cheaters
8217,hehe
8218,its my destiny to play this
8219,get ready to become no life.
8220,"It's the standard for an entire genre of games.

Real talk though, its very hard to get into this if you are completely new to the franchise since sunsetting happened. So much story and context is just gone so you're left confused as hell. If you dont mind watching lore vids on youtube then you should be fine. If you can manage to get into it you have a game with fantastic end game progression/replayability, fantastic raids, and a pretty unique PvP if thats your thing."
8221,"Solid game. Very much content, can be almost overwhelming for new player, but anyone who likes this genre, its a good thing. So much to dip into and learn. Gameplay is smooth and satisfying."
8222,我非常讨厌这个游戏它的狗屎
8223,"To be honest, if you like to play the same missions over and over again, week after week, then this game is for you. My friend, Juan, plays this game for hours on hours a day. I have seen him go from a emotionally stable 19 year old, to a clinically depressed teenager with the spirit of a 43 year old man that has recently found out that he has been cheated on by his wife of 20 years with a young black man packing an 8 inch c*ck. I do not understand why he keeps doing this to himself; however, I have hope that one day he will realize this game is detrimental to his well being. So, if you want to lose your wife to an 8 inch c*ck, be like Juan and download Destiny 2 and begin your sorry journey to depression. But if you don't want to be like Juan, and lose your wife, instead get the free-to-play game, League of Legends and become the 8 inch c*ck, like me. (:"

8239,yes
8240,w game
8241,What happened to my content?
8242,"Regarding the game:
1) The music and sound design for this game is amazing. Motifs repeated in different tracks, foreshadowing encounters, telling a story of Light and Dark, each one trying to one-up each other for the universe, it adds to the experience in waking up in a world where you can't be killed in a way that matters.

2) The story and lore can be overwhelming if you're a new player (if you're like me and joined in after listening to friends go on about Destiny and it's characters and story). There are things that aren't explained due to content being removed and vaulted (a shame really), but you can access these out of game via the anthologies or archives. The incoming story for the current content is really good, dealing with trauma, the mistakes of one's past, the consequences of one's action- the various themes on what's good, bad, morality, the drama that one expects of a novella, the humor, the dark tones, there's so much to read up on, to enjoy. 

3) Weapons and armor design is just perfect. No need to pay for armor ornaments, eventually you'll collect enough armor to make an outfit yours. The weapons from their sound to handling, are my favorite of other games I've bought. They're unique shapes (though there are some reskins), sounds and weight, and reload animations, are memorable that i find myself sometimes recognizing the weapons my friends and others use out in the world. With weapon crafting, one can personalize their own weapon to fit their playstyle.

4) I play on controller (hand issues and all that), and sometimes play on mouse n keyboard. You will play differently depending on what you're using. There is a gap between the two with regards to PvP, controller players are slower to turn more shotgun usage and Last Word usage, mouse and keyboard players play at distances, precision hits from snipers and hand cannon are easier. Aim assist for controller will pull your sight down towards the body or towards enemies that are closer to you and you will have to fight it to hit your target. Mouse and keyboard allow more precision. I would suggest adjusting Look Sensitivity for both to fit your playstyle.

5) Price-wise: Season stuff is affordable and can be completed after the season's end (season pass stuff cannot be claimed however). Expansions go on sale when major Steam sales happen. Silver bundles are affordable and the ornaments are cosmetic (no pay to win system), and emotes and other cosmetics can be easily purchased with farmable in-game currency. I do dislike they've added upgraded cards to free events that give you access to cosmetics that could originally be farmed for in the free event (for much less work nonetheless). They're also charging separately for new dungeons which used to be included with the expansions. 

6) There is a grind. There is so much stuff to grind. Rolls, stats on your weapons, the gear you want, the bounties. If you're not someone who can stand doing the same activity over and over and over again, I would steer clear. If you are? Godspeed.

Overall? It's fun. Though I would say it's better with friends."

8251,Super fun!
8252,I blinked and now I have 1100 hours in the game. 11/10 would recommend.
8253,why should I continue to play the game when the devs have made it very clear they will straight up delete anything you pay for after a couple years have passed.  absolute nonsense.

The main gameplay loop is really boring and repetitive too, which mostly consisted of just running around the huge maps with the occasional shooting.

There's always something new to explore and experience! The story of this game is rich and wonderful, with intricate backstories and whole characters. Hell, that's not even exclusive to the campaigns! each one was well scripted and well executed, though you can't play most of them now, sadly, even though they still sell Forsaken. but here's the thing, if you're gonna play the game, you're gonna need the DLC, even with it's outrageous price tag.
all in all, great game, better with friends, and I don't regret even one of my 316 hours."

8290,"The game is good but it has a lot of recycled content / overpriced DLC expansions and season pass cannot be redeemed in other methods if you did not play enough. 

----------------
Negatives of this game first:

So if you paid for the deluxe edition (Like I did multiple times) all your rewards are gone in the season pass if you did not play enough. 

If you pay for the DLC, there is also a chance the Developers will erase the content of the DLC so you cannot access or play the activity anymore. It feels like Subscription based DLC.

I spent $600+ in DLC for this game since the beginning of Destiny 2 on Console and re-bought the DLC on PC and I am locked out of Nightfall PVE rewards. Some other activities I paid for - multiple times in the past I cannot access currently today. 

Can we get a season playlist that don't lock us out?

For a game that is open world and a lot of content you can explore - it still is charging for season pass and DLC content every couple months. 

Free to play players, you cannot get the best/top weapons for PVP and your subclass along with stasis is locked behind DLC you must buy. Unless you are dropping all your games or investing all your money into this game, you still will have to be behind a lot of community events to wait out rewards, and locked out DLC or season pass that are not obtainable at this time anytime soon for certain weapons.

You will have to rely on legendary drops / RNG to have certain Exotics outgun/outplay you in PVP. Meaning, you have to completely outplay the current player/be better than them.

The PVP scene is a money grab of streamers charging $20-60 per run for Trails of Osiris etc. a playlist activity to go flawless for gear rewards you cant get otherwise without grinding the playlist - which is also locked behind DLC.

Could of spent $600 on probably 30-300+ games

Destiny has a semi-toxic community, but it is nowhere near as bad as other games I played (Like Tera Online MMO, probably the most Toxic MMO I played) - That is because Destiny now considers themselves an MMO couple years ago.

------------
Now onto the Positives of this game:

Despite there is a huge chunk of this game gone now, and they removed the Story/Planets/Environments/Activities/DLC content you paid before in the past. 

The story is decent, for the time it is and the game play is excellent. 
Now since it is an MMO I feel the story is half the time rushed.

The voice actors, sound effects and much more are top notch. 

The graphics are average, what you'd expect in an FPS in a triple AAA format these days. 

The music is very generic, repetitive and heavily looped. (I know what your producers are using for the music) 
But it is mixed very well, so it is decent

there is also an Exotic Vendor for weapons - but it is locked behind DLC more than 50% of them every weekend he is out.

There was time the Exotic Vendor Xur wasn't locked behind DLC - and I miss those days when I had the option of what I wanted to invest into.

Destiny had a lot of potential at the start, now it is a game with heavy micro-transactions everywhere. 

These guys are worse than Activision - Everyone talks how bad Activision is. How they ruined Destiny 1 - but I honestly think Activision saved this game, and it is why Destiny 1 was so great over Destiny 2. Destiny 1 has none of the flaws I describe in Destiny 2. 

Despite we all know Destiny 1 was the better experience we had with this game. Destiny 2 is an excellent addition despite the heavy flaws that come with it. 

Expect to have your Wallet run dry if you invest too far into this game. I been with Destiny 1/2 since the start."
8291,"Destiny 1 was my favorite game, then I played this game at launch and it threw a couple hundred hours at it on console but it was so bad that I left the series for 5 years. Almost all the problems I had with the game at launch are fixed now. Destiny is my favorite game again. Do not play it if you value a social life or work/home balance or friends or free time; it's a little too fun."
8292,goog
8293,"Reinstalled 3x, ran as admin, verified content 3x, hardwired internet. Continually kicked with error codes. Idk what else to do. Now the 2 friends I got into it ask me to play daily.  Im pretty mad at this experience.

9-5-22, tried again. Coincidentally the day it asked me to review my previous submission was the day it started kicking me again. At least this time I didnt sink money in. Worked for a week."

8308,great fun game woohhaaaa
8309,fun
8310,game good
8311,"I know on here it says I only have roughly 14 hours on this game, but on my PS4 I have about 96 hours of this game played, so I have about 110 hours of play time. In my 110 hours, I have never once dropped the game because of disappointment or dislike in something in the game. However, I have dropped the game because of boredom. There are only so many free things you can do before the game gets repetitive and tiring. There are a few bugs that don't allow you to progress with certain quests as well, such as there being no landing points on Europa, making it so that you can't start the armor synthesis quest. I really think Bungie should invest in making a rolling campaign system, as I saw in a Forbes article, where all campaigns become free when a new one releases. Bungie has done something similar in the past, where they make the previous campaign free for 3 months right before the new one releases, but with a rolling campaign system, I feel like they could bring a lot more engagement back into the game and have it continue to be fun and exciting. If not this, then I think they should think about making the campaigns maybe $20 instead of $40 at launch, as it's much cheaper and would more than likely increase the player count as well. 

Overall, it's a pretty fun game. If you like pvp, you have the crucible and gambit. If you're more of an open world pve type of person, they have a total of 11 planets that have been in the game, currently only 8 of them being in there and the other 3 vaulted. The game looks amazing, even on my mid spec pc. The gameplay isn't boring until you've completed everything there is to offer and you have to go spend anywhere between $20 and $40 on a new campaign (if you want to buy all and dont go for and bundles or deluxes, it'll cost around $140) that'll only get you about 6 more hours of game time. PVP is pretty fun, not very toxic in my opinion unlike other games. Also a really great game to play with your friend. 

The only major downside to D2 is that the content vault is extremely disproportionate. When the New Light expansion came out, they vaulted more content than they put out, so it left the game feeling pretty empty and boring. They have yet to release anything other than the Witch Queen expansion to add more to the game, and even then, the expansion was quite boring in my opinion. 

On a scale I'd probably give it a 8.7/10. If they could fix the content vaulting and either lower the cost of expansions or introduce the rolling campaign system, this game would easily be a 100/10."

pros: 
amazing dlcs 
fun combat
great multiplayer
takes time 
you always have more things to prepare for e.g new seasons every now and then and more and more dlcs
great community and welcoming
cons:
costs alot to actually get far into the game
takes alot of ur time up (also a pro)
mostly adults playing the game which is good and bad (im only 15 so kinda hard to fit in to the community)"
8315,They really need to fix this game. There are too many damn cheaters in the game.
8316,A good game! Can't wait for the new xpac.
8317,good
8318,"I put hundreds of hours back when this game was on the Blizzard launcher, and returning to this game I have no clue what the hell is going on.

8324,I love playing Titan and  bullying my friends
8325,"Meh. It's grindy. Costly. And if you have a family or don't have friends - you won't get everything you want out of it. I've had for Xbox since it came out, and I've gotten to the point where I'd like to feel like I had completed something rather than having to fly to 10 destinations in 1 hour just to get one part of a 50 step quest done for a weapon that will be sunseted in a few months."
8326,good
8327,great game if you have couple of friends to play with boring alone
8328,they take away content to the add it again in smaller amounts and if this game isnt the only game you play you wont have fun and i hope you like grinding because thats the game and if you dont have friends enjoy trash players through LFG and doing the same strike/nighfall/raid over and over again just for the gun or gear to be worthless in 3 months due to new gear or nerfs and crucible thats a yikes same with trials bad game overall
8329,Yes
8330,fun
8331,Very good once you spent a bit of money on DLCs.
8332,Don't do it. Don't play it. I'm saving you from pain and heartbreak. Do not click download.
8333,what a cool game the graphics are soo good
8334,I've stopped playing because I can't keep up with the grinding and repetitive gameplay. The graphics and game mechanics are wonderful but having to grind constantly just to rank up is a nightmare for anyone that can not spend hours and days devoted only to this game. I wish you all luck.
8335,best shooting game ever
8336,very addictive and theres plenty to do
8337,If you like a game that feels like a game packaged inside of a game that is game then look no further than game. Best Destiny-like game within a destined game universe surrounded by the player's destiny to find their destiny. I can recommend for those destined to play it and looking for a shooter.

8345,"It's a fun game overall, it has a wide variety of action and storyline. This could be a very grindy type of game, but yet it could still be enjoyable. The lore in this game is never ending and rich, it combines action and story together very well. A downside to this game is that it gets boring once you play it for a long time, its game you would main after you get used to playign this game. I'd recomend this game but you should play this game with your friends. 9/10/"
8346,you buy the dlc on one console but it doesnt travel between platforms is really trash

8351,I force myself to play this.
8352,"Alright so, the game is great, but if your not willing to spend a good probably 6 hours and then be locked behind a decently large pay wall. I do not think this game is for you. How ever if you are willing to spend the money which is around 150-200 dollars for every dlc. This game is probably for you!"
8353,"I haven't played this much yet but have friends who have been playing for a while, some several years. There is a great story line and so far the game play is solid."
8354,"Pros - Free
Cons - Can't transfer DLC content from other platforms.
Have to purchase it again through steam to play it.

8355,"i more hours on console
funni space game in space with space stuff such as space ships and space guns all in space"
8356,you can kill your friends!!!!
8357,This is a great game regardless of if you pay or if you keep it free to play. I started free and moved on paying for the season pass since I was enjoying it so much. I'm more then happy to pay for this game as its given me many hours of enjoyment. Just warning to those that get addicted to games it can happen quickly.
8358,"When this game is good, it's reaaaaalllly good. Full stop one of the best shooters ever made"

8367,"guns are fun, general gameplay loop is serviceable but not great, mostly a great experience with friends."
8368,The video game industries' biggest finesse. In no way is it free to play.
8369,"Bought it back when you had to pay for it on the blizz/activision client, then transferred to steam (hence the low play time). An endless reach into your pocket for minimal content. They deleted the goddamn story from the game and it took away some of the most important character development out of the game. Cayde-6 and what his conclusion was? GONE. 

The gun-play is amazing, but they try to make everyone a pay pig for every expansion. This isn't the bungie you knew when the xbox 360 was in full swing. They lived long enough to become the villain. Try to play it without spending money and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about."
8370,l
8371,"I have around 5000 hours in this game and played pretty much every aspect of it, save for a few. All in all, Destiny 2 is an exceptional game. Despite most players complaining about certain issues, it is still the game we know and love. Would recommend to anyone looking for fun times and some grinding."
8372,Pretty good
8373,time wasting and fun
8374,"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon."

8376,They fixed an issue where players enjoy the game
8377,asw
8378,If you're a new player I would avoid this game entirely. If you're not willing to spend money every month on a DLC and spend the initial $150 for the current content then don't waste your time.
8379,It is one of the games I have ever played
8380,"Good game if you have money to spend on expansions and time to grind out. Very time consuming but can be fun with friends, crucible is full of grease balls who have no lives :). Wide variety of pve content is you buy expansion passes and season passes (expansions tend to cost about £30 and season passes tend to cost about £8). Overall it is a fun game though and i would recommend giving it a try."
8381,"It's a fun game, but I hate how every year they take away content, making it impossible to know what is happening. And before they take away that content they make it free, ripping off the people who spent money to get it. I don't suggest playing this game unless you wait for the content to be free,"
8382,shaxx is hot.

If you want to melt your brain, I highly recommend it."
8395,"Absolutely not, they give absolutely no care in the world to their PC players, it has been YEARS since people have been reporting frame issues and they just consistently update the game with shitty ass content that no one cares about rather than actually FIX their damn game."

8401,:(
8402,Sucks your life away 0/10 dont play this
8403,"good game, be careful how long u spend on this game though"
8404,"New player experience is TRASH!

The game 100% fails to explain you the fundamentals, thats not forgiveable considering how long this game has existed, and how some newbie mistakes can set you back months in progress. 

They do have a somewhat helpful discord server where you can ask questions and get help, but the typical help is a link to a 98 page google docs that looks like learning material for an university test, OR a 4 and half hour tutorial video. Learning the basics is a full time job.

The DLC system also sucks ass, a new player wont even know what hes buying and i hope anyone reading this review wont even consider buying them through steam as they are way overpriced for what you get.
Find a deal on some 3rd party site and you can get all of them for less than 40 euros which is an acceptable price. 

You think you can play and have fun without the dlc's? LOL 
If you want to play for free, prepare to run into a wall (paywall) whenever you want a weapon or content to run with that weapon. Sure some smartass could argue that there are some things to do for free, but realistically you would waste your time and not have fun while with the dlc's you might have fun while wasting your time.

However, if you really want to play the game as its meant to be played, you will have to quit your job and grow a neckbeard in order to grind. The weeklies really feel like a forced chore, not doing them is not really an option if you want progress, but they are really dull and repetitive for the most part.

Overall the game is essentially cock&ball torture until you get used to it which you probably never will if you start now on year 5, but it looks beautiful, has some cool stories, good potential for co-op given that you have friends to play with, and ofcourse you can deplete your dopamine gland with all the pay to win instant gratification bs and the never ending minmax grind once youre there. 

If you consider playing the game for its PVP, dont. Its scuffed, unbalanced, and the aim assist / bullet magnetism is so strong that you will get headshotted by some kid who cant even hold a mouse let alone aim. There is really a trivial amount of skill involved in it, PVP in destiny 2 is all about who has the meta gear and who hasnt.

Im disappointed at the whole experience, but i started playing this game knowing that im walking into a dumpsterfire, out of pure desperation for something new to do since other games are in such a bad state, if i had any other game to play with friends, i would rather do that instead of this."
8405,just try  it!
8406,yes
8407,good
8408,"I only play this game for a week, already bought the Legacy Collection (which includes 3 DLC's: Forsaken, Beyond Light and Shadowkeep) and I already played D2 for 45 hours. I think that already shows how much I love playing this game. It goes really far, with storyline, weapons, armor,... It's awesome to see a game develop so much, with so much to do."

8415,"Great game, do not ever play Trials of Osiris.

Trials is a very difficult pvp activity if you are paired with the wrong people. If you constantly play this game mode with the wrong group, this will lead to suicidal tendencies.

8416,its a little slow in the beginning but if you put forth some effort and time you'll hate being outside and touching grass the same way all of the destiny vets do (D1 was the Vietnam of the destiny community
8417,"expensive, addicting, A LOT LIKE CRACK, dont play it, its bad and youll like it"
8418,"I love this game and think it can be insanely fun, especially with friends. But In my honest opinion. This game has some serious problems with the end game difficulty. I'm not talking about mechanics in raids. I'm talking about just the enemies themselves. Things like Master nightfalls or higher, have enemies with almost indestructible barriers unless you use a matching element on them. Quite alot like borderlands. This wouldn't normally be a problem except for how builds normally function in this game. As of right now Bungie is wanting players to use matching elements for their subclass. If your using a void Subclass, your going to want to use a void weapon especially for the volatile rounds buff, that only functions on void weapons. This creates a problem for when enemies don't have void shields. Your going to be helpless to fight against a knight with an arc shield unless you waste your grenades, heavy ammo, or super. Sure you could just equip a weapon with a matching element for that strike. But then that ruins your build 90% of the time. Another big problem with the enemies are the ""Champions"" that have the exact same issue. Forcing you to use unfun weapons or just something that doesn't meld well with your build to stun them. This also causes you to completely waste mod slots on your gauntlets. You can either dump everything you have into them to kill them. Or just bring a weapon to stun them and practically kill them instantly, but now your stuck with a random weapon doing literally nothing but stunning a champion. I Find this issue very infuriating to deal with. If bungie want's players to use a build they made themselves with this whole build crafting thing. Then do not make enemies that completely destroy half the builds a player could even think of. There's no build crafting when your forced to use specific weapons and mods to play the game."

8440,It has had its ups and downs over the years. But the gunplay is varied as the weapons. THERE ARE TONS! The armors are also varied and shaders (while not the perfect system) help you armor feel even more unique. The lore is deep. There are so many activities! (Which at times CAN feel overwhelming.) But most of the time you can just pick something and have at it! And at the heart of it all: being an awesome space magic wielder is just fun!!

8443,"Fun little game. Lot of content. The F2P content is a little bit confusing since it refer to storyline that are out of the game currently. The gunplay mechanic is very nice. If you buy any of the expensions when they are on sale you will have your money worth. At full price it is still nice, but they have sales every seasons or so."

8446,i hate this game highly recommend
8447,At this point the game is just sunk cost fallacy for me. The grinds have become more obtuse over the course of the game with rng on top of rng. Inventory management is a nightmare with how many deep sight weapons you need to get crafting schematics. I've been playing for a long time so most of this is fine because I have decent gear and knowledge of good places to grind. I however would never recommend this game to a new player and everyone I've gotten into the game during beyond light no longer plays because of how much more tedious the game has become. It's not just just a simple rng grind fest it's multiple stacked on top of each other. Deepsight was a mistake
8448,2
8449,it'll make you hate it but you'll keep playing anyway because you actually love it even though you hate it

Underrated, 100%!!!"
8453,"You don't play free, you get a pretty solid demo. Once you get past that, this is a buggy, crazy broken mess with an amazing world, lore characters, gunplay and progression that will hook you. Definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but if you like destiny, you LOVE it"

I remember I pre-ordered D2 on PS4 for a little more than $100 thinking I will be settled but now you get that and even more for free.. or kinda not.. cause well yeah the story and all that have been deleted from the game and now there is even more stuff to pay for, I just checked and to get everything you will have to pay aroun $375.. I REALLY hope (if they make) D3 that they wont money milk/grab it so much and make the game great again. D1 I started playing just before Rise of Iron dlc and I loved the game but D2 is just a big meh..

Dont give them more money.. they have enough.. play the F2P version."

The new player experience became crap when they sunsetted game content. They tried to make it better but it's still far from not being crap.
bungie has become more and more of a damned snowflake company and it shows in their decisions made to the game. If this keeps up, I'm sure Sony is going to regret their acquisition of bungie."

might feel a little to repetitive to play same missions, but it's worth it."
8475,yes
8476,guns
8477,"yes

8478,Fun fun go brrrrrrrrrr
8479,"Game is mid
I only recommend if you have no life"

8481,great game
8482,"depression,"
8483,pretty fun to play i did get bored though
8484,It gud
8485,"If I had any other options, I'd be playing that."
8486,fun game good graphics i recommend
8487,i love this game
8488,its fun dude
8489,its one of the best first person mmorpg game i have found. If you are looking for a game like this you should really try it.
8490,Very gud
8491,"Worst best time you'll ever have (if you have friends). Solo players beware, not really a solo friendly game, but can be if you're willing to find the stuff to do. If you can't buy all the DLC (or at least most of them) then I would give it a try but don't expect more than about 8 hours of PVE game play. All that being said, some of the best gunplay on the market, and a dev studio that (mostly) listens to the players makes this one of the best FPS games out today. Play at your own risk."
8492,"Step 1. Grind Game
Step 2. ?
Step 3. Dopamine Release"
8493,"Ah destiny, one of those franchises you blow hundreds of dollars on and thousands of hours (2500 on pc alone). I used to absolutely love this game but over the years i've grown out of the loop, constant hunting for the exact same rolls on reskins takes any well-meant replayability away. 

The story and music, visuals and gunplay are among the best in the industry, but a real lack of achievement once you've played for a while keep this game from being #1. I can say that anyone completing a raid or minmaxing stats loved doing it for the first couple times, but then what? 

Ill recommend Destiny to anyone who wants to hate and love a game simultaneously, but I think my time with the game is over, Ill go join Taeko-3 now. Lost to the darkness of life"
8494,"Game is really good, and keeps getting better and better."
8495,Free to play and addictive.. Open world game.. Guns are amazing
8496,very fun would recommend :)
8497,"played it as long as i can remember and though the paywalls get annoying its super fun
"
8498,i hate this dogshit game fuck this game dont play it
8499,good

8501,"Destiny 2, despite its rough launch, is an incredibly fun shooter with hundreds upon hundreds of hours of content to enjoy, a fun endgame of stunning raids with intricate boss fights, piles of satisfying to shoot weapons, a great soundtrack, and enjoyable ongoing plot, and good looking visuals. In short, I love it.

It's also a game I have an extremely hard time recommending to anyone who's not already sold on it.

Don't get me wrong, the ""not recommended"" on this review is not to say that the game is bad or not worth playing, even though many online will tell you otherwise. Destiny 2 has definitely been worth the money I've put into it, it's one of my most played games ever. The problem is that the entry fee is unusually high for honestly any video game. Sure you can download the game and futz around in it for free, but if we're going to be honest here, that's just a demo of the full game. If you wan the full experience, you'll want to get the deluxe edition of the newest expansion and all the old expansions, which commands well over 150 dollars. That's an eye watering price, and it's a hard sell regardless of how good the game is. To make matters worse, content does get cycled out of the game periodically in order to keep the game stable and below a certain maximum file size. This is because Destiny 2 was developed when Bungie was still owned by Activision, and was more than likely intended to be replaced by Destiny 3 in two or three years after launch, however, after Bungie left Activision, they decided to stick with Destiny 2 rather than scrap everything and start over, but this has the side effect of Destiny 2 at its ground level not being designed to be supported for such a long time and have so much content stacked on top of it. It's unfortunate that this is how the game works, but that's how it is, and I don't blame people for being turned off by it since content they paid money for gets removed from the game later on down the road, especially when that content is so expensive.

Again, I really enjoy this game, and can easily see myself continuing to play it for years, but this pricing issue makes it a hard sell to new players. If you can stomach the price, you're in for a good time, but if not, that's totally understandable."
8502,"my favorite game and easily the best user interface i've ever used
"
8503,"Best game to sink hours away into.
"
8504,peanut butter
8505,quite possibly the least fun i have ever had in a video game
8506,great game
8507,qa
8508,"The game doesn't have the greatest story,unless you read the lore, but if you like looter shooters this is the best one IMO"
8509,the game is good until you play destiny2
8510,Yes i would.
8511,lots of content
8512,"[list]
[*] Bad MM
[*] Even worse balancing for PVP that they don't respond to
[*] Terrible community that actively threatens the devs whenever they don't get what they want
[*] Boring PVE content that really needs a revamp or at least something to keep it fresh and feeling fun.
[/list]
And yet I still come back for more after playing for 7/8 years with over 4k hours combined across D1 and D2 on multiple platforms... What is wrong with me?"
8513,"a bit unfriendly to new players, very overwhelming, its good to have a guide but overall its a really good game."
8514,"loved when our ghost said ""this really was our destiny 2"""
8515,This game has it's ups and downs but overall a fantastic game
8516,Woooo Destiny
8517,dear god
8518,"It's, awful, unbalanced, and the devs have no idea what direction to take the game. yet i can't stop playing."
8519,Its good.
8520,yes
8521,I enjoy the various story-lines that can be pursued.  I like various scenarios in which one can play alone or with friends.  I like the goal of game piece acquisitions; and path procedures needed to improve and progress with a character.  My kind of game. Thanks!
8522,"its a good game try it
"
8523,I hate it.
8524,I hate this game
8525,"This game is fun, it involves a lot of farming but very fun!"
8526,Its really fun and addicting I player for 2 hours but it felt like ten seconds
8527,a
8528,
8529,I'm not great at FPS games because I'm out of practice (since days of Doom/Quake).  This is a fun game and I'm glad to be able to get back into the genre.
8530,i have played destiny since day one and i have never been so involved in any game. the story line is nice and catches you off gaurd some times. i have made many friends in the destiny community and i feel like my clan is family. there is something for everyone from pvp to pve  even the lore seekers and the completionists.. solo activities that you can also complete with teammates if you choose. the base game is free but the expansion will cost you a few bucks. some times you can catch a DEAL.
8531,"Most toxic and braindead community i've ever interacted with

Wonderful"
8532,got banned for hacking when i was lobbied up with a hacker did not know he/she was a hacker came back to login and account was banned been a whole year created a new account just recently.
8533,Very nice (recomended to play with friends)
8534,I have tried doing cross save on all platforms and the game still won't let me in. Microsoft account validation is busted and I have already cross saved on three other platforms. Optional cross save next game at launch of game please. :(
8535,ye
8536,I recommend this game because it's getting better. There is a huge new world to explore. Who doesn't like killing aliens?
8537,very fun after 11 hours of playing i have pretty good loot and i am decent and playing
8538,"very good game, dlc is very good too

"
8539,"Great game, great support over the yerars."
8540,good game
8541,Please release me from this hold
8542,fun but exhausting
8543,Pretty good game. Like halo but in MMO format.
8544,it is a very good game i would rate it 10 out of 10
8545,"I had around 1,000 hours on Battle.Net before they moved this game to Steam.

It's too bad the gameplay for this game is good because Bungie sucks at running a live game. Removing a bunch of content because ""tHe InStALL SiZe iS ToO BiG"" and then bringing that content back via drip feed to sell you a season pass is pure scum."
8546,"Very confusing to new players,
""Storyline"" is basically nonextistent,
Immediately encountered a major bug to which the solution was reinstalling (this 90gb game nty),
from what I heard from friends the DLC policy is a greedy money grab,

Didnt play much but imo the concept is fine, the execution terrible.

"
8547,This game made me realize my bad financial decisions
8548,"This game sucks, I love it. Sure the grinding and the constant horde modes and the disconnection between the community and the devs sucks, but the gameplay is solid enough to withstand even the worst of time periods. Try the game if you want, but know that you will have to buy the expansions and the season passes to be able to enjoy all this game has to offer."
8549,This games ight
8550,trash game
8551,"halo but it steals ur money
"
8552,"Very complex and sofisticated, 3 months in and no bugs so far. Not to graphically demanding. To complex for me to explain, and really no other game like it :)"
8553,"currently, the game is in A very dry state, next season will have a new(old) raid release, but the game is not enjoyable for me anymore. great game for the first few hundred hours, then it gets stale once you have done everything. IK the game is supposed to be grindy, but the grind just isnt fun like some other games"
8554,funni game still miss Cayde tho
8555,"Nice game
"
8556,stinky game
8557,its destiny
8558,"once you enter, you can't leave. Bungie has you by the wallet. seriously tho. if you want to have really any part in metas and even fun. you are pretty much forced to pay for dlcs and season passes."
8559,it very good. yes.
8560,"Destimy were great. It was my favourite game for years. But when thy started power-capping the weapons i had used hours to get, i lost all interest. I've come back many times to see if i like the new system, but its just not for me."
8561,Love it
8562,Don't waste your time or money on this game.  I played it just a little while and got a {Turtle} error code which is basically a LOCKOUT.  The game starts to load and then when you attempt to play it locks you out.
8563,"This is an incredibly boring game with a incredibly boring story line. Gameplay is nice though but that's it, character customization is terrible as well and 20-50 dollars for more story?? Just go play Warframe, everything's free."
8564,ok
8565,Amazing game
8566,fun fun
8567,"I hate this game, please do not play it :)"
8568,"very nice. even tho the game is pay to win, you still have a good chance at having fun"
8569,amazing game
8570,no
8571,"Best co-op game with friends, i don't have any friends.

Played Destiny over 3.5k hours.

Anyway 10/10"
8572,"This is one of the best i ever played, which make me play again and again."
8573,"If you ever want to see your family again, don't play this game"
8574,"point and wreck pvp is the only thing keeping this alive anymore

yes i like pvp even if its always run by meta classes"
8575,IT GUD.
8576,"very fun game, but if you want your sanity and to lose your virginity stay away from pvp"
8577,"game NOT good
bad FUCK YOU BUNGIE BITCH ASS STUPID IDIOT"
8578,fun game
8579,fun but im kinda gonna say its a veeeeeeeeryyyyyyyyy grindy game and it needs alot of time to keep your power high and get the stuff you most likely want and yes there is a charm in that i love i feel it can be repetitive
8580,"I hate Destiny 2, its my Favorite Game."
8581,The best MMO i've ever played in my life. Avoid at all costs
8582,Narddawg approved.
8583,"This game took everything from me, and I no longer am able to tell what grass feels like. All for a gun I have 500 of but with a slightly different stat roll. Please send help."
8584,Very fun and content rich game now. Caters to lots of different play styles.
8585,"I haven't played too much, but It's fun so far. I totally haven't sunk years of my life into this franchise."
8586,I like playing with other people and the open world.
8587,gud
8588,love it so much to do and explore
8589,It's my favorite way to waste away :)
8590,Space magic.

Would recommend if you have A LOT of free time."

8593,This a very re-playable game and never gets boring!
8594,"If you're reading this, you know what this game is about. Just spend the money my guy"
8595,THIS GAME IS DOG SHIT HAS MORE BUGS IN THE GAME THAN IT HAS RECYCLED HALF THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PIECE OF SHIT GAME.
8596,ergaevrearv
8597,cool
8598,I can always go back to this game
8599,"Este juego se ha vuelto parte de mi vida, literal. He creado amistades a traves de toda la historia desde el D1, muchas experiencias y aventuras. Es un juego muy bien balanceado, con una excelente historia y con seasons con mucho contenido. Es el mejor momento para volverse un guardian"
8600,"Destiny is an excellent game if you're willing to spend an exorbitant amount of money on the DLC. While there is plenty to do without it, the gameplay becomes stale after some time. The expansions are what make the game shine. If you are looking to get into Destiny, I would suggest waiting until the expansions are on sale."
8601,bleugh
8602,"Its fine
"
8603,Nice graphics and easy to learn to play.
8604,killing myself
8605,Good

8608,"If you like a gaming company that sues it's own player base, and is part of the #Woke crowd then this is the game for you!"
8609,"This game is amazing I am definitely not lying
"
8610,guns... I guess.
8611,Came back to the game after being away for years. Game play is just as fun as I remember and there is a lot of content to play.
8612,MID
8613,game good
8614,"THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER!!! PLAYED 
I LOVE THIS GAME"
8615,Played through a few seasons and p good. Lost all my old stuff but got new stuff. Now punching aliens in face as a crayon eater. Can't go wrong.
8616,Fun game for almost any type of players
8617,Very Nice suprise
8618,.
8619,it stole 1600 hours of my life.
8620,"The game is not for me but I would recommend it to someone else if they were looking for suggestions for free games to play.
I will keep playing this game so I might change my review in the future."
8621,"Just fun all around, especially with friends."
8622,"Destiny 2 really is a great game. There are so many good things about this game that are unique to the game, and honestly has been the game that has kept me occupied for days on end. As such, I tried to get my friends to play this game too. But they all backed out soon, and I honestly don't blame them"
8623,Good game n fun!
8624,"Still a good game. If you are a die-hard destiny fan this game still has all the good stuff. Beautiful art styles, Crucible, events, and even raids if you can gather enough comrades. Gathering enough comrades and finding a good reason to play this game is probably what decides this game for most people. I love the feeling of nostalgia i get when playing destiny. That's part of what keeps me playing this game. Lots of happy memories with the franchise. Thank you for everything"
8625,pls don't do this to yourself. there's still time to run away... it's too late for us... save... your...self.....
8626,"I love this game!  Some of the best movement and designs in a video game.  With the storytelling improved upon since vanilla Destiny you really have a good overall experience in the game as far as what you would like to do.  Unless you just want things for free, then you will probably run into some walls."
8627,i like it
8628,"This is a very fun game. I got it back in September '21, and took to it like a fish to water. The scenery is gorgeous, the mechanics are sound (although there are those who only care about 'loot', and will always find something to complain about), and is a fun way to relax.
Bosses vary in difficulty, but none are impossible, and there always seems to be people ready to go for an adhoc group."
8629,"goood
"
8630,fun
8631,fun
8632,its fun
8633,"Destiny 2 is best if you have friends to play a few sessions with. It caters to grinders and casuals alike and offers endgame activities that don't feel mandatory. You can play a few rounds per week or stay longer and farm an item on an activity, its not lacking in this aspect when it comes to simple entertainment. Solo, you will tend to miss out on raids and some activities but you won't feel pressured to deal with it.

But the cracks do show, most games have this issue really of content drought. Bungie does its best to mediate this with seasonal passes and activities, which can burn out a player if they focus too hard on it. Content Vaulting also sort of destroys the narrative you got from doing the oldest free expansions. It could be true that Destiny might have ended up being a 200 GB installation if we're being silly, but I'm sure they could have made it optional. You'll still deal with an 89 GB setup I think, so its still pretty hefty.

Honestly I would recommend it, wait for a steam sale and you probably won't regret seeing your money vanish. However if you are a free player, there are sadly more better options to use time."
8634,destiny 2 big cool
8635,i hate this game :(
8636,mid game
8637,"this is a looter shooter and im not much of a lore enthusiast, so just the running around and defeating enemies to get better loot is what i do. that said it is really hard to get your power level high and the grind is real. 9/10 imo"
8638,"this is the destiny 2
"
8639,F2P is a 7/10 and paying 10$ for seasonal content is not bad overall it's good
8640,Very addicting.
8641,good
8642,"look, ima be real, the first 1 or 2 weeks you're with this game is going to be great, but it's all downhill from there. especially if you buy the dlc. mark my words."
8643,"-Best FPS story game out there, endless expanse of lore and missions.
-Crucible PvP is not flushed out even years later
-Lacks endgame content"
8644,u get ot kill aleins
8645,"have been play a few years now.



help"
8646,its somthin to do
8647,is ok
8648,"Ok I have to say this game used to be good when I bought its expansion before launch of the Beyond light. Currently I have to say that I'm really tired of instant nerfs to anythings that Bungie launches even the stuff you pay for will get nerfed :). so basically each season they make something good and nerf previous guns to force people to buy new expansion and your previous expansion will become useless :). If you want to play PvP you can enjoy playing with cheaters in 3 matches out of 5 matches and the Battleeye seams to be doing nothing and if you complain about PvP their gonna be people that'll tell you get good, I mean sure use toxic built or an adept Trails weapon and stack your fireteam to 6 people and play with ordinary people and you're gonna say it's a lot of fun. What my point is, this game is coming to its end and I'm glad I've no interest in buying the next expansion. Their were a lot of other things to mention but anyway RIP Destiny 2."
8649,lai ji  you xi
8650,i played this game and got sad
8651,Amazing but very grindy
8652,"Lot of yes, lot of no. No matter what its not Destiny 1 or Halo."
8653,I haven't played played this since the year it launched and recently got back into it. When I first saw that everything I spent hours grinding to get was now base level I was somewhat disappointed. However I just put in a bit of effort to build my character back up and actually have been enjoying it a lot. I recently picked up a few of the expansions during the recent sale as well which has added a lot of extra content to jump into. Overall this is a fun game 3 years later and I'm glad I got back into it.
8654,Fantastic game and fantastic story line. A lot of content in this game and you can do a lot of stuff in here.
8655,"Are you the kind of gamer who likes to be emotionally abused by a game that is always ""almost perfect"", well have I got the game for you!"
8656,"an fps game with cool space magic, best game but in the worst hands SMH"
8657,"PvE is fun and there's a lot if you get the expansion packs but it is getting long in the tooth. The raids can be fun and as is typical with an rpg it gets very grindy. Do yourself a favor and AVOID PvP. If it isn't horrible latency(check your tcp connections in resource mon, even with an open NAT) there are numerous cheats and aimbots. It's an exercise in futility, there are far better options for good PvP."
8658,"good
"
8659,make me wanna poop
8660,"If you're looking for a PVP game, my advice is to look elsewhere. Destiny is good for its PVE content, can't say enough about its story mode, but it can only stay entertaining for so long before this game feels like a boring slog of a pointless grind. Can't quite put my finger on it but PVP element just seems a bit inconsistent and lacking compared to other competitive PVP games. The free stuff is alright but if you really want to do anything you have to pay for the season passes which honestly is not worth it. I would say if you are content with the free stuff and dont care about the story, then by all means this is a great game."
8661,Destiny 2 consistently and regularly disappoints me while also keeping me so addicted I can never truly leave. It's like an abusive relationship I can never get out of.
8662,"One of the Best Games I played so far.
It has a kick-ass story and unique take on the gaming. I love how community based this game is. Although there is a lot of content that only unlocks when you pay but still I believe its worth the price."
8663,Please help me I haven't touched grass in a while
8664,"beautiful scene and music
I don't understand the story but it is ok. nobody cares that

just be sure to pay for all the dlc so that you can spend rest of life farming guns
go play halo if you are poor"
8665,Get it. It is good.
8666,GDYFD
8667,"horrible terrible game.
still love it."
8668,Been playing Destiny in general since the beta of D1.  The saga continues with D2.  Overall great game.
8669,cool
8670,yes
8671,"theres no big booty latina b1tch3s but otherwise pretty good game
"
8672,"I love Destiny 2 in spite of Bungie's need to rip out old content and try to leech every penny they can out of players. I can't recommend it for new players though. So much of the story has been ripped out, including arguably one of it's best expansions, Forsaken, that I can't imagine it would be easy to get into the story anymore. A lot of the events that setup characters are gone, Saint 14 is just some guy now, gone are the stories of his being brought back to life, or his developing relationship with a race of aliens he only saw as monsters and so on and he's only one example. It's such a shame but unless they start to bring back old content in some form I'd say it's probably a ship that's already sailed for new players :("
8673,Can’t sex savathun

The one things I am sad about are the 6-man activities because I don't always have enough friends to get on with and do them with! So many things to do within this game, developers are always creating new content!"

8693,"This game is very tough to get into for new players and I wouldn't have played through the first 30 hours if my friends didn't play already. The game is only really fun as you start to get to a high enough level and build up a big collection of weapons.

Even now after playing for a year, I mostly play as a social thing with my friends. It just isn't a fun game to play alone, and although I enjoy it I can't recommend to new players knowing how much of a slog it is getting to the good bit."

8695,Great game if you have the time for it
8696,i cant stop it.
8697,yes
8698,"I have a horrible, sadomasochistic relationship with destiny, and it's been going on for about seven years. I find this game fun, I will play it until it goes offline someday, but no, I don't recommend it."

8700,cayde dies from a cheap shot after consentually going to prison
8701,I love how not alot of games give you this much freedom but this is one of the few games that does and you can also go back into some of your most liked maps
8702,New to D2 and I understand this game is still active and they add new content but why has there been two maintenance server updates in two days at two different times? Couldn't have you fixed it today at yesterdays time?
8703,yeah it's pretty good
8704,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son ever. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
8705,Epic game
8706,"This game is so much fun to play with or angst in game, along with having higher ranked people coming and helping you with missions that your having a hard time on."
8707,I bought physical Destiny lore books so yeah I probably have an issue.
8708,I would recommend this game
8709,GG zerei em 2 horas o jogo dps o game mandou eu compra uma dlc de 89 reais obg
8710,f
8711,Got back into it a little more than 2 weeks ago and already have 120 hours on it
8712,.
8713,"I hate this game so much, highly recommended"
8714,"Im allergic to grass so i play destiny.
Jokes aside great game, great graphics, great story (even the vanilla D2 story that you cant experience anymore), great gameplay, seasons can get bit stale after few weeks. Would highly recommend<3"
8715,i kill so many bosses and level up so much that my wife and family now treat me like an outcast and dont speak with me. i poop in a bucket now because i have gained so much weight from not moving from my gaming chair. destiny 2 has taken everything from me and i am done. i am going to leave my destiny clan and end it all. Warlock out!
8716,shit game
8717,plz add sex
8718,Like this game but I only play with friends who know what is what and can tell me what to do. If not the game is too confusing for me.
8719,i hate this game
8720,shoot
8721,YUP
8722,i forgot what grass looks like
8723,Its fucking Lit. Halo with mad colors and loot. Get a fireteam going and hit some DMX on Discord and its a wrap.
8724,i live on this game xd
8725,its a decent game
8726,"As you can see by my hours, I've played the game a bit. However, I would never recommend this game. 

- Consistently has the same gameplay loop problems
- Is a buggy mess in some shape way and form at all times (Yes some of these bugs can be very fun/cut down grinding time, however they are still bugs and I would say that typically its 1:1 on bad to good bugs)
- Half of its early released exotic guns and armor are power crept out of relevancy and the developers aren't known for going back and making old, borderline useless things relevant (tho they are improving)
- Barrier to entry for new players is wack asf. Learning this game is a chore.
- Artificial Difficulty. The hardest content is the hardest not bc of mechanical and skill based barrier but bc enemies have big hp and deal unga bunga damage. 
- Repetition. If I had a dollar for every time I've done a boring asf basic ass playlist activity bc I needed to for pinnacle/higher level drops or bc its apart of the dumb event ""challenges"", I would have been able to outbid Sony in buying Bungie. These activities aren't fun in the slightest. If they got removed tomorrow I'd blow the devs.
- No In Game LFG system. Seriously? It's 2022, you got Sony money, and this is a social game. 
- The HUD/UI is so basic for a very complex game. A plus of this game is build making. You're gonna need at least 3 or 4 third party websites to just make sure the build making process doesn't take 9 years.

However,
- Gunplay is fun. Cool weapons combined with fun movement and builds is fun.
- Build crafting is fun. Becoming a God is neat.
- I've heard great things from lore heads. Don't really care personally but I'm being objective.

All in all again, I would never recommend this game to someone completely new.
I'd say prerequisites to liking this game and wanting to play it are you gotta like mmo fps games, you have to be willing to put the effort to learn the game, and you have to like flashing numbers and colors.
You have to be able to turn your brain off for the remedial shit and turn it back on for the higher level content. 
If everything said applies to you then be warned, you WILL sink in 30 hours in a week multiple times.
If you want to get to that high level content I suggest you tell your SO that they're gonna have to pleasure themselves, tell your job to give you less hours, and/or go on a diet of red bull and carbs.
I never thought when I was a kid and picked up this hobby that it would be physically exhausting but here we are.

Can't wait for Lightfall! :)"
8727,pp
8728,its pretty good
8729,When sex upadate
8730,terrible game do not play 0/10 recommend absolutely garbage
8731,Very good. I recommend it if you like looter-shooters or RPG mixed with First-Person gun action.
8732,"Item 9, Gas"
8733,"scuffed company, scuffed meta, scuffed game"
8734," crucible makes me want to pull my hairs out 
9/10 from what i remembered when i wasnt bored 
2/10 when the game made me play crucible for good drops"
8735,cant sex
8736,Will ruin your whole life haha
8737,Bro it's just like Tarkov
8738,this game is the worst game to have ever existed and i hope it gets taken off of every platform forever so that everyone that plays it can have a happier life without this garbage depressing game.
8739,Controls are undescribeable because they are so great. plus its fun once you learn to use it correctly. I would recommend it to sci fi halo and fps fans.
8740,If you have the money - Destiny is a better Halo.
8741,EXTREMELY SURPRISED AT PERFORMANCE! I have a GTX 1070 (non Ti) and i am very happy and surprised to find that the game gets 90 FPS in 1440p with settings at high. Very well made game and lost of stuff to do before even spending a penny :)
8742,Destiny 2
8743,"Very entertaining, with many options of play. Loads of Expansion game-play and rewards"

8751,"Good game,but WOW is better"
8752,"imagine removing 80% of the content and charge 40$.. good job for supporting this joke of a game and joke of a company

THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR PLAYERBASE

Cross progression is a joke, you need to rebuy previous owned DLC even though you have the content done on your account

Removing a campaign for new players...

dont bother with this product"
8753,"very good, rage easy tho"
8754,"very good grinding game, recommend if you like grinding and WoW"
8755,"when ever i launch it, it freezes right away"
8756,nie wiem jeszcze nie grałem
8757,tyfrtyrdty
8758,"came back to the game after the disappointing release of destiny 2 back in the day, I'm very surprised with the changes, the gameplay is fairly amusing, the game doesn't guide a new player where to go to play the story, it just throws you in there and lets you figure out where to go and what to do which is very annoying. The long loading screens still seem like an issue to me. Overall, Good game."
8759,"good game for pc
"
8760,pog game
8761,Bad game but it's a decent time with friends.
8762,"The game is fun as long you dedicate time into it. It's very grindy, which I like about a lot."
8763,"Great game, constantly upgrading, balancing, and listening to the community (just because they don't implement, doesn't mean they're not listening).  PVP is great, PVE is great.  Love it.  1660 hours at the time of posting."
8764,"Maybe one of the best games that I have ever played, the weapons are very cool and well done, the raids and the various game modes are very beautiful (although there are few modes), unfortunately the game remains a pay to win and if you don't buy the dlc there is nothing to do, however if it s played in company and with the dlc it is definitely worth trying"
8765,good
8766,"as a free to play player, i can assure that it is still fun without buying campaigns or tiers"
8767,idk y just like it its a very good game
8768,This is my least favorite game
8769,is good
8770,i shooty and stabby the dark gods in space
8771,"She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o’er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!"
8772,"Great core game play mechanics. Shoot stuff, looks good, rinse, repeat. Can't comlpain."
8773,Pay to     win   game
8774,It is a video game that you play
8775,"Having put 1500 hours into D1, i quickly fell off from D2 becaue it just wasnt the same. With recent expansions, i feel like this game has made a comeback, it reminds me a lot of the things i loved about the first game."
8776,shit game
8777,
8778,"Ive been playing this game on xbox and PC for years now, and i have to say, i do like the game. I do have a few things I don't like but have learned to live with. the first one being the removal of the campaign, since i loved it so much, i hated to see it go. The other thing i recommend is skill based matchmaking, that way you are fighting people closer to your skill level and not getting dominated every 3 matches."
8779,420
8780,Very fun game with many memorable team play moments.
8781,can be fun if yo niggas playin w you
8782,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
8783,"Destiny was literally my childhood, I played the first one for hours on hours. Played this game for hours and hours also but this one never shined like the first one, probably my nostalgia being ignorant because its not what I expected. But honestly if you have an extra 60$, you ain't getting good content. but what can you expect from a free game."
8784,I hate it
8785,"It's kind of hard to write a review on a game that is so extensive and that's been going on for 7 years; but I'll try my best :)

Destiny is a shooter looter, & Bungie hasn't referred to it as an ""MMO"" for whatever reason but instead use the term ""shared-world shooter,"" which is fine except that's literally the baseline & bare minimum of the game. You start off by picking between 3 classes and they just kind of throw you in after that. It's not very beginner friendly unfortunately and gives you all this info in such a short time; Bungie has also ""sunsetted"" like half of the story meaning that it's not longer accessible so if you wanted to know what's going on, good luck! There is SO much to learn but to be honest there's not really a learning curve imo. It's fairly straight forward - shoot & loot; the only problem that I personally had was trying to learn what different abilities did to what kind of enemy, what to use & not to use in high stakes missions, how armor mods or just armor in general can give you certain builds that are perfect for you. 

(I'm going to be honest I've been playing since D1 and only recently learned how all this affects you so maybe I'm a special case; that goes for raids too. I didn't do my first raid until VoG was brought to D2 LMAO)

Anyways, sure some of it is free (but I don't know what part exactly) so I would give it a chance and see how it goes; but just a reminder that a lot of it IS locked behind a paywall so you won't be getting the full experience BUT I really think everyone should try Destiny just for fun; it can be a solo game or a game you can play with friends however your going to have a much better time playing with others so keep that in mind if your more of a solo player. 

-6/10 unbiased because I know this isn't for everyone and its centered more so around having people to play with/HAVING to play with others in certain aspects/missions, and because of the slight learning curve for the technical stuff.

9/10 - biased because I love the story telling, everything about it and how complex it is but still makes perfect sense; the weapons are crazy fun to and I have met some really cool and friendly people through this game. It's a lot to take in but if your here just for the shooting & looting than personally I think is perfect"
8786,Great game!
8787,","
8788,"It has a lot of paywalls for most of its actual content, and on top of that its buggy and crashes a lot so its not worth the money to get past those pay walls. its a game ruined by a money hungry company if you ask me. I only play it because my boyfriend does and i just want to spend some time with him doing something he loves."
8789,it's aight
8790,"never thought i would play it tbh, but a buddy convinced me to give it a try and its got me yk like it caught me with its trap card and after 80 hours i feel like can yah worth a try its f2p to an extent but its fun"
8791,💩
8792,it good
8793,"Not the same game, bought content only to have it taken away from me. I do not recommend."
8794,Play the game or I'll cook your dog.

8796,good game
8797,It's okey
8798,good game
8799,"If you dont play this game, you are missing out"
8800,"I hate Destiny 2. It's my favourite game!

The onboarding for new players is rough, and the game can be baffling at times, but there's honestly nothing else like it. If you want to give it a shot, you definitely should. Just remember to use DIM and complain about every choice the devs make and you'll fit in in no time!"
8801,"Fun game even when ftp its a time sucker if you are new and have nothing to your name
"
8802,"DO NOT play this game solo, you need at least 1 or 2 friends who also have bought the same DLC that you have. It's a money sink, and the content that you get from it is VERY lackluster. Whole game is basically doing the same 5 things over and over again for 100 hrs. I've also had multiple times where an enemy that you have to kill will be stuck in the floor with no way to damage it, so you have to exit the mission and restart. Very cool game, Bungie big brain."
8803,Bungie has sold its soul to Sony that's why it is lacking hard
8804,An FPS with defining game-play mechanics with an in depth story and constant content updates that keep diving further into Bungie's decade long universe.
8805,sdfghjkl
8806,what happened?
8807,"Love to grind the game,"
8808,"Tons of content to explore, been playing Destiny since Day 1 back in 2014.  The game has come a long way and is generally a lot of fun and is in it's best state in a long time.  Yes there are issues, but there's very few other games out there that play as well or look as well.  Jump in and enjoy, ignore the hate and contribute to the community with lots of positivity!"
8809,hell nah
8810,Good balanced game.
8811,"good
"
8812,"this game's something between Halo and Borderlands and WoW
such a great game
"
8813,shit g zmre
8814,"its a cool Game, but yes :("
8815,I have been playing Destiny since September 2014. It is not perfect but it is a fun game to pick up whenever you want. I can only advice you to join a community and make friends. This game can be played solo but meeting new friends and best the hardes quests is very rewarding.
8816,It's really fun but i've reached a point where i have to pay to continue the story so when you want to play this game make sure you can afford to move on if you enjoy this game. Well good luck guardian
8817,its ok i guess

"
8821,Very gud :D
8822,Would not recommend
8823,DO NOT start playing this game. I've been trapped in the mental prison of Destiny for 6 years.
8824,amazing game. lots to do. never ending fun with pvp and pve events. thank you bungie for this amazing game.
8825,"its a cool game
"
8826,I have not played that much and I hope to play more. Cayde is my favorite character so far I hope he lives forever!!!!!
8827,the worst game i've ever played but i can't stop playing
8828,silly game
8829,I'm wasting my life and I don't intend to stop.
8830,worst game ive ever played. i love it
8831,"most addictive grindy game out there...cant stop playing need help 
"
8832,"pros: sparkly sounds and flashy lights give me dopamine

cons: time loses meaning, because this game does not value your time. Expansions and DLC only add value half of the time. The story is so sprawling that its impossible to keep straight. no character is sacred. there are no servers. 

conclusion: addictive and schrewdly designed."
8833,"Its destiny Love/Hate relationship 
"
8834,"Do you want to watch your life wilt away, if so play destiny 2
in all honesty though i played D1 all the way back in elementary/middle school and its just a bunch of nostalgia so im hella biased. fun game nonetheless, but pay to win, and way too many expansions"
8835,yas
8836,
8837,gud game
8838,"Great game, honestly, not a fan of buying DLCs, but this game is an exception

Firstly, it's pretty impressive this game doesn't have a monthly payment like most RPGs

Either way, for a free game you can do ALOT"
8839,For your own mental and physical health dont do it.
8840, mid game
8841,hate this game
8842,my physics teacher would be disappointed with the horrible physics in this game
8843,pain
8844,pew pew aliens and stuff
8845,"Absolutely terrible, I have several hundred hours on PS4"
8846,"Destiny 2 is a amazing game and i love it i play with my friends and its always my second resort after minecraft, however minecraft is not as 3d and doesnt have as much good graphics as destiny."
8847,"Don't start, you'll never stop.  Took me 8 years to get away from this franchise.  The addiction is real."
8848,its pretty cool
8849,"It's ok i guess, for one play-through."
8850,Never play this game 11/10

8861,My favourite game! Highly recommended! :)
8862,this game fucking sucks
8863,I love to hate this game
8864,"I have like 1000+ hours on xbox.  This game fell off.  you are going to have to pay 100+ on dlcs and monthly season passes to make Destiny 2 something continually enjoyable.  That said, this game has next level development and is amazingly made.  If you dont mind the price, its very fun with friends."
8865,I like
8866,"An amazing game! I just wish they had free to play campaigns
"
8867,"Good :)
"
8868,awful shitt game but fun with friends $108 dollars to get all the dlc is fuckin crazy
8869,Worst game ever tbh
8870,it's so cool
8871,"Been playing since original D1 beta, still have a wonderful love/hate relationship with this game"
8872,i (still) dont know what's going on but i like shooting things with my friends
8873,it's my favorite game and i hate it. play at your own risk
8874,megamind hunter
8875,its fun just fun thats it
8876,the more and more i play this game the more of what i do means nothing i never wanted to say it but this game blows and the developers can kick rocks they clearly dont care about improving it they are just as complacent as always.
8877,ooga
8878,"If you are willing to drop 100$+ every year for content, then its not half bad"
8879,fun
8880,
8881,U took everything away from me
8882,.
8883,Geometric shapes fight each other with some paywalls in the way
8884,"great game especially when i die every 5 min and my friends have to come and revive me while also not dying  because they are better then me and still call me a new light even though i have done all campaigns, am at a higher power level then the max power level, and have a lot of hours of game play"
8885,i cant stop playing
8886,epic
8887,fun
8888,I'd love if players like me would make this game more popluler so the game makers have fame plus the game is really fun!
8889,did not like it
8890,mad
8891,"fun game, aslo bad, also fun
"
8892,just a w game
8893,"good game
"
8894,fully encompassing game - my main game to play.
8895,its like heroin but it destroys you mentally and not physically
8896,"The environments and challenging FPS ""boss"" fights. I get sucked into it. I don't even play the game to its full potential and I still think it's worth the money."
8897,If you have no life this game is for you.
8898,this game has no end so if you like games that are open world then this game is good but put hours in then it gets better because its starts getting good the more you play and the lore is insanely good for the people who like lore.
8899,its fun
8900,"So, once upon a time, in 2018, this game was utterly mid and unfulfilling, and not even super fun to grind out with friends. Unfortunately for my productivity, it is anything but that now. I recommend giving it a try, especially if you can rope some buddies into it with you."
8901,bad. can't stop playing :(
8902,"Gambit is the best gamemode added to any game ever, I love gambit. Gambit is my life"
8903,very fun
8904,Played a little bit. everything thats op is hidden behind a pay wall bigger than the northern wall from the game of thrones. but fun
8905,Snooze festival
8906,cool
8907,it a good game
8908,No dlc no life
8909,yes
8910,Love this game and hate it at the same time. Good job Bungie. Not talking to you Sony
8911,is good
8912,"it's a really fun game, highly recommend"
8913,"Heloo everyone looking for a game to satiate your bloodlust

I, as you can see, have played 2000 hours as of writing this review. To be completely honest I absolutely love this game! The movement and mechanics of each class are entirely unique and require time to get used to, the guns and powers you get throughout the game make playing this game fulfill your power fantasy of exploding with space powers, careening highly charge lightning bolts, blasting blisteringly balls of searing flames, and crispy frost shards of ice at any foes that dare stand in your main character's way. As someone who has played a Warlock, I like playing the best of both world when it comes to all three characters: Hunter, Titan and Warlock. I have played a Warlock since the beginning of this game and I felt it was my birthright to play a Warlock and become a wielder of powers that make me feel like a god. This game in my opinion takes a while to get into the thick of it, in order to actually figure out the controls. Story-wise the beginning of this game has evolved with new cutscene's and ever closing on the fact that the end is coming and we must prepare, practice and learn. I'm hoping to play this game til it completely ends."
8914,It is very hard when you first jump in because there feels like you have to do so much and so many places to navigate. Once you understand what is going on and certain objectives it feels as if you will never run out of things to do. The movement and gun play is unlike any other game. 10/10 would recommend
8915,everything
8916,"If you like grinding your life away only for you to have to pay $160 or more over time to get the items you need, then take it. The game is borderline abusive and would sacrifice your firstborn if it had the chance to earn a quarter in profits."
8917,i love destiny
8918,"Destiny 2 has been on a difficult path, but I think it's okay now. It'll never compare to the nostalgia many of us have of the first game but for what the game is itself it isn't horrible but also isn't anything insane. Still worth a go either way."

8953,"I enjoyed the game, loved the various armors and whatnot, plus some of the weapons and concepts are wicked. HOWEVER, they basically steal your money by VAULTING PAID DLC AND NOT GIVING YOU YOUR MONEY BACK!!! I PAID TWENTY DAMN DOLLARS FOR FORSAKEN AND THEN THEY JUST SAY NAW, YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS ANY MORE AND WE WILL NOT BE REFUNDING YOU! THAT OUGHTA BE ILLEGAL!!!

Go find a different free scifi game, like Warframe. At least they don't steal your shit, even if the farming can take a while. Plus at least their ""classes"" AKA the Warframes actually feel unique unlike the three Guardians classes which just feel so darn samey!"

This is the most unfriendly new player game. I cannot stress this enough, if you haven't picked up this game already - save your time and money by dodging this aged looter shooter."
8969,"game keeps freezing at the load up of the game, its annoying."
8970,"So, here's the thing that many other (much better) reviewers than me have said: Destiny 2 has become slight hell for new players. I was lucky enough to be able to play everything before content was vaulted, but for many new Lights, getting into Destiny's world and story can be tough when you can't even play the original base game anymore. The 'New Light' quests are intended to ease newbies in, but they don't do a good job.

HOWEVER. The stories have improved vastly. The characters are wonderful. And Bungie's commitment to improving accessibility mean that my disabled ass has a much more fun time in this game. It's been a continual commitment of theirs, and I'm glad they care so deeply.

It's by far my favourite space game. Definite top 5 game for me. If Bungie can just figure out how to make the game less daunting for new players, it'll be that much better."

9006,very fun and immersive
9007,"let me preface that i love this game. ive had 2 accs both at about 1000ish hours on xbox but they got corrupted and lost them. 

This game is such a banger if 
1. You have a ppl to play with, which is not hard to find if im being honest. i prefer solo play but nothing beats meeting ppl through Discord, or even in game and just hangin out running some raids or GMs.
2. You can afford the time investment. This game uses a lot of repeated content to make you every week gain some power in certain slots of your characters and gradually get powerful and be able to do the highest Difficulty content. but it takes a long to get there if im being honest.
3. You can afford to shell out some money on the DLCs, which recently have been worth every dollar. But Destiny in genera; has a habit of releasing content through a weekly basis instead of all at once. 

i truly do recommend this game, but man its got issues. the 50 minute activity to gain *maybe* 1 or 2 power overall in a certain gear slot, the sometimes lack of new and exciting content and them reusing the same event for years in a row (Talking to you Solstice), absolute toxic PvE/PvP community that has a bunch of elitists in it and assholes.

Amazing Series, Amazing Game, And Usually Amazing and helpful community"

9032,"There is so much good in this game, though I think most of it gets tarnished by aggressive marketing practices. I think it's a great game to take casually, hop on to feel like a superhero every once in a while. But at the end of the day, Bungie's priority is not making a quality experience, it's capitalism first and everything else after."
9033,"Amazing game play design, What you would expect of a power fantasy shooter.
Every Weapon and Perk is unique, Meaning if you are in it to chill there is many combinations and play styles for you.
However if you are looking to play seriously you may dislike this game, Exotics (Higher tier loot items) will be power crept extremely hard as the seasons go on and with very little chance of Bungie going back and tweeking the individual power of things, you are left with a sentimental item that doesn't achieve the current seasons goals.
A lot of the game is behind paid DLC, imo for the price you get the hours out of it. However the structure of how they did the DLCs is absolutely appalling, With new DLCs reaching upwards of $60 you have to spend hundreds and hundreds to unlock the full game. 
For DLCs i recommend you enter with the mindset ""How much of this will i use and will i get my moneys worth from this""

The tutorial for new players is done extremely poorly, You walk around and interact with irrelevant objects for 20 minutes only to be bombarded with tons of information about classes immediately afterwards. While it does not bother me personally, A friend i brought into the game definitely did not appreciate it. I got them to stick through the tutorial and they are getting into the rest of the game really well.
PvE is pretty straight forward and for casual players you can complete most early to mid game activities without any stress.
With the options to up the difficulty if you want to get more rewards or achievements.
PvP i personally hate, there is a very defined meta which you sort of are forced to use if you want to win. Matchmaking isn't the greatest either, with Bungie putting solo match makers against 3 or 6 stack premades resulting in stomped matches, or will put 1 really good player on each team and 5 newbies, also resulting in a lot of people getting stomped.

Overall, Try it out. The free to Play experience isn't the worst, if you join during an event like the summer or winter events you get a lot of free to play progression help choices as well, Just try to stick through the painful tutorial and judge the game for the game play.
P.S Sorry for the bad grammar i wrote this at like 4am"
9034,Pay for the DLC... That is all
9035,money grab.

9038,"i came back after so long excited to experience all the stuff ive heard and relive the red war again, however they have removed almost everything from the game now, if you wanted to experience the red war? you cant its been removed, if you wanted to go to the moon titan? you cant its been removed. the game feels devoid of content, the current story is immensely bland and done entirely through text which is a massive downgrade and as it stands, it doesnt feel worth buying ny of the dlc as i dont feel like itd be worth my money for the experience i may recieve. its incredibly disappointing they went down such a path instead of evolving the world as you play to join people on the same quest level as you, they just got rid of everything and say ""too bad"""

9045,UJ
9046,one of the games of all time
9047,"The game has constantly changed every year ever since I began during the Red War. Not knowing how to get Upgrade Modules despite the number of times it publicly popped up, getting one-shot by a Wanted enemy on Titan, seeing the level system overhaul, third Supers being added, the shift in story to Light versus Darkness, Exotics becoming common drops, addition of Champions, content becoming outdated or irrelevant with the constant release of new guns and mods changing gameplay substantially, Seasonal content, content being removed, etc.

It all seems overwhelming to look back on and see where I am now. Year 2 (F2P): playing solo and joining Public Events at random. Year 3 (opting into subscription service): playing with my brother and friends while being introduced to Champions, dungeons, and raids. Friends depart in less than half a year. Year 4: Joined a clan mid-year. Got to do raids again for the first time since my friends left the game. Did Grandmasters and showed them my way of the sword. Year 5: Present day.

It doesn't take 3k+ hours to have an amazing gameplay experience. It takes some self-creativity, self-exploration, and independence from the community and friends. Despite the problems that this game is riddled with, I've come to overlook many for the gameplay alone, but my experience hardly matches the standard. Everyone's about meta, popular loadouts, whatever YouTubers put out there, and other things without consideration or thought of ""why"" or ""so what"". I've done just fine in endgame content doing things my way, and my clanmates respect the benefits that come with it. But, the game has slowly become stale playing with randoms who follow the trends and abandon creativity.

My thoughts on the direction Bungie has taken with this game overall has been neutral, pros and cons both outweighing each other. That's for me though. I can't say the same for others. You may have read others' experiences (though brief their writings of their experiences may be) being terrible while others were great. It all depends on who you are, what you look for in a game, and what you can't stand in games, as it does for any game. This game having over 400k reviews, you are bound to meet and interact with the best and worst of humanity. Most importantly, as this is an MMO, it's mostly about how you value your time and where you spend. You might find at some point that you hit a wall and you can't do anything about it. Sometimes, you just get left behind. Or, you might propel so far forward so fast that you wonder why everyone else has so much trouble.

This is game is one of few games I've played where I experienced the above for the better, overall. It expanded and pushed my independent creative thinking and ability to learn from mistakes and exposed me to more types of people in the gaming world, some of whom I never wish to meet ever again and some who left a positive memory to look back on as I continue to play this game."

9049,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

With a recent update however, bungie has made it so that I cannot play the game longer than a few minutes before it kicks me out with a vague error code. I spent hours trying to follow their useless guides to fix this error code, but nothing has worked. Looking around online, it's apparent I'm not the only person with this exact issue, but bungie has not spoken about it publicly as far as I'm aware. But don't worry, bungie is hard at work implementing new battle passes and other ways to yoink your money, but still not maintain the game. Don't be like me, don't fall into the same trap I did. Assuming bungie ever gets around to fixing this stupid issue, I will probably drop another 750 hours into this game, so don't make the same mistake I did"

I would not recommend this game to anyone looking for sustenance and replay-ability in game. There's not really an incentive to complete the storyline, the PvP is run by sweats and there's not really any modes for casuals unless you play the party modes when they're in the weekly rotation, the constant removal of older content makes the story telling hard to catch up on when you miss a season, and finally the paid aspect isn't needed unless you have friends that like to do other activities than the 1 free raid.

"
9093,"this game is my favorite, I fucking hate it."
9094,played game for 5 years on xbox and game is still pretty good. Bungo just needs to fix shotguns
9095,"Free, but still overpriced."
9096,"This game is still a very enjoyable game. For me this game is like a good wine, it gets better with time and of course its not a flawless games, still got some bugs here and theres, still got some empty spaces to fill but at least in this game the devs and community is still pretty involved and got a long road map of new things planed in the pipelines of ideas and project to come in a near future and in the years to come too. Every games got their flaws but not every games are kept alive with futur contents and project, but this game surely does deliver that and if your looking for a good addicting looter/shooter to be competitive or even just to have fun, Destiny 2 is one in the genre that deliver all that. For all that i would highly recommend and has it is at the state of today i would put a 8.5 out of 10."
9097,"I respect the stories in Destiny 2. The art is just a masterpiece. I can customize my character looks, but it does not snatch the attention from the crazy campaigns and points to be earned in mini-games within the game. I am slightly obsessed for a student at college."
9098,very pog
9099,This game stole my friends from me
9100,"Recently came back to Destiny 2 because a friend wanted to play. I tell him, ""I'll play, the campaign is fun so I'll level a new character with you."" Jump on to see all characters are 1350, and super confused on everything. Come to find out they removed the campaign, and all the dlc I owned. So I literally can't play my owned content. Bad decision, dumb AF reasoning, I hope this game fails with decisions like this being made."
9101,"My main issue with this game, bloodshot eyes.
This is a first, but i am fairly certain that this game causes massive eyestrain. The amount of bursting lights and high contrasts takes its toll quite fast and in 15 years of gaming have never encountered anything this severe. It looks like contrast and vibrancy ratios are turned all the way up with the goal to make getting flash-banged make you go blind irl. Yes, game looks stunning, but it also feels like staring into the sun sometimes. 

Also PvP Matchmaking is non existent, menu navigation is backwards and unintuitive mess."
9102,"Its good other than having to buy all the DLC. Cheeky ""play first two campaign missions, then have to buy it"". Otherwise, its still fun"
9103,"I was considering writing an actual ""review"" because I 
absolutely loved Destiny 2 but Bungie insisted on
turning this game into one massive dumpsterfire and it's getting worse each year.

Do yourself a favour; stay away from Destiny and save your money. 
I hope someone takes the IP from Bungie to salvage the mess they have produced the last 3 years.
Bungie sure as hell is not able to do it."
9104,It is a game.
9105,
9106,"""You've played for ~200 hours""

yeah thanks stop reminding me"
9107,very fun
9108,HORSE crap
9109,The Best!
9110,I like destiny it duh bestest game out there
9111,lit
9112,best looter game i've ever played
9113,I love this game for being free its just great there's so much to do and i love it
9114,"just play it, its good"
9115,Gooten gamen
9116,"very fun game,very addictive aswell"
9117,"This game is a great arcade-y shooter that you can relax with. 
It's set pieces are gorgeous
It has an in-built aim assist like Halo's so no need to strain your arm
Poor decisions aren't punished heavily while still keeping some challenge,
It has endless progression for people who care about that 
Finally, you can form a form a party with friends extremely easily. 
If you play games to relax, or want an action game you don't have to practice much to be decent at, then this game is great for you.


(P.S.: Unless you have all day to play it, don't bother with dedicated grinding. It is arduously slow, without much skill-related challenge, and scores reset every season. I recommend that you play to relax or have fun.)"
9118,I liked it a lot
9119,"A good game with fun and entertaining game play though you have to grind A LOT to get to the endgame and imo leveling is boring and i wish there was a better new player experience. Right after I loaded up the game I looked up stuff on youtube, because I did not know where the story was going at ALL the game should give you a cutsecene explaining what was going on the LAST FIVE YEARS."
9120,
9121,bueno
9122,"[h1] Thieves [/h1]
I bought the game, few months later they made it free to play and took away content.  They added expansions even more expensive than the original price of the game and took away some more content. 
So now I don't have acces to the product I bought because they took away all of the content available when I bought it . 
I wish that company goes bankrupt and disapear."
9123,game good
9124,"5 out of 10
it's free, but not entirely free to play.
you have to purchase a very expensive DLC to get the full experience that is sold separately.
plus, the dev planning to remove DLC(s) that you already purchased in the future.

on the bright side, the gameplay is solid, gunplay, gimmicks, game modes, PvE & PvP, stories, they have it all
yet, the greed of the company ruins everything!

consider this F2P version as a demo
still worth to try"
9125,destiny is the best game ever made.
9126,is destiny 2.
9127,That wizard came from the moon
9128,i love it....
9129,"Really good game and has some of the best feeling mechanics but has very dry spots throughout the year and grinding gets boring during them, I have over 2000 hours on console and a little under 50 here. I couldnt recommend this to a new player as they missed too much and the grind for them would be super unreasonable and not to mention the FOMO on previous season guns that are not obtainable in the kiosk"
9130,"This game will always hold a special place in my heart, whether the game is in a good or bad spot. I’ve seen the best and worst this game has to offer, and even at its worst, I think it’s one of the best looter shooters ever made. I’m mostly a solo player nowadays (which is still fun), but with friends, this is a true masterpiece and an absolute blast. I highly recommend at least giving this game a shot if you haven’t already. It’s free so why not?"
9131,good game1
9132,There's nothing to do if you're free-to-play
9133,this game has made me bankrupt and lonely

9144,"Yes the game does have it's Qualities, it't Pro's. But on the other hand it also carries Bigger problems ... 
I do consider myself a gamer, and for a long time I have become 100% intolerant of any game that does Not give me enough control over my experience, I have written 3 large personal articles explaining my own position on these gaming matters that No one read, therefore I would only go so far as to share a link to them if by request"
9145,Ive wasted my time on this game. I hope I fall into a pool of scorpians
9146,I have 9.7 hours of loading screen. Pretty good game
9147,fun
9148,This game is a very awesome FPS.
9149,it is a great game with amazing maps and and all kinds of never seen befor items and relics  and a very long and interesting storyline that takes alot of time to get frew with new content constantly getting released
9150,"First and foremost, I'm not recommending this game for their business model, but strictly for the gameplay and visual standpoint. From a business standpoint, i'm indifferent to negative with it for many reasons, but just know that you'll be spending money, at the very least, yearly to keep current. Now, the positives are that it looks graphically great, and feels fantastic. A very good blend of what I would compare to CoD x Halo. Very fun with friends especially, but easy to jump into strikes, pvp, and public content with others as well. A lot of content ( especially now ) to go through and grind, but be aware that that's the game content.... GRINDING. There is a lot of it and whether you like that game design, and like the content that you will be grinding is subjective to each person. I don't mind it since it's fun, in my opinion, but is definitely not for everyone. It having essentially a free to play trial is quite nice though to try out and bring friends with too, to see if it's worth your time or not, and with that being said, I recommend most everyone at least try it out and see if it's worth the investment."

9154,"the game was good when it first started out, but now its a hot pile of trash, as of 7/25/22, there is absolutely no free campaign that players can play, the free ones that originally came with the game; ""Red War"", and ""Temple of Osiris"", have been added to bungies ""vault"" of death, and will never return to the game; they did this so they can force you to buy the current dlc, good marketing move imo, but trash for free players, dont bother. i dont understand why they cant stop ruining things, i understand the game is getting too big to keep all the content in it, but if thats really their argument, why not just let players who want to play the old campaign; choose to install the old campaigns? dont make it mandatory, but give players the option of installing and playing the older campaigns, without Temple of Osiris and red war this game is pretty much an empty void of nothingness, besides pvp and some trashy ""heres a preview, PLEASE BUY OUR DLC"" quests that dont even let you finish the questline. and they wonder why no one plays this."
9155,Not a huge fan of fps but Bungie got this one right. so much fun.
9156,"punch yes, good."
9157,"Destiny uses peer to peer networking. You better hope you don't play with someone who lives far away from you. It's fun on the PVE side of things but If you're looking for a fun PVP experience, than look somewhere else. It's rife with hackers and while Bungie always talks a good game about fixing that, it never hits the mark.

Hopefully Destiny 3, if it ever happens, does not suffer the same fate."
9158,free-to-play sure until you have to pay 120+ for dlcs just to do the most basic shit.
9159,great game but a savathun sex scene with rhulk would be great

9163,i have never loved and hated a game so much before
9164,"Great game. Don't buy it. 

Half the thing has been sent to Brazil, and the other half is almost as incomprehensible as warframe. The story is some pseudo religious dogwater that makes Evangelion look like a dating simulator. Despite being a first-person shooter the hit-detection works like a D&D dice roll. 

There are three overarching game-modes game-modes; Man versus Nature, Man versus Self, and Man versus God. 

Man versus Nature has you fighting the San Diego Homeless population for the Last Pure Heroin Needle in the Golden state, the Roman Empire if it was run by bodybuilders, The Average Residents of Pittsburgh, the Church of Scientology if their god was real, and the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Genocide. 

In this engaging and enraging cycle of suffering, you are allowed to; 

-Fight in the peaceful and serene streets of Irag as you take on bounties from the  [strike] brave men and women of the Mujahideen[/strike] residents of Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, Hillah, and Kirkuk. We used to be able to go to Naveah and Kuwait but uh... we don't talk about those anymore. 

-Fight in Strikes on Suspected Terrorists as you form taskforces to [strike] find and kill Sadam Hussein[/strike] whatever boss the game wants you to kill. 

-Fight in Nightfalls, which just remind your Grandfather of the Tet Offensive and is about as difficult, as your teammates will most likely be potatoes and the enemies here are brutal. 

-Fight in raids on [strike]Sadam's compound[/strike] beautiful and scenic locations where you take the fight to the enemy, participating in ritualistic and communal suffering with a fireteam composed of 6 simians as you struggle to atavistically attain pattern recognition and evolve into Homo Sapiens. The rewards for this communal suffering are some of the finest weapons and armors in this game, as well as the memories and trauma of the number 6. 

In Man Versus Self, you participate in the fine traditions of Sufi self-flagellation as a vaguely Asian man encourages you to viciously slaughter your fellow man in pursuit of money. In this stunning and engaging game-mode, you are allowed to; 

-Participate in the fine American tradition of Manifest Destiny wherein you slaughter your way across the New World in pursuit of riches, plundering and murdering across America to send your ill-gotten gains to the King and Queen of Spain. 

-Participate in the fine Russian tradition of Revanchism, wherin you are allowed to invade and kill the [strike] Colonials[/strike] ENEMY team in order to kill and plunder their loot so that it rightfully and heroically becomes your blood money. 

Man Versus Self encompasses the ever-spiraling cycle of murder and revenge; you struggle to pay your blood-tithe to Genghis Khan, the Sisyphean cycle of violence serving as an allegory of the human condition. 

In Man Versus God, you are pulled into an Average and Peaceful day in Denver, Colorado; the experience of which will leave you a veteran in advanced CQC and room clearing techniques. In this form of hell, you are allowed to; 

-Fight to the death against your fellow man for cool guns as you are yeeted into a 1v5 situation where no one is your friend, and every single 1v1 WILL be interrupted by some random yahoo who WILL appear from the fucking ether to cap you RIGHT before you kill your guy. 

-Fight to the death in a team-based cooperative experience wherein your team of 6 is comprised entirely of monkeys, while the enemy team is comprised entirely of Seal Team 6 Operators fresh from combat. The battlefield is chaos, and everybody and their mother has a shotgun with your name on it. 

-Fight in the Trials of Osiris, where, much like in the aforementioned 6v6, you are a monkey fighting against man. You will experience strange and surreal things in this peyote trip as you witness a man come flying at you at roughly a third the speed of light; his spear piercing both your body and your soul approximately 0.001 picoseconds after the round has begun. 

When you're not fighting demi-gods, you are fighting the Oracles of Delphi, who somehow know; Where you're laning, how many of you there are, what gun you're planning on peaking with, your home address, and the true name of your soul. These people live, breathe, eat, and shit Trials of Osiris, and will send your ass to Brazil. 

Man Versus God is the cycle of inevitability; at first you join because its fun, over time transitioning that fun into impotent rage as you struggle to improve and strive to attain Unbroken or Flawless, ultimately coming to the understanding that to struggle against God is futile as he is currently hacking. 

Destiny 2 is a mostly fun experience with a variety of activities for those both Free-to-Pay and Enslaved-to-the-Grind. It's not a game, it's an addiction. Don't buy it."
9165,the game
9166,game is fun i have been playing this game on xbox for years then built a pc and started to play it on here
9167,only ogs will like game

9171,"Awesome game with something for everyone.  Solo activities, group activities, and PvP.  The story driven content is pretty good too."
9172,"fun

9173,its iight
9174,this game has taken time away from my loved ones 10/10 deff recommend
9175,"the game is horrible after the story, endgame is just boring raids and pvp (which the pvp is so bad and unbalanced)"
9176,Game 100% sucks. Totally didn't start playing when it was on Blizzard. May or may not be sarcastic when I say this game sucks. They need more MILFS like Mara Sov and Hawthorn
9177,"The screen to play for free, but it isn't.  This sucks not sure i like this game.   Oh Well back to my other games"
9178,"Destiny is a cycle of hills and valleys. It has its great moments alongside its dull and boring days where we wait until the next set of contents. Despite the flak this game gets, especially from the community's retards (trust me, there's a metric fuckton of them), ESPECIALLY from Reddit and Twitter, I enjoy its great moments. The narrative is at its best ever, though with an increasingly aging content release structure. And don't even get me started with the New Light experience. TO anyone trying to pick this up for the time, I only wish you luck."
9179,"man this shit sucks ass. most of the game is pure grind, the game isnt free to play, it`s just a free trial. Fuck Destiny Fanboys, them dick riding bitches. cayde deserved to die anyways that bitch ass had it coming. Anthem is better anyways, that game at least has flying, its the best mechanic yet in gaming, that shit goes hard."

9211,It ight
9212,yur
9213,It's a really fun game you should download it for sure there might not be many things to do if you don't have DLCS be you can still do many things
9214,most fun game iplayed and it have the best grind system
9215,"with over 2000 hours across steam and the xbox version, i can safely say its a favorite. i could go into a long, in depth review, but there's no need. everything but cross-progression, pretty damn great."
9216,when enemy i press g for funny HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
9217,Its ok...
9218,it's value for your mothers moneyz
9219,torture
9220,my favourite game of all time
9221,"Played the game when it came out yes I paid for it and yes I did regret it because it was bloody free years later, anyways was a big virgin while playing the game once first dlc drop for this game I quit. After I quit destiny I lost my virginity B)"
9222,it's ok
9223,"if you are willing to spend your life playing then yes its a great game,"
9224,"It's free, why no get?"
9225,"Good game, lots of content."
9226,I've been playing Destiny since D1. Always a good game to grind. I do get tired of it after a while but I always find myself coming back for more
9227,fun
9228,nice
9229,If you have $200 ready to dump on this game then i recommend you to play this game.
9230,its alright
9231,"devs don't care about the game much these days, crucible has no identity, PvE content is watered down re-skinned stuff every season, only cool things left is the Raids which are once a year so i don't justify playing this game all year to have 3 weeks worth of content being the new raid (or old raid from D1 brought back as new content) overall not that good but its free so thats neat i guess. just don't play this as a main game and you're good."
9232,"A great game with an interesting story, addicting mechanics and I reasonably nice playerbase. Unfortunately you cant play the original campaign anymore, and one of the best expansions just doesn't have a campaign anymore. Witch Queen: Best thing I've seen in a while, a great story, cool loot, get to kill the moth mommy. Beyond Light is just fun. You get an entirely new moon to explore, a cool new damage type that has thankfully been nerfed recently, and I campaign that feels solid and not recycled. Shadowkeep: Yikes, sure the dungeon is fun and the raid is the hardest one yet, but dang, Bungie really had 0 original ideas for this expansion. Moon? Recycled. Enemies? Also recycled. The campaign feels like a whole bunch of bounties put together with duct tape and superglue. Even the raid, in the black garden, Recycled as well. The only new thing is the Giant Red Tower that somehow isn't the final boss fight? Its barely a 12 minute strike. Forsaken has cool exotics, but the campaign has been removed so you're essentially paying 20 dollars for three weapons. 
I general, recommend. A lot more fun with like 5 friends who have the same expansion so you can do raids, and having a DLC in general is a lot more fun. Make sure you know where and when Xur is each week so you can get exotic gear, and don't do Looking For Group on raids."
9233,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played
Please Help Me"
9234,It's the opioid epidemic but for gamers.
9235,"Simply put, Destiny 2 has really good gameplay but its wrapped up in a horrible game. Also If you want to try playing it as a free player don't even bother go play warframe or something."
9236,"while the game is loved and hated, i can state for myself this game and Destiny 1 are just so addictive.. the gunplay is just so tight and perfect! the art design, the haunting music which stays with you long after you stop playing. i have bought this game again and again on multiple platforms as its like a bad addiction i just keep coming back for more. thats not to take away from the expert game design and constant levelling and new armour and guns to unlock. the formula is perfect, no fps fan can deny the magic of bungie games which gameplay wise is always rock solid. love this franchise so much just wish i had more friends to play with. WE need match making for all raids and game modes.... yes controversial but needed so bad"
9237,Good game.
9238,I hate playing this game not one second is enjoyable.
9239,I paid over 50 bucks for an expansion and just realized I can't access it's dungeon... would have to pay?? wth is going on nowadays???
9240,It's a grindy masterpiece.
9241,"I hate this game, I think I'll buy the next expansion"
9242,"I love all the options you have and just how ""sandbox"" it is!"
9243,VeR Pug
9244,cool
9245,"very fun game, but dlc is so annoying, apart from that its great."
9246,"put tons of money and time into both destiny and destiny 2, almost 400 hours on steam and god knows how many on bnet. But in the end anything and everything i spent money on besides pretty colored cosmetics, are all entirely gone from the game. Spent $60 on a expansion? no longer playable. Spent that for every new expansion as its come out? hundreds of dollars for something that doesn't even exist anymore.

so what if you're new to destiny and don't care? well you'll get to enjoy one of the worst kept up and worst balanced pvp games around, you'll get 10's of characters with years of implied history, but you'll never be able to experience it. You'll also get to wonder why anyone even cares that this guardian killed cayde, cause who the fuck is cayde? 

what sad treatment of the fan base, the characters and the franchise. Bungie has absoultely lost it if they think people will trust them with their money in the future, they've shown they care nothing for the people who stick around long term, as long as the whales are there to float their company. Looking forward to Destiny Immortal

"
9247,I LOVE THIS GAME
9248,yay
9249,This is a game where you are forced to pay for new content every couple of months so be prepared to pay for the same game over and over again and disregard all human decency in PVP why? Because Shaxx said so also still haven't found Mara Sovs bathwater yet.
9250,"1,000 hours baby"
9251,"very fun, realistic and Great story. I recommend you play this game"
9252,"Maneiro

9253,"very fun game, played D1: Taken King and this already gives me that nice nostalgia."
9254,its nice you shoot goblins and you watch numbers go up as you get things that have different colours it ok
9255,"very good
"
9256,The game wants you to spend more money and is incessant with ads about the most recent season completely ruining any sense of immersion.
9257,"nice game, relaxing vibe"
9258,It's ok I guess
9259, its a fun game with lots of adventure
9260,"In regards to the display of the ornament that is shown with no lock icons it 's specifies that the ornament item has been unlock, in regards to silver shown that is needed to unlock it, means that the ornament itself is locked because it has not been received. theoretically there are logs of players in regards to what they have earned in they re lifetime of gameplay, meaning it can be seen in the history of the game account that those items that are collected already are unlocked. The new content that they add with the silver that is required to unlock ornament is bug because, if a player had a piece of ornament and is not equipped, the silver lock will overide the rewards making it lock. so as a test bug that is 100% accurate can be tested .
Test case of bug overriding a skin ornament that was previous rewarded and not equipped will be shown with unlock with silver.
1. Boot the game Destiny 2
2. Make a character and enter the game
3.Collect a piece of ornament that is a reward offered
4. Do not equip the ornament
5. Roll the update that require silver to equip ornament
6 The skin ornament that is not equipped will be silver lock
Players that have receive in the past ornaments for weapons, items and so on that are not equipped should not be silver lock after the update.

BUNGO stole my rights of owning the ornaments that i got from past rewards mission and xur and made them silver lock with the new update. i hope this game will die fast

here the post and the piscture of the items that i had and bungie locked me out, because i didn t had the ornament equipped ...."
9261,Played this game at launch and maxed everything. Lost my character on the transition from Blizzard as I didn't want to play anymore. Now I've come back because there's nothing else out there as good and complete as this with so much content grinding to abstract you from real-life as possible. Great game.
9262,eh
9263,GET ADDICTED it fun
9264,"Bungie has completely lost touch with it's player base.  They force you to play PVP when they cannot control the cheaters and their matchmaking process is broken.  I have tried to look past their poor response to player concerns, however; I have come to believe they do not care.  Additionally, there new content is just a replay of old content.  Nothing new but grind."
9265,"Destiny '1' WAS/AND STILL IS my FAVOURITE GAME EVER! So naturally, Destiny2 the continuation gets a recommendation from me. Truly great, this review should be longer but with| D1 | being PERFECT in my mind that about sums it up. its a shame though we can no longer play the content from | D1 | and D2 is all we have left. This series will live on in my heart forever. \\"
9266,"Destiny 2 has some of the best fps game play of any game out there, that being said, bungie doesn't seem to get this, instead of creating challenging campaign levels with difficult enemies they make stupid silly puzzle levels, jumping puzzles and obstacle course levels. I wonder if there is a way to see death statistics because 95% of my deaths must have been falling off cliffs, being pushed, or caught in some trap i couldn't possibly know is there, not to mention the time wasted looking up walk throughs for their silly puzzles so that i don't waste my time. I read a review like this before buying and thought user must be exaggerating but no, every campaign mission of this expansion has some annoying thing that is plain anti-fun to deal with. Hope Bungie realises most people just want to shoot things, puzzles and stuff like that is okay as optional side content not mandatory story content."
9267,It's good yeah
9268,Why can't I stop playing this game. The gameplay is smooth and there's enough variety of content to keep me occupied whenever I have time for gaming.
9269,a
9270,"i really like the weapons and bosses keep it up
"
9271,It's ok
9272,"Destiny is an online multiplayer (or solo) action shooter with rpg elements. You play as a superpowered guardian (3 classes) and you play different activities to level up and upgrade your gear. 

Destiny is probably my favorite game franchise at this point. I've found something to enjoy in each release, started more casually but became much more interested after year 1. With Bungie's split from activision and the release of shadowkeep and new light the game is in a great spot. 

Its a great game to play with your friends.

9279,"This game has massive issues,
lack of content, missing original game, cant do anything unless u have the newest dlc (which is normally 80 bucks) 
but if your willing to spend the money then i say its an amazing.
i got the dreeded virus and have been isolating this past week and this game has keep me grounded to some extent. i will say i probably have 100 plus hours in the original destiny with all the dlc and i enjoy that destiny fair more. and i played destiny back before i get a pc on my ps4 when destiny 2 become free and i would say there was more content back then. i would say this game is a 5/10 possible a 6 
dont waste money on this game unless you will put time into it. if not spend a few hours grinding and getting to max level (untill it resteats) then decide from there what u want to do"
9280,e
9281,the worst best times of life. This game made me realize I can hate my favorite game
9282,time consuming
9283,just remember the forsaken campaign was removed
9284,it is a fun game to play
9285,is destiny 2
9286,Best toxic relationship ever till something new comes to destroy the pvp meta again :D
9287,these motherfuckers wont let me access the DLC on the account i ported from my pc so now i have to pay like 200 dollars do get access back to all my favorite raids and strikes that i ALREADY FUCKING PAYED FOR AND PLAYED WITH. absolutely retarded i dont know what the fuck they were thinking
9288,FUN GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS
9289,"i like
multi play 
vs ememy"
9290,I can never play again
9291,Love the game and I'm cool with f2p w/ paid dlc business models.... But there is a limit. And the expansions already adding up to $100 with more to come... That's just too much. Especially considering how much they also have in micro transactions. They can absolutely afford to drop prices and probably wouldn't even notice.
9292,"Pros:
- The gameplay is amazing & addicting
- AAA Action MMO
- That graphic is insane
- Nice Lore and world creation
- Weapon and armor Tier
- Not PTW (need to finish campaign in Legendary mode or play some mission to get exotic weapon or armor)

Cons:
- Need DLC to progress further the story.
- Devs delete content of old campaign after several years to save storage (hopes they will reintroduce the old campaign)"
9293,Waste of time and money.
9294,fun yes
9295,"Some cool weapons. Not your average FPS / MMO. Check it out, it's not for everyone though."
9296,"I liked this game for the longest. It was fun to play, I liked the characters. There are some good community members. The game is at it's best though when you have friends to play with. You can use apps and such to join other groups but that is random and you can make friends through that."
9297,"terrible game

9302,"Destiny has simply the best feeling shooting in any game I've played, with boat loads of content and occasionally even a genuine MMO feel towards the beginning of seasons when every instance of the world is fully populated. A lot of the content is geared towards parties of either 3 or 6, but solo players can still get through nearly everything with enough patience and persistence."
9303,"the pvp is ass, i keep dying to thrall. and the endgame is just outfitting your character, 10/10 would reccomend"

9309,"they removed most of the content, increased the grind, made your progress delete itself after a few months, time-gated all new story events outside of expansion passes, and made it so that all of your gear is going to be unable to compete with new stuff.

They took everything I enjoyed about Destiny 1, and the early years of this game, and crushed into dust. The devs passionately champion their decisions as a step in the right direction, and it comes off as tone-deaf at best, and malicious at worst. Do not expect anything better now that Bungie is no longer with Activison-Blizzard, because while that partnership was active, it seems Bungie was learning and absorbing the greed, the cold-heart, and the anti-consumer mentalities.

The base gameplay is still good, and new gameplay changes aren't bad at all, but when most of the actual game you interact with is a goddamn Skinner Box, you really have to watch out for your mental health while getting into this."

9315,"I was unsure whether or not to recommend this game. In the end I believe that not recommending this game is the best option. Positives: soundtrack, gunplay, optimisation. Now for some negatives. Firstly, this game is NOT free-to-play, do not fall for that. My second gripe are the seasons and season passes, and how every 3 months you're forced to grind to increase your power level. I guess some will like that, I do not. The constant shift in ""meta"" is tiresome. The game is also not solo friendly. The dreaded micro-transactions... This game has some of the most egregious prices when it comes to cosmetics, and most of the skins you will want will be behind a paywall. PvP is an imbalanced mess, that has no regional matchmaking. You WILL play against people from all around the globe, and ping becomes an utter nightmare."
9316,No

9334,"Good game, some paywalls but other than that fun"
9335,"Kicked me out of a mission part way through while I answered the door, which broke the mission stopped me progressing into the season I just paid for. Absolute joke of a game."
9336,this F2P version is a lazy destiny 1 reboot. I wanted to atleast try crucible but i guess ill have to pay for it. Will update review when i play mroe but so far first impressions i shouldve kept my original copy of Destiny 2 because not only did i lose my characters but this is a shell of a game.

9343,It does not run on linux and will ban you if you try to play on linux.
9344,"This company has become crap. Grind hundreds of hours for shit that means nothing in game. The game play loop has not evolved at all. Why is the light system still in game, paid for content why do i have to wait to play. This game could of been the best but Bungie grind is what matters. If you like the wasting  100's of hours not having fun after 25 hours of playing the game this is for you, if you have no life this is for you, Solo players can be done if you don't mind dating apps or filling out job applications.... ""GO MAKE FRIENDS TO PLAY CONTENT YOU PAY FOR"" lmfao F*** Bungie"

Overall the game is really good!"

9351,"Free to play but there isn't very much to do unless you spend $100 on DLC. I had 2000 hours in Destiny 1 and expected Bungie to treat Destiny 2 differently and they didn't. This money hungry age of game developers is getting old. I will continue to play Destiny 2 but I do not recommend buying all the DLC from steam at full price. Either get them on sale from steam or try G2A. 

A pure example of when I realized how corrupt DLC was in this game was when I was told to go to the moon to visit Eris Morn for a quest and I couldn't accept the quest without buying the DLC. I felt like I was being manipulated into buying something and I know other players will feel this way too."
9352,the game is ok . needs to much work and new graphical engine with better third party graphics
9353,my friends took L's
9354,buy the dlcs online not in-game or from steam lol half the cost.
9355,yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
9356,"If your a serious gamer and your looking for a game for you and your mates to sink some serious hours and or drop a little cash here and there, this game is NOT for yall.

This may be lengthy but if your a PvE based player it will be worth it.

This game allows you to choose between three differnt classes allowing DPS (Damage per second), Tank (High armor/HP) role and an AOE class (Area of effect) to take out many enemies at once. There is no real goal as to just go from season to season (This may reset some of your stats or power) but you travel around planet killing the enemies of humanity and those who would harm your traveler (space sphere god).

Now the game play is utterly amazing and very addicting and that leads into a problem later on. You have movement abilities, ordanace such as grenades ect, and a few other talents besides your firepower. it offers freeroam, strikes to where a 1-3 person party hunts down a boss, raids, dungeons ect. 

NOW we get to the real issues. After you have sunk hours into this game with your friends you start to discover certain predatory tactics the game takes. SUCH AS 

1. Certain advance weaponry or special advancements for said weapon can not be advanced with out PvP. (That's right even though you 100% focus on PvE the game forces you to play PvP to obtain what you want)

2. PvE Events where you combat NPC's for various reasons will often have quests/tasks that force you into PvP and not just for a moment the most recent event pits you into 25 PvP games with AT LEAST 100 player kills. Yes.... for a PvE Event...you can never achieve the full rewards with out this.

3. Due to the complete unbalance of PvP many players choose not to play (it does have a decent player base) BUT the game and there forth the developers FORCE PvE players with no intention or morale to play PvP to fill in slots to feed these players as a sacrifce to appease their PvP player base. Thuse creating incomptant and low morale players who simply jump of the side or give up in mid match due to lack of effort in being there... only to complete forced quests.

Some of their DLC is mileading as it shows many great and POWERFUL rewards but they neglect to tell you it takes hours upon hours to complete with endless deaths starting you back to the start upon death.

**This isn't an instance of ""Get gud"" these are players who are forced to do something they do NOT want to partake in the first place**

it has the same implcantions of someone who only plays PvP who has to go on a 30 hour PvE dungeon raid with equipment that dosn't match and enemies you are not geared for, just to unlock the rest of their PvP gear or unlock a new PvP mode.

For this reason alone does this game get a negative review. For forcing your player base to partake in events they clearly do not want to participate in, and locking equipment, and advancments behind them.

**EDIT** Community Forums and topics are actively removing all debates about this subject, had 2 threads get locked for no reason given nothing violated community standards on the second. If that tells new players anything."

9362,Play 4 times a year when new content drops but content bangs every time.
9363,"I go through a constant switch between this game. I hate it one day, usually when I am not having fun in pvp and getting stomped by people who need to touch grass or spend there 3000+ hours in game to instead get some bitches, and then there are times when I want nothing more then to sit and play all day and will enjoy the grind. I do not recommend this to anyone who doesn't have a lot of time on there hands because if you aren't careful you WILL get sucked into the game. Do not get the game for it's pvp, it is not a pvp game at all. Get it, play the pve content, get the dlcs, find people to do the raids with. That is the best way to play. I don't think this is a game for everyone but, I do think there is something that will scratch an itch. To anyone reading this and starting out feel free to add me, I would be more than happy to help a new and aspiring guardian. I may not have a ton of time logged on steam but by god do I have time on xbox, more than I care to admit."

9401,"Nice and Fun challenging game but this game servers is trash disconnected alot of time and also PVE is good challenging enough but PVP is ABSOLUTELY NOT BALANCED for new player or lower power level so you will just giving a freaking 1% damage to enemy and the enemy give you 120% damage so yeah YOU NEED TO REACH A MAXIMUM POWER LEVEL TO PLAY PVP OR YOU WILL JUST GIVING 2 DAMAGE YEAH 2 FREAKING DAMAGE i thought the PVP gonna be balanced for lower or higher power so a newbie can play pvp too but NO you need second life to grind for that

and also P2W event you need to buy it before you claim your reward so basically your item reward is MEANINGLESS"

9422,The free game is more like a demo. most of the guns and armor are lock behind DLC and your not able to get them unless you pay about 70-100$ in DLC some of which does not seem very good. Even older weapons from destiny 1 and early destiny 2 are locked even if you already had them before all the updates. Also i'm a returning player and from destiny 2 on the PS4.

9433,"If you don't mind paying a seasonal fee to play a video game, then this is the one for you!

 Destiny 2 is a very good game within the looter shooter genre, and has a very dedicated pve community,  if there is an activity within the game, you are sure to find someone who would be more then willing to join you, the problem that personally points me away from the game, is the fact that although free to play, every expansion comes with a very hefty price, I believe I have payed up to $40, or even $60 for each of the expansions that have come out these past 7 years of the games life cycle. 

Destiny 2 as a pvp experience on the other hand, has a very simple, yet vast learning curve, depending on which class you have chosen. you could run at your foe's and brute force your way through them with the Titan, fly gracefully over your enemy and reek havoc with the Warlock, or even weave through and assassinate your opponents with the Hunter. 

Personally, coming from the widely popular series borderlands, the thing that glues me to my screen, is the grind potential this game has, rather it be increasing your light (the games leveling system), Hunting for the games hilariously strong, and over the top legendary, and exotic weapons, or simply completing in game challenges to unlock the games deep lore.

Story wise, unfortunately you might find yourself forgetting any plot points of any of the missions the game has to offer, with as much content and story expansions, I personally found it forgetful and completed it for the sole purpose to unlock the next shiny new weapon after the next, although there is a community that revolves around the raid section of the game, where you are challenged with a complex mission to coordinate with a squad, and fight your way through to earn extremely rare items, and unlock lore of the world, in which unfortunately I personally couldn't find myself interested.

In summery, I am absolutely in love with the game, but I feel it is more or less just something that I turn on to grind out pvp and no-life when I have nothing to do, but to call it free-to-play is just a lie, although there is the pvp, main story, and even raids you can do without opening your wallet, the game might start forcing some of its content down your throat.

67/100-  very fun, but comes with a catch"
9434,The game's very grindable and free
9435,Destiny 2 is like a bad drug.
9436,cool game
9437,"pretty fun, PVP is ridiculously sweaty but getting on with some buds and grinding some quests is 10/10. also, ridiculously good for warming up your aim"
9438,"I hate Destiny 2, it my favourite game"
9439,I dont know why i play this game
9440,its ight
9441,10/10
9442,I like destiny 2 its a solid game and I have atleast 2000 hours on console it has its dry stages but otherwise its a fun game
9443,"ok game
subscription model under the guise of yearly dlc and season pass
fun if you are addicted"
9444,I hate Destiny it's my favorite game
9445,god
9446,"This game is different from the many other first person looter shooters, where it has a story that has actual effort put into the writing even the lore segments not directly told to the player character, not like the executive meddling that many other AAA FPS games have trudged through, excluding the Half-Life series and a list and many others but this is Steam run by Valve, and honestly, I'd be down for a game collab between Bungie and Valve."
9447,not bad
9448,a good game dont put ur credit card on here you will buy too many things on here and it is adicting and a great game
9449,"Do not play this game. It's a gutted version of Destin 2. In fact, this isn't Destiny 2 at all since they ""vaulted"" (which pretty much means permanently removed) the original campaign from the game and all of the subsequent expansion campaigns until Year 4, making them 100% inaccessible.

I'm one of those people who bought the game when it came out and stopped playing when I was done with all activities only to come back a day ago and to find out Bungie had quite literally robbed content out of a product I bought from them.

I don't know how this scam of a game keeps getting positive reviews because there's basically nothing to do in it now if you're a free-to-play player with a new character. All the old campaigns are gone and all you can do is roam around doing mindless side-quests and the intro to paid, new expansions.

Also don't play the PVP for this game. It's one of the most unbalanced pieces of garbage I have EVER played in my entire pvp life. Players that have been playing for a long time have access to extremely OP exotic gear that will destroy you in 3 shots while you have to hit them 10-20 times with a normal weapon to kill them.

I know people who are pretty much at professional level in FPS who tried this garbage and could not understand why no matter what they did they were always in last or close to last in every Crucible match.

Not to mention their servers are absolutely terrible. You won't feel the lag while running, but you certainly will notice how people can kill you through walls and how if you keep shooting at someone who just hid behind something, you'll keep ding damage because their servers take forever to catch up with the player, meaning you can pretty much kill someone on purpose even if they get behind cover.

Only PVP game mode that is worth a damn is gambit. it's the only time it doesn't feel like your guns are shooting peanuts.

Also don't do the exotic quests. Bungie's designers are absolute morons that should not have been made out of college. Their idea of ""challenge"" is to force you into having to solo an actual VERY DIFFICULT GROUP strike. Yes, you read it right. They picked a group mission that is already EXTREMELY  difficult for 3 people and without changing a single thing in terms of difficulty, put you to do it on your own. No balancing, no nothing.

I have seen some incompetent mission designers in my life. I have even met them while working in the game industry as a Character Artist, but my god none seem to be so inept as Bungie's. Every single decision they've made after they bought out of Activion has shown they have absolutely no clue how to run their own game. Literally the only positive change they've done in my opinion is making shaders no longer 1 time uses again. That's it. That is THE ONLY positive thing I can say about this game now.

Now they are owned by Sony, and i doubt it'll get any better from this point on, but let's hope the japanese company realises how absolutely incompetent Bungie is and force them to change. Starting by giving back they STOLE from their own paying customers.

Please, do not support this scummy company."
9450,"Not what it used to be, too much boring and non-unique grind, and scout rifles are never in meta"
9451,its one of those games you should keep coming back to
9452,Dont waste your time. There is a known bug with characters being stuck after the tutorial and they have yet to fix it. I am stuck in the room post schism quest with no way out. Map wont come up to fast travel. All doors are locked. I redid the tutorial 3 times after restarting the game and trying different fixes i found on the web. No dice. Just stuck in the room for eternity.
9453,I love the destiny series. The only thing I will say is that in reality the game is not free to play. Its more of a demo where if you really want to experience the game you will have to pay. I have played Destiny 1 and 2 on PlayStation and bought it here too. Definitely worth it but also dislike the free to play marketing. Its more to get people hooked into buying.
9454,This game is just crazy and soooooo muuch fun.
9455,.
9456,its whatever
9457,The Gameplay can get repetitive and boring after about the first 30 hours.
9458,great and expansive
9459,fun game with cool stuff
9460,I always take long breaks between expansions. But its always fun coming back.
9461,"100 days down, 900 to go"
9462,It ruined my life. i have 1400 hours combined across all platforms
9463,feels like a 9-5 except you get no pay and its just for nothing
9464,Its ok
9465,i cant do this anymore
9466,gay
9467,ass cheeks game worse fucking game ever played its a 20 min campaign repeated infinitely ! incel
9468,"Just hit 1000hrs and the only way to describe my experience with Destiny 2 is with the Captain Crunch analogy. It tastes amazing for the first few bites, but as you indulge further you realize that your mouth is being cut up by razors until eventually you are left with resentment towards the idea of pouring another bowl. You should play it though, fr. It's fun"
9469,I like it
9470,Good
9471,"my own personal issue, i hate overly long tutorials and this game has a pretty long one."
9472,Solid gun mechanics and fun with friends.
9473,
9474,big fun
9475,"Used to like it, but now i just don't. It also ruins peoples real world time management."
9476,loved it keep up the great work
9477,good
9478,Spent over $300 to get Cabal shielded into the pavement
9479,My Favorite Game
9480,JA!
9481,fun
9482,"I haven't played a lot yet, but I like it a lot. 
I did need a lot of help in the beginning from friends who have played the game before,, so I would not say its very beginner friendly. However, it is a lot of fun when you get a hang of it!"
9483,"The game devs want the game to be in their image which is why the game is dying now. I have over 2k hours on console and over 1k hours on steam. They reduce ability time about 5 different times just for it to get boosted back up to longer times and then that doesnt matter because they proceeded to put in armor mods that would allow you to get the abilities instantly. They put you in weapon locks for an entire 3 months at a time. I also dont agree with the fact that we reuse content is new content for the game. They dont really update the game unless it is something truly game breaking ONLY to PvE. They dont care about the PvP and that's about a fourth of their content out the window unless you run with stacked friends. The rerunning of content and nothing being new for like a third of a year is not healthy for the game. The PvE portion of the game is so easy that you dont need friends to do it but they lock a bunch of loot behind 6 man activities even tho when the raid is supposed to be new and good, but when there is a copy pasta of a portion of a raid the ""New Raid"" is more of a joke at that point. Why does the company say they listen to the community and add in things that are not needed but wait like a year to change other things that actually need to change. Clearly their image is clouded and they need to ACTUALLY work on the game. More than 2 updates after a major update actually try and balance stuff actually try and do stuff they have been lazy for like a century now. I truly cant suggest a game that was also pay to play at first and then just given out even after the whole Hacker situation."
9484,Good
9485,tons of fun tho a little grindy but with Friends the time flies
9486,too mucg grindingi
9487,fun
9488,"I enjoy this game. The only thing I struggle with is doing things that aren't matchmaking. There is Lfg but I am shy so making friends is difficult. Otherwise, the game is enjoyable most of the time and has pretty worlds."
9489,like the game even tho im not that active because of other games XD
9490,DONT DO IT
9491,I sold my organs to buy Witch Queen. I don't regret my decision at all.
9492,Good gaem jes

9495,"thanks for removing my Forsaken DLC, because I wasn't informed on the transfer..                                              
                                         ... ridiculous standards, being a paying player doesn't mean sh%t to bungie."
9496,"fun but you get sucked in for hours lmao.
"
9497,i hate this game.
9498,"After 1005 hours so far I think I know if I enjoy the game or not. Love the social aspect when getting a group together to figure out a raid or get a fireteam together to rock out a dungeon. Not the most user friendly to new players, but once you know the basics a great game."
9499,fun
9500,I LIKE CHEESE
9501,good
9502,reeeee
9503,"To all my chummers,
this game has Action and Adventure, daily bounties, and more but it's more fun with friends.
But for the low cost of free (until you need the DLC)  to play with your friends  is always a good time can be a bit...go to A do B  comeback to a, Maybe get what you wanted did Iron Banner got duplicates of everything but no chest piece and iron banner gone so no armor for you. so take it as it is...ok"
9504,"game stole my job, my house, my family away from me. do not start playing this game unless you wish to destroy your life like i have."
9505,Its still as good as day 1 of its release.
9506,Got rid of alot of content
9507,"This game is excellent. The gunplay is amazing, the voice acting is almost always great, and they deliver new content on a regular basis. I have played on and off for years, which is the best way to enjoy this game."
9508,"It's a beautiful, content-rich shooter sandbox with satisfying gunplay, meaningful build-crafting and plenty of different ways to play. Pick up the newest expansion, hop into the Destiny 2 LFG Discord, and have an awesome time. (Also, make sure to download the companion app on your smartphone, it's endlessly useful)"
9509,"Yeah okay, it's good now."
9510,gg
9511,E
9512,k
9513,great
9514,perrrty good
9515,Great Game
9516,"This game ruined my career, made me cry"
9517,bad
9518,"great game with good graphics
"
9519,"Well well, i blame a friend of mine for me having 80 hours in this game now and i can say for sure that in the future itlll be a lot more.

But now to my review nobody will care ´bout, destiny 2 is probably among my favorite shooters of all time, the general gameplay, the story and the PvP flow incredibly well into each other.
I dont know what it is about the game, but even if im just doing some boring grind for an exotic or am grinding to reach a higher powerlevel for my armor, most of the time i still enjoy every second of doing said tasks.

Destiny is DEFINITELY not a game for everyone, the grind can be hair tearing and the amount of money you have to spend to get all the DLC content (which is basically required the experienced the game at its fullest) is insane [I have to note here that i got all the DLC´s except one by some friends which im very grateful for <3] but even with those things, i still really love this game and will definitely buy the DLC´s coming in the future, even if ill have to sell my liver to even afford them! ;P

Scores: 

Gameplay: 9/10
Story: 10/10
Price: (for the perspective of a new player) 4/10

So i definitely recommend giving this game a shot, but now that you´ll have to do a LOT of grinding and will have to reach deep into your pocket to get the most out of the game."
9520,game sucks
9521,its a great  game
9522,It gut
9523,refund me for deleting the story i bought thx pls
9524,Hate this game.
9525,"it can be fun with friends
"
9526,You know what it is
9527,"BERRY GOOD, YES!!"
9528,"The game is a lot of fun, awesome gameplay, great visuals, good content, skins, dungeons, raids, overall great pve and fun times with friends.
But deleting paid expansions kills it for me... and for that reason I'm out"
9529,wizard on the moon
9530,Its fun but the Expansions cost way to much.
9531,"If game bad, why sexy?"
9532,"How to play Destiny 2
1. Play new Season/DLC
2. Finish Season/DLC
3. Uninstall the game
4. Reinstall when a new Season/DLC drops
5. Repeat"
9533,"This game is doggy doo doo. If i want to have a solid garry good time i have to buy the $520 pack. Do bungie want me to take out a second morage to support their multi million dollar company? I suggest the devs get their money in the gym so it can turn heavyweight. I used to be an avid destiny lover, i argued voer this game with my friends. Now I see that this game is piss poor"
9534,this game makes me wanna kill myself 10/10 would recommend
9535,yes
9536,ok
9537,"youdownload yes??????

"
9538,"in light of recent events i have decided to reword my review due to cancelling capabilities.

This game is very bad but also very good, there is a lot to do and thus is very addicting so if you are currently working or a student do not play or you will become an addict- games like meth ong.

Unless in a pandemic then the game is extra cold, also dont play with the user ""Rao"" on steam he is kinda bad and wa was a lot but mainly cuz he is a sqeaker so bad for raids tbh."
9539,mickey mouse
9540,addictive in a bad way
9541,It's a good game.
9542,worst game ive ever fucking played
9543,eh
9544,Review at 14 hours & 78.4 hours....If you are doing the actual missions with a story it isnt bad. Once you finish the main story its just repeating everything and hoping you get better loot. This game is ok in 3 hour or less blocks. If you arent playing pvp or the main missions its a super dull game at least to me. The customization is really good and creates a lot of options and styles but overall still not really a fan of the game. If it wasnt for friends this is not a game I would wake up and be like ya lets play destiny! Just not my style of game but others really like it.  You need to be in a mood to grind a game. Not a casual game style game just to pass time.
9545,shit game
9546,shit review
9547,"I was a fool to think I could hop in and enjoy this game be prepared to grind just to start getting to the fun bit 
if you got the boys the and you down to clown waste some time and go on a massive grind you too can eventually get to the fun bit maybe 
"
9548,It's just real deadly!
9549,The free to play content is actually really good imo.
9550,this game sucks
9551,I absolutely hate this game. Ruined my life. I have no friends. Destiny takes up too much time
9552,i like how if there are alot of enimes they hord you and you trough a grnade and they all die
9553,"This game is an abusive relationship. You will leave it alone for months at a time, only to come crawling back. Over and over again. 

That said, with a combined playtime of 650+ hours across D1 & D2 (which probably isn't that much for someone who's played since D1 beta), this is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time. 

[spoiler]Warlocks #1[/spoiler]"
9554,"My main peeve, and ultimately why I just can't seem to get back into Destiny 2 after the launch of Shadowkeep, is that the power level system STILL makes no sense whatsoever to a newbie; no explanations as to why it starts at the 1000's.

You may be wondering why I am fixated on this or why this point would even matter. If you're asking the latter then you've obviously already had experience with destiny 2 so just shut the hell up. It's the equivalent of forcefully giving a newbie in an MMORPG a level 70 character when the level cap is 100 and expecting them to fully know what to do and what to unlock at that point in the game. There is no organic growth, players don't feel like their characters are getting better because there is no established metric or a due process through which they can compare them to and improve upon, it's all a jumble - a confused mess of gameplay mechanics which would have worked out - if Bungie didn't delete most of the legacy content to save up on space (though to be fair, the game upon its steam launch was sitting at around 250 gigabytes so I can't complain too much). This is a main point of contention to me and in this review because Destiny 2, at its core, is also a role-playing game. You're playing a character that's living through a story, controlling them and improving them - what's the point of all that when you're instantly at the level 20 cap with the branches unlocked? Nothing, that's what. There isn't a need to play catch-up when the developers just give it to you on a silver platter.

Also what is the point of purchasing past DLC's like forsaken and shadowkeep when you can't even get the previous content to work? I know we needed to reduce the file size for the game but why did Bungie completely phase them out with no hope of accessing them? Aren't we in the era where hard drives are more readily avaialble? Why can't they just allow us to tick a box on/off to enable content in exchange for less space on our hard drive? If you own them you should at least have some access to game modes and content outside of the exotics to their respective DLC's. Bungie really did inherit activision's propensity for pulling anti-consumer stunts like this for the sake of enhancing the FOMO.

At this point I am merely echoing my woes I have aired out through my Shadowkeep review; There is no proper progression system, there is only the battle pass with shallow and insultingly meager rewards for what is a slogfest of an experience. I'd also like to parallel Destiny 2 with Warframe, they're similar in that both games do little in teaching or directing you where to go, but at least Warframe introduced tutorials for some mechanics whereas in Destiny 2, you're simply just thrown into the thick of it with nary a hint and expected to know what to do. They could have had a tutorial section for it - in the form of the base campaign - but then Bungie made the moronic move of removing that too from the game, so they kind of just both themselves and you in the foot

But hey, YoU pLay dEsTiNy 2 FoR tHe RaIdS rIghT, gUyS? Not to play devil's advocate, but Destiny 2 just made alot more sense before its move to Steam. Right now, their mentality to managing the game just seems like the good old 1 step forward, 2 steps back approach to me."
9555,This game slept with my wife and took my kids.
9556,worst game ive ever played
9557,This game at one time showed promise.releasing new content all the time and a free player campaign to wet your feet. Things have changed and they removed the free campaign as well as purchased content off their users. I cannot recommend this game even though the gameplay is good.
9558,bungie i have quit destiny 2 multiple times please stop pulling me back in i want to have my family
9559,ok game i guess
9560,This game is so fun to send time with you're friends in. Its entertaining and the maps and the animations are so cool ESPECIALLY the stories in the game are the best
9561,"good game and fair enough to get the weapon to the next level, so you wont feel desperate to get your kill"
9562,"very colorful and shiny
lots of bang bang boom zap pow boom bap pow
fizz fizz sizzle crackle Caaaaaaaaaaaayde! Noooooooooooooooo!
Bang bang sniffle sniffle bang boom oh no savathun, what do now?
"
9563,very fun
9564,w game
9565,the grind gives me a reason to wake up every day
9566,"Very in-depth gameplay and new content added each season that keeps players coming back. The new weapon crafting system is both fantastic and saddening as these weapons negate the point of farming ""god rolls"" for these weapons in particular."
9567,G
9568,"Other than Bungie jumping on the microtransaction bandwagon, the game is still just as wild as when I played on console. Great visuals, cool abilities, and fun co-op.

Kinda disappointing that you have to buy DLC to make it playable now. It was on sale for free but they stopped supporting stuff from the original storyline so you have to buy DLC to do anything outside of patrols and public events."
9569,Removed my old account which I paid for and also deleted all the free campaigns afterwards. This game is also insanely confusing as a newcomer as it introduces multiple different campaigns at once.
9570,Eventhough the introduction isn't the best the game has tons of free and paid content waoting for you if you have the patience for it. I think it is over all a great game with a lot of variety and many different ways to play.
9571,fun sorta
9572,dogwater
9573,"good game
"
9574,free
9575,Really fun game especially with friends. Only down side is you need the dlcs to get the most out of the game as the base game now is very lacking.

Edit: After another 30 hours I finally figured it out!"
9585,"Destiny is a great solo fps/mmo that can keep you busy for months with PVE and pvp. Its easy to find raid / fireteams if your friends arnt playing or around. 

trials of osris was the best part of the game."
9586,"Genuinely the most fun game ive played, even though I shit on it from time to time, I still come back because nothing else can scratch my gaming itch as good as this game. Even with its flaws Destiny and Destiny 2 are easily my most played games ever, I love the world and I love the gameplay. I adore this game, I have so many memories with this game even as a mostly solo player, keep it up bungie!"
9587,boom!!!!!
9588,"[b]Option A[/b]: Pay £35 for an expansion to get half of the new story content, then £13 every 3 months for the Seasons ([i]that contain the rest of the story and content from the expansion[/i]), for a grand total of £87.

In all seriousness, very enjoyable time i have over 900 hours on xbox."

9594,slightly better but still has its problems

9596,One of the best games to date
9597,fun but a lit-til pay to win

9599,love movemet
9600,Fuck Bungie. Dogshit game. Dogshit company.
9601,
9602,"i hate destiny 2, it's my favorite game."
9603,"this game was made for the average retarded 50 year old that spends his remaining  days farming for meta weapons. 

also it's very interesting how if i use a weapon the enemy literally can't die. if they use the same weapon i die in 1 shot.

also also it's fascinating how in the enemy team there are only pro league champions, regardless of your pvp skills, whilst in my team i land upon the worst of the disabled braindead and pantaloons-shited-cock-eating-diarheea-mouth-stained retards. even blind and people with no arms and legs cand play better than my random teammates.

also also also let's not forget the toxic community. no one is willing to spend some time to help you if you need something, like a difficult quest for an exotic or if you want to complete a raid. if you haven't completed a raid yet, you never will.

in conclusion, every destiny 2 player is a radar that detects unsucked cocks and proceeds to drink every sperm on this planet"
9604,Good game if your an into playing games longer
9605,good game
9606,good game!
9607,very good

9610,well if you ended your life you might have some fun!
9611,Very enjoyable
9612,good game
9613,never play this its horrible
9614,the only bad thing about this game is that it requires dlc's to actually progress proprely
9615,Unless you are willing to drop like 200 dollars this game isnt worth playing f2p
9616,I dont have the dlc's or anything but it's pretty alright
9617,"fun first person shooter does require fast graphics card though 
i would say 4 out of 5 star game"
9618,its very good
9619,....
9620,"Destiny 2 has a lot to offer, both free and paid content. There are so many different things to do, Vanguard, Crucible, Gambit, Campaigns, Dungeons, Raids, various events like Trails of Osiris, Iron Banner, or at this time, the Solstice event. If I'm not in the mood for one game mode, there's so many to choose from, even more than what I've just mentioned. 

What keeps me playing this game is the consistent short term gratification and progression such as doing well in a crucible match or completing a ton of bounties at once AND the long term progression of seeing your light level get higher and higher and expanding your collection of exotics and seeing how they synergize with one another and your build.

Speaking of builds, there are so many different ways to play the game and different builds to shoot for. Despite being a returning player that hasn't played since 2019, after some YouTube videos I was up to speed and understanding all of these new mechanics.

Downsides:

The paid content is overpriced, especially for the content that is rather dated. I understand its F2P now, but holy shit ease up a little bit on the DLC prices. They're outrageous, especially for a returning player coming back seeing that so many rewards and a ton of content is locked behind those paywalls. Bungie needs money, but content from several years ago should be $10.00 max. 

RNG will absolutely wreck you, you're going to get pissed off at how shafted you'll be when you're farming for a certain weapon and it simply won't drop. Or, you only get one weapon to drop over and over again. I dismantled about 25-30 riptides from this weekend. 

Crucible balance or lack thereof: In Crucible, you'll want to try out fun and unique playstyles, but unless you're very skilled, you're going to get stomped by players using meta weapons, armor and builds. I can slap on Knucklehead Radar, Vigilance Wing, Ace of Spades, or other powerful gear and stomp people, but sometimes I want to use off-meta weapons and not get shit on.

Overall, it's a respectable 7/10. I'd argue 8.5-9/10 if the greed wasn't so bad."
9621,"Grind, the game"
9622,"
"
9623,spent years on destiny as a whole why? yes.
9624,"After playing for years and years this game keeps me coming back, if even for a few hours now and then just for the extremely tight game play. More then enough to do, even with the vaulting of content. Only thing I would say is paid for campaigns need to return, if even disconnected from the main narrative for paying customers. I was a little thrown a year or two ago that my paid for DLC was more or less gone. But when I started to think of it more like GW2 or other living world games, it made sense. However, other games do it better without pissing off paying customers that paid for content."
9625,"In the past I've never put real money into a game... until this one!
the community is amazing and so is the game-play!
it's also the first shooter I've liked and its truly amazing!"
9626,"The game is good but the pvp segment is an absolute cess pool. Playing pvp is like driving a truck fool of flaming garbage while the truck itself is also on fire. You have to be either mental or high out of your mind on heavy drugs to call it ""fun""."
9627,First one was great the second one even better.
9628,"+ story, powers, combat, events, raids, gunplay
- grind, stale sometimes, pvp"
9629,Halo pero con poderes
9630,good
9631,"I recommend this game to those who only care about gun-play, movement feel, and grinding loot. If you care at all about the story, why you are wearing that boss' a** as a hat, or the journey the game has taken over the years then I CANNOT recommend this game. That may not sound like a big deal but I guarantee that most people will be discouraged by the sheer scale of content to figure out when they get started.

Like I tell most of my friends, this is the best game that I probably wouldn't recommend to most people."

9651,I hate this game with a burning love.
9652,Good gameplay and microtransactions not necessary to progress at an OK rate.
9653,game crashes way to much lately
9654,"too many dlc but very fun game, d1 better doe"
9655,I love this game but with them shelving everything and still wanting $60.00 for content that you only get a portion of is crazy. The legacy collection is in no way worth $60. The witch queen was a great add on to the story but you can complete it in a couple of days. They added a crafting system that is beyond broken. Raids are fun.... if you can find a group that can stay connected to the game long enough to finish it..... Well that is if you can even find people that want to do raids or even know how. You're going to constantly run into toxic players that don't want to know how to play because they already know how to while causing wipes left and right. If you can find a clan and you're not lucky all your going to do is get to earn clan XP for them while they do end game stuff without you. If you ask they will just ignore you completely or they are beyond rude and say if you don't like it leave. I suggest trying out the F2P version of the game before buying any paid content and judge for yourself because this is just my opinion and you really should stop listening to everyone that has an opinion and make your own.
9656,very snazzy :))
9657,A
9658,fuck minotaurs and ogres.
9659,Makes ur liver healthy
9660,"good game, insanely greedy company"
9661,Shoot n' loot aliens for coins.
9662,i love this game but if i have to buy another dlc i am going to blow my brains out and it will be your fault bungie
9663,good game
9664,this game is fun :)
9665,Still as fun as it was when i first started at launch ^^;
9666,"worst game ever made, play it everyday"
9667,Great game in HDR with amazing visuals and gameplay
9668,ill give it 7 peens out of a 10 man orgy
9669,its fun
9670,Fun until you realize you need to buy expansions very early on. Free to play the first dozen or two hours. Then you need to buy expansions. I played on PS4 for a couple years after release. Fun to play again. PC controls are a bit more difficult. Still enjoyable.
9671,It's a great game tbh but 80 DOLLARS FOR ONE EXPANSION??? WHY????
9672,Nice
9673,very fun its the perfect  challenge not too hard not too easy
9674,gud
9675,If you want  a good semi mmo like shooter game and fine with paying ever now and then then you found your game.
9676,Not a fan of losing access to content i paid for.
9677,great game
9678,"you like it play it, you dont like it dont play it #yourewelcome"
9679,"this 8 year addiction has been a blast, from the good times to the dark ages of destiny 2 vanilla. If you are wanting to come into this looking for a community that is amazing and where you will find people who are also addicts, you have come to the right place. Also just a heads up, this will NOT be a F2P game, first and foremost. This game will be F2P for only a 10th of the game and the best parts are behind expansions. So you will be spending a good chunk of cash. [spoiler] as gamer to gamer you should buy the expansions via key sites which it's alot cheaper, try eneba for example. [/spoiler] If you can get past the dollar tag of this game there is no better experience for this kinda unique genre."
9680,pew pew
9681,awesome.
9682,GOOD
9683,"I feel like my souls is being ripped from my body every time I play this game, that and my wallet."
9684,Shit Game
9685,i love playing destiny 2
9686,"To preface, I have many more hours off of steam. This game was so much fun. I enjoyed the raids, and I didn't mind dropping money on the expansions. I took a break from the game for 2 years, and come back to find all the raids I enjoyed are just... gone. Bungie decided it was a good idea to remove fun content from the game. On top of that, almost all the gear I grinded for in those raids are sunset. Cool decision, remove the content I paid for in only 2 years. Gotta be a new record for ripping your playerbase off"
9687,It's not bad.
9688,good days bad days destiny
9689,Good Stuff
9690,"i hate this game.

4/10 looter shooter as a solo experience
11/10 with friends"
9691,"I hate this game so much, most of the time this game makes me want to throw my PC out of my window and then burn myself... 10/10"
9692,Oga Boga money wasted
9693,good
9694,"A game I wasn't a big fan of in the beginning, but I have found myself playing it a bunch solo. I originally started playing with a group of friends and I still do, but it is not only with them that I am slowly but surely grinding away at this game."
9695,yes
9696,kys
9697,Love Destiny since the beginning.
9698,"If you play this game, then you hate it. If you don't play this game then maybe you'll hate it. 11/10"
9699,its okay
9700,"As everyone has said, good gameplay, gunplay, pvp is a bit broken but hey at least we get pvp at all. 
I don't like how the events force you to grind and are limited to make you feel bad for missing out. 
The old dlcs should be free as they are overpriced.
Story kinda sucks compared to halo imo but game is fun. 
"
9701,"The game is overall fun, both in PVP and PVE although the price of DLC and the near requirement makes it an issue after purchasing at least Forsaken the game is very much enjoyable even with the DLC being quite pricey"
9702,Don't play if you want to touch grass.
9703,Definitely not pay to win
9704,"I've played since D1, the game is frustrating but you don't ever want to stop playing. The goal to grind is endless, there is always something to grind toward. If you're a person who does not have the patience to do the hard work and intense hours of grind then don't play it, but if your that kind of person then welcome to a game where you'll end up hating but enjoying it at the same time. It may sound crazy but many know this feeling. Good luck Guardians"
9705,funn af
9706,It's alright
9707,Magical space wizard
9708,i like it is the best game.
9709,why not
9710,epic adventure game.
9711,This game is very fun but if you want to jump right in and do everything unfortunately you can't but even without the extra DLC content there is a surprising amount of free to play stuff.
9712,good game.
9713,"Destiny 2 bills itself as a free to play game...but in reality if you want full gameplay you have to buy several expansions that are still priced at 100% even the old ones.
Then comes the fact that even some items you buy are then locked away in raids/long grinds that you will need help and a few hours to complete.
The whole Bungie thing is to come up with ways to make you grind for everything at length and make you feel that you risk missing out if you need to take some time away.

I could not recommend this game to a new player unless they want to not have a life and spend a lot of money on something pointless...because it's kinda like deciding to get hooked on drugs because meh why not!"
9714,w game mid players im the greatest
9715,it is nice
9716,
9717,"reminds me of a game called defiance 2042 issa lit
"
9718,ah yes destiny 2 ive been playing destiny 1 and 2 since house of wolves i played on ps4 and in season of dawn i got a pc there have been some rough patches in the destiny lifetime i will say though that if you just play everything the game has to offer you will get burnt out really quickly but from the pvp to the harcore pve the game has treated me very well!
9719,Yes
9720,This is my favorite game. I hate it
9721,Don't

9726,"There is no other game I have sunk this many hours into. I have 4k hours on D1 and 2k on D2 on Xbox and another 1.1 on PC, NOTHING compares to this games raids and high end content"
9727,big brain
9728,"This game is the one i go back to every time another game gets boring. And playing destiny makes me love that other game way more again, cause this blows"
9729,fun with firends
9730,please add sex
9731,I have been playing on console since the D1 beta and have fallen in love with this game story and mechanics.
9732,"There's so much to do in this game with so much variety. Never gets old. Great mix of shooter and RPG elements. There's also an RNG grinding element to the game that's not too punishing (think stats on items in Diablo), but you can min/max if that's what you're into. Finally, if you want to take it easy, there's faceroll content, but if you want a challenge, there's plenty of that, too.  Can't recommend Destiny 2 enough!"
9733,"Game has a lot to do. A nice community when they aren't toxic, etc."
9734,"I enjoy Destiny 2, The overall look with the class gear, and all the different types of ships you can obtain, is what I love the most."
9735,yessir
9736,The game is absolutely stunning. It's worth every cent.
9737,Amazing Game!
9738,Its cool or whatever
9739,"destiny has always been a wicked game, one of if not my all time favourite."
9740,"Entirely too much FOMO.  Although the story did finally begin to get very interesting, it does not help the fact that everything is linked to FOMO.  They want to call themselves a MMORPG yet they lock everything behind FOMO without any way to make up for lost time or do older content.  They CONTINUOUSLY remove content, its almost pathetic to even think of them as a MMORPG.

Basically, if you aren't playing this game weekly you will get behind.   You will lose opportunities for great guns, titles, or even armor.  There is no redemption factor for any of these things either.. not even the cash shop which is surprising.  You would think they had the brains to make past season rewards available via Silver purchases, but no, the FOMO business model sustains and its awful.  

The community is interesting, not many people are aware of how easy content is & refuse to help newer players on things that don't require much brain power to begin with.  Killing adds in a new raid would be a prime example as all encounters were designed to be made for every player to complete.  The community however isn't intelligent enough to grasp this.  Although I have carried many people through newer raid content, I have found more groups removing people over helping and its quite sad.  Because you know, for their micro brain its too hard to tell somebody to stand here, shoot this, don't shoot that, don't stand there, etc.. 

As for the Pvp, if you like cheesy trashy Pvp then it may be for you.  Hand cannons have been meta since launch & special 1 hit cheesy KOs have been a staple on Pvp since year 1 of D2.  Equip Chaperone, throw on a controller w/ Last word or any sniper and aim assist will carry you to victory in a vast majority of fire fights.  The micro brain will just say git gud, but in reality everyone is good w/ the right load out.  My Timelost Fatebringer & Timelost Found Verdict have done their duty... its time to rest.

After all this time I should have quit sooner, but here we are.  Better late than never I suppose, & just when the story was really getting good.  Its a damn shame.  I'm actually sad by this decision..  I hate Destiny, it was my favorite game..I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't miss my Titan & Warlock.  F*** Hunters (they were fun in Pve the past two seasons tho)

Over 1000 hours in on PC, & around the same if not more on console I can safely make this review with no remorse.  It is what it is, and of course people will call me crazy.  They're in denial, and its okay.  How you waste your time is entirely up to you.  You must do what you feel is right, of course."
9741,"its fun :)
"
9742,"I have always love this game since the 1st time it tried it. Loving 1st person shooters, Destiny 1 and 2 are gem's with its futuristic taste and its different type of builds when playing with freinds. its an A+ for me"

9750,"very good, too much grind tho"
9751,"If you like repetitive content (really repetitive - being essentially forced into doing the exact same thing over and over and over) and you like slow load times, slow UI, just general slow and laggy behavior then this is the game for you! It has great artwork, good music and sound effects so I will give it that. PvP has no balancing whatsoever. They keep making you think they will change but they do not... it is just a skinner machine disguised as a game with a slow trickle of new content and the same formula lazily applied over and over."
9752,pain just pain

9759,"Очень любил эту игру, даже несмотря на политику банджи, однако недавнее лицемерие после заявлений ""Дестини - игра для всех"" поставило точку на возможности возвращения в эту доильню. Жаль, что, при всех своих либеральных высказываниях, разработчики приняли решение огородить жителей некоторых стран от покупки, да даже просмотра страниц дополнений (без которых эта игра вообще теряет всякий смысл).

9777,"After playing the beta for the first game, I knew something special was in the making. Upon first release in 2014, my intuition was proven right. Futuristic settings, science fiction, alien invaders and super-powered humans/turbo-humans/war machines. It certainly checked off all the boxes for me.

Times were simpler then, when the biggest of our problems were the local Fallen Houses clawing away at the walls of the Last City. Or, the time when we traveled deep into the rusted ruins of Old Russia and reawakened the dormant Hive abominations. Or perhaps, our first encounters with the Vex on Venus, or the Cabal Sand-Eaters on Mars. We didn't have to worry about Worm Gods or Taken Kings. Only Man, and their local threats.

Destiny 2, however, has taken all we've ever known, and flipped it upside-down. What started as a simple story of reclaiming our solar system evolved into a battle of cosmic proportions. From our very powers being stolen from us, to the brothers and sisters of our oldest enemies seeking shelter in the last safe city that we call home. Nothing from before has remained as it is, and we are collectively made stronger for it.

But just as our influence in the system grows, so too, does the presence of our greatest enemy: the Darkness. It approaches us frequently, olive branch in one hand, poisoned blade in the other. The forces of Darkness intend to give us a window into the true nature of our existence, and emphasizes the secrecy of the Light we were resurrected with. Our very source of power, which works in opposition to the Darkness, is called into question by the only presence in all existence capable of comprehending it. In these times, trust in our Traveler wears thin, while Darkness is being retooled into a brand-new power for us to exploit from within.

We will not give up hope, however. Many of us pray that when the veritable End of All Things approaches, the Traveler will make it's move. In that decisive moment, truths may yet be revealed about our patron Sphere, as well as our place in the Cosmic Game. Until then, the Final Shape shall remain obscure to our clouded vision.

Eyes up, Guardian."
9778,"One of the best FPS and Loot Shooters I've ever played. Have been playing since Destiny 1 launch, then again with Destiny 2 launch. Love all the diversity in the weapons, armour, shaders, crafting, accessories and emotes... and this game still has one of the most fluid combat / specials gameplay systems along with awesome drop in / drop out multiplayer for those who love PvE. PvP is also very cool :)"
9779,buy to plau wow nies geam

9787,"I had Destiny on my PS, but I had to sell it and now I'm not playing it, because of that. 
I started to play it when I was 4 years old. The game shocked me then, because it was the coolest game I ever played. 
The game has awesome graphics and it's free!"
9788,fd
9789,i hate how i like playing it

9798,no
9799,i fly in ship:)
9800,"-Gameplay addictive
-Graphics are good
-Excellent movement that feels intuitive
For the most part the game is amazing, but the one downside being the amount of grinding (which can be challenging and fun) is easy to get brunt out of, I played this game here and there with friends so as to not get burnt out of it. The movement feels amazing.
Tip: Got to the Eververse Store, click on the box icon, go to page to, and click on the ""Year 1 Shader Bundle"", it is really cheap and you get a lot of shaders from it. [b]Don't forget to open it in your inventory![/b]"
9801,game good.
9802,"this game just isnt fun for new players to get into, and the battle pass is a fucking joke... gotta love the bullshit of battle passes that you have to fully buy every time and cant earn the next one"
9803,what is the bright light coming through my window
9804,it's a game
9805,This game can bring a lot of technical issues. I have an NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU and i have ran into nothing but problems with this title i do enjoy the game but i will not be returning to this title after finding out how many flaws it has. With it's poor performance on my PC.
9806,Brrrt! Brrrt!
9807,"hell yes gimme that sivussy
"
9808,"This is a very fun game. It's better played with other people or in a group but can certainly be played solo, it's free-to-play to some extent. The endgame content is locked until you pay for it through DLC's or Season Passes. It has a variety of different activities with different group sizes. These include Raids (6 people), Strikes (3 people), PvP (some modes are 3v3 some are 6v6), and Gambit (4v4 PvP/PvE activity). Endgame content is challenging and will test your teams cooperation together to beat it. It's a very grind-heavy game so if that's something you enjoy, I would recommend this game for you."
9809,"Look just play it to mindlessly kill things for a few hours that will feel like 30 minutes, if you play it to actually grind for one exotic for 50+ runs seek help you mental patient (I was lowkey that mental patient)"
9810,fun
9811,Fun!
9812,no
9813,"I poured my life and my lives savings into this game, it was not enough"
9814,space guns are cool
9815,idk whats going on. lots of stuff to do but u dont gotta know everything to enjoy playing crucible
9816,if i could get a hold of you id bash your fucking head into the wall
9817,Its got its flaws. But its fun. Just like me. And just like you.
9818,no
9819,guns go shoot
9820,"while this game is fun at times, once you step back and look at the content and how the game treats new players, the cracks really start to show, its a game that you can very easily get burned out on, its the same enemies, same mechanics, and same maps for pvp. the balancing for weapons is always iffy but they do make changes to try and fix it so credit where credit is due. As for the campaign to this game its very solid, but if you are a new player you are thrown into the middle of a story with no ability to get caught up on what is happening. this game is the definition of i don't know who i am all i know is i must kill. there is no learning how mods, stats or weapon perks work in this game. Bungie relies on older players to teach new players the lore, rules, and basically everything about the game cause there is no way for new players to be invested. Now for the older players in this game, we would all say yeah we love destiny just cause we know whats going on and what to do. so i can't recommend this game to new players."
9821,was good before the vault messed everything up...
9822,i recommend this to all the players
9823,mmmm
9824,"Until they fix the asinine mod system I do not recommend this to a new player.

Every recent and 'most op' build video requires mods that a new player simply does not have access too. ""Well work on unlocking them"" you say. You want to know how to unlock the most important mods for most builds? 

Every day Ada, a vendor will sell four mods, there is no duplication detection or anything like that. So she might be selling 1-4 mods you already own. To get the mods you want you just need to check everyday and hope, luckily they are the same for everyone so you can just watch someones 'PSA' video to see if mods you want are there.

I would love to be able to go solo some of the content like people do in these videos, but I dont have any well mods, so I have no idea on where to start or if its even possible with out them.

I enjoy the game, but the more I play the less I want to play because I cant play how I would like too.

I would mention the story but its been gutted, think of it like sitting down to start watching a movie thats two thirds over, it looks good seems interesting, but you missed the super important parts."
9825,space magic and guns. its a grind but worth it.
9826,o9iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
9827,ALRIGHT
9828,everything but the story
9829,It fun
9830,good
9831,"Is it a well made game with a fun, long lasting, and groundbreaking bunch of campaigns? No.
Does it have a good community? 60% are good but the rest are atrocious.
is the pvp balanced? thats funny.
well does it have a good story? yeah, some of the lore can miss though.
is it over all a good way to spend my free time? Not unless you have a lot of it.
"
9832,"it is an amazing game! if you are new to the game I would suggest playing the first one to understand the lore and everything else that is going on. Their is plenty of content for new players, and a lot of amazing guns and also very customizable. Two things I do not like is the amount of content they removed, so now new players can't play it or current players, the second thing is that it doesn't seem that the creators listen to the players and what they want in the game but, after that it is a very good game
"
9833,pay wall otherwise same game as warframe
9834,"Good game, Bad company.

That DLC content you paid for?  They removed it from the game!
That equipment that you grind to get? Can't use it on new content! You have to buy the new DLC!
Did all that grinding and the quest bugs and is gone? To bad. There's no way to fix it.
Those items that only come from that quest? Never going to get them!
Want to create a ticket to get support with bugs? You can't! Bungie has no support options!"
9835,great game lot of fun things
9836,"the game is good as long as you avoid crucible (it's filled to the brim with sweaty loser that need to get a life or play a different game for once). the base game gets pretty boring after a while though, and you need to buy the ""dlcs"" if you want to continue the story. But I'd still recommend it."
9837,I guess
9838,fun game to play with friends.
9839,"The original story is not even in the game anymore. You get thrown into the middle of this gigantic campaign with no idea what’s going on, what to do, or even and way to play previous campaigns to get caught up. The worst part is that all the previous campaigns are considered paid DLC that you can’t even access. If you enjoy losing your paid content this game is for you otherwise, do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time or money on this trash of a company that is just in this for your money."
9840,"It's a good game, had fun with my friends over the years. Will keep playing it."
9841,its the bees knees freal freal
9842,"after finally getting the basics of the game, I'd say its a pretty good 

realistically, its fun both pve and pvp, but the seasonal champions can get a bit boring of a mechanic to deal with. Some descriptions are rather unclear (eg weapon perks), so you have to know where to find the information. pvp can get a bit frustrating at times, and it would be nice to receive some more maps."

9861,"Look how far Bungie has fallen. Every single aspect of this game is broken and buggy. It's such a shame because the moment to moment gameplay is so good! Bungie's greed and poor attitude have ruined what could have been a fun experience. I'm convinced that the only way one could enjoy this game is if they've already played from the very beginning. In 2022, the new player experience has been completely ruined and paid content has been removed from the game. To reiterate, content that players have paid real world money for has been removed! I wish so badly that this game could just be good because the gameplay is so fun."

9875,the game was one of the best pc games I have ever played. It has PVP and PvE. I 100% recommend
9876,This game is so bad only for the reason that I have friend that is overly obsessed with this fuck shit game.
9877,It can be frustrating at times but it is a very fun game
9878,10/10 would smash.
9879,"I've played the game Destiny when it first launched on Xbox 360 and continued after purchasing my first console when Taken King came out. Even after Bungie created Destiny II, I've continued to play this game and after all the good and bad that it's shown me over the years; this is still something I'd recommend for everyone to play for themselves."
9880,Fantastic Game!
9881,bad game :( i struggle with addiction
9882,good game
9883,help

9885,Great Game!

9887,Hands down a BIG money pit but 100/10 would play again
9888,"I have been playing since Destiny 1 year one and the entire buildup of the story line has been one hell of a fun ride! For the newer players hopping in, I would ask that you look into some of the lore from Youtube's ""My Name Is Byf"" to get a more in depth look into the plot. There is always room to improve and thousands of different builds and skills to work with. I personally like the mix of pve and pvp but i tend to steer more towards the pve aspect for the story. Keep it up Bungie! Now with Sony at your side, i cant wait to see what youll do next!!"
9889,"This game is wonderful. I love playing it, but I highly recommend not playing it if you do not meet the required graphics. It is a pain to play while lagging. Also, the melee registration is extremely broken."
9890,i hate this game
9891,a fuckin plus
9892,i like the guy in that collab with star wars name obi JUAN kenobi
9893,Hands down one of the best games of all time
9894,"best gunplay ina game ever by a lot 
"
9895,"I love a game that you have to grind. While I tend to get burned out quickly by sinking a huge amount of hours in at the start. Destiny has kept me coming back with the lore, raids/dugeons, and ease of getting in to a group for some games. I enjoy it, while still acknowledging it's not perfect. But what is? nothing i've ever played. To me it's the perfect looter shooter, i do wish it could implement some more rpg elements, to help make characters feel more your own. But i do love just grinding away with youtube on or while hanging out on a discord chat."
9896,COOL
9897,Best game ever!

9900,great looter shooter! I would recommend this to anyone who are fans of borderlands/rpgs
9901,It is very fun and there is so many things to collect and do! I like the game :)
9902,cooool
9903,Solid game but in between seasons it's dry. keep that in mind. It never ceases to come back with more content and better content but it will always have a cycle.

9912,Great game!
9913,My favorite game! I don't play anything else!
9914,lit
9915,good gam
9916,"Ive been playing destiny since the release of the first beta for destiny 1. Amazing visuals, amazing people to meet from LFGs and the excess amount of content for any NEW players. Destiny has been going strong since September 9, 2014 and all the so called ""destiny killers"" still hasnt lived up to their expectations. Give the game a shot. Its free to play, and if you do enjoy it, you could buy the dlcs."
9917,its like hell
9918,Play it
9919,"I hate myself after playing this game, Its one of my favorite games that I've ever played 10/10"
9920,its a good game if you're willing to throw $200 at the game and not feel horrible and have the time to get your moneys worth
9921,...

9929,yes
9930,"It's like that ex that you go back to every time at 2 am when you are drunk and eating taco bell, because they are also drunk and eating taco bell, but they don't drink baja blast, which you know is a bad thing, but at the same time, they are the person you know who is awake at 2 am, drunk and eating taco bell. Even though they are flawed, and completely wrong for not drinking baja blast, you bite the bullet and still play destiny. I hate that I love this game so much."
9931,"eh good game but gets boring sometimes

9932,تحملها اول اسبوع وبتتحملك سنين
9933,definitely a game
9934,cool
9935,"Great feedback loop. Progressing in the game makes you feel more and more unstoppable. Wish the loot was a bit better, but their model makes sense."
9936,Crucible is fun
9937,Great game best ever played.
9938,"Do you want to waste away into nothingness? Are you looking for something to grind other than Runescape? This is it. PvP can be fun, sometimes, Vanguard Operations is fun, and a weekly raid or two with your friends can actually be some of the most fun to have in a video game. Just don't touch Gambit. :)"
9939,100 thumbs down
9940,spacegliding
9941,great for dealing with anger issues especially when you have one more round until flawless in trials and your team hates you 10/10 would break again
9942,good game
9943,i love being space pirate.
9944,Cross save/play  is a neat thing.. It's a shame you are forced to pay twice to play the D2 DLC's on XBOX X coming from PC Steam..
9945,"iisss goood, play with friends if you can. the only franchise that continues to update and do more."
9946,"companies a bit greedy, good game tho"
9947,Any story this game had was removed.  New content refers to elements that were removed and nothing coherent is left for a new player.  Grind and milk the remaining player base is Bungie's direction for this game.
9948,Very fun game to grind on. The only complaint that I have is the new dungeon is very glitched.
9949,"fun game 
"
9950,good fast playing game good gaming community
9951,yes
9952,good game
9953,It is not bad. The gameplay is really good. It is a pain to get items some times and there is no way to know what iterms you are getting from special enemies. It isn't amazing or bad. It has good stuff and bad stuff.
9954,hard to understand the story but great game overall
9955,Gameplay is really good
9956,On release Destiny 2 was alright. I quit playing after about 20 hours due to content feeling repetitive. I came back during the Witch Queen expansion and HOLY COW is it good! There is so much to do and the campaign is amazing. Highly recommend!
9957,"its a really fun game, enjoying it to this day"
9958,"This game stole my social life, made me fail half my classes, and made me forget the color of grass. I absolutely hate this game.

9969,"This game will make you send 200 plus dollars to get all the expansions to have content to make the game fun. If you are a new player and don't want to dump a few hundred dollars just to get the expansions the game is not worth it. On the other hand if you do want to spend the money the game is great. Even when the crucible is the most aids thing I have ever played in my gaming history. Overall, if your looking for a new game destiny 2 is worth a try."
9970,not really
9971,Great game but not beginner friendly at all I felt like
9972,"if destiny has taught me one thing, it is that you can absolutely hate your favorite game."
9973,"Keep getting Error CAT. I have all the DLC installed. 
FIx your shit.

No, i won't recommend this game."
9974,"At the beginning its a little complex to understand the game hub, dynamics and how the content for the game works; but after you get the hang of it its a master piece of a game. Bungie never dissapoints with their creations. I would like that the game included more activities for the past content so that previous weapons, armour, etc... becomes available, because some of this content isnt reacheble to obtain at the moment because the seasons or game activities are over. One important aspect to improve is the availability to play with other players on dungeons or raid activities, because if you dont have friends to play or a clan with several players it is nearly impossible to complete this activities on SOLO (if you use the option beta raids, you can stay several hours waiting for more expirienced players to adopt you and play the raids, which almost never happens because no one uses this option) so, you either have friends to play with or this activities arent available for you. The PVP has improved drastically and the game content is awesome, even if some players consider DESTINY not being a PVP, you are wrong, currently it is one of the best PVPs; it is just a very fast PVP that once your eye adjusts to it you will have a lot of fun and well anger sometimes because of the challenge some players will be. The different classes in game give that personal touch to how and what type of a player you are and how you use them on PVP and PVE. weapons & armour skins are very well made, just spectacular from the point of view of first person. I would like to add a particular point for a specific in game class; As a main HUNTER character :) (which I love) sometimes you feel that the power disadvantage compared with othe classes feels off; maybe if the hunter had an extra jump or some other power advantage like 2 shots while invisible before going visible again, would be nice (I could go into details on how to improve it, but I will leave my thoughts on the topic for another time, if there was a hunter exotic that allowed to use 2 exotics at the same time, either weapons or armour it would be amazing, but I understand it is almost impossible, if for some reason its possible please let me name it jaja). Once again the game is outstanding and I hope more content comes out. Destiny is the type of game that once you start you just cant let go of it, every update just makes the game better and better and the story line is very intresting, mysterious and intriguing. Thank you Bungie, you are a piece of a very fond memory of my childhood and continue to do so today (dont know if I wrote that good but you get feeling jaja)."
9975,"This story is truly amazing. Lore for days and days. Very easy to get adjusted to playing on either keyboard//mouse or controller. DON'T LET HIGH STATS OR GOD ROLLS SHAKE YOU.  That's just icing on this cake. Anyone can play and you will have so many opportunities to earn rewards, gear, weapons, and more. If you ever feel like single player doesn't cut it, join a clan of like-minded players. Helps grind and earn more rewards. But most of all, just have fun! Don't let sweaties or other ruin what is a fun game. PVP is a mess, but all PVP is messy."
9976,It so hard to describe how much I love this game. This is easily one of the best games in the past decade and one of the worst games in the past decade rolled into one. This game gives hours of fun and hours of depressing thoughts at the same time. So if you want to have a new favorite game that makes you question why you are even playing it every time you load up this is for you.
9977,"This game is deep and well developed, of course just like any AAA game has its flaws. However after playing destiny since Destiny 1 the story, the game play, the content has been fun and great. Play it and give it time, find some friends to play and maybe a clan and the game will be fun and great to play. Even for solo players like me its been fun and a blast."

9981,fun

9983,started on xbox and made the switch
9984,"The best First Person Slot Machine you'll ever find. This game is a field trip through RNG dynamics, with your psychology being constantly abused to make you think you're achieving things in life. The basic model is not bad at its heart. But, with as many seasons, DLCs, special events, etc ALL REQUIRING MORE MONEY TO ACCESS... that's where they screwed up.

Bungie doesn't deserve to have any more money. I highly recommend no one start playing this game. It will seem like it's fun, but it will really just turn into a weekly chore that gives you dopamine. It's not fulfilling, it just appeals to the completionist in me. It will cost you more than a $100 to access everything that is on the destination menu. And even then, they will sporadically remove some items every 3 months, add new ones, etc. That is, if the servers are working. That's a very big IF. Sometimes, they are just down, and your $100 dollar game is completely inaccessible, which is really neat.

All PVP encounters are totally bust, as they never stop changing the meta. You just have to google what the most effective weapons are, and try to keep up with what all the pros are doing. 
Did I say pros? I meant people who paid more money than you, because now you can outright purchase exotics and better gear, so it's effectively a Pay to Win experience in PVP. Again, just a chore to get through if you're not already high ranked and stacked out with raid gear. Almost everyone will have years of progress on you. 
Even then, if you are very skilled and know the maps well, and play well with a team, the ultimate Destiny PVP goal is to play as dirty as is humanly possible, so it doesn't matter how much skill you have when you get destroyed by a heat seeking fusion rifle bullet from across the map. The only way the PVP combat could be any more unsportsmanlike is if they allowed biting and nut-shots. Everything else goes.

In all fairness, I'm going to keep playing it. I'm literally addicted, and I paid way too much got dang money to not get my value out of it. 
My plea to anyone reading this: just don't start, don't bother getting involved in this mess. There are simply much better games out there, don't give these crooks your money like I did."

9999,"помойка еще та, но интересно"
10000,"I have been playing destiny 2 for over a month now, and I have very much enjoyed the game. The base game, while limited in its campaigns, has enjoyable content such as nightfalls, and crucible. I say limited in it's campaigns, because most of them are locked behind expansions and season passes. A large portion of it's content is locked behind paywalls, including some of the top meta weapons, so if you plan on being f2p, you will be a bit behind. Not enough to destroy your enjoyment, but it may annoy you from time to time. Overall, the base gameplay is fun. Complex enough to be interesting, but not too overwhelming for new players. I would absolutely recommend playing this game, but I warn you to expect the occasional dissapointment."
10001,h.j
10002,"This game is really fun especially if you have friends to play it with. If you dont have friends, thats fine too. The PvE community isnt very toxic but there will always be that bunch. Just try it and if you dont like it thats fine too. its free to start the game so your starting investment is quite small. The service model is also not terrible by any means. as long as you manage to hop on for a few hours a week you will be able to keep up and fully unlcok each item of the passes and DLC. The game also has a very intuitive build crafting system which isnt very complicated by any means leading you to be able to make a build that caters to your play style. Overall the game is a blast and I would 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time!"

10023,GOAT minus PVP
10024,"Destiny is the game that you hate to love.  I don't mean that as harshly as it sounds.  It will eat time like nothing other.  There are endless builds.  Endless power and weapon grinds.  There are lulls when you finish seasonal story content, but there are triumphs to chase.  Trials cards to complete.  Grand Master Nightfalls to gear up for and grind adept weapons.  On top of all that, there is a massive community of unique and interesting guardians with a lot of streamers and content creators.  I hate to love this game because of the time sink I put into it, but I just can't get away from it."
10025,"Been playing since D1 launch and even though it has its dry times, and unbalanced metas, I've never loved a series like I do Destiny."
10026,"Listen, this game is one that you can have good fun for maybe 10-20 hours if you play by yourself and just want to feel cool shooting a gun, but if you can put in the time it can become something much more. The amount of people in this community who are here to help others and help you get better at the game is staggering, and going on lfg to find raid groups has lead me to find a group of friend I play with to this day, even on other games. This is one of those games that changes you as you play it, not by its story or game play, but with the cooperation with others that it promotes. give it a try, and maybe, just maybe this game will change you."
10027,good game

10045,"Destiny 2 is an amazing game, that I actually encourage you to try out for yourself. So why is the review negative? Because the game sucks. In it's current state, crucible is an absolute nightmare that rewards people who spend their life playing this game, and punishes those who can't. That's obviously kind of what happens in a game that involves farming for weapons and pvp, but it's to the point where if you don't have the current meta weapons godroll (Specific roll that can make a gun twice as good) then you end up suffering the consequences by dying to it over and over and over and over again. Definitely a good game, but it currently has some massive kinks it needs to work out"

10068,Great game with beautiful graphics and story. Great for playing with friends or even yourself.
10069,"Fun, bit of a learning curve, mission flow is disjointed, quests become confusing, lots of overlap and peculiarities.  No hand holding here but once you get into it, good times to be had.  Also if your not willing to through some ""Happy Meal"" funds $$$$ at it, you'll be less satisfied IMHO."
10070,Game is not perfect but no game is. For a game that is kinda Pay to Win I'll recommend it becouse of amazing community. If you are looking for a game that you can commit to Destiny is a good choice.
10071,"highly recommend this game to anyone, lots to do."
10072,love this game love how they brought  vault of glass in here from destiny 1 if you like looters and shooters and just wanna have fun with friedns i avice getting it BUT a huge downside is the price of DLC's 87pounds for witch queen deluxe edition + 30th aniversary expansion so its quite pricey for a FTP game so if the dlcs were cheaper i feel like the play base will be more happy wbecause not many people have that amount of money to pay for these dlcs

10085,"(the 41hrs played only represents PC playing, I started D2 on PSN at launch and played a lot on xbox once cross save came out)

First the dislikes: RNG and the grind. it can get tedious and if you're a solo player not everything is achievable.
What I do like: loudouts and cooperative content. Playing with friends is always fun and there's a good amount of content for duo, trio, or six man content. The abilities have gotten better in the new 3.0 and even non-exotic weapons can feel fun to use."
10086,"wonderful questing loot-shooter, FPS diablo/borderlands glory child , beautiful landscapes, so many weapons and armor, so many build options, and a lot of fun! TONS of stuff to do. takes a little bit to get into. once you get through the learning curve, its an absolute BLAST!"
10087,yes
10088,good game
10089,game good.
10090,This game is fun if you like having no life <3
10091,game is still fun after 100 hrs of playing especially when you have a great clan
10092,"Destiny 2 has a great story, and the graphics are pretty good. Gunplay is really fun and the level of customization (provided you're willing to pay) is really insane. I've had so much fun playing this game with my friends, but unfortunately if you're looking to jump into the game for the first time I can't say I'd recommend it for a number of reasons: 
1) the new player experience is abysmal. You will be thrown into a world with little to no explanation on how to do anything beyond the most basic activities, and no story characters will be introduced. You gotta just assume what's happened in the past, or watch an extremely long video that recaps all the previous expansions and seasons just to understand who a particular character is and why they are bad.
2) Some of the previous expansions and storylines have been removed from the game yet the DLC is still up for sale (Forsaken).
3)PvP is kinda whack, isn't balanced well at all, and is extremely meta driven. Recommend staying in PvE if you value your sanity.
4) Once you hit the power cap there's nothing to do. Right now the season still has like 30-40 days left and there's no story being updated weekly. It's a massive grind period and if grinding isn't your type of run stay away. Once the seasonal story ends you will spend hours every week replaying the same missions and dungeons over and over again for the chance of better loot. I'm not at the power cap but I still cant get armor that is stronger than what I have, so there's nothing for me to do as the concept of grinding forever to possibly get a stronger piece of armor isn't appealing.

If you have a friend who plays Destiny and you want to get into it with them, by all means! It's a lot easier to understand how the game works and understand the story better when you're playing with someone who's been around for a while. If you're planning on mostly playing solo, then I really do not recommend unless you are fine with being confused about the story and gameplay elements or you like watching 3 hour videos explaining the lore."
10093,"great game
"
10094,10/10 game. must have friends to have an enjoyable experience
10095,trash game thats why i still play it
10096,Very fun and good for free to play players
10097,its great
10098,Dope. Just wish there was more LFG or party finding tools in game rather than having to use discord or third party websites.
10099,Love this game have been playing it since D1
10100,"incredible RPG game to play with friends and has a lot of content to run through, might be pricey with the DLC content but you eventually get your moneys worth if you enjoy the game and playing with friends."
10101,"Honestly this comment cant show how much I love this game. It has it all, PvP, PvE, a great story, amazing music, stunning maps/backdrops, and overall fun mechanics. Yes, the game can seem kinda slow when starting out as a new light, but trust me its all worth it."
10102,"I've rarely seen a game with such amazing graphics. It's so well optimized it's insane.
I have yet to play good content but for what I've seen, it's pretty chill and cool game :)

10122,really neat
10123,"This is stockholm syndrome at it's best, I love it."
10124,this is a sci-fi novel of epic scale in disguise of an FPS game.
10125,"So... I've played this game for 2 days and I'm already at ca. 21 hours. No afk time whatsoever. 

Pretty sure that speaks for itself. Great game and can already say, very grindy BUT it's hot outside and I have all summer to hide from the sun so that's what I'm gonna do. Grind.
[i] Not planning on stop doing that after summer's over [/i]


I know I'll end up like everyone else here that wrote a review, with thousands of hours in this game.

Hadn't had that much fun with a game for a long time. 

I love Destiny. Great movement, great game mechanics and it's clear what you have to do, even for beginners like me.

[i] If anyone wants to play with me, add me! Always on the search for people to play with. (: [/i]"

10134,this is a good good game
10135,fun
10136,good game and whatnot
10137,"Bias Opinion: I very much enjoyed Destiny 1. Besides the Content being a hit or miss when it comes to storyline, the game play is smooth, and they have improved quiet a bit with customization, and personalization with your Character."
10138,"Very fun and addicting MMO RPG with looter shooter gameplay. The difference between the hours I have on my most played game, Destiny 2, and second most played game is 887 hours, so I think that backs up the fun and addicting claim lmao. Lots to learn but once you learn it it pays off and adds to the fun."
10139,great game with tons of content
10140,MONEY
10141,this game is a love hate relationship
10142,i hate Destiny 2. It's my favorite game.
10143,been playing since destiny 1 beta and ive fallen in love with this game. ive grown up with it ill probably always play it to some degree
10144,its ok
10145,gud game with just a few obvious issues
10146,"OK game, but a few issues have frustrated me to the point of giving up
1) Unclear explanation of goals and objectives.  This was not a problem with the original Destiny 2, which gave me many hours of good gaming.  But the add-on packs and adventures are disjointed, and lack any clear frame of reference.  I should not have to search the Internet for basic instructions on gameplay.  The game should provide these.
2) Constant outages, including many (such as today) that are outside of the stated maintenance window

I give up!"
10147,its good
10148,"destiny is like the gun game version of wow but they ruin pvp by allowing no skill guns such as shotguns in pvp on top of that the warlock is a user of solid pure power they should have two grenade and melees as should the hunter we are missing a super from our class which is unfair on top of that both warlock and hunter deserve a shield/barrier option more melee options it makes since for all classes to have a melee that can be fired reason behind this logic is we are powered by the light lets hope they do not ruin the arc subclass with arc 3.0 the fragment system is flawed and there needs to be sets that are worthy of being called legendary and exotic void 3.o needs more fragment to put on and more then two of the other fragment or aspects and to add to dark and light add wind earth and stasis version of solar void and arc duel wielding would also be a much welcomed change make auto fire a perk that is on ALL weapons because the wear and tear is unfair to us and makes it look like it is being done on purpose upgrade module need to drop with our weekly missions as well on top of that sparrows need a speed boost and weapons as well and raids absolutely need to be match making i am a d1 player got it on release  and there are so many raids i have not been able to do because of this fatal flaw and i most likely will not be able to do the current ones because of this mistake not everyone has friends and it is not easy to make them in this day and age only the CURRENT generation would know what i am talking about but no one considers the disable group which is a very large portion of all games population and that is not counting the squeaker squad also a trade option is well over due and should be put in put actual things we want in the bright dust store not GARBAGE reduce the cost of prism 
 that is to damn expansive and increase the amount of legendary shards we get from missions and dismantling weapons and armor also NO MORE BLUE ENGRAMS after you reach max level anything less then a legendary is trash and wasting our LIMITED time on this planet some of us our time is shorter then yours and it may be shown through actions that you do not care but we do matter as people and a fan of a new generation of gaming make the races we pick have perks to help us give us a daily log in along with keeping the season bonus ad a skill tree to give us bonus passive abilities sldo please bring back our ammo synth we would love you for this and 3 of coins you could add a class that uses pure light and stasis warlock can get staves cast with hands along with artifact equipped and can summon elemental to fight so will the hunter and titan add battle pets in with it make glyph and rune powers for all of them titans can use martial arts combined with light or stasis also triple jump needs to actually be triple jump your first basic jump does not count because it is a normal none light infused jump the hunter can throw different Kunais or shuriken and windmill shuriken not to mention using scrolls for summoning teleporting healing or damage or sealing and there is different kinds of sealing for example you open a seal aka use the ability and capture and on coming attack and can store it forever no time limit and no that s not op that is basic and then release it back at them then or at somone else later or seal a super that was cast ofc there would be a limit with this and once used then there would be a cooldown but not in pve  the warlock can also use scyths as it would suit them titan can use there fist to send out punches infused with ligh solar arc or stasis and have different combat forms and martial arts to learn and use expanding the game sso much more and all classes would still be able to hold there own against a gun user on top of that something needs to be done about the ppl not focusing on the objective in crucible like rift or control after so long if there just killig they need to be kicked and banned for 3 hour from crucible until they can show they can learn and stop screwing everyone else the same  needs to be done if they do not get revives in both pvp and pve on top of the iron banner it was very inconsiderate to make anyone wait 10 slow seconds 3 is more then enough and ill actualy be able to defend the spark who would have thought lol and stop with spawning us way away from the defend zone because that fs things up a lot and please no more nerfs we need buffs the squeaker squad are the ones wining so why listen to them instead of the adults make a d2 servers for all ages below 18 that way we never have to worry about the squeaker squad again and our long live torture will be over finally a simple age verify will fix this plus dont anounce it like a sod and just do it and all will be well other then that i have aton more but i doubt i will see any actions that will show you care or listen to us but for what its worth i love d2 and d1 i met my best friend on d1 back in the good ole rumble days where you can join as a team and just have some fun we both got into it and wound up wiping out everyone in the match that got in our way just so we could hunt one another and thus a friendship was fordge in the rumble of crucible and in the midst of chaos stable ground was not found but fordged through the stomping of our feet the soot of our gun powder and the power that is the light bestowed upon us by the traveler...and so our story begins a tale of stellar vibes and awesome bushman a tale that would unfold into something grand two competitive souls striking the iron of one another only to become stronger and to never allow one or the other to fall the iron banner only made our steel hotter so that it made be forge into a n even greater weapon then before the trials tested us and what we was really capable of what can we do as a team or csn just only one stabd to rule on top of the throne...to be continued?

10149,this game is a blast with friends but i will say u will either get addicted to this game or u will delete it its one of those type of hit or miss games if u love exploring and pvp then this game is for u i will say the game is not worth the dlc but i will say if u play it out free and u love it then get A dlc and see how long u plan on playing this game
10150,"The game is for free, if you like fast fps games then go for it. Even better if you love Hand cannon ""Pistol/Revolver"" pvp."
10151,Fun game with friends
10152,nice
10153,"Raids/ Dungeons / competitive PVP / Good campaign & story line / smooth FPS combined with super powers.  At initial release, the game was lacking a LOT of content but now its doing much better.  People complain about paying to play certain content.  I can understand that but at the same time there are games profiting off of cosmetics alone.  It is what it is, support the game that you like buy  giving them something in return.  Sounds like a fair deal to me."

10187,"I used to have 2mil buckorinos, after downloading this game i have 1mil.The game isnt pay to win I just have  a drug addiction"
10188,The game much like its predecessor is a money sink. The old content is still required to play even the smallest bit of end game content. So if you have not purchased this game fair warning its filled with not only the cost of the game but there is additional price locked content once you buy all expansions. The cost is not worth even the content that you do get.
10189,"FORTNITEBATTLEROYAL THIS GAME IS 100 PLAY FIGHT TO DEATH BATTLEROYALE WHEN THE FINAL PLAY WINS THE GAME GETTING THE ""VICTORY ROYAL"" WHEN U FIRST DROP FROM THE BATTLE BUSS WATCH OUT FOR HOBGOBLIN VEX AND CABAL THERE THE NPC IN THIS GAME MAKE SURE TO ELIMNATE THEM WITH UR PUMP SHOTGUN AND UR SCAR"

10202,"Destiny 2 is a very fun game if you are looking to be able to have fun by yourself or with friends. The PvP is very good and feels great. The PvE is EVEN BETTER, there is many different quests. The gun system is the best out of any FPS game I have played. Would reccommend 4.5 out of 5 stars"
10203,The only reason i wouldnt recommend it is youd better be ready ti buy some expansions

10209,guns go pew pew and speeders go brrrrr
10210,If you make it past 100 hours you'll be stuck here forever
10211,"1000 hours is a good bit and this game has been a good bit of fun, even for the amount of hours that have been spent doing mindless grinding. Going back to the early days of Destiny, the memories have kept me coming back, while Bungie holds Destiny up better than suspected when other franchises fail to deliver.

Things I like:
- Destiny community and people I met through it
- Lore (do not get too invested or canon relationships between your favourite characters will haunt your dreams)
- Being able to have a 2 hour long fashion crisis and still not being able to pick what kind of look I want for my character (because I can never decide)
- Incredibly well designed weapons and abilities that make me LOVE fighting under levelled pushovers as much as bullet sponges
- Increasingly well made DLC and a captivating story to accompany them (see: lore)

Things I do not like:
- Being forced to use constrained loadouts because of artificial difficulty mods (champion artifact mods) for specific weapons more often because of champions appearing increasingly often in more casual PVE content
- Crucible because despite years of experience I cannot break even in a match for the life of me (also hearing certain kinds of crucible players complain about crucible without end)
- Aforementioned fashion crises costing silver after I run out of synthweave
- Disappointing lack of EXOTIC SHOTGUNS (for PVE use)
- MISSING OUT

In conclusion, good game yeah
I would like to say it's the memories and the (not crucible) community that keep me coming back as much as the FOMO..."
10212,One of the best games ever created and defiantly not a game for babys
10213,played it a bit its pretty good
10214,Fight big hamsters trying to take god ball. Fight bug queen that are trying to take god ball power. Fight discount female general grievous that reject god ball. Fight robot that want to make god ball square. Fight zombie terrorist general grievouses who hate god ball. Fight the first four but in dark mode who support the anti-god ball. Now go and turn them into a new gun to fight them in new exciting ways.
10215,"its fun but the grind is hard 
"
10216,Pretty fun
10217,"Played for 1.4k hours on console
Easily one of my favourite games of all time, this game has given me a lot of good memories over the time of me playing.
The only issue I have is that it is ESSENTIAL to have all of the dlcs and the season passes each season to be able to get the full experience as F2P is very limited but I've been playing this series since the D1 Beta which was in 2014, so if a game can keep me playing that long and I'm still enjoying the game, I think its pretty solid."
10218,"gud game, im surprised its free"
10219,"I hate Destiny 2, I play it every day."
10220,.
10221,its ok
10222,game bad
10223,this game go crazy. i really like it but sometimes it gets under your skin like all games do

10225,yes
10226,"I hate destiny 2, it's my favorite game."

10240,x
10241,my friends destiny's are now set to play destiny and ignore me for the rest of their lives. i shall now live my life in an eternal loneliness devoid of all friends all because i refuse to waste away my life grinding. 10/10 would grind again
10242,Amazing storyline and graphics. Very interesting mechanics and alot of fun to play with friends and do raids and dungeons
10243,"TLDR: Amazing game with satisfying game play loops that is good as a solo player, but best with a group of friends.

Says I have 1,000 hours, but that doesn't include the roughly 1,007 hours I put into the game on Xbox one. I never played D1, but I bought D2 before it came out, and stayed home on the day it came out becoming so absolutely fascinated with the games systems and game play loops. I played every raid the day it came out until Garden of Salvation, due to my switch to PC whilst losing many mutual friends and not having a clan to play with. 
Every raid I played I loved, each had unique elements that with a group of friends was fun to figure out and challenging, and granted a very strong feeling of accomplishment when completing each raid. Even playing with randos as a solo I had fun grinding through the raids and higher end game content (although mileage may very due to some of D2's more toxic raiders).
Sadly, my switch to PC and a complicated stew of personal problems turned me into a solo player, but I still enjoy the game nonetheless. It is much more challenging and restrictive to play solo endgame content, and there is also much less content available, but there no game that I have come back to time and time again like this one.
Every year this game gets better at really using the systems that pulled me into it in the first place. Its absolutely satisfying flow between abilities and kills has become even more strong and connected through its recent introduction of the 3.0 class updates, and has also become much more freeing and thorough in its customization of builds.
I don't think I will be putting this game down anytime soon, and will be closely following any continuations of the series."
10244,"The whole damn game is just a paywall that steal from you.  You don't even get to keep the majority of what you pay for. It's literally stealing, yet the whole fan-base somehow defends that shit."
10245,"Yeah, an awesome game, 11/10"
10246,Wonderful game. Not new player friendly at all
10247,"good game
"
10248,yeah its fun but it takes a lot of grinding and you will have to spend a lot of money. so not unlike every other popular game right now
10249,run now don't get sucked in its not worth it RUN NEVER LOOK BACK STOP LOOKING AND RUNNNNN
10250,"Been with bungie on destiny since Destiny Alpha. I Can say it has gotten alot better with Activision being gone. It has gotten better since the season of the lost and I dare say my favorite season was when we all had mountaintop and recluse as wonderful as they were. I Enjoy this game alot and I tend to play all three characters but I really enjoy the game for the story and the seamless gunplay. Is it perfect? No, but at least they are treating this game with the respect it deserves. Much Love and Respect."
10251,poop
10252,"my friends and I refuse to pay any more money in the game, you pay for expantions and get it taken from you and removed. it still show ingame time line new thing yet you can't access , i'm not into investing money or time anymore. sad since it was the only fps i play. and being thrusted into a fight when i log in after som time off with a group and dying ovr and over and over again is no fun. when all the group starting quitting. so did I.
i try every time to get back into it but nope i'm done.

mayb new players might like it i would advise of not spending on anything unless you are very sure of it but no gaurantee it will last though!"
10253,"idk, still haven't played this game enough, will update review at 5k hours"
10254,A LOT has changed since the last time I played but nonetheless I still love this game
10255,i dont like FPS games but i like destiny 2 cuz it's RBG game at the same time
10256,meh. is okay
10257,I find this game really fun because there is so much to do what i do not like about it is how expensive the DLC are other than that this game is one of my top 3 funnest game
10258,I have played for 75 hours and I still dont know wtf is going on
10259,meh

10269,its pretty fun
10270,"Yes this game is pay to play in a lot of ways, but what you get is an action packed story multiplayer shooter like no other. Once you're able to level up properly, the grind sucks you in, and the first 500 hours feel like 5."

Edit: I have been asked to revise my review. No changes needed to be made."
10290,"I am a 45 yo maidenless father, probably one of the many maidenless sigmas actually playing this game. I am a partial time single farther to my grandson, who is 40 now. My grandson got this game for valentines day from his step father, who is living in the flat next to me with my former wife,  Anyways, so we rushed to install it on his dope- 4k 360fps ultrawide razer RGB back lit ergonomic gaming microkettle pro max lite 9- and he immediately started playing. By the end of the first 24 hours on this game we had inevitably accumulated around a month of playtime. So i decided to make an EA account and purchase this 80.84GB game from GOG.com, (still had to launch through ubisoft connect which was a total bummer). It was the best time had spent with my grandson since my wife had cheated on me with Clementine next door, my grandsons step father who also just so happens to be my wifes older brother . All in all This game reminded me that if there is a hole, there is a goal."
10291,eh
10292,Tis is good
10293,Is good game.

10326,">You are harassing me and making death threats if you demand us to fix the game even though we got 100 USD out of you for the deluxe edition but please pay 10 USD more for the dawning event card too
>Will spend money on lawyers to sue people but will NOT get dedicated server or kill cam or review non-streamer cheater reports
>One guy said something mean to the CM on twitter so all of you are toxic and we won't update you anymore even if it's CM's job to COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMMUNITY.  IF THERE'S ANY DIFFICULTY ON MY JOB I AM JUST GOING TO BLAME THE CUSTOMER REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS WRONG AND ME AS THE CM AM YOUR GOD WORSHIP AND PRAISE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!

I played since D1 and I can promise you the liberals at Bungie are making things worse. Witch Queen was very good but the next season we are back to almost no content besides the dungeon you have to pay extra 20 USD for (or the deluxe edition.) If you paid for the season pass it's just nonstop nightmare containment for you (which they nerfed the drop rate twice.) PvP? Cheaters every 2 games and report does nothing. Every other game you will meet someone net-throttling or aimbotting and reporting them does NOTHING unless you are a streamer.

They intentionally made most armors from dungeons/raids look bad so you will be tempted to pay USD for silver for Eververse/battle pass. Dungeons are also used to be included in the season pass/DLC but now you have to pay extra.

Bungie talk about muh mental health all the time but will do everything within their power to keep you trapped and playing this game with all the BS grind/lack of matchmaking so you will be forced to join groups to peer pressure each other into grinding so you will have people to raid with. They intentionally throttle exotic drops when you play everyday. But if you take a break from the game and come back exotics just drop. Not to mention muh artifact level that resets every season so you will be FORCED into playing hundreds of hours to get into GM/Master raids so you can get ascendant shards to masterwork your armors.
Can someone tell me how's hundreds of hours of your work being reset every 3 months good for your mental health?

Besides Bungie the PvP community in this game's one of the most pathetic I have ever seen. It's clearly a PvE focused game since Bungie doesn't really even bother with updating PvP much besides balancing. But everywhere you go you will see PvP players acting superior while the only thing they are good at is pug stomping with their God Roll max aim assist guns. They even object to solo queues because it's ""uncompetitive"" while in any other PvP game solo queue for ranked is more prestigious because you can't get carried. If you watch their video in slowmo you can see NONE of the streamers/elite PvPers can actually land shots, it's all aim assist and their aim would be trash in any other shooter but somehow they have the audacity to act like they win because they are the better players..... No bud it's just cheese(ier) strats and god roll guns and pug stomping. It's not actual skill. Most of the PvP mains are hunter if that tells you anything.

Bungie's PvP team also clearly favors Hunter (has been that way for years.) None of the Titan's charged melee one-hit-kill any more even though they don't have tracking/aim-assist and most aren't even ranged. But Hunter's throwing knives have MASSIVE aim assist (google Tripmine knife tracking is wild...)(it's basically a homing missile no joke.) and will OHK with headshot AND some even come with proximity detonation so you can combo with tripmine for OHK. Not to mention invis hunters that 1. have dmg reduction with omnioculus 2. disables your aim-assist (people in this game can't hit anything without AA) 3. goes off radar (people in this game have 0 map-awareness without radar) 4. can stay invis forever with multiple ways

Then there's the streamer privilege. You get in-game items (glimmer, XP, trial XP, emblems) when giving away subs or reacting with emotes on certain streamer's page. (paying real world money for in game advantage) And you can also give away subs (i.e. giving real world money but with extra steps) on streamer's page for trial/dungeon/raid carries. But if you try to do it with any non-streamer it's banable........................? Why are the streamers defacto allowed the privilege of carrying people for real world money (subs)? If you are going to ban people for it ban both.

Finally Bungie just HATES solo players when solo players are the majority of the player base. It's been years since D1 but they still have not enabled matchmaking for dungeons/raids (GL getting guided games)/higher difficulty nightfalls. When in this year's Guardian Game people were doing 1550 NF no problem.
I highly suspect it's their way of creating peer-pressure so you will be forced into grinding to stay in raiding clans every season. You either have to put in hundreds of hours of grind to get into good LFG groups/raiding clans or be stuck joining random LFG groups that clearly has never even read a guide before joining but will put KWTD in the title. It's clearly much better if they would just enable matching making so people can at least try the content they paid for out and maybe learn it by stucking it out with randoms. They already match people close to your light level, they keep track of your clear counts with emblems. So they clearly have the technology to match people based on their clear count. but they don't so you are forced to use LFG and spending 30+ minutes to pick a decent team if you are exp. And if you are new and have a sense of shame you are stuck spending hours/days looking for a sherpa run. (If you have no shame like a lot of players, you join KWTD runs and make people jump off half-way wasting everyone's time.)"
10327,"A co-op FPS by nature, by being structured and marketed as MMO, Destiny 2 unavoidably gets compared to games from both genres. Its MMO side is simply insufficient due to the lack of content. If Bungie could adopt the subscription model, this game would have simply been just an expansion of the first one, as they are as close to each other as World of Warcraft expansions are to each other. However from the FPS standpoint, Destiny 2 is ticking many boxes. It is correct in its core mechanisms, it has juicy gameplay and it is a worthwhile title that should have been a bit more ambitious with its design."
10328,"dlcs are crazy expensive and pretty much the only way to have fun or to get good looking cosmetics besides raids and i am extremely lonely so raids are not and option because you NEED to have friends to complete them which is even more stupid. Incredibly grindy and terrible level system the only good part about this game is it's amazing backgrounds and wonderful open play spaces but theres nothing in them! so if you check every nook and cranny it's just a waste of time the only other thing good about the game is the design of the weapons and armor which you cant even keep on to for more than a couple minutes because of stupid stuff called ""power level"" so even if you get a cool gun or helmet dont worry because in ten minutes youll be wearing another ugly piece unless you want to constantly try to level up that armor which again super grindy! this game is nothing but wasted potential and don't even get started on the dialogue."
10329,kind of a shit game. decent enough game play but story is hard to follow as theres just to much other shit going on and so many dumb DLC that cost a fortune to buy and tons of content removed from the old DLC while still charging for it. they just want your money
10330,"good

10340,Good... i guess... i dunno
10341,It is literally the best game ever hands down
10342,took me a while to try it but i'm glad i finally did great game play loop and i love the lore

10344,amazing
10345,"This game is so great they divide the masterpiece in many, many, many pieces. It's fun to buy back the parts! And the characters so life-like, I can believe all of them sit around and tell you want to do cause.... story is a masterpiece and the lore is so beautiful. No plot holes."
10346,extremly fun game to play with friends as it  depends on team work if you are intersted in PVE game mode. it has 3 classes which gives you so much different play style each time you switch. You can never be bored.
10347,AMZING
10348,im addicted
10349,"New players don't even bother. Every season is a ridiculous grind. You won't have all the mods, I made this alt account and in almost 3 months I still didn't have anywhere near close to all the integral mods. Basically, you just look stuff up on YouTube and it tells you what to take for gear for encounters. Yeah it's pretty. But it also gets pretty boring, too. Listen. You as a customer are not valued by Bungie. They do not care about you at all, despite all the claptrap at TWAB. The lobbies in PvP are still full of cheaters, how do I know this? Because I was one, and I got away for 3 months. BUT it wouldn't be an issue if it didn't take months of grinding to get mediocre gear to get blown out by three stacks of cheaters in Trials. I could prescribe remedy after remedy, but basically all of that is hashed out on the discussion page on Bungie's site, which usually ignored, unless it's unintentional game behavior that makes the game fun again. They drop the banhammer on that quick. YOU MUST HAVE FUN THE WAY BUNGIE WANTS YOU TO HAVE FUN - but, I'll probably just make a new free to play account, or buy someone else's and just cheat on that, too. Y'all don't know the rush of one-phasing Rhulk with a Grand Overture, or creaming a dungeon in 15 minutes on Legendary, lol. Screw you, Bungie."

10367,"Used to be a big destiny player but now a days it feels like a chore to play it. It is just easier to list what made the game bland for me. 

-The expansions are just lacking other than forsaken (I know that they said there is not enough resources). I also did not play witch queen but seems like more the same. The same being a campaign that is a few hours long and you wait every week to get a small update.  When the small update comes you play it and have some fun but then the blandness comes in where you just want to finish whatever it is as fast as possible. 

-Season pass model is the worst thing to come to destiny since it is just the same as above but instead of getting an expansion all you get are boring missions that you must wait 8 weeks to finish. The pass itself for some reason disappears after 3 months even though it is still accessible through bungie.net. I understand that people/devs do not want the game to have dead space during the year but if they just focus on making an amazing expansion that is huge and let us say have a few small updates around the year like 2 dungeons and a strike then i feel like it would be a lot healthier than just smashing your head at a wall while you play a game where you cannot lose (You cannot lose the seasonal activity unless all players just did not play, that is lame). 

-Vaulting, I feel like this just by itself should be enough. I understand that the game files could amass a huge amount for players, and they would complain but just deleting some people's favorite raids/strikes/dungeons is not a solution it's just erasing the game that you are playing and having fun with. Just imagine what the game would look like if we had all that content (tons of stuff to do!).  Instead, they delete it and force all players to purchase the season pass since most of the content comes from this year's expansion, which makes sense for business. Getting rid of a product that you purchased just feels wrong and makes it close to impossible for new players to ever get interested in the game (think of it as watching a show but they deleted season 1 and 2 then you must try and follow what is going on and being told it is better this way since they will leave teasers for the first 2 2 seasons). 

-PVP is basically nonexistent.  They finally added a new map after around 1000 days, this should be argument enough for how poor the pvp is.  The PVP in general is just not fun compared to any other shooter out there. The substantial change that would make it amazing is making it more like halo where you find weapons on the map and having let us say a starting weapon that could change for every season, could be an AR one season then the next sidearm. You could also base abilities on kills, and it would act more like a reward instead of a free kill for some people.  PVP is also the reason we get nerfed in PVE so also not very cool. 

-The expense of the game is wild compared to other games if you look at getting all the content being season pass, expansion, and dungeons/raids. The argument against this that i have heard is you can just buy the deluxe edition (or whatever it is called) and get all the content for the year, but the problem with this is you are pre-purchasing something that is 3/6/8 months away not even knowing if you would play the game by that time or just think that one of the seasons is just not for you. Looking over how much i spent on this game makes me feel a bit gross since a portion of the content is now gone (got it on release and bought everything up to the last season during beyond light). The straw that broke the camel's back was when they started selling content during the season that i already bought, i.e., being the 30th anniversary, which is funny how they said let's celebrate by giving us more money. The game is one of the first PC dedicated mobile games ever created when looking at the amount of content.  Even though eververese is just cosmetic the amount of content pumped through it and the insane prices blow my mind especially since it is a gear-based game where you will change everything all the time (transmog is an awesome add on but the cost and grind to unlock Armour looks that you already unlocked blows). 

(This is a person-to-person thing but if it is your only game, you play then expenses don't mean much since some people purchase every call of duty so kind of is the same thing at the end of the day) 

-Free-to-pay/new lights is a bit of a smaller point since it does not refer to me but to people I tried to get into the game. Getting people into destiny after they introduced vaulting just made it frustrating for my friends to have any interest in the series since all they understood was alien bad and shoot it. When it comes to the free-to-play it is more like a free trial for the game since all the content is behind a pay wall. Even if the content that is getting vaulted now you are forced to purchase a stripped-down version of it instead of just giving last wish out for free. 

The game play is one of the best and raids are one of a kind in the gaming sphere, but these problems just added up for me, so I had to get out while I still had money intact. 

  When I first saw the witch queen trailer, I was hyped af, but as the 6 agenizing months of the season of the lost went on I realized how bare bones this game has become. Then as I said the 30th anniversary was shown, and it just made me quit altogether. I have not written anything for a while so probably butchered this, but just wanted to throw my hat in the wind.  Probably stated the same points more than once since they all merge together.

10368,"My wife died, thanks for the cope... #betterdays"
10369,great game
10370,"i hate this game who even plays this shit anyway, 10/10 would recommend"
10371,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
10372,its a full time job
10373,"love the graphics, the movement feels fantastic. The music.. Mint."
10374,The most fun you can have outside the bedroom. Solid loot and shoot game.
10375,"good game, pve stories are good, pvp is fun for me at least."
10376,"If you've been playing for a long time, it's gonna be more of what you like already with some improvements.
If you're a returning player, its gonna take getting used to and you'll have to meet the game more than half way, but still worthwhile
If you're brand new, don't even bother, the ship has sailed and there isn't much to help you catch up.

Overall, 10/10, wouldn't do it again"

10381,"Destiny 2 is MMOFPS looter shooter game which similar to MMORPG game. (I played lot of MMORPG such as FFXIV, GW2, etc.) 
So by that this game also contain : 
<> Story / Campaign
<> Dungeon
<> Raid
<> PVP
<> World activity 

However they have remove the base storyline & Forsaken content (campaign, raid) but the weapon is stilll obtainable if u have the DLC.

Content in my opinion :
- The PVE is playable solo, but its more fun bringing your comrades ( up to 3 person play )
- The PVP is based on ur build & gameplay, not affected by power. Means u can do pvp even in early level, theres no damage GAP.
- Raid kinda complex & the mechanic is fun (Similar to MMORPG game, required 6 ppl & good teamwork to do the mechanic)
- World activity : this thing is still active due to theres no level restriction(any low level can do any world activity without having issue damaging the enemy) & reward is adjusted to your level.

Pros :
- Unlike basic MMORPG game which old dlc weapons outdated, in D2 all the gear can be powered up to the current level cap.
- its solo friendly for the campaign 
- PVE is not boring & enjoyable 
- Seasonal mission & story (season pass required) which gave u good weapon & gear.

Cons :
- The UI is kinda confusing for first timer, need some time for me to understand the game leveling system, the planet function, quest system.
- Theres no clan space / room that clan mates can meetup (In warframe theres DOJO where u can customize and ).
- You have to buy all content (the previous DLC & current DLC) coz sometime theres weekly dungeon or playlist rotation that if u dont have the DLC then u cant do the weekly dungeon. Luckily i bought it on summer sale which affordable for me.

I think thats all.. will update my review on 500Hours Gameplay 
Thanks.."
10382,"Good for PvE but, PvP match making is extremely unbalanced and full of you getting matched with people that treat this as their literal job."
10383,"I get one-shot by Jotunn in Crucible every 2 seconds. Bad game, 0/10"
10384,"bad game, probably"
10385,Replayable content. Each season has something new to keep you coming back.
10386,You don’t want me writing a review. Trust me.
10387,"I'm still early in the game but I like it so far. Let's break it down shall we...
  -Gameplay is fun and addictive
  -Graphics are good
  -Excellent storyline
  -Easy to learn (so far)
For the most part the game is just outstanding but one flaw is you have to spend $$$ to advance. It's not terrible but you can rack up on the DLC real quick. Grinding is an option but you miss out on a lot of lore without the extras. In my opinion  it's worth it to spend the money but play for free and enjoy it if you want!"

After you do all that and get to end game you're pretty much doing the same thing every week and all of it is locked behind a paywall so unless you're ready to spend over $100 I would stay away.

10416,"I started playing for PVP content, the PVE was pretty fun at first gets boring and repetitive very fast, started trying to get some equipment for PVP, got to a not bad gear score and every PVP match just 1 shot by everything. Its the most unbalanced sh*tshow game i've ever played. 

I am one of them players that has pure determination to get good and sometimes sweaty when it comes to pvp and this broke me. 

Had my heart set and sinking some £££ into the expansion for this game but the PVP killed my enthusiasm very quickly so glad i didn't buy anything."
10417,This game sucks. 1000 hours hurts too much
10418,"this game is designed to ruin your free time, your wallet, and your will to play other games. do not ever install"
10419,yes
10420,its decent i mean i have 4k hours on this game between pc xbox and playstation
10421,this game is worse than 9/11 and hitler
10422,"Bungie is a money-whoring company, don't fall for their trap."
10423,Good
10424,New World is better :P
10425,"Fun game, but the constant rotating seasonal content makes it difficult for completionists that have common life obligations to keep up.  As the game has progressed, the pressure to play on the games timeline vs at your own leisure has continued to increase."
10426,Just started. So far so good.
10427,Hate myself for loving it :)
10428,"ITS GREAT

10429,Destiny 2 :(

10431,"I haven't eaten in 2 days. I just cant stop, wont stop. Please keep making new gear and quests. This is such a fun game :)"
10432,best game na
10433,its cool but kinda gay sometimes
10434,great game
10435,Great Game
10436,"in destiny you play as john destiny and shoot guys and gods to transform them into guns, good game, have the right amount of ass in it 5/5"
10437,Few hours into the game and I was cok-blocking by the expansion
10438,"Its a good game however if you wanna get a good start, your going to have to pay for at least the latest dlc."
10439,"Too grindy, hurts my head"
10440,this game is fun if you hate yourself and have hours of spare time
10441,I loved Destiny so the second one has its pros and cons but this game is really fun. Especially if you find a group to play it with.
10442,"good
"
10443,"Not just saying this, but it is so boring and awful. Been playing for 8+ years. From when I purchased D1 it was an solid A game IMO. Now its a C- at best. They shovel the same crap every season. 6 man activity. Iron Banana blows. Dude for $100 and to get ONE new pvp map is garbage. GMs rotate from season to season. Trials is broken cause of the builds you can have. Literally what is there do in this game? Gambit? Forreal? What else is there? Raids? The new dungeon? They are ok. Sad because this was my favorite game when it came out. Idk how people still defend this game. You want a S tier game, go play Elden Ring."
10444,fun fps
10445,"amazing gameplay, extremely addictive"
10446,A fun game to grind and slay enemies and bosses. Not a fan of PvP but hear it's still a fun mode in this game. Raids have to be done with a group of people which sucks for people like me who don't really have friends who own this game and could do the raids with me. From what I've watched they are difficult and require a great deal of teamwork. Would recommend this game to someone who loves to grind PvE.
10447,I liked it because it has pvp and pve
10448,"The PvP isn't very balanced and makes it hard for newer players to get into it, but I'm a PvE player and I enjoy all the free content that I've played so far.  Just bought some DLC and I'm ready to try it out."
10449,"I've played this game a lot and it's a great looter-shooter with beautiful graphics and good gameplay. But the story line, quests, challenges, etc are so poorly described that they're almost impossible to figure out. The game often directs you to locations and quests that aren't open at your level - - just sloppy game design and really poor user interface decisions."
10450,its impressive
10451,"destiny 2 is not a good game, its a successful game, its a proffitable game. the gameplay itself, the running and gunning is fun enough, but its so steeped in what feels like pointless grind, repetetive missions. the free version contains enough to get your feet wet but nothing of the end game and of the really juicy parts, which are, the DLC. destiny isnt actually free to play becasue all of its good qualities are in the DLC, and even those are still steeped in the same issues as mentioned before. ultimately, its a very polished game but there are other games out there that acomplish the same but better."
10452,tracking where and what to do with a quest suck. other than that not bad
10453,dommy mommy caiatl
10454,"In my top 5 games all time.Its a grind, be prepared to leave your other games behind for a while. Warlocks are by far the best class, that's a fact, look it up."
10455,its much better with friends and doing dungeons or raids but i still enjoy it alone
10456,One of the best MMORPG games out there.... One of the most beautiful games to explore.
10457,The best game to play when your board because it is fun and somewhat hard or easy.

10477,if you like life you will like this game same if you don't like life
10478,"This game, which was purposely designed to be addictive, still comes with many frustrating/unmanaged issues which have not been addressed by Bungie for too long. The gameplay issue that frustrates me the most, poor melee registrations, have not been managed by Bungie since the release of this game (2017).

I've played the 1st iteration of this game on PS4 for over 1000 hours, and played this sequel for over 1000 hours on PS4 as well. I had hoped that switching to PC would help me rediscover and enjoy this game, but nothing had changed, as melee registration continues to consistently work poorly, at least multiple times a match.

This is only one frustrating issue found in the game at this time. There are many more to be found. If you wish to hear about more, simply look at other reviews. They are all valid.

If you want to experience a time of great initial fun, play this game. However, the more time that you spend playing this game, the more you will see the problems swept under the rug, and you will realize that you've been roped into an unpleasant addiction."
10479,"Destiny 2 has always been an amazing game :D The classes and sub classes are done real well, I played this like crazy on Xbox and now glad I've got it on PC."
10480,"I've enjoyed Destiny over the years. I've had an on and off relationship with it, but I know that every time I hop into my ship I know I'm going off on an amazing adventure."
10481,Bought it when it first came out and enjoyed it. Took a break and came back just to realize basically all the content I paid for is no longer available. Blatant rip-off.
10482,it's cool
10483,"Good game, but gets boring and repetitive after a while. Content droughts are still an issue, but not as bad as before."
10484,bold of you to think that this is a FTP game
10485,:3
10486,The game is quite enjoyable to anyone with the time to put into it.
10487,"mm very nice
"
10488,"it can be a fun game until you find out, they make it for players that want to dedicate their lives to it... if you are a single player with no one to play with you will be limited to always falling short of completing season quests. The weapons are also great until you find out they MAKE you play PVP  to complete weapons catalysts.
example: i worked hard to get season 17 achieves.. second to last week they made a GM nightfall run as a requirement.. as in you need to have others you know to play with.. it doesnt have matchmaking.... so singles are once again crapped on."
10489,Expansions are too expensive. AAA-game price for an DLC is wild.
10490,"Fun game, terrible monetization. If they at least allowed you to play content as long you're with a friend that has bough said content, but no.
This isn't a ""free to play"" game, this is a free demo. For a game you then have to spend crazy amounts to actually play. Not to mention, the content you buy may just get suddenly patched out of the game, for who knows how long.

If you do spend money, buy the expansions on sale as cheap as you can get them. Heavily flawed as it is, it IS a fun game, at the end of the day.

Edit: As of the Summer Solstice 2022 Update, the performance has also gone from bad to unacceptable. I've tampered with system settings, Nividia settings, and the in-game ones, and yet I'm consistently below 60 FPS, despite running on the lowest possible settings at 60% render resolution."
10491,"Best game I've ever played, PVP is challenging, PVE is challenging, the game is forever evolving, the lore is insane! I can't believe they don't do a Destiny Cinematic Universe"
10492,"great game for FTP players , loads of weapons and dungeons , raid content is reserved for players that purchased the game and add-on"
10493,"ive probably got over a thousand hours total on both destiny 1 and 2 back on ps4. i would probably consider destiny one of my favorite games of all time. although i cannot recommend it to anyone else. this game has so much going for it. amazing gunplay, really cool lore, fun subclasses and abilities, and so much more. but what ruined it for me was just how boring and repetitive it can get. granted, i havent played since forsaken dropped so idk if things have gotten better, but back when i played the game was plagued with repetitive missions and excessive grinding. doing the same strikes and missions over and over again just to get your power level up was grating. and yeah there were cool activities like raids and other stuff, but most of that is gated behind a minimum player requirement. for most of the time ive played these games, ive only ever had one or two other people who played with me, which made it impossible to play any higher level activities. ive also heard alot of older content from previous expansions have been removed which is rather infuriating considering i bought most of those expansions for $60."
10494,Great Game. Start playing it for free. If u enjoy it buy the DLCs.     totally worth it
10495,ye
10496,I hate this game. I wish every moment that ive tooken on this game i couldve taken back. i wish i could stop playing. Lord help me this game is terrible. it hasnt changed its terrible

10498,"Fun to shoot stuff, lots to do and not time consuming, you can play for as long as you like or shut it down with in minutes if you need to do other stuff (not a raider btw)"
10499,Macht spaß
10500,"game is decent, good content but **LONG** content drought can happen (days where nothing massive happens)
also most of the content is behind a pay wall, and the older dlcs (forsaken for example) some of its content is vaulted (not available to be played) grind is also  considerably big thing here so yea lema0 

if you like looter shooter and slaughtering doods with to consequences and can burn a bit of money pick it up ig"
10501,i get why people hate this game but it has halo guns so i like it
10502,great game to play
10503,only absolute virgin loser would play this game. this game fucking sucks. i would rather play genshin impact over this ass game
10504,"Bungee has gone off the deep end.
40$ per expansion? fine.
but 10$ every three months for ""content""? eat my ass.
20$ every season TO GET ACCESS TO A DUNGEON!? eat my whole ass.
You make enough money off cosmetics. Sony acquired your studios.
Cash grab. That's all this is.

If you have to pay for anything in this game, buy it off key resellers so it will ACTIVELY cost bungie money."
10505,"it will be near impossible to play this game alone and get anywhere like the carries and the sweats do imma go play banner and level up but ya;ll been had me fed up about trails being light leveled and carry based. 
i miss 4v4 competitive playlist options as well as duos it should be instilled in the competitive and trails playlists either as 2 v 2 v 2 or solo with 2 v vs solo with 2 or my favorite handicap matches like 3 vs 2 and 2 or 2 solos and a team of two all light levels applied trails doesn't feel like trials

10512,This is a good game is has it's pros and cons. me personally love the game-play and the lore it comes with although if your try and quit this game you will come back to play it again I tried to stop playing it on several occasions. so if you do consider this just remember that there's no turning back
10513,"So I've gotten to the point where it's just grinding for pinnacle gear. I dont want to shell out 300 dollars for all the dlc in order to play most of the game. And it looks like each dlc only unlocks a couple things to do...really? With such a huge cost of entry this game just isnt that good. The PVP is an absolute shit show on it's own. I'm actually disgusted by it. 

If the DLCs go on a 75% discount I could see the game being worth it. But right now they're living on something quite abundant, people with more money than sense."
10514,yep
10515,"i would only recomend the game if you get into the lore or if you like a time waster. Its a good story but there is a lot of background that you either have to look for or watch a mynameisbyf video. Gamely can be repetitive, but the best times ive had have been with friends doing content that i was under-leveled for.

[h1] The New player experience [/h1]
It's 2022. You decide to check out this hot and cool shooter called Destiny 2. You log in, make a character, and watch the intro. It's short, mysterious and the music swells as the title is revealed and you're instantly immersed in the world. You then proceed to shoot and disintegrate some aliens throughout the intro missions and perhaps think to yourself: ""Wow! I get to wield space magic and use a multitude of guns, this gameplay is awesome. I can't wait to play the rest of the game!"". As you put in some hours though, eventually, inevitably, it hits you: ""Wait, what am I supposed to do again? Whats the story? Who are these people? Is there a campaign I can play? Hold on what do you mean that intro was actually from Destiny 1? Where can I talk to other players? Should I buy an expansion? Which one should I get? Do I need a season pass? [strike] What the fuck is a zorpalod [/strike] ."" In short, its a bit of a mess for newcomers. For all its focus on an ongoing story and 'living world' through yearly expansions and seasonal content, the very nature of seasonal story telling (seasons are usually ~ 10 weeks) means you'll miss out on them if you were not playing then. Coupled with the content vault, where Bungie shelved/removed/deleted/dragged-out-behind-the-shed-and-shot roughly half the game around Beyond Light (2020) and will most likely continue to do so for older expansions (for the sake of game stability), means that it is difficult for new players to orient themselves in the game's world if they don't even have the opportunity revisit older content.

[h1] The Shootin' [/h1]
Admittedly, the game plays fantastically. No other game I've tried nails the feeling of popping some space demon's head with an over-sized handgun and incinerating his pals with lightning like Destiny, and to add the ability of experiencing it with friends no less. Moment to moment gameplay is awesome, and encounter design for more higher level content is usually pretty well thought out, and its the reason why most people stick with the game even if they might complain about it in the same sentence. Most importantly, Bungie knows this. They know they have lighting in a bottle, and over the years it has been proven that however much the very vocal Destiny community likes complain of things, they will still continue to put in hundred upon hundred of hours. If you understand that, then you'll understand why the game is monetized and priced the way it is. 

[h1] The Price [/h1]
Don't be fooled, its really a ""free to try"" sort of situation. With season passes lasting around 3 months and the big dramatic expansions coming yearly, you're expected to pay somewhere upwards of £80 pounds a year if you intend to keep playing and having things to do. Video games are an extremely cost-efficient medium and there are so many interesting games out there to buy for a fraction of the cost, giving you more value and enjoyment for the money you spend. Though what's provided by the seasons and expansions is often well made and interesting, it is hard for me justify their full price tag under any circumstances. Coupled with this is also the enormous amount of microtransactions present in the game, from skins to emote to ships and anything of the like. Look I get it, its a long lost battle against microtransactions in video games, but if an in-game emote costs roughly as much as an season pass and the rewards and activities (repetitive as they may be) associated with it, I can't help but feel a little ripped-off. At least a couple years ago one could say hey, at least a couple campaigns are free and playable, but those are long gone. Essentially, it feels like a subscription service and you should know what you're getting into. 

[h1] The Loop [/h1]
As is par for the course of the genre, the game eventually devolves into several repetitive gameplay loops in certain activities if you're trying to achieve some specific goal/item. There is a lot of things to do in the game don't get me wrong, but inevitably one may find themselves grinding for some particular goal, be it a good roll on a gun or whatever and just spend hours on it. In this case, Bungie is very good at making 'boxes' for the player to tick, and playing Destiny 2 sometimes makes me feel like I'm some hamster in a wheel thinking he's progressing somewhere, while simultaneously being afraid of missing out on timed content. It is what it is, and I suppose there is nothing wrong in finding enjoyment in that, but it is important to hold no illusions over what ~80% of the game actually is. 

[h1] The Closing Thoughts[/h1]
About the main reason I would recommend Destiny 2 to completely fresh players is the no cost of entry and its amazing gameplay. Try it out, the look and feel of the game is brilliant, and as long you are aware of what you are getting yourself into, you might even like it. But the price and nature of drip-fed content along with peculiarities too numerous to fit in this review such as the reliance on third-party apps/websites for basic functionalities like loadouts or LFG's leaves a lot to be desired. It does not help the fact that money spent on the game's expansions just feels wrong considering the inevitably removal of said expansions down the road. As I've mentioned before, most continue to play because they're just not much that compares to the way Destiny plays. 
If you are a returning player however, I would definitely recommend checking the game out again. It's in a fairly alright state at the moment, while some controversial mechanics like sunsetting are gone (though what has been sunset will remain that way), and you are probably used to some of Bungo 's hijinks by now."
10575,Fun but not much to do after you do all the free play stuff
10576,"The description says ""absolutely free"" but no, the game insists you to buy dlcs for unlocking the main content of the game, most of the story and the amazing guns are not available for f2p players. I'm not saying that the game is bad, I enjoyed it for a while as a f2p, but that's all. You'll either end up uninstalling the game after 20 hours or buying dlcs and stuff. I spent a lot of time just to grind a few good weapons and then after realising how limited the content is for f2p players I lost interest in the game. I personally think there should be more content for f2p players, it's not on satisfactory level currently."
10577,very fun game :)
10578,"This is legit awful. I remember playing this a long time ago and recently thought I should give it another go. My god. The amount of crap you're bombarded from the very beginning is insane. You're first few hours in a game should be about learning mechanics, getting into the story, and simply having fun. 

My first foray into it after like 5 years was overwhelming. Hundreds of bounties that don't seem to matter. Trying to teach a new player about all these different sub classes and abilities in your current class within the first hour is stupid. Fuck I couldn't even figure out how leveling worked. It used to be you play, gain xp, you level, and get to get a new ability or something. Nothing close to that now.

Then navigating is a whole other thing. The ""map"" where you travel to different planets and stuff is a mess. There's like 8+ icons you can click and unless you google stuff you'll have no clue what any of them are about. 

This is not a new person friendly game. If you're going in brand new expect to spend hours trying to figure out anything.

I just wanted to shoot aliens in the face while trying to follow the story. (I couldn't figure out how to continue with the original story at all) Huge mess would never recommend to someone. Free or not."

10584,uhh
10585,freaking awesome!!!!!!
10586,">1060 hours.

It hurts."
10587,"The more effort you put into this game, the more rewarding it will be to play. You will hear a lot of complaints, you will hear a lot of compliments and you will hear a lot of neutral accounts. Look at the game as what it is: a PVE centred MMO looter shooter. It is not dedicated to PVP, so don't expect top notch, perfectly balanced and optimised PVP, this is a game about space magic, not just guns.

Dedicated and skilled players are rewarded for their perilous journeys into Grand Master Nightfalls, master raids and Trials with titles, stronger loot and some bragging rights. A complaint I hear often: ""Why is the best loot locked behind late endgame?"" and to this i say: ""Why shouldn't it be?"" Effort = reward after all.

There is plenty of content for the average player too, standard difficulty nightfalls, dungeons, dares of eternity, the strike playlist, crucible, campaign missions, exotic quests, public events, blind well, alters of sorrow, containment, a plethora of Easter eggs, secret quests, triumphs, seasonal playlists, seasonal story missions... (R.I.P. season 14) even just chill in orbit and listen to the incredible music or explore one of the many planets the game has to offer.

TL;DR this game is suitable for all players of the genre, the average player has plenty to do and can get their paws on a lot of great weapons and exotics. The veteran player is rewarded for their endeavours with rare stuff. And again: Effort = Reward.

10588,"Over 3k hours and still going. I think I may like this game. Great FPS gun play, movement, story, and PvE content. PvP is hit and miss, but can be fun depending on what Bungie recently nerfed or buffed. But let's face it, D2 was never meant to be a competitive PvP focused game. With the classes, mods, and overall gameplay, there's no way to truly balance the PvP experience. But it's still a fun distraction from the PvE content."
