4,Honestly a good game. hard for me to get into because i suck but the more i play the more i enjoy it
5,"10/10 recommend, most friendly community I've been in."
6,"good game 
+rep"
7,This game has the friendliest and most supportive player base that I have ever interacted with.  It is so nice to just have a relaxing night where I go out and farm to upgrade my base and have other players come up and give me free loot while giving me supportive nicknames.
8,good
9,I entered because of Neoxa crypto server. But It is a good survival with pvp combat enhanced. So That means the combat is smooth the aim is fast. It is almost a FPS when fighting others and the survival we love is here too. I entered to be paid but It is worth time even for free.
10,"Its toxic, hard"
11,"The best survival game out, cannot get better then this. You can grind for hours then lose it all in the matter of seconds, This game is a game for PvP Chads, Role-players, and Average Gamers. This game is E-Girl friendly most of the time and its possible to make friends, more then likely to make enemies but that's OK."
12,such a good way to waste time btw im a farmbot been at it for 1247 hrs
13,"yes
"
14,eh
15,"Rust is interesting blend of what i would say is a survival game and csgo. It requires a ton of skill to get settup and do stuff.

However, the way it is set up makes pushing down the lower people way too fuckin easy. Unless you get lucky theres almost no way to get better gear. Hemp is for some reason extremely rare and it makes it incredibly difficult to make sleeping bags (respawn points) or bows (a very good weapon but still just a bow).

The game is filled with these crazy sweats that go on genocide runs murdering people with literally nothing just to cause chaos and place pressure on people with less time, are new, or have just started. I played last night and i was literally spawn camped with ak47s, nail guns, snipers, all kinds of shit. Meanwhile this was a BEGINNER FRIENDLY SERVER. no deals were made, no words exchanged, no benefit gained on either side other than senseless violence in order to make me, a new player, feel like shit."
16,"most of my ""play time"" was just waiting to join a server only for my game to crash while loading"
17,"Thats the only ever recension i made about a game on Steam. And still after 1.2k hours i feel like a newbie... The greatest Gift that all out of gaming gave me troughout this Game was neither how good i could get, but rather the Friends i made along the way. I disminished stereotypes i had all along, and witnessed others to do the same vice-versa. Unforgettable Moments shaped our timebeeing side by side. This Game gave me more than Raids and Superiorety above Others. It gave me Friends and intercultural Exchange i could barely belelieve beein possible beforehand. I highly wish some of you are expereincing similar Stories. ""Its not about the Treasure you seek about finding in the End. Its about the Journey that leads you upon on IT"""

49,подняли цену
50,"Its alright, i guess."
51,"I love this game. Most of my time has been spent on an awesome Rust community called the <BAD> Rust community. I love how the servers are constantly improving and evolving and the community is fun to play with. They have weekly competitions to see who gets the most points in different categories like farming, gathering, pvp kills, npc kills, building, etc. And there is a weekly pvp event before wipe on their event server. It's a perfectly balaned rust experience and it's why I've logged so many hours.  They're growing and are bound to have tons of players one day."
52,Nice game
53,"people are mean, and people are nice.. mostly mean :/"

62,"Rust is great
"
63,"Dieses Spiel ist einfach legendär. Zu zweit, als auch allein ist es einfach ein cooles Abenteuer. Es macht immer mega viel Spaß. Ich habe das Spiel zwar noch nicht sehr lange, dafür habe ich teilweise bis zu 12 Stunden am Stück gezockt, weil es einfach so viel Spaß macht. :)"
64,"A game where you can do anything, but the world and players will stop you at every pass.

Rust is a game that can be insanely enjoyable and a challenge at every turn, but it is vital new players know what they are getting into. Getting into the game and getting start has a large barrier to entry as just getting past primitive tech can be an endeavor in and of itself. I would recommend anyone starting this game go in with a crew of people they know and have good tolerance. Friendship within the game is few and far between and you are most likely to get a bullet to the head than a friendly face.

Additionally, the risk of a raid is ever present. While it is possible to make deterrents, you are never truly safe. Every log in may inform you of your death while offline and all your hard earned progress stolen and reduced to rubble, With all that said, the highs of victory. the joy of a good find, or the elation of crafting your first firearm can be amazing. I would recommend anyone curious of the game enter tentatively and with the expectation that your progress can and eventually will be reset at any time.

Pros:
Gameplay is easy to understand and fairly intuitive
Obtaining progress is very fulfilling
Mods of the game are very quick on removing/banning cheaters.

Cons:
Dealing with other players can be annoying and frustrating.
Barrier to entry is a steep.
"
65,This is a very fun game!!
66,gg
67,good
68,only have 200 hours but it stilled made me miserable
69,Cargo Ship
70,guuuuuat
71,"The graphics are decent, my only qualms are the load speed entering a server and the numerous trolls that make game-play miserable. 

Another issue is that Rust is not newbie friendly, even after watching YouTube videos and googling tips and tricks, game-play does not make it easy to navigate the keys/controls as well as simple functions find safety. 

Other than that, once you figure things out and befriend kind players, it can be fun. I think the positive part of the social side of Rust is what keeps it enjoyable."
72,i don't know how to play this game
73,Toxic dogshit of a game!!!
74,not bad not bad
75,"i loved this but its not for the snowflakes
"
76,заспавнился чернышом
77,.
78,bad
79,its k ig
80,"I have a few hundred hours in Rust now. 
And in other games that would be a decent achivement.
On Rust this is just the beginning, 750 hours is just barely enough to be able to say that
you're ""ok"" at the game. My pvp still very much needs training, my building is still very much meh and i'll most likely still need 
about 2000 hours before i can say that i am ""decent"" in it.

So the pro's of Rust are:
Good game
A great time sink
Lovely way to build and farm.
Great fun if you stick to it. 
Most skins are great and cheap.

Cons: 
Loading times.
Quite a few cheaters.
Devs putting updates out that no one realy asked for.
Devs seem a bit delusional.
THE LOADING TIMES.

All in all great game, with a few bugs here and there.
If you enjoy loading into GTA 5 you'll love this game for sure. 
Also if you plan on playing just an hour, you'll take about 30 minutes to load up. 
Depending on your HDD / SDD´/ NVME that is ofc. 

Other then that 8/10 would get raided again."
81,it's grat! you will become a racist loot goblin. totally recommended!
82,very sexy game
83,Please don't get into this game
84,"Its like Minecraft, but you can raid others"
85,"really fun, just takes time to get big base
"
86,"Everyone called me a poopy head,untill i broke in their houses."
87,"Dont Be stupid with your main account -Sens, 2022"
88,Very good game
89,With the terrible loading times. This game is just not worth it.
90,i love jurking off to the naked women in this game 10/10 game
91,Stimpee experience on daily basis
92,"dont buy waste of money 
"
93,MUST PLAY
94,.
95,.
96,"Once you play it, you never stop."
97,"use to be fun till the devs started shooting crack into their veins
"
98,Regret buying it. Feeling addicted.
99,"Euphoric highs and manic lows, Rust will absolutely ruin your life if you let it"
100,"Don't play this game, if you do you wont be a normal human anomore."
101,will fucking kill you socialy
102,i like the naked people
103,"Astounding amount of racism in chat holy mother of god. You'll find great gems of nice peeps who will dance around and drive boats with you though :) Lotta cool peeps. Real fun game, usually not one for survival games myself but, Rust is pretty dang fun. Play with friends! Even more fun!"
104,"Awesome game 
"
105,"Very specific bug make this game unplayable. Usually I am waiting end of loading to see ""Press any button to wake up"" and no one button works ass ""any"". Reloading a few times connections to different servers to see same inscription ""Press any button to wake up"". Then just turn off the game..."
106,"I wake up on the beach,
I see a naked guy running around with a rock,
I kill him,
I Build a house, 
I Buy a computer and buy rust and start to devour my sleep schedule."
107,veri gud game for 40 euro

124,love it
125,makes me extremely disappointed in the human race. Fun game i guess though
126,my friend's rock looked like hamburger my rock did not look like hamburger i killed my friend now my rock looks like hamburger
127,"h
"
128,"If you VALUE YOUR TIME I would NOT recommend you to play this game.
It is heavily grind based, and it gets boring really fast.
But still, IT CAN get you on the hook. Because, it exploits human biology like in the way gamble machine does. For me it explains why people spending their time on this game in extreme manner. Risk is present all the time (not necessarily a fair one). Some times you won't have a choice to set up your ""bet"" and will have to go ""all in"". And no matter of outcome, win or lose, it's getting boring.

Few more words...

What's good:
- Crafting system is decent
- Electricity mechanic is good

What's bad:
- Game is boring, PVE elements and PVP doesn't save it.
- Events, puzzles, something doesn't click with them.
- Procedural maps do not make much of a difference, they look very same.
- Loading to a server takes a while
- Cartoonish vibe (compare to DayZ, but DayZ has much poorer craft/build mechanics)
- So called UPKEEP mechanic is really bad at the current moment 
(it forces you to connect to the server everyday if you have large/expensive base (Official servers))
- No MAIN win goal. It is probably just ""play more and dominate more"" (one of the reasons it gets boring even if you're getting better).

So in the end we have very grinding, mainly PVP game, that i would describe as minecraft_for_adults, with (!) cartoonish vibe, and the game forcing you to LIVE in it if you want to be good at it. And it feels like even if you are already good enough, you still need to live in it to have your fun.
...Not my recomendation. I'll leave it for those who like it...

Have a good one
"
129,👍
130,toxiccccccccccccc but so addicting
131,"Rust is an absolute nightmare (for most players). Or, its just as good as a therapy session. Killing screaming European kids is so soothing to me. The head shot crunch satisfies me. Over all I'd say beating in children's skulls is just a blast.... Maybe I should book a therapy session :/"
132,"Rust is amazing, simple."
133,over my first 100 hours of the game i spent the majority of it just learning the basic mechanics and overall just learning the game. It was most definitely very frustrating at times but after you learn the basics and have an idea of what to do its a very fun game.
134,"Rust was once a great game, I loved it. I had never put so much time into just 1 game before, I could play it for hours upon hours with friends. Over the years of playing from 2013 all the way to 2021, I had learned to perfect the recoil and become decently skilled at the game. 

Sadly over the last year, the dev's dropped a patch which absolutely fucked the gunplay and made it incredibly easy for anyone with 1 hour to 10k hours pick up a gun and just use it with no skill involved, just pull crouch pull down. It's sad for all the players who have put so much time into Rust, who took hours and hours to learn the recoil and become insanely skilled for it all to be taken away. 

I've tried to get back into the game, but it's just not fun anymore. I wish Facepunch would make it an option for some servers to enable old gunplay/sounds, but god knows if they ever will."
135,i hate this game
136,good game

256,"Rodarius Marcell Green (born August 27, 1998), better known as Rod Wave, is a platinum-selling recording artist originally from St. Petersburg, Florida.

Following the release of three albums under the Hunger Games series title, Rod rose to national prominence after dropping “Heart on Ice” in 2019. The track, a single for his album PTSD, peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 with assistance from TikTok and a viral Genius live performance.

Rod continued to garner critical acclaim with the release of Ghetto Gospel in November of 2019 and Pray 4 Love in April of the following year.

In June of 2020, he survived potentially life-threatening injuries after crashing into a pole at over 100 miles per hour. Recovering from internal brain bleeding, he reflected on his trauma on the track, “Through the Wire.” Pain, past and present, remains a recurring subject matter in his music.

In 2021, Rod released SoulFly, a 19-track project assisted by the singles “Street Runner” and “Tombstone.”"

This game ruined me, ruined my mental health, everything. I don't do anything anymore besides wake up and hop on this game until Im too tired to keep my eyes open. I cant tell you the last time I even stepped outside and got a little fresh air. its been months since ive even seen the sun. I tried to go to rehab for this and they basically laughed at me on the phone, I really don't know what to do."

320,"This is a GREAT game but the cheaters plague the game. I am not trying to act like I am ""good"" with only 860 hours but the amount of cheaters is astonishing. Im not talking about someone BEAMING you from hundreds of meters away. Those might just be ""skilled"" players. I am talking about sneaking up on someone and they are just waiting for you. They look at you through walls and should have no idea that you are even there. There is no element of surprise on rust. There are WAY too many situations where you are dead at the respawn screen asking yourself if that guy was cheating. You will never be the best in the lobby unless youre running a MASSIVE group. Youll never be like those solo rust videos you see on youtube. Just wont happen. This game has a LOT of potential but because of all the cheaters, Im finally done. The stress and toxicity isnt worth it. Save yourself the time and headache and just go play something else. This game used to be great in its golden era. But now every single last server you join will have some rage hacker who just walls, aimbots and raids all day. When that account gets banned, they make a new one and do it again. Rust isnt like other games where progression matters and will set even a hacker back. Hackers join in and immediately start snowballing. Admins in MOST servers are pretty non existent. Even in the larger servers where admins ARE present, youll see someone getting banned usually every hour for cheating. But heres the thing, they just get banned from THAT server. They are free to go plague another server until Facepunch eventually issues a perma ban. Seriously, unless you plan on playing in a PvE server(Which is PAINFULLY) boring, dont buy this game."

359,"This game might seem fun at first, you try to learn new things and think it will eventually be fun, and I disagree. The game has been made to survive with no point whatsoever, if you wanna survive then why not just build a little base in the forest and eat berries and shrooms all day long and sing&play songs  with that guitar you got off the crate in lighthouse? The people saying '' I'm friendly don't shoot'' will not  be friendly once they get guns and other advantages that make you superior to them. This game has wasted many days of my life and I wish I never heard about this game, and never told my friends about it.

He's forty years old. Receding hairline. A bit pasty.

He's not a guy we'd pay attention to if we passed him on the

Right now, we'd step the fuck out of his way.
Underpants man looks at the RV. End of the line for that.
He listens hard. Out of the silence, we hear .•• SIRENS.
They're faint, a few miles off -- but growing louder. Our
guy knows he's boned with a capital B. He HOLDS HIS BREATH
and leaps back inside the RV.
INT. WINNEBAGO - CONTINUOUS
A chrome 9mm is clutched in the hand of one of the dead
Mexicans. Underpants grabs it, tucks it in his waistband.
His unconscious passenger, still strapped in his seat, lets
out a groan. Underpants leans past him, yanks open the glove
box. He comes up with a WALLET and a tiny Sony CAMCORDER.
EXT. COW PASTURE - CONTINUOUS
Ducking outside, he starts breathing again. A short sleeve
DRESS SHIRT on a hanger dangles from the Winnebago's awning.
Underpants pulls it on. He finds a clip-on tie in the
pocket, snaps it to his collar. No trousers, unfortunately.
He licks his fingers, slicks his hair down with his hands.
He's looking almost pulled together now -- at least from the
waist-up. All the while, the sirens are getting LOUDER.
Underpants figures out how to turn on the camcorder. He
twists the little screen around so he can see himself in it.
Framing himself waist-up, he takes a moment to gather his

The sirens are WAILING now, on top of us. WALTER WHITE, the
underpants man, turns off the camcorder. He carefully sets
it on a bare patch of ground by his feet. Next to it he sets
his wallet, lying open where it can be seen.
CLOSE ON the wallet -- a photo ID card is visible. Walt's
smiling face is on it. It identifies him as a teacher at
J.P. wynne High School, Ontario Unified School District.
Walt pulls the chrome pistol from the back of his waistband,
aiming it across the tall weeds. It glints hard in the sun.
Flashing red LIGHT BARS speed into view, skimming the tops of
the weeds. Heading straight for us.
Walt stands tall in his underpants, not flinching. Off him,

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
No president ever slept here. No millionaire ever visited.
This is a three-bedroom RANCHER in a modest neighborhood.
Weekend trips to Home Depot keep it looking tidy, but it'll
never make the cover of ""Architectural Digest.""
We're in Ontario, California -- the Inland Empire. LEGEND:
""ONE MONTH EARLIER.""
INT. WHITE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Dark and silent. SKYLER WHITE, late 30s, sleeps peacefully.
Beside her, her husband Walter is wide awake.
Walt reaches over and presses a button on his Sharper Image
alarm clock. It projects the time in glowing blue numbers on
the cottage cheese ceiling: 5:02 AM.
Walt lies motionless. Brain churning. He presses the button
again, staring straight up. 5:02 turns to 5:03.
Close enough. Walt rises without waking his wife. He exits.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT
We hear an o.s. SQUEAK-SQUEAK as we drift through this room.
We pass an empty crib, Pampers, a baby monitor still in its
box. There's going to be a new addition to the family.
We come upon the source of the SQUEAKING. It's Walt balanced
on a Lillian Vernon stair-stepper, just three easy payments
of $29.95. Walt plods up and down in the darkness like he's
marching to Bataan.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Walt sits down on the 7dge of the tub. We're watching his
face in the bathroom Mlrror. He masturbates. Judging by his
expression, he might as well be waiting in line at the DMV.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Walt is dressed for work -- Dockers and a short-sleeve dress
shirt courtesy of Target. An American flag pin on his tie.
He and Skyler eat their breakfast in silence.
Skyler glances up, sees Walt puzzling over his bacon.
SKYLER
Sizzle-Lean. We need to think
about our cholesterol.
WALT
Huh.
Skyler's cute in a way most guys wouldn't have noticed back
in high school. But not soft-cute. Not in the eyes.
She's dressed for staying home -- she's five months pregnant
and just beginning to show.
SKYLER
When'll you be home?
WALT
Same time.
SKYLER
I don't want him dicking you around
tonight. You get paid till six,
you work till six. Not seven.
Seventeen year-old WALTER, JR. enters the kitchen, dressed
for school, hair still damp from the shower. The CLICK •••
CLICK of his forearm crutches precedes him into the room.
Walt and Skyler's son is a sweet-faced teenager who appears
to have cerebral palsy. He moves slowly and awkwardly, and
grinds his teeth as he labors to talk. But he's a smart kid.

Hey.
Just seating himself at the table is a trial for Walter, Jr.

479,"Rust is a great, well written, pure piece of innocent fun and camaraderie. Spawned naked on a beach with nothing but a rock, you seek out on an adventure to cook meth and find Heisenburg. Based in Alexandria, you find Rick Grimes early on in a breath-taking adventure. Personally I have never had more fun upgrading my sniper monkeys and taking out the camo balloons that threaten my base and way of life. This game has quite literally moved me to tears...not because of the incredible story telling and heart breaking scenes, but because of the insurmountable time that has been ripped away from me. All I wanted was to farm sulfur on a remote island with Bryan Cranston, but instead I get a plate full of dirt, and a clan of newborns who somehow tracked me down across the map to foundation wipe me. All in all, it was a great experience, fighting off the dead and establishing my own community, and family I can come home to at night. Rust has built me up as a character, a survivor, much like negan of the walking dead series. But just as easily, as torn me down just like negan from the walking dead series. I love Heisenburg, but the devs refuse to let me reunite with my lover. If there is one tip I can give to new Rust players, is to watch out for the white walkers that periodically invade Alexandria. I wake up in cold sweats because of Rust, but Rust has also impregnated me with a love that none can beat, Heisenburg."

494,"Peashooters and sunflowers are essential for the early game, but you should be fine once you get the repeater and wall-nut, you should be good. The Zen garden really calms me down and I love the benefits of being able to get coins from marigolds when I take care of them. It’s nice to see the smiles on their faces. I love this game since it brought me so much nostalgia, and is just good overall. Cattail is broken and needs nerfing, but other than that, looks good. 8.5/10, would play more, WILL play more, ratio, L bozo, there’s a zombie on your lawn, XD lmao, counter ratio, cancelled."

511,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

513,"My first hours on Rust was sneaking in forest with bow, hiding in darkness & shadows. 
Trying to survive. And maybe even get my hands on precious Loot.

Rust really gave me some memorable & fun moments:))

522,"I've sank wayyyyyy more hours of my life into this game than I would like to admit.  However, if you're on a PvE server (as I typically am), it's a great way to blow off some steam/mindlessly adventure while listening to some music or a podcast.  Have played a few PvP servers and don't really care for 'em (because MURDER). I'm not quite as good or invested in FPS' as others tend to be, but Rust is definitely an interesting world to visit."

If you are looking for a game where you spend hours on end trying to find and craft things to progress just for no life players to destroy you and take all your hard earned loot in minutes... then this is the game for you. Also, don't forget that all your progress is wiped every few weeks. I wish I could say this game is great but it seriously misses the mark for me."

595,"Friends, I have a confession: 

I sold all of my Rust Skins for Ground Branch. Then found out Ground Branch wouldn't crest 30FPS on a 1080TI so I returned it and bought Ready or Not. Then I couldn't play Ready or Not without having an AED near my desk because I got jumpscared so many times. And then I used the rest of the money to buy Shark Cards in GTA and cheap sim games. 

Long story short, I play Rust until the AK kids come, and then I go play something else for 6 months until the nostalgia kicks in.

As a good friend once said: Rust is bad for the brain. So can I recommend it? I don't know. You decide.

639,i enjoy this game as a whole there is a lot of choices on how you play you will run into cheaters here and there but the admins are quick to get rid of them. you will also die a lot and find a lot of toxic people but the ones that are friendly do anything you can to keep them by your side a lot of terrible and great moments already with this game its a frustrating one but also rewarding. if you do play be prepared to spend a great amount of time on here. it takes a lot to keep your base up depending on how you build but take time to learn to shoot and build those are the most important

676,"This is a great game for someone who loves competitive environments. 
There is a server for each play-style, whether it's PVP, PVE, creative, role-play, and many more. 

For PVE (and inevitable PVP), there are many ""monuments"" that are inhabited by armed scientists whom are guarding treasure whether it be in a time-locked box or hidden behind doors that require a key-card you've gotten by running another monument. There are different monuments varying in amount of scientists and difficulty of survival. 

For creative folks, there are many servers that will allow you to focus on making an aesthetic base while having to do little to none of the farming for you designed masterpiece. 

For folks that enjoy role-playing there are a few active servers that have a small community dedicated to this. They are quite like little societies, in where they have laws, events, hotels, shops, and a small community.

While the community is generally pretty kind on role-play servers, the other server's communities are pretty hit or miss. You can meet some nice people. You can also meet some rather unpleasant folks. If I'm being entirely transparent, you can expect some blatant disrespect when you are bested; but that's video games for you! 

All in all, it's a good game for someone who enjoys survival games and a challenge. While this is a game that can be enjoyed solo, there are strengths to forming alliances; Strength in numbers. One of the best parts of the games is managing to find someone you can build trust with in the game. You can build large compounds and raid others. You can roam the map and find unsuspecting farming players, who've been kind enough to take the hard work out of farming for you."

Starting off with almost nothing, then after an hour you have already got a base, not only that but a big part of this game is clans, forming groups and massive clans and raiding other people cannot be more fun. Rust is a very large game and I believe there is nothing wrong with it."

739,"
My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

792,"TL;DR: A great game for anyone who is equipped to handle a moderate amount of toxicity.

What a great game this has become.
When I picked the game up in 2017 it was not a lot more than it's incredibly toxic community, but over the years Facepunch has made something absolutely incredible out of it.
The pacing has evolved into something great, since with a lot of Updates came a lot of new features and what was once a game where you could only build bases and kill your own has steadily become a game full of different Monuments with PvP and PvE content, there is Wildlife and Scientists that attack you every chance they get and there is also a lot of other Players roaming around that also attack you every chance they get.
The amount of great experiences I have had in Rust is just insane, I have made friend and enemies, farmed countless hours just to get revenge and raided with neighboring Zergs I hardly even knew all in all I have a lot of good memories from all my time in this game.
Although the Community is still probably one of the most toxic on the Internet, a good Neighbor is found or a great friend is made on almost every Wipe. If you look hard enough and if you can stomach 5-8 toxic people to find someone with whom you can play countless hours and have fun just so that they betray you in the end and change all the codes to your base, then this is just the game for you.

833,"I have played many games like this one and by far the best experience after the 300 hours I have played. There's toxic elements but you have to expect that when playing online, PvP is balanced and fair with constant new updates.

840,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

The game plays well and feels good to play. The only problem is that everything is so mechanically min-maxed by people with 3k hours that if I log out of my stone base for literally two hours I'll come back to have everything demolished and have to start again (this is on wipe day).

The gameplay loop is compelling, but it has become clear that you'll need to endure a lot to become halfway decent at the game.

I'm going to continue playing on and off, trying again on new servers and wipes, but I feel like this is a problem of it being a hardcore survival game that is getting close to a decade old."

965,"toxic, not rewarding in any sense, 9-5 play style required, have to have foreigners or no lives in clan or else you'll get offlined while you sleep, have to race inland, but if your not one of the first off wipe good luck, official is best, however it's not great, 2x-x servers are just rust battle royale, you will face racism and other forms of toxic chat, but that's any online game with prox vc, so i'm not going to complain about people being people when you can just hunt and wipe said people clean. overall, would not recommend, so much so that i would actually recommend not watching rust content as well. i fell into this game from a yt video and i will tell you rust does not play anything like what you may have watched. unless it was a 'raiding toxic kids/clan' type video, then yeah your experience may play somewhat close to what you've watched, but other than that Rust is an all around negative experience and i would not recommend you dump hours into this game bc you will have nothing to show for it."
966,"donated my life to this game and I don't regret it, I have bare memories with my big boy @phodog07. This game brought me and @phodog07 closer than I could ever imagine. I know more about this man (little boy) than anyone else. He is my best friend because of this game. We watched movies about this game together whilst snuggling under a blanket. Then we grinded the game for 25 hours a day. Rust became my life. I would wake up and think about rust, I would sleep and dream about rust. I use to attend meetings with @phodog07 where we would dress up as rust characters and get freaky. I miss the days of lockdown where we would play this game whilst teachers taught us important life skills. Sometimes a person called @ryanhall1902139 would join and these would be the best wipes. Me, @phodog07 and @ryanhall21930231 would become the best trio known in the game. @ryanhall2931821 actually introduced me to the game and I am forever thankful for that. Me and @phodog07 do not speak as much as we used to as the game became dead and pretty shit tbh. But nonetheless I am forever grateful for the time I got to spend with @phodog07 playing this game. I still remember random wipes and the laughs and giggles they would bring us. Even though we were both terrible at the game and @phodog07 would usually rage off after I kill him in our base it would only bring us closer. It was about 7 months in when I began to gain feelings for @phodog07 and eventually would propose to him. He said no and called me a freak and we stopped speaking for a month or two. Until we hopped back on the game and grinded none stop once again. This, after fortnite, minecraft, do you know de way, gorky 17 and monopoly might be the best game I have ever owned. I wish I could play one more wipe with @phodog07. I really miss how close we were. Now I realise how lonely I am. I often spend all day alone with no one to talk to. This is where I'd typically bell my man @phodog07 up and we'd hop back on the grind. But we can longer do that as his pc blew up and it wont be able to run this game. I dont think he'll ever invest the money back in order to get a new gpu as that time has unfortunately passed. However, I will always cherish the time I spent on this game. I have never laughed as much as I have during this time. Thank you @phodog07 and @ryanhall21736123 for all the time we spent together. My best wipe was with @ryanhall21392103 and @twisted. This was the wipe that @phodog07 actually got the game but we locked him in the base and never let him leave. I'm surprised he didn't just refund the game at that point but thank god he didn't. I hope one point we can return to the game, it's a shame that won't be any time soon. I love this game."
967,"personally, as a female, i find this game vv fun, you may even get free stuff from people, as long as you're a female. I usually carry my bf bc im just better in every way, and he mostly just learns from me. To any girl playing this game, i wish you the best of luck bc you'll get slandered by men just bc you have bobs (even tho half of them do, they just don't wanna admit it <3)"

It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as RUST. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how RUST is done!"

972,gud
973,Unplayable. I'm sure it will work for some but for me and many others when logging into a server the incoming network traffic drops to zero and you cannot wake your character up. I have submitted in game bug reports. I know for a fact that chat is not open in the background which will cause the same problem. It just wont work. Half of the 1000 hrs it says i have played are actually me just trying to get the game to function. when it does its great but then when i try to log into the server that did work it fails again and all my progress is lost.
974,best game ever
975,"


Inspired by youtubers to try this after passing thus far, what a mess. Gotcha mechanics and deliberate tedium just ruin the early game. Poorly optimized. Giant hit boxes, clipping everywhere, silly physics. Its like the developers had a great idea but werent great at the actual implementation. Its ok once you get built up but far too tedious to get there for what this game offers at endgame.

I expected to be bothered more by the chads preying on noobs, but the game itself man. The worst performing game Ive ever encountered for real. Its like its barely hanging on sometimes., even wayyy past rec specs. Someone with talent please remake this game."

1051,"This is one of the funnest games I have ever played and I still love playing it, but I would not recommend people to get. Rust is fun but also extremely addictive and I didn't realize that when I started playing and It really held me back to do more things out in the real world. It made my rust experience more as an escape than a game."

1063,"This game was genuinely probably the best and most fun game I had ever played. I played from 8th grade to freshman year of highschool, spending hours just grinding and trying to become better at every moment. Rust had something no other game could boast and that was a learning curve that surpassed natural talent. Sure, with any game more practice is great, but in rust there was no way there would be some god off the bat and it took hours, weeks, and years to become even alright at the game. Now they have taken that away and that is why I have fully stepped away from the game and will continue to abstain until it is renewed to it's former glory."

If you have a group of friends who likes PvP/FPS/Survival and build bases, this is the game for you and I guarantee you it will be epic.

Really good, recommended.

1085,"Minecraft is now more challenging.. Hardest game on steam my fuckin ass!! What a joke.. Every ""update"" is a nerf....And how the fuck does everyone go from 130 odd fps to 55fps the moment they hit a tree, open inventory or shoot one bullet.. They can't come back from this; almost feels intentional, like rust was doing too well so they had to kill it to give other games a chance in steams top 10.. Well hopefully rust will be a footnote in gaming history on what not to do to a video game..

1114,"The thing I like about Rust is that the community is dog shit, game is unfun and runs like it was coded by a helicopter.
Best part is when they sold the game with a native GNU/Linux binary and then stopped supporting it and refused to refund or allow that community to the play said dog shit game.
-1/10 good way to waste your limited life force."
1115,Never really enjoyed it since the community is so toxic. i remember i gave this game a shot few times since i enjoy the building an survival games. The PVP part in this game is ruff. even as a new person the people on the map never let you get started before your noticed. Even offering to help clans as a newbie gets you killed. so unless your part of a big group don't waste your time in this game. its for the toxic.

1130,"I've been playing rust since the early days, and let me tell you there is not a single game in my library whose dev team is as dedicated and creative as the rust developers at face punch. 11/10 game. Even though i purchased rust on sale way back when it could be found for just 15 sheckles, its well worth the $40 price tag it is now. Get this game if you love randomness, competitive attitudes, social interaction (or lack there of) and the ability to truly do whatever the hell you want. A community like no other and a unique ability to make your week nights vanish.

I love rust,  you will too.

Unless your on mac. . ."
1131,"Sooooooo Freaakkin GoooD :) Why could I not be here from the start feelsbadman BUT, yeah this game is great, I would suggest finding some ppl/friends to play w/. Def makes game funnier, and there is so much shit to do, its good to have some exp. players to figure out kind of what is important, most valuable, etc etc. 

Low key, never thought I'd be playing a survival/crafting/fps as my main game, but unless this is just some crazy new gamer bliss I'm experiencing, I'll be adding this to full time stream schedule along with Warzone 2 and some other variety. 

Softcore server has been great for first raid as well. Highly recommended if have no experience.

Until whoever makes this game work like the superior games of the world, such as Eve Online, MineCraft, Fortnite, this game doesnt deserve to even be on ""steam"".

1346,"I tried out this game, only to find out that my account was randomly selected to use only female character models, and this can never change even after switching servers.  As if this wasn't bad enough, a quick google search reveals the developers intentionally made this decision, knowing that it was unpopular with the players.  Of course they don't tell you this before you buy the game.  Based on this experience, I'll never buy another Facepunch game.  This one seemed like all hype anyway."

1414,"Once you learn how to fit in to the ""trust no one"" toxic culture of Rust, you learn to love it. Id recommend looking up what the rookie mistakes are to avoid in the game (since the mistakes can cost you your entire base). The combat and rush you get from fights in this game is unmatched since everything is at stake in every fight. Only thing that sucks is putting in the hours then getting offline raided but there's ways to outsmart the raiders and plenty of traps you can set up; sometimes still isn't enough though so be warned. I never did the mobile phone notification route but if you are that committed, there's that option. 
Overall, this is one of the best, most well rounded games that is out right now if you can commit to the hours of game play it takes to find a good server, then to learn a good base design and strategy to prosper in the world of Rust."

1506,"Being a man who has a lot of sex at all times, I can say that this game is 100% similar to having sex with a woman, as I always do. Obviously this game did not make me horny. I'm not gay, I have plenty of sex with real women to spend 15 minutes with. On the other hand, I would like to recommend this game to people who don't have sex (not like me, because I have a lot of sex with women, a lot) as if there is a naked woman there and she is naked. One character looks like one of my several girlfriends with whom I had a lot of sex. I've had a lot of sex. I'm also very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because I'm very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. All my girlfriends say I am very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. One of my crushes asked me to have sex with her, but I told her I was playing a sex game and she started crying and became a lesbian and committed suicide because I didn't have sex with her. I have sex with women, not men, I am not gay. I am very cool and handsome, so girls always want to have sex with me because I am very cool and sexy. My penis is very big. All my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and I am very good at sex and I am. I have a lot of sex. I am also handsome and sexy and I have sex."

1557,Ive been playing this game for along time.. and it really is a game for all types of players.. if you dont like pvp theres pve servers for you and if you do love pvp.. this game is great for that... it is an all around good game.
1558,"Let me start by saying I have played Rust since it was playable in your browser & it is truly insane to see how far the game has come from that point. I'm someone who for the longest time refused to switch over to current Rust and instead tried so hard to keep Rust Legacy alive and breathing, however, just a few years ago I finally folded and gave it a try and I was shocked! Facepunch had poured their hearts and souls into this game for years at this point, and just when I think the game is already beyond great, they add something new or make changes that actually strongly improve the flow of the game.

Rust is a STRONG recommend for any PC gamer out there, it's up there with the giants such as Counter-Strike at this point and it's well deserved, albeit, the game is one that is daunting to play as a Solo. I am aware there are Solo based servers but they heavily restrict alliances and making friends as you go, but when you play a normal Official Server on average people will chase you down even if you're just starting (naked). Playing with people, whether it be 2-8 can be a blast however and with all the various ways to gain scrap/mats nowadays you can easily get top tier loot and compete against the bigger clans. I do genuinely love getting into a Rust wipe every now and again, allowing it to consume the vast majority of my free time and you will find if you gave it a shot how insanely time consuming the game can be. Now that's referring to Official servers, there are tons and tons of modded/community based servers that allow for a more casual experience, even ranging from big team battles similar to Battlefield games, gun game like CS or CoD, Team Deathmatch and more! 

Definitely a must buy for anybody on Steam in my honest opinion and worth spending some time in, the Devs love this game as the players do as well!"
1559,best game ever!!!!!!!
1560,lots to do in the game lots of fun
1561,Great survival game + hilarious salty toxic players = good fun! Don't forget to catch some of the great streamers as well.

1571,nice game 👍
1572,this game is so good but just a warning you will get killed a lot even if you have nothing they will still kill you trust me it is annoying but just keep going you got this
1573,"i'd recommend this game to anyone who genuinely doesn't want a social life. i'd recommend this game to my enemies so they'd have to suffer through this game the same way the entire player base does, all in all i still play it but its hard to have a good experience without no lifing the game all day everyday. recent recoil update makes the game too easy for new player including myself when it comes to gunfights. the fact my first time picking up an ak i outgunned someone with an lr at 200m full auto is sad. maybe he was just bad, or maybe the recoil is too easy im not quite sure."
1574,it is a very realistic game and is just fun in general.
1575,fun
1576, takes 2 hours to load in the game?
1577,Stop asking me to say the game is good... it is.  There I said it.  Play it if you want to have fun.  Molest yourself if you don't....

1579,got a game ban dad came back
1580,w
1581,I really enjoy rust but hate getting offlined and getting door camped but overall really fun game to play.
1582,"Maybe if you're more familiar with survival first person shooters the experience would be different. Maybe I'm the dumb one. But I've played this for long enough that I feel like I should have gotten something out of this experience by now.

The crafting, looting, and building mechanics are very well thought out. They're satisfying and simple with enough complexity to never be boring. There's enough breadth to feel spanning, enough depth to feel meaningful, and the shallow end is enough to be interesting on its own. But the main core of the gameplay, the pvp. The raids. Even updated to be more friendly to people like me its brutal.

Everyone you meet feels like they have a thousand hours and twenty friends who play this game. You lose as a matter of course, and in that small percentage of times when you win you get killed by your targets friends or a third party. In almost thirty hours of any game you expect to feel somewhat comfortable in a role, even if it's the role of a beginner. Here you don't. I'm sure at some point you do, but I can't recommend this because the newer player experience is awful and it stays awful for entirely too long.

I don't think I've ended a session of this game feeling good about the time I've spent."

1618,"The Concept is good but Unturned did it way better. This game has built up a toxic fanbase that ruins the fun inside and outside the game. The community is filled with racist, sexist and generally toxic people that try and ruin fun and other peoples enjoyment in the game. With Unturned it had less content but it was generally more fun and spent way more hours playing that then this toxic game That basically promotes being an asshole. Just because this game is meant to be a loot and base raiding game (which is to be honest really flawed), shouldnt mean you be toxic to everyone around you.

Pve servers are boring because there is no gameplay, The whole aspect to this game is collect resources and with those resources ruin everyones fun with it. otherwise, Some other asshole is going to ruin the fun for you. Thats basically it. Unturned did it better PVE wise because at least you have another objective other than fighting eachother."

1692,"If you love being screamed at by kids that they're going to come back with C4 and rockets - or finding that a group can overwhelm you when you're solo - this game isn't for you. Whilst it's good for PVP, there is a lot of griefing to be had."
1693,its a worst copy of ark but its still fun and has less bugs
1694,GOOD
1695,its a challange its fun
1696,"i had a lot of hope when first joining rust; it seemed like a great looking game. I had been looking for a multiplayer post-apocalyptic game to play; it seemed like just the thing since there is quite a limited variety of  games that serve this purpose. I was wrong. dead wrong. lets start with the obvious. griefers. as a ""naked"" which these griefers affectionately call us it is a shark eat shark world. if you are lucky (very lucky) enough to get a shotgun early on: (which so few of us are lucky enough) you can hold your own. but those who are not lucky enough get killed on site by people who argue that because it is a PVP game it doesnt matter; but it does when you can't even start the game and get ahead with a community as toxic as this one.  people will attack you on site for the simple crime of being a ""naked"" and call you a ""noob"" for not being good at the game yet. I say it is impossible to become good at the game when people do not give you the chance to get good at it. 
    becoming a pro at anything takes practice, and without the chance to practice things such as building, and crafting, and arming yourself you cannot ""get good"" at the game. It seems that only the lucky ones get ahead and if you are as unlucky enough as I was in this game you will be killed relentlessly as a solo player. even more so that I don't have friends who play this game. however unlike these griefing nutjobs and their Micro cocks attacking me on site I actually have friends in real life and don't have hours to spend on a game that keeps resetting your character so you have nothing upon death unless you have had adequate time to farm resoources to build at the very least a cottage of sorts to hold items in; (newsflash) griefers won't even give you time to do that and they can even break into your home and take all of your hard earned belongings. this game was not built so that people could have a good time and experiencine truly surviving an apocalypse. it was built so that mean people could ruin your fun and make up for the little manhood they have by killing you. ten out of ten would NOT suggest this for someone who wants to play a multiplayer apocolypse game. it is simply impossible to have a fair shot at even starting the game. "
1697,rock
1698,This game is good and awesome guns skills nature humans animals vehicles and more but one thing i really want them to add is a single player game mode that where you can learn the game more easily and also have fun with yourself a little bit.It can be better if you be able to invite you friend to come and join your single player too.
1699,i hate nakeds
1700,The highs in this game are never worth the lows of spawning in and being camped by machine guns when you have a rock. If you play solo this game is pointless.
1701,i hate this game i want a refund 12/10
1702,Good
1703,Incredible i can see myself spending a lot of time in this game
1704,yummy just cummed
1705,"Dont download this game until you are ready. This is not for beginners. No tutorial, no help... YOU NEED TO SURVIVE any means necessery. You will find people and their deeepest emotions: Lie, backstab, bait, swearing, cry, shout and more. You nedd to prepare yourself. you need to be ready at all times.
practice... practice gun recoil, som basic base building (bunkers, wide gaps, loot rooms), heli flying necessery.
If you are in a team, choose your teammates, practice tactical movement. Get used to your hot bar... such as what numpad you have gun or guns, wall, meds or tools for a quick grap. miliseconds can decide wheter your hours of preparation was worth or loose"

There's plenty of modes that make the game easier and enough of a challenge that it stays super fun, so you're definitely in for a treat with this game."

1766,"this game used to be good... have played 3500 hours across 2 accounts. slowly over the past few years they have been ruining the game with shit updates and then recently they removed the only thing that was making the game fun, the skill gap. shit game now, handed my mouse and keyboard to my grandma and she killed 4 full metal AK kids and i only gave her a sar. awful awful game, no skill in it anymore whatsoever, also ram packed with ESP and scripters. devs are also braindead and dont listen to community input."
1767,Dont. Just Dont. The Small pinches of greatness are not worth the sea of suffering. Run as far as you can and never look back. Make some new friends. Go outside. Find a new hobby you enjoy. You will never regain the countless hours you burn away here. Dont be like us. Dont make our mistakes. 11/10

1772,Do you hate a life outside of video games? Then this is the game for you! You will spend hours farming the road for that tier 2 workbench and finally you have enough scrap! Then a 10 man with aks roll over the hill and before you can even realize your situation youre already dead! Leading you right back to that starting point you were almost done with! That being said i love this game and i hate life outside of my comfy home. Buy it....or dont i dont really care but its fun to me!

1786,"god help me, for my hours will only grow from this point onwards"
1787,"Sadly my bad PC can't handle this game properly, so I can't actually play this game like it should, however it is still really fun with friends, and even better if you are on a server with basically just your friends. In generaly I would give this game a 7/10 because of it's replay ability and it's advance in teamwork. But it has major problems with low-end PC's like mine which has to run it with low graphics and no external applications open."
1788,good good gem

1793,"I am a 51 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, joined a server and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and we went in to a server and played together. loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

Died not less than 10 times in that short span.  It seems this is what some people like so I'm not going to down-vote the game, but I do very deeply regret having spent my money on it."

1859,Great game to play in a group solos kinda harsh and the recent Gun recoil update the sounds and sprays or recoil of all the guns seem to be a lot easier for more casual people. But also making it even easier for the more skilled players as well so its a decent balance to get more variety of people playing.

1902,"It starts off with learning base designs, then you get addicted to perfecting your recoil. And then they go and change it so all 500 hours that you sunk into perfecting that 150M AK Beam? Useless. AND THEN ON TOP OF ALL THAT, RUST IS NOT AT ALL IMPRESSIVE TO WOMEN. EVER SINCE I STARTED PLAYING THIS GAME WOMEN CROSS THE STREET WHEN THEY SEE ME. MY OWN MOTHER WONT EVEN LOOK ME IN THE EYE ANY MORE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

Would recommend 10/10"

What is there not to love about a game that let's you learn to be an electrician one day to being a thief the next! Come venture with us on Rust!

2072,I have too many hours in this stinkin game and the devs are making it worse and worse.. still worth it but is it still gonna be enjoyable after a little while after couple more updates???? Most likely not. Devs should uninstall the game and leave it be! but instead they are making the players to unistall.
2073,a very good method to waste your time and money

2076,"You will die a lot, you'll die and lose a lot of progress each time. Your only choice is to get better, and spend a while on the wiki looking at how to make things and damage charts, weapons, explosives, how to get them and make them. 

There are relaxed, PVE servers but I imagine there are other games more fun for that. The main point of this long term is the PVP."
2077,"Its got a huge skill roof that you would need to break ASAP if you want to advance at all in the game. Its very realistic and it requires you to pour time and effort. While you're farming as a naked or skirmishing with other players as a geared player, anything can happen ranging from losing the battle and losing a lot of stuff to losing items you farmed. The whole point of this game however is to lose and rebuild back up. Will you be on the top of the skill chain of the server, or will you be easy pickings for the higher-ups of the server?"
2078,yessss mate
2079,"This game will literally take your life over, finding food is more rare than an ak. if you buy Rust beware that you are at extreme risk of high blood pressure, losing your home/job (because rust will become your job), and you will risk being mentally unstable. proceed with caution. :)"
2080,i hope you fix this update . I put a stack of 50 fuel in the oil refiner and only 17 shows up and i lost the rest.

2108,"This game was good back in the days when the old recoil was still in game now noobs can destroy you easly not even spending time on the game the new ui furnace update is dogshit u need to wait 20 years to smelt ur shit they are removing great mechanics (headglitch the steps 60 thing).Also the new gun sounds are dogshit as well.

I like the fact that back in the days u need to spend some time on the game learning some mechanics recoil patterns etc.
Now as i said the recoil patterns are easier than cs go patterns thats destroying the magic of this game.
Back then when i was watching my favorite rust streamers,ytubers i was so exited that they were hitting triple hs from 200 meters now everyone can do that shit.
Now u will win fights only when you first peek and hold an angle or you are with like 10+ ppl in a clan"

2124,"Played on PS4 and PS5, first time playing it on PC and there really is no comparison. PC is the clear winner. With the amount of updates in the game and Admins on modded servers keeping up with the hackers just make it a fun game to play. Also, my Mom now loves me more after playing this game.... I don't know if the two are related but who cares, right?

2301,i like a what it a do... da game make me do da cha cha and i like. i recommend.
2302,"This game is generally pretty good and I've had a really fun time playing it. However it is horrendously unoptimised. I know my setup isn't the best and the maps I was playing on weren't the easiest to handle either. But still. I am barely able to run the game at 40 fps with lowest quality settings at 1080p with screentearing and huge lagspikes. All this while with 5-10 minute start up times and 10-20 miute load in times. in comparison; I can start up Halo Infinite in 3 minutes and play with stable 60-80 fps at high settings. and 20 second load in times for matches. Similarly it takes me 3 minutes to start up dishonored 2/disonored doto and I can play it at stable 60 fps with high settings and 15 second load times. Just recently the game has started crashing not only itself but the whole of steam as well. It's kind off a 50/50 gamble if I'll be able to start the game without crashing and I'll be able to play for at most 30 minutes before it crashes again, if it didn't crash after loading in. I've tried solutions to these issues suggested online, like verifying the game files, but so far it hasn't helped.

Developers, if you're reading this, please fix your game.

2306,I only recommend this if you enjoy not having a good time and don't have family/friends.
2307,good
2308,"you want a game that is toxic, racist, mentaly braking that dose not give a fuck if you are new to the game, welcome to rust."
2309,Its a good game but there is no servers for solo players. If you want to play solo and like getting demolished by teams of 5 every 10 minutes this is your game. You could kill them all tho you only need about 4k hours to get that good.

2354,"After almost 5k hours, I have some thoughts.  This game is what we always dreamed about for decades.  A game you could get your friends together and battle it out as a group against up to 600 other players.  This battle for supremacy lasts up to a month.  You will have stories about the back and forth battles between you and zerg clans, toxic kids, and relentless opponents.  With a group, you can be a specialist too.  you can be a builder, fly, dive/boat, grind, farm, trade, or whatever skill best helps out your team.  It's an amazing achievement and there's nothing like it.   If you're gonna play official or similar ""big"" servers, it's not for the weak.  You'll want to aim train.  Smaller, community type servers can be chill and a great way to explore the landscape and defeat the ai vehicles, ai, and monument characters.  You might just make a few friends along the way."
2355,This game is terrible.
2356,not for the faint of heart

2437,"The game is fun, However the community that plays it is extremely toxic, Pretty much everyone in the game grieves new players and rarely do not let them start out, constantly killing them repeatedly even though they are naked with a stone and torch.

There are very few pve servers that ban raiding and grieving other players. The building and gathering is great when you fin a good server where people are cool. raiding locations and killing npc's iare hard without guns and guns are extremely hard to get because the older players camp the locations and get them all. 

the game would be more enjoyable if it didnt have the pvp in the game."

2483,"It doesn't feel like more than 1400 hours have been recorded in my playing history of rust, in the last 4 months since i own this game.

The first time i entered this game, i did not understand what was actually being done in this game, i only found a main character who was completely naked while carrying stones and torches that suddenly appeared on the beach. Hours passed and i began to understand what was in this game, and when i started to understand this game, i said that this is the best game i have ever found in my life (although basically i'm not a pure gamer).

My curiosity and addiction to this game continues to emerge even though i say that i have fully understood what is in this game, unlike other games in rust fps, shooter, survival, pvp, pve, building, farming are presented and packaged very well which gives a different feel when i try other games that are even said to be similar, almost everything i like and expect in a game is in rust. So yeah, because of the many features that also make everyone who plays can't spend a short time, because there are many things to do in the game to be enjoyed in the fastest time possible to excel in the game. And well, ever since i started playing and addicted to this game, my time is very much taken without notice, and my work is affected by it because i am also a person who doesn't have a time bond set or set by others so i'm free to decide what i should to do and what i want to ignore makes me spend time in this game imperceptibly.

Because it started from curiosity in myself, basically i'm just a solo player trying hard to excel in the game and survive in the wilderness life in rust, although sometimes i realize that i need to play with other teams and people but what do i need? chase is to answer my curiosity about every thing i have to do alone. Since playing this game i have many new friends and joined many teams and yeah, it is very fun when you are decided to play games with your friends without feeling lonely, fun or various drama i have been through a lot in this game, and that's the thing which gives a sense in playing the game.

Now one more thing that makes me more curious is about cheats, many players throw words about a cheater in the game, whether it's words to defend themselves because they feel lost to each other or it's really true, i want to know about, is there really a cheat in this game.

So yeah, because i'm just an amateur looking for everything based on the top browser results, i found a site that rents out their cheat services, to be precise, esp, i immediately tried and wanted to know if it was true that esp was in this game. And yes, cheats do exist in this game, i found i had access to see what i shouldn't be able to see in normal mode, in conditions of cheat features that didn't match what the seller said i was a little hesitant and repeatedly complained to the seller about this, but what they say in my opinion is just bullshit, because i think the cheats they sell are not perfect.

In the end i found my account was suddenly banned by the developer because i found cheating within a day after i used the cheat although not more than 2 hours, i tried many things after i found that i was banned from playing Rust and at least 5 new accounts have been banned too because of the strict ban that has been given to me.

Now, in my opinion is yes, the cheat/esp really exist in this game even though i haven't used that feature in a long time but i also don't want to try other products and don't want to try hard to be able to play the game anymore.

I've decided maybe this is the right time for me to take a break from this game. It's time to back in real life for me, and it's time for me to get married soon, and think about a family in the future.

However, rust is a treasure i've ever found in my life. Thanks to rust, and my friends in-game have filled my dark days, maybe rust will be my secret treasure that i might find come back later when i feel iRL is so tired."

2505,"I have played many games and avoided this one for a long time.  I finally decided to try it and while the game play is good, the game is totally hacked.  I constructed a base and had electronic locks on it, and found the electronic lock hacked and marked with hackers markings.  I looked into it and there are literally sites out there that sell hacking upgrades and hacking defenses for this game.  Honestly, it is totally corrupted and if Steam had some integrity, they would remove it form their platform."

2519,"Rust. The ""most challenging survival game."" This game has drained me mentally and physically. I have almost a years play time and it has honestly taken an entire years worth of social life away from me. I stopped playing in May of 2022 because the developers do not know how to update or maintain their game properly. Face-punch makes themselves look horrible due to all the updates that favor the ""new players"" or the ""role-playing."" Rust is not that hard if you just put a bit of time into learning the game. We all start somewhere with it. The game has to many different things that the developers add instead of fixing the game with the fps issues, the lack of optimization to the game, the exploits, and glitches. The developers add new things to the game instead of listening to their player base and fixing the common issues among-st all the players. Over the last 3 months - 2 years they have been babying the player base and not hearing what the longtime vets recommend. Overtime, friends and I have become extremely disappointed with this game. It is no longer enjoyable like it used to be, and has become to easy for the new players to get a jump on it. Most of the time you would have new groups with people over 1k hours, but now, you have people joining groups with like 200 hours on an aim train server because they can ""shoot an AK."" This game has become nothing but aim, and no brain. Face punch has made me lose interest in this game quick and easily, and you hear people say ""rust is to hard to quit, it's addicting."" But in all seriousness, once you realize how terrible the game has become, it is not worth the time an effort playing. I no longer support this game, and I do not recommend it to anyone due to the careless and worthless efforts put into this game by the developers."

2888,this game is pretty good but inappropriate i didnt think you would spawn inwearing nothing on a beach
2889,Very good way to waste your life by putting the same amount effort of living into a video game
2890,"this gmae is fukcing stupid
"
2891,shit game dont buy
2892,yes
2893,bald developer
2894,"Toxic ass community but a fun game i would give it a 5/10 due to the hackers and little kids painting N***** and swastikas on their bases and screaming it when they are getting raided, Then u have the 40man clans who hire people to jump on a new account to hack and kill people while they raid a base. DDB and Nep being two big clans that do so. but hey rust state of the trash anti cheat is disgusting. You know what maybe if your a kid dont play this game. probably wouldnt recommend this game to people who dont want to fail constantly in order to be good. last of all FUCK you to facepunch maybe if yall would have an update and fix yalls anti cheat instead of ruining the recoils then yall might actually be a good company.
"
2895,yes
2896,best game ever
2897,great and fun (a little toxic and racist)
2898,"As solo player it can be horrible, but very addictive."
2899,i reccomend it its a full time job thats fun but u dont earn any money and u cant get a gf reccomended!
2900,fun game i recommend starting in small modded servers to understand the game then progress toward vanilla servers in modded or official vanilla servers

2909,"Very frustrating game qt times, keeps your nerves on end.  Can be very satisfying if things work out."
2910,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2911,Reeeeeeeee
2912,10/10 game and each update gets better. Recoil update though 0/10
2913,"Let's phrase it like this, the combat system now is terrible the guns sounds feel less authentic and there has still been no real update to drastically increase fps. The base of the game is immaculate to say the least they need to stop trying to do so much and stick with the basics and build off that. Not try to change the game entirely. I think well over half of the Rust community can agree the new combat system will have a lasting effect on the decline of Rust population. I hope FacePunch can turn this around they've made a great game now they need to fine tune it!"
2914,it good
2915,"this game may seem fruustaurating at first but its really fun once you figure out what to do,"
2916,its trash you get spawned killed as soon as you spawn the youtubers make it look so fun and peaceful but it is trash geared playesrs come up to non geared players and just kill you for no reason go watch a noob on rust do solo runs youll see how bad this game is also you littraly can never find stone youtubes make it look so fun but it takes you 10 hours to fine 1 node of stone also the night time is impossilbe to see in wouldant reccomend this game

2963,"welp im not even gonna lie this game is pretty fun. but its an on and off type game if you get a good start on wipe day and dont get offlined its fun but then you play the wipe after that and get fucked and quit until the next wipe. its actually pretty fun to grind too, but when i first got the game i had no fucking clue what to do i didnt even know what the purpose of workbenches were until like 250 hrs theres not much context on what to do. its also not a good game to play while your back in school bc if you get raided while in class you cant do anything about it. so play it when you have atleast 1 week free."

3002,"I don't recommend playing on the main servers if you want to have a good time, this game is really time intensive in the long run for noobs. Community servers are more relaxed but at the same time it's not authentic. You will get burnt out if you play for too long and it will suck when all your hard work gets destroyed but the game is polarizing enough so that you will either quit forever or continue regardless. I think most people who enjoy the survival genre should try it, but don't take it too seriously."
3003,best time i've spent with my friends
3004,BUY IT NOW IF YOU LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE MAD AND HAPPY
3005,Great Game
3006,"have around 3k hours, played the game never cheated at all. Havent even been in a cheat discord for more then 1 minute
fucking loved this game,  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<GAME BAN>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 

what is wrong with facepunch, i dont understand

they treat there veteran players like shit
dont play
this game ruined my years of hard work. fuck facepunch fuck rust AfinTM"
3007,"Got this on discount, rarely write reviews and just unsatisfied about a lot of the game. For how much popularity it gets it feels like there are obvious bugs that are not fixed, As well as mechanics that are just overall bad. I would only recommend this game to players that enjoy pvp. The few key points I do like are, you need to farm a lot to keep your base maintained as well as to raid other people. But with big servers with hundreds of people, resource respawns can either not go your way or you have to fight to actually get a good base going, the very little that I meet the community only want to manipulate you for kills. 1/3rd to half of my hours are MOSTLY loading times, I haven't been able to tell how the AI even begins to work, I've sat right next to things that should attack me but don't while other times I can't even see them and I just start getting blasted. Also lack of being able to edit your character in anyway really set the tone off for this game at a bad start. I was also told that you can get cosmetics just from playing the game but I haven't seen any yet and seems like there is a extremely limited shop. Overall I think that it has potential to be a really fun game but lacks some small details to make it fun, right now it's just massive chores in a game."
3008,L game after recoil update
3009,"After the combat update there is no more having fun, aimcone is awful, shooting the AK feels like I'm hipfiring a unmounted m2 browning. do not waste your money for a boring game like this"
3010,Rust is just one of those games where it makes you want to punch a kitten. But sometimes it also makes you feel like you just had the best game of your life. Love to teach new nakeds how the game is played though.

3075,ruined my social life
3076,"So before I bought this game I was a virgin. Throughout the years I have owned this game that has changed. I really anjoy playing this game even considering buying the full DLC bundle. It is a lot of fun and is great to play with friends. Now back to the story point. Before I owned this game I was a virgin until my second server. I log in as usual and a few of my friends hop in, now at the time I was talking to this girl ya know. Nothing serious although I had the biggest crush on her at the time. During the night she was asking if she could come over and sleep over. Now reading this at the time, I was around 16/17 in 11th grade, so my heart was racing and I told her to come over at around 2:30/3:00 am, I sent this around 11pm and she agreed. Now fast forward to around 2:00am, me and my buddies are in our Rust server chilling in our base and then we heard it, the first rocket. Later that night I would text my friend that was a girl and cancel the plans, as that was the first time I was ever fucked in the ass."

Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna
Beer bust like I had last week
I must stay deep because talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they getting sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me is flirting it's just like sport, anything fly
It's all good, let me dump it, please set in the trumpet
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

Use your rock, get wood, get stone, pick all the hemp you see, craft some clothes you animal, make a bag, craft a bow, craft some arrows, find food, craft tools, get more wood, get more stone, build a shack, craft some boxes, go kill some bears for fuel, die to a bear, hit some barrels for fuel instead because bears suck, craft some furnaces, get metal, cook metal, cook LOTS of metal, save all that charcoal because you’re gonna need it, start looting roads and monuments while trying not to die, build a tier one workbench if you’re a noob and can’t go straight to a two, get more wood, get more metal, get more scrap, expand shack, upgrade expanded shack to unraidable base, what time is it? it’s sulfur time, get sulfur, cook sulfur, cook LOTS of sulfur, make gunpowder with all that charcoal you saved because you were gonna need it, craft ammo, start farming hard, get a decent weapon, craft meds, craft LOTS of meds, oh snap cargo is up go get that AK and bolty, kill everyone you see and take all their stuff - it’s yours now haahahahha, go double up at Bandit and make a tier three, farm more, and more, and more, build a heli tower, avoid rockets, take down heli, if you aren’t packing C4 and a launcher by now you might be bad at Rust, turn everything you see into explosives because this friendly person you gave four pumpkins to turned around killed you and took all your stuff and you need revenge - you need it bad, store all those explosives in your super secret spot in your unraidable base, go get a Red Bull cause you’re waiting for this dirtbag to log and it’s gonna be awhile, maybe take a shower too, get back to your computer, respawn cause dirtbag killed you, run back to your base, it’s locked and you can’t get in and you can hear dirtbag’s entire team mocking you from inside their new unraidable base, cry a little but never admit it, start back at square one angrier than you have ever been before. Like I said. Amazing."

3134,pretty meh
3135,I have played this game for a few years now and love it. Nice blend of PVP with PVE .
3136,Amazing game people are usually toxic but its addicting.
3137,love it when a group of 10 virgins storm ur base and murder you until you have nothing left in life and lose everything you have earned for the past 2 days :)
3138,tbh it was better in legacy and had less cringe players
3139,"Your experience depends entirely on other players. You can be an absolute PvP god, but that won't mean anything if a larger group passes by. Either play solo and have a miserable experience picking up scraps, or sell out and join a group that raids the rest of the server. The most enjoyable experiences are on somewhat smaller community servers that aren't filled with every toxic VAC banned player on the main servers. Find your server and you'll have a great time"
3140,after 6k hr i hate this game even more but cant stop playing. this game is ass if you like your life dont download this shit
3141,game ruined my life

I understand that really depends on your pc and what specs, but atleast I would've liked to know this before

Other than this the game is complicated but you'll get the hand of it, it is fun at the end of the day"

Has it ever gone away in a matter of minutes or seconds? Maybe to those pesky creepers or that one ""friend"" who decided to be a little goofball that day and blow it up. And thats what rust is, a bunch of silly little goof balls in the same server competing to be the biggest goofball. It usually comes to those with the biggest group, or the one who doesnt have a job and plays rust all the time. Back to the little base part, it can be your home for an entire wipe (every couple weeks or days the server resets so everyone gets a fresh start) or for a minute or 2. But then comes those silly little goofballs, they blow it up, wait outside the base to kill you and ""go deep"" while youre unaware of the situation. All your hard work gone, well... it would have been gone any way right? The server would just reset and everyone would have to start out at square one. But, you slowly start to realize that the fun comes from messing with ""nkeds"" and raiding/killing others. Become the silly little goofball, the smartest and most skilled goober will have the most fun in this game we call rust. Also be aware of the racists :)"

Join new server, more weary than before and server is called ""Beginner Friendly""... until less than a hour later you're engaged by 2 dudes with crossbow while you've just a wooden spear and instatly killed, no warnings. Alright!

Must be just bad luck and bad server, right? But then again... you know what... official servers have a decent odd to have hackers on... community ruled ones are mostly one sided for several other reasons... modded ones are plain weird and mixed experience.

Finally, the wiping system and huge requirement of activity, unless playing on Monthly reset servers, but there you get other issues to deal with.

To put it simply:

boring chore that you're better off not playing, minimun 8-10 minutes of load to get in a server on SSD with overwhelming higher specs, huge issues with RAM handling, absolutely garbage optimisations and dated graphics. Forgot, combat is mostly shit aswell, camping / ratting / groups vs solo or zerg vs group etc... yeah you'll want to pass on this, just play games like Tarkov or The Cycle: frontier, honestly at least there you can have solid fun for 30-40 hours and perhaps even more if you dig the gameplay, and the game doesn't just piss on beginners/newplayers or casuals, also doesn't have insane time requirements and timelimited runs.

The community? Average mental and actual age is way lower than you could expect which leads to a very further unfun experience"

This game without a doubt is the Alpha PVP shooter game out there… It will punish you without mercy then some more… But man o man, the reward you get after that juicy PVP or counter raid etc etc… Makes your adrenaline spikes 10x fold! 

P.s. For your mental health, make sure to watch a few videos before jumping in the game."

3580,"It might be a survival game, but the freedom it gives to do whatever you want mixed with the fact that you know is going to be over ( eather because server wipes, or the risk to lose it all at anytime), alows a mind set of play it however you want and gives you the most joy for your time (pvp, roleplay, survival, building, chill vibes, etc.. you should try them all), knowing it will be over and all that will remain is the good times. Really amazing to play with hips of time, or even with very limited time on your own acord (for the latter i recomend low pop servers or pve only servers, and just chill)."
3581,I bought the game spawned and had 4 naked people chase me while making monkey sounds.
3582,guys shot me
3583,"I got banned for no reason, I barley play and I am kinda mad I was banned. I liked playing the game but after learning other people have been banned for no reason then I have came to terms that Rust and easy anti-cheat suck. There is NO proof I was cheating, BECAUSE IM NOT CHEATING. I only ever played 100x plus servers because I was so bad at the game. Oh yea and getting the ban removed is impossible, even if your not cheating."

instead of fix performance issus ,they just add new modular cars and stupid skins updates

3612,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Imagine you wake up on a beach with a rock and as you wake up you start getting shot at by a bunch of strangers in masks, you manage to escape only to once again be chased around by a bunch of people with rocks and all for what ?! So you can build yourself a 1x1 rock house where you are 'safe' from the outside world(until someone decides to blow it up)."
3643,"No training. Slow wait just to begin. Corrupted by trolls worse than Kiss of War or Metro, by far.
Here is the welcome to the game: wait 5-10 minutes to load & connect... get killed less than 5 minutes in. That's after learning on your own off game from YouTube how to start and possibly survive. No training, no speed in launching, no cheater management, despite BS cheat control humblebrag virtueSignal ads while waiting endlessly on top tier hardware just to launch. Just to get picked off by pay to win hackers who lurk to live to light up naked n00bs running from the beach for the hills with no training, no clothes, no weapons.

This game when I started was very young and needed some work for sure, but its funny how as the game grew so did I as a player. Rust is definitely not for everyone but if you catch the ""rust bug"" if you will,  then brother you're in for a RIDE!! There really isn't any other game quite like it and that's what I think brings so many people in to the game and keep them playing!

3705,"this used to be such a fun game. the way they did the static spray patterns basically keeps this as a thirdworld game. because of that, i really cant support the game, play the game, or recommend the game unless they fix the static spray patterns into something actually playable. 1600 hours down the drain. the way it is, aiming is complete garbage. either your hitting people at 400 yards with triple headshots because you spent 2000 hours practicing alone in aimmaps, or you cant hit the target twice in a row at 50 yards because of how unnatural the recoil feels for many of the best guns. i just dont get why the devs would spend such a great deal of time making a bunch of updates and imrpovements just to wash it all down the toilet with literally the dumbest spray patterns out of any first person shooter game.. avoid."
3706,"BULLSHIT

3707,"Fun game, lots to do / explore and really gets the adrenaline going. I recommend muting chat sometimes because there are sadly a lot of fat children with big egos on this game. Apart from the fat racist 12 year old's, adults and everything in between this game is great."

3771,"possibly the worst community on steam
5 people armed to the teeth will go out of their way to steamroll a person new to the game
i hope this game dies out because it makes people lose part of their humanity. Especially because it's anonymous.

It's like life, unfair, cruel and everyone is out to get each other. Those that try to help more often than not simply get exploited. People say that it is what it is, but does it have to be?
Laugh at me but i'm not wrong, whoever you are online dictates part of who you are."

3776,"Fantastic Game, it can be extremely addicting but that just confirms how much fun it is.  The interaction you have with other players and the grind is a blast."
3777,"This is truly a goated game, I have much love for it and always keeps me lured to it. I just wished the game was less scary when taking loot out of base. Gear fear is a true fear that I still to this day have to overcome, Despite that, the game is amazing and fun to play with friends and is a good challenge to yourself when you play solo"
3778,Best game to ever exist. I hate it.
3779,"good
"
3780,"Pretty bad ngl, wouldn't recommend"
3781,Great game to play alone or with friends. Monthly updates!
3782,"avoided this game since its conception, finally was pressured to get it in 2022. Hate it. if you are tired of farming, losing all your progress, learning new UI and controls, figuring out the absurd blueprint system... idk lots of people love this game. Ive just played too many crafting open world survivals to enjoy the grind. Ive died too much in online games to enjoy the pvp, and DO NOT MISS gmod's loading times. Holy shit the loading times. 

so yeah, enjoy this game if you want, but do not allow yourself to be pressured into buying it."

3835,great game dont ply it
3836,add old sprays back they removed the skill gap which is what made everyone play the game now that anyone can just hop on and get a ak and be good why tf would any ac skilled players keep playing. Whoever decided to change sprays needs to be fired and shot 34 times in the head tf what a sped. Rust is a failed game like fortnite it had its run now its just complete shit. DONT BUY IT!! rust isnt how it used to be dont be fooled into buying the shit game.
3837,"dont waste time playing all the fun times you think you had were a alusion of video games if you have under 10 hours or have not purchesed yet dont buy, save your soul"

3856,No real base defense compared to the raiding power. the raid experience is a joke lol its just planting an overkill amount of explosives on doors of an awkward structure and door camping so they dont come out until eventually you reach their TC. half the game is dope other half makes 0 sense.
3857,"BEST GAME TO EVER EXIST

3860,this gamewill make you waste the next 3 months of you life i love it
3861,"Was never able to play.  All I got to see was an ""asset warmup"" loading page that took 15 minutes to get half-way through.  YOU HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY TIME YOU PLAY A GAME.  Yes, that's right, you have to wait for FIFTEEN MINUTES, before you play the game, every day, every map, every server, period.

And no, don't criticize me for having a PC that's out of date.  I'm rocking AMD Ryzen 3900x-12 Core processor with 32 gb of DDR4 Ram on x570 Taichi ASRock board, all built from scratch by yours truly.

This is just an obscenely badly optimized game.  Life is too short for load screens that take up more than 50% of your gaming time."

3873,Was banned by the anti cheat do to someone accessing my steam through rust then selling most of my in game items on steam marketplace
3874,I recommend this game to all players on the steam player base. This is a masterpiece survival game with unlimited things to do. I was once a hater but the mighty mcclongshank managed to persuade me.
3875,cool
3876,This game sucks you should buy it

3880,Best game to play house!
3881,nice game
3882,"good game 
like dick"
3883,"Shame... this game looks like it *could* be really enjoyable.  Maybe once upon a time, it was - I wouldn't know.  Unfortunately, however, the entire community - virtually EVERY existing server included - is currently just completely inundated with griefers, trolls and bad faith players.  New players to this game do not stand ANY remote chance, as you'll inevitably be shot/have your head bashed in within 10s in virutally any server you try spawning into.  It's basically like trying to play Day-Z, except with a Fortnite user base.  Likewise, the existing community is so incredibly gatekeepy that it's pointless even trying to search through the guides(most of them aren't actually guides, just sarcastic remarks by wannabe edgelords) or joining a community discord(new members generally just get ignored and talked over by veterans posting memes).  

I spent four hours trying to survive for longer than 41s without getting either sniped by an equipped player or rushed at and skull caved in by 3 other butt naked new spawns.  Which was two hours longer than I probably should've.  Honestly, though, I'm not even going to request a refund - because it's really not about *my* $40 at this point - it's about saving others from making the same mistake and wasting *their* $40 and time on what is effectively a closed community that does not really allow for new players.  

TL;DR: DO NOT BOTHER PURCHASING/TRYING TO PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY KNOW HOW TO PLAY & HAVE IG FRIENDS WHO CAN TAKE YOU IN & PROVIDE PROTECTION.  Unless, of course, you specifically enjoy spending $40 just to spawn in, have barely enough time to maybe knock down a tree or two, get killed by a rando and repeat over and over again."
3884,game sucks trying to start out everyone spawn camps you cant get anywere.  so would not recommend this shitty game to anyone. they need to put a timer on you so other people cant kill you for so long when you first start out.
3885,u will get sunken in this hole for rust and block out everything besides rust
3886,very good
3887,love getting offlined
3888,"This is one of my favourite games of all time

Gonna ride the lightning

3920,"I am a 50 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 19 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his brother , so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he send me a server for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son Goku many happy memories.
"
3921,"Wouldn't recommend this for solo players, horrible experience especially if you are new to the game. You're just running around naked with a fucking rock and a torch, trying to figure out what you supposed to do and everyone you run into on the map is just killing you for fun, because it's kinda obvious you don't have any useful loot at this point. If you have a team to play with, or you have someone to teach you, the game might be fun, I think."
3922,"the best game
"
3923,ok

3931,A good way of either blowing off steam or being a complete troll or having fun
3932,"I'm going to give you a quick rundown on how to play this game.. You wake up on a beach naked you've been drinking again after your wife divorced you. You start exploring the world and then you see your ex-wife's new husband. And you decide to act like your uncle at every family reunion and you just observe him from a distance, you begin to learn his sleeping pattern, his habits his bladder capacity and when he eats food. After days of observing you finally know your enemy like the back of your own hand. Now you are finally ready you sneak close to his door and wait with your ""trusty"" eoka. After two hours of waiting he leaves his base and you attack you get him in the head for 67 dmg and the one taps you in the head. You fail, he starts flaming you in chat for door camping and you cry yourself to bed"

3981,Help
3982,Good game
3983,bussin
3984,First loading into Rust is a complete rush! The fifteen minutes it takes for me to load into a server overwhelms me with such pleasure that I almost don't want to load to the game! There are two things that make me smile and those are hefty load times and full on nudity! If you like to rock out with your genitalia out then be prepared to be called the N word here!
3985,its ok
3986,bad game
3987,"Great game, although it can be a bit ruff for beginners. Graphics wise it's pretty good nothing out of this world but very good. U can have a lot of fun specially when ur playing with friends."
3988,good game
3989,"Good game, But it is a job"
3990,"- Amazing Graphics. 
- Endless game play. (If voice chat is off lol) 
- Pretty steep learning curve but you'll get the hang of it. 
- A lot of fun with friends. 
- Pretty fun at least give it a shot.
- Loads of PVP 
- Unique base building 
- Huge community even though the majority of it is toxic asf


Note: Don't risk everything be greedy! You'll get farther :3"
3991,play with your friends its better
3992,d
3993,"game bad, small bobs"
3994,God no even with 100 hours I hate this game!
3995,i like this game because making kids mad is what i like but this game needs to work on its anti-cheat way to many hackers.ps. dont play rustoria.co 10x that server is filled with hackers.
3996,this game used to be very fun i played it every single day. now since the horrible update that changed the whole game it is unbearable. it used to take 3-5 bullets to kill someone now you have to mag dump to even bring their health down to half. cant kill anyone and its not even fun. i dont care what anyone says the game was ruined
3997,"This game was described to me as a friend as ""a fun, base-building, do-whatever-you-want kind of game."" Of the 12 hours I've spent playing this game, 6 hours was loading and absolutely none of it was base-building or even remotely in the realm of what I would call ""fun.""

If you have friends, host a server and learn how to mod. Otherwise go play Battlegrounds or Fortnite."

3999,
4000,really cool
4001,"Great game, but a community on par with League of Legends.  Until the new player experience is improved I cannot recommend this game to anyone."

4019,"Rust Log August 2022:

Spawned on a beach with a rock, torch and no clothes. So someone who looked friendly... Said Hi and was shot. As I was down they called me the N-Word and bashed my head in with a rock. 

Spawned again. This time I ran into a forest. Was instantly shot from some guy on a roof in the distance. Crawled for a bit before being eaten by a wolf. 

Spawned yet another time. This time I managed to build an stone hatchet and pick axe. Used them to farm some materials and built a small shed out of wood only to be surrounded by the locals. I survived their first attack and hid in my shed. Started hearing bottles breaking and fire around my shed... Got roasted like a marshmellow. All my stuff taken or destroyed.

Spawned for the fourth time. Built my base again and this time upgraded it to stone. Took most of the day but finished it. Logging off.

Woke up today and started rust. After logging in my stuff is gone. There is a different door on my base. I appear to be trapped. Nothing left to do but suicide. Started a new base. Started talking **** in chat afterwards. Got a positive response... I think the locals may be accepting me. 

Started today by talking ****. Learned of something called a trap base on youtube. Decided I am going to try to build one.

Finished my trap base...First victim decided to scout it out. When he jumped in he landed on my cactus. I shot and killed him... Took his stuff and called him the N-Word. Things are improving...

Been a couple days since my trap base design... Havent showed up for work. My boss called. I told him to get rekt. I now have more time to play Rust. Trap base has been coming along. I dont even bother to use any of the other mechanics in the game. I just run around and kill people for items. I had someone invite me into their team and discord.

Been playing for a few more days with this team. Now we have moved to our 3rd server. Got a whole new meta to the game. Now we login, create bases, and ""roof camp farmbots"", as the locals call it, for supplies. If things dont go our way we move on to the next server like locusts. 

This will be my last post for a while as my power is getting shut off. I will be moving back in with my parents. I have begun to **** in a bag so that I can use it in a composter. I am hoping to start to create manuer to sell for scrap. I figured I could use the materials to build my own place. My parents are looking at me funny while I was over. When the amazon guy knocked on the door I told them we needed to place more barricades because the next time we could be raided when I move in. They arent listening to me. They said they wanted me to ""see someone."" I told them that I would as soon as I am done making my satchel charges. I have been watching their neighbor eyeing my future house. I am going to offline him when he goes in to work. Will post details later..."
4020,This game is very fun with freinds but by yourself its very boring.
4021,in my 130 hours in this game i have only touched a gun in a vanilla server twice. Quick to reccomend

4030,"I think I have played this game enough to give a review. I recommend the game to anyone who likes to tease angry little kids. I love how toxic the community is and its really fun to mess with them. Game is badly optimized but overall it is a good game. I can actually call it currently the best game available. Amount of things you can do is endless. You can doorcamp your angry russian neighbor, or you can go play annoying russian hardbass from the in game voice chat. Its just fun"
4031,"amazing... (side effects include: anger, genocidal thoughts, cramps, headaches, a weird russian accent.)"
4032,amazing game

4058,Great game fun for group of players and by yourself
4059,"The devs have ruined the game by adding to much random stuff i.e new recoil, pointless monument and more. bring back old rust..."
4060,Very good game game cuase you can see naked people
4061,Very good
4062,Boss Ass Game
4063,"I played the game, got a minicopter and then died."
4064,"As soon as they arrived, the entire area felt off. OGdinosaur and her boss pushed the feeling away in favor of their work. About 15 minutes in, they hear a loud ‘womp’ sound. Both stopped, thinking the sound must have been their imagination. Then, they heard it again. This time, it was so loud that they both felt pressure on their bodies and got goosebumps all over. They fled the site as quickly as possible. A decade later, thinking about it still freaks OGdinosaur out."
4065,very addictive. went 4 days no shower but overall great game after the primitive curve.
4066,everything best game ever
4067,good memories
4068,If you suck its a skill issue

4091,"For competitive players who want a mix of survival and crafting, Rust is the best there is; for everyone else, there are plenty of other games.It is a brutal game, an intense and often sadistically punishing hell with a great potential and a new look.
PvP-heavy survival game for gamers resistant to frustration, with weaknesses in construction and discovery.
Rust is still as addictive as it was. Maybe, because of its early success, we expected more from it, and in that case it can be disappointed. It still needs to be polished and improved, but at its core, Rust is a great crafting and survival game."
4092,.
4093,cool
4094,nice game

4096,10/10 perfect game
4097,"Rust. oh god , nothing beats waking up to a 12 year olds zerg eco raiding your base at 2 am - they are either russian or quiet because its past thier bed time -  even the slight confrontation always ends up with some squeaky child saying the n word but other than that 10/10 would play again (not for another 3.2k tho)"
4098,good
4099,good game 10/10
4100,get good or u no have fun time
4101,Great game but it is very hard to learn at first but you can make some team mates to help you and get better at the game!
4102,rust is such a good game! (please let me family go)
4103,Get killed a million times. Finally make base. Base decays. gets killed by wolf. Uninstalled.

4113,If you like to age 2x faster play this game
4114,"Scumbag developers that don't care about the people that have played Rust and supported facepunch since the early days, don't go investing too much time into learning the recoil patterns because they will change them to something stupid af and won't care at all about anyone that has invested thousands of hours into the game in order to earn the ability to be good. They would rather make the game noob friendly so they can line their pockets with more money.

Had they of changed the recoil to finally stop scripting asshats it wouldn't be as bad but they love people scripting as they get to line their greedy pockets with more money each time they have to purchase a new account. Fuck rust and fuck facepunch, good riddance."
4115,Have a strong mental or crumble.

4128,very difficult survival. if that's what you're looking for then this is definitely it!
4129,Play this game if you want to spend hours upon hours of your life hating your existence because your getting d**cked on by 13 year olds. 5 stars highly recommend.
4130,very good
4131,its alright
4132,"Been playing rust since 2015/2016 around, its a very good game if you have friends to play with because if you don't its extremely hardcore going solo, every update so far has made it only better which is pre gud."

4146,Yes!
4147,"Get a whole family of people that scream like Tyler1 and you get an average squad in Rust. Constant kids screaming the N-Word and a place where the inbred can finally feel like they belong. You either beat 'em or join 'em and I recommend that you don't join them. If you allow it this game will take over your life, as you see by the constant negative reviews with over 1000+ hours in game, thankfully I didn't get dragged too deep. To truly be successful in game you need to constantly have someone online and defending base or grinding. That's IF you can find someone that'll commit to dying for hours straight and being degraded. Afterwards you have a misguided chance at getting geared and building an ugly ass base. This game can feel rewarding at times but its misguided and will just drag you in for more pain. If you're a masochist that likes the feeling of having everything taken away while you sleep I 100% recommend. If not, you'll sleep better without this game in your life."

4154,"This game has given me bigger trust issues than past relationships, but still fun."
4155,rust will only ever be the only game where skript kiddies and hackers will always find a way back just to dumpster on people that have 2000k hours and brag like they've done somthing to them? - basically what im trying to say is this game is great and its worth every cent but its not when all of your effort goes to a fat little loser who grabs skripts from hackers who are bored - how ever this will not stop me from loving this little masterpiece cause it is a great game and [great games live on]

4330,Rust is like a chatroom made to look like a survival game. Half of the game is spent getting called slurs or talking to some of the most down to earth people. Those people tend to raid you in the end but all around its a good time. 8.5/10
4331,"It's a fun game at first, but the more you play, the more annoying the players get. There's a lot of horrible people that just kill you for no reason. Every time you die, you have to restart and it gets repetitive and meh. 6/10 game. I just don't like pvp survival"

4364,"This game, can be summarized as a unforgiving, hardcore, sandbox combat and action game. It's a game where you have to fight for your life, every day, because of the toxicity, combat skills, and raids from players. This sounds like its going to be the worst time of your life to play the game, and immediately refund it.

BUT, somehow... The game is enjoyable, repeatable, challenging, daring, engaging, and unique. The systems and mechanics within the game, the toxic people within it, the accessibility for creativity within a post-apocalyptic, aggressive, hardcore theme and setting, it allows you to have a new experience each time, and repeat what you do, in a different way, each time. Rust is like a randomly generated first person sandbox PVP survival game, where its merciless and you can learn on your own. If you make accomplishments, it feels genuinely rewarding, in addition to the game providing community-made and moddable servers, to fit your liking, and enjoy it the way you like it.

I'd rate it as one of my most favourite and replayable games. One thing to note, though, is the only thing that's a genuine problem is the performance, and optimization for the game. You're going to need quite a bulky PC, and you're kinda going to have to bear with the frame drops. Otherwise, have fun surviving! (Or trying to!)"

4419,After 2400 hours in the game i can say its one of the worst games ive ever played. Somehow they cant get their hacker problem in control. They made the recoil to favor people who dont put any effort into getting good at the game. And they keep adding monuments into the game to keep making the fps lag worse.
4420,very toxic

4422,people will shmeagle your shmogle without consent :(
4423,"good game

4424,"The game and it's mechanics is really fun and I would recommend to give it a try. What I don't like is the absolute state of toxicity within the community. Racism, arrogance and degeneracy is prominent both in chat and voice. Never play this by yourself, a minimum of 2 people is a must unless you understand the game to it's core."
4425,I would absolutely recommend this to any one whos a fan a fps and building games just be careful about securing your account i got hacked and then game banned they will not give you the benefit of the doubt you will have to make a new account and re buy the game

4445,"I awoke nude on a beach as a female, unsure what to do next to a swarm of random naked chads racing in every direction, and began randomly murdering every single one of them in front of me with just a piece of  rock. I was afraid and ran away from the most dangerous location, and there I spotted this random black man gazing at each other, wondering what we should do to one other for fear of killing each other.  We pleaded not to murder and began to thrive for survival together since that time. We began searching for basic supplies in order to construct our first home. We awkwardly stared at each other nude, debating if we should create a separate 1x1 room for both of us. We followed the same procedure every day after that, unaware that there was more to learn. 

One day, this man proposed to me, and I eagerly accepted to be his wife. I grew my guts with this man, gradually leaving fear behind me, and I killed many. With this husband, we built the best first biggest stronghold and a well protected house ever known to humanity, making it difficult for raiders to figure out what the fuck is going on, what to do, or how to raid our place. 

Then, in a very short amount of time, my husband and I began aruging, blaming each other for not doing enough to maintain ourselevs. I almost murdered his ass, but he begged me not to, so I left him alone. We went our own ways quietly for some peace and quiet. My husband then became enraged at me for relaxing at home while he worked tirelessly for hours to keep our house secure. Then our neighbor's house got raided and destroyed. My spouse began to act strangely, pulling away from me. He suddenly decided to end his relationship with me. I recall his precise remarks to me. ""I want to break up with you because you are a worthless bitch who doesn't do what she is supposed to do, so f*** off you arrogant Bastard."" Yes, those are his exact words.

 He stood by and watched me get destroyed at night, doing nothing to aid his unfortunate wife. I fell asleep in the main room, devastated. He gradually began to take everything from me and began to construct his own modest beautiful house. I awoke in the morning to find that our first house together had been demolished. Yes, he divorced me that day and abandoned me to die.

Never trust anyone in rust even your own imaginary game wife/husband. 10/10"

4535,good game
4536,"Recommended, BUT before playing this game remember it takes LOTS of time to get good loot and it needs time to learn how to play efficiently. ALSO reminder there are wipes, where you lose all your progress so be ready to lose all your progress every month. There are not many hackers but there are some. DO NOT TRUST anyone in this game they all gonna end up killing you."

4550,brutal
4551,The game is a fun game cool the best part is raiding.
4552,Get better and better!
4553,"This game is not made for people who like to play games alone. Unless you have a team of fifteen people to play with then your going to have a rough time in this game. Playing Rust solo is pretty much dying simulator unless your willing to put in hundreds of hours. I gave this game a try because I heard good things about it, but from my experience it very difficult in ways that are just not fun. From Youtube videos I watched, playing with friends seems very enjoyable, but my God, do not buy this game and play solo without knowing much about the game. I wouldn't be so hard on this game if it wasn't $40, even though it has similar format to free-to-play battle royale games. In short, don't buy thing game unless you have alot of friends who are willing to play this game with you for several hours."
4554,fun
4555,it ok i play sometime
4556,"Step 1: find good server :)
Step 2: wait 20 minutes to load in :/

10/10 experience"
4557,racism
4558,Playing for hours and days so that in an instant you lose everything to other players. Basically you are grinding for other players. Its not worth of my time.
4559,"This is a fun game. I am not huge into the pvp aspect so I enjoy more of the pve servers vs the official ones. I wish it didn't wipe every month, but it is what it is

4809,"I'm going to give a straight, and serious review of the game. Rust is by no means a bad game, I'd say the only downsides of playing Rust is that it's a game that requires a decent dedication of your time, and the player base is another downside. About 100% of the servers you go on will have someone who is toxic on it if your playing well populated servers but don't let them ruin your experience. I've found if you find some cool friends and just ignore everyone but your team its actually possible to have a lot of fun. To add onto this, the developers have been maintaining this game for some time now, with regular updates to the game adding new features and balancing the game I'd have to say that they showed more effort than 80% of the studio releases this year. In conclusion I believe that Rust is a fun game, but it can also be hell due to the toxic player base that you are bound to run into. 
Tip: Just ignore the toxic people, chances are they come on here for attention"
4810,"Fun game if you like grinding. The new gun recoil isnt too bad, definitely helps even the PVP fights. Could use better ways to get rid of cheaters on official servers but plenty of modded and community servers that are great and have active admins."
4811,makes me wanna die
4812,one of the best games around 👌
4813,this game was good now its all head shots and not even surviving through the next day rip
4814,"&
"
4815,would probably be fun if I had good friends to play it with
4816,good game
4817,Great game if you have the time for it because it is a full time job
4818,once you go rust you dont go back
4819,simple but complicated at the same time
4820,"I played this game for all of 40 minutes, and in that short time I was griefed 5 times by different players before I could barely step off the beach. If that's what you're into, have at it. Me? I'm out."
4821,cum
4822,"this game sucks cheeks 
i downloaded the game on my birthday excited to play but when i got on i spent and hour and a half loading into a game and once i loaded in i was frozen and couldn't do anything for about 20 minutes until i closed the game via task manager but once i did that i tried to re open the game but in doing so it deleted it self so i reinstalled it and noticed that it also caused my entire steam library to also be deleted therefore meaning i have to now reinstall all of my games again 
and will most likely not receive my refund due to having more than 2 hours on the game even though i didn't even play at all 
do not recommend"
4823,"+500 hours in, yes I like the game."

skill ceiling too high.
and honestly, too many russian servers."
4831,"fun game with friends to play and mess around on, steep skill curve on the game but u do get better. lots of fun however can be frustrating and rage inducing."
4832,"I played more than 5000 hours through different accounts. The game isn't terrible - but it got worst over time. High-end computers don't get good/stable FPS, too many cheaters and the game was intentionally made easier and simpler.

Nowadays I don't recommend new players for all reasons mentioned and much more. For old players like myself I'd recommend to not even try it cause it might destroy your memories of a good game with deep and interesting mechanics."

4841,asdf
4842,very good game but is full of zergs
4843,"Rust AHH yes the survival game. First of all Rust is a great game depending on who you ask. There are two categories of people who play rust. The die/try hard , and then you get the people who want to enjoy it or try and enjoy it without getting your head blown off. Rust is a great survival game it has monthly updates and the admins remove bugs and cheaters all the time. If you are new to Rust get yourself a friend who can help you if you don't you will end up not enjoying your experience as you will run into people and die most of the time.There are a lot of friendly people to meet and you will have a great time playing it. One of theee most important things to remember is to trust no one. the game is called rust for a reason the t is missing... But when you do find that person or persons to trust you will have a great time and probably end up spending most of your time on the game.Great game recommend it 10/10."

4983,"I'm sure the game is fun, I've seen fun things I was looking forward to when I bought the game. BUT I utterly resent being forced to have a random character model I can never change besides buying the game AGAIN on a different steam account... Uninstalling on principle because every time I see my char and know I can never change it if i so felt like it (I don't even dislike how my char looks to be honest) It annoys me, which defeats the point of playing a game in the first place. No thank you."

4993,"The most fun or frustrating survival game you can play at the time of reviewing. This game and the DLC goes on sale a lot so I would recommend waiting to save some money. Otherwise you can pay full price if you really want it. The amount of time you will put into it will be more than worth it if you can handle literally losing your shit from time to time. Devs are and have been updating the game a lot since it was on Steam.

TL:DR - If you like multiplayer survival with a competitive touch get this game. Just be sure to clear your schedule."
4994,Worst game ive ever played i get shit on by friend with 4k hours
4995,its a fun game

4997,غ
4998,AMAZING GAME
4999,"I will be fast and clear with my review. I started playing Rust around summer 2020 with a friend. Simply one of the best survival games out there! Here are my pros and cons.

Pros:
- enormous player base
- beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay
- can play with friends
- weapons and clothing customization
- unique base building
- a lot of PVP action
- raiding enemy player bases
- different type of servers ( modded, vanilla, community, etc.)
- day and night cycle
- every month the game has a major update and all servers wipe
- large maps filled with monumets, caves, icebergs, ships, animals and more


Cons:
- you can get OFFLINE raided
- time consuming (especially if you want to play solo)
- weapon recoil requires dedication and practice (especially the AK)
- if you want to play solo get ready to be wrecked during your first 100 - 200 hours
- to craft items you need to find and learn blueprints (also time consuming af)
- you can get randomly kicked out of a server because of a TIMED OUT connection
- requires a decent gaming PC
- FPS optimization lacks in some zones of the map

I hope this review will help you!"

5046,"day one of wipe, wakeup on the beach with all the other nakeds hoping for all the best but behind you all you hear is screaming coming from them. So you keep running until you have enough to make a small starter and that's when it all starts.

day two of wipe you realise that everyone around you is in a team so you try your best to stay low because you dont want your base to be the first raid of wipe. as you run along the road you come across a naked who is collecting scrap and you become friends with him. you trust him (the worst idea of your life) 

Day three you load in only to realise that you have been betrayed by your scrap loving friend has killed you, as you make your way back to YOUR base only to realise that your scrap loving friend Obama bin laden has taken over your base he was part of the big bases all along. then from then on you have troble trusting anyone in this game (if you can even call it that) ever again then you have ptsd from any naked person you see irl and in game.

other then that tho its alright boars and wolfs are a real cunt of a thing"

If you like Vanilla great, if not explore around, modded servers may have what you are looking for."

5103,great game
5104,Very good Very nice
5105,"Games great, not optimized dont expect to run on it a potato PC. On private servers with huge bases my frames drop but on slightly modified or vanilla server its much better. Toxic community (on the sweaty servers) that love talking shit and threatening to raid. PvE servers are a nice relaxing way to enjoy the game just as much. There really is something for everyone on there. Just riding the boats/helicopters in the sunset can be as satisfying as a roam PvP victory"

5169,"Toxic, fun, addicting"
5170,I love this game and just about everything about it except the wipe. i think the one big that get's under my skin is that if you put in the work on a good base you come back the next day to server wiped and all that work gone. that is the one thing that i would fix other than that this game is what it says it is hard core survival.
5171,very nice game

Well this is the game for you! Say good by to your social life and say hello to rust life! GG"

5212,"This game is intense and has bit of a steep learning curve, especially if your playing in populated public servers.
If however you give the game the time of day and maybe even rent a private server to get a feel for the monuments, movement style and building, you will be well on the way to doing better in public lobbies. The main advice I could give is just don't give up, remember its a game and a hard one and eventually you'll get there =D

Good luck & Have Fun!"

5222,havent played it alot but good so far!
5223,"good game
"
5224,"arks worse
"
5225,"The game is definitely a pain. It will test your sanity and zen worst than ""getting over it"" if you're familiar...you're familiar...
The game overall is great, there are some things that shouldn't have to be researched in my opinion and starting fresh on a non force wipe server will make you cry and rage at the same time, but that clutch play? That's the JUICE of rust. I've honestly never felt the same rush from nearly any game as far as difficulty and reward, everything is a play on the chess board and you best protect your king."
5226,"Running across the beach me and a friend see a man on the other side of a lake, completely stripped naked brandishing nothing but an ak building a base that looked far too large for one man only. 

The naked takes notice of us on the other side of the lake and decides to shoot at us missing all but a few shots, obviously me and my friend surprised by the fact they were picking a fight against people who were not only adorned much more advanced and protective gear but had enough explosives to transform his base of twig and stone into a crater rivaling the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. 

Despite this fact me and my friend decide to bide our time, instead of running over to him completely overwhelm him in a firestorm of bullets and then proceeding to dump enough rockets into his base to cause another Cuban missile crisis, we played angry birds, but instead of birds we had rockets and instead of pigs we had the naked and his base. We launched various rockets at different heights across the lake, the ones that hit took out most of his twig scaffolds, at times he even tried repairing them to no avail as we mercilessly launched more rockets immediately demolishing anything he'd attempt to build, it was the most fun i ever had on this game. Although for a brief moment of self reflection I've realized what I've become, before buying this game i had everything going for me i was happy with what i had, this game has changed me in such a way that i only got enjoyment out of the suffering of others, all to typical for a rust player i thought to myself.

The period of self reflection was cut all to short when another player with an ak snuck up to see the commotion and opened fire on us when our backs were turned instantly killing me and downing my friend, surprisingly after explaining what we were doing the player decided to revive my friend and join us, we gave him a rocket launcher with a few rockets and let him go at the poor naked. What the guy who killed us didn't know though was my base was right next to where he killed me and upon respawning and telling my friend to stall for time i grabbed an ak, went on my roof and shot him dead, the only person who would even consider hearing us out and showed mercy on us, i killed him. Do i regret it? No, it's every man for himself and if you find yourself showing mercy to people thinking your having a positive impact on the community like the person who showed mercy on us you'll find yourself stabbed in the back sooner or later wishing you'd never res'd that naked on the beach.

all in all my KD went from about 1.5 to 1.75 so i'd say it was worth it 10/10"
5227,If you buy this game get ready to not touch grass for a month
5228,hh
5229,mwwah
5230,its a super toxic game do not get it filled with russians and hackers and kids who constantly are shouting bad stuff pvp is impossible DO NOT GET IT!
5231,"Load server

Hazmat kills me
Laughs at the fact I tried to kill him with thrown rocks

5384,"I now have cancer and aids, Thanks rust"
5385,Rust is a game that starts off way faster than other survival games. It doesnt even try to get you hard. It just expects you to throw rope for 4 hours and power grind your way to end game. Theres no foreplay. Although when you finally get to where you are trying to go....rust will leave you with a smile on your face and regret in your heart.
5386,Got hacked so can't play it again but i'll but it again

📋 | [b]Personal Review[/b]:
This is a great survival game. There are many things you can do and the gameplay gives you a lot of freedom. There are a lot of active players and the community is very toxic but it is part of the game. I recommend playing with friends for a great experience and enjoying the game. A wipe is carried out every week / month in order to continue making the game playable for everyone and to feed the addiction of the players. The price is right but it is very likely that you can also get it at a sale. There are some minor bugs and glitches but overall the game experience is great.

5464,"this is a very well made game. it is very frustrating and i am prety new to the game. you wil get mand and los all of your lot thet you usedd 20 houres to get, thanks for that _anedogtt_ ."
5465,The game is great when you want to feel like an emo kid about to do hangman. The game is great on paper but playability is trash. (When I say playability i mean the players AKA low-life scum of the earth)
5466,"big balls

5467,trash
5468,"A modded server with a active admin/player
Where you can build and play with no worries just have fun the only rule is Don't Be Toxic to other players."

5476,"i wanna hurt myself, no sleep, not eating. Just to stop others like me from entering my base."
5477,"Rust is a pretty cool game. When it comes to how much you can do for one thing, it's insane. I spent hundreds of hours playing this game. But I quit playing for two reasons. 1. The game takes over your life. You spend hours building your base, doing runs, and upgrading stuff. In order to play this game (like how it was designed), you gotta put in a large part of your life. You constantly worry about your base's upkeep, and the first thing you do upon waking up is wanting to get on. 2. All those hours of grinding are shattered because of an exploiter/hacker. No matter how Great you make your base, someone is gonna blow through every wall. It's sad because most of my raided bases were because of a hacker. I mean, no one simply tunnels a way through exactly to your TC. Rust has some of the worst mods I've ever seen. Simply bc 1. you cannot contact them and 2. they don't want to help. Even when you submit a ticket, it is never replied to.  It's a great game, but you're just wasting your life on a never possible success."

5493,great game no cap
5494,make tool build base get rekt or rek some1 and make a clan and then bigger base
5495,Rust is a super fun game but also addictive at the same time. I play mainly Duo but sometimes Solo and Solo can be really boring so I recommend only buying this game if you have teammates or friends to play with.
5496,good and racist
5497,This game is amazing for if u like competitive fights and realistic features! Overall AMAZING GAME! the only issue is the toxicity that can appear but theres always a mute option (: hf ly

5501,"Rust is a multiplayer-only survival video game developed by Facepunch Studios. Rust was first released in early access in December 2013 and received its full release in February 2018. Rust is available on Microsoft Windows and macOS. Console versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One being developed in conjunction with Double Eleven were released in May 2021. Rust was initially created as a clone of DayZ, a popular mod for ARMA 2, with crafting elements akin to those in Minecraft.

The objective of Rust is to survive in the wilderness using gathered or stolen materials. Players must successfully manage their hunger, thirst, and health, or risk dying. Despite the presence of hostile animals such as bears and wolves, the primary threat to the player is other players due to the game being solely multiplayer. Combat is accomplished through firearms and various weapons, such as bows. In addition, vehicles controlled by non-player characters will occasionally roam, attacking armed players. Rust features crafting, though initially limited until the discovery of specific items in the game's open world. To stay protected, players must build bases or join clans to improve their chance of survival. Raiding is a major aspect of Rust. Rust supports modded servers which can add additional content.

Rust was first released in December 2013 to the Steam Early Access program. During this period of development, the gameplay was changed significantly. Dangerous wildlife replaced zombies as the primary environmental threat and several fundamental revisions to the crafting system were released, along with general improvements and feature additions. While in Early Access, Rust was ported to the Unity 5 game engine, providing substantial graphical changes. The game also introduced immutable, predetermined skin colour and biological sex tied to players' Steam account details. Despite being fully released, the game continues to receive updates.

Throughout Rust's alpha release, critical reviews were mixed, with many comparisons made to other survival games. Rust was commonly explained as being a mixture of DayZ and Minecraft. During this period, reviewers frequently noted the game's unfinished nature. During its pre-release phase, critics praised the concept and gameplay and by March 2017, Rust had sold over five million copies. After leaving Early Access, it received mixed reviews from critics. The player vs player combat and survival aspects were highlighted by those who enjoyed the game, though reviewers were critical of the harsh beginner experience and the constant need to grind for materials. The game has continued to be successful post-release and has been listed as one of the best survival games."

5503,"first you spawn on a beach a bit weird but hay i dont judge or do i?, i go up to someone he had a gun so i said that looked cool asked if i could have one*dead* nother guy with gun *dead* nother guy with gun *dead* guy with rock make friends i find gun but i dont know how to use it so i give it to other naked he invites me to a team he sits afk while i get wood on stone he kicks me kills me*dead* get made so i get hackx.exe, get banned quit game play years later same thing :)"

5506,"I like this game a lot, change the recoil back and give me alien red AK !!"
5507,no good dont get
5508,its scary
5509,After playing the original Rust and coming back to it the pvp and game has declined badly. Players can now just ladder into or out of any part of your base. Still no viable defenses except to stay online 24/7 and genitalia still forced into gameplay. A game truly made for toxic teenagers. Find a better survival game that won't waste your time with people building a ladder that takes almost nothing to make while you base took hours to make. Amazing developers 10/10

5530,"Bought this game some years ago.. Tried it and didn't like it. Recently decided to reinstall and give it another shot. Spawned in.. Opened up my inventory and I'm like.. Why am I a female. Let me try to figure out how to change that. Spent some time online and... 

Oh yea.. that's why I uninstalled this game last time. You can't change your character. It's randomly generated and whatever you get is locked to your steam account. Only thing you can do is create multiple new steam accounts until you get a character you want. 

Literally the dumbest bs I have ever heard of in any game ever in existence. F'in Dumb.."

5542,"Tips for beginners!
Every time you see somebody, shoot them. If they have nothing, that is even better!
Stand on your roof and shoot at people. Don't get off of your vantage point no matter what people say.
If your neighbor kills you and you don't like them very much, go stand by their door with a gun and as soon as they come out, kill them.
If you are invited to someones team, this is your chance to take everything they have! It is rightfully yours just like all the loot on the server.
Go out there and have fun ruining peoples hours of work then conveying your emotion when they are helpless on the ground!
Nobody is your friend except your guns! Use them... Nobody survives..."

5562,This game is legit
5563,"addicting, Fun, Unforgiving, i love this game"
5564,This game is the definition of no life sitting on pc all day everyday for a min of 15hrs at a time but its is worth the lack of social life until they changed the recoil and now the game is complete utter shite.
5565,this game is so fun but not when u are geting yealled at by a rasted
5566,good game like looking at the females titties
5567,Really Great Game Lol I LOve Getting A Zerg
5568,voice no work but lots of fun
5569,This game was the best game ever made at 3 years ago in my opinion. Rust peaked when mini's spawned and recoil was difficult and consistent. Every wipe patch the devs just make the game worse and worse. It's very disappointing. I hardly play rust anymore.

5740,"Highly recommend this game, you spawn and get killed, nobody cares of what you have to say and just kill you on sight so it gives it a very hard survival feeling to it. The community is toxic and I love it. If you are looking for a chill survival shooter with building this ain't it and please if you are thinking of leaving a review because you are getting killed or because the community is not all rainbow and sunshine then don't."
5741,this is a cool game when u have team otherwise u r gonna get bullied so much (like me)

5770,"much fun very kewl

5771,best game  very noob and has friendly teached me me 2 new words and the community is safe and non toxic u should consider getting it if your suicidal like me i now want to kms and regret all life decisions and wished i had never bought this game

5778,Played this game for whole year and a half and already got 1.5k hours its a horrible game if you actually care about you mental and physical well being if you dont care then have a terrible time :)
5779,terrible
5780,"This game crashes more than my drunk grampa if he was driving, hes also blind too.... uh anyways the game is good itself just a little laggy at times but its prob just my pc ive had for like what? 2... 3 years? soon im getting far better parts but for now... pretty good game nice comm- decent community. Poggers."
5781,It sucks to get raided and killed but overall a fun experience. Would not recommend if you get triggered easily.
5782,this game gave me brain damage and im suicidal now would recommend to anyone
5783,This is a game better played with friends in my opinion but it can also be very fun and challenging solo. Modded servers allow for an array of game modes and creative servers allow people to practice. I will say its not a game for the faint of heart or overly sensitive. People are extremely toxic when you try stealing there stuff so be prepared to mute people or have a thick skin. Plenty of hours of entertainment to be had here though.
5784,yes
5785,even though the community sometimes seem toxic as hell i had some joy playing
5786,0000000000000000000000000

5794,Super good game
5795,"everything
"
5796,very good game 10/10 :)
5797,90% yes look i used to be a console player so for me anyone who has a 100 + can write a review for this game (i know 100 hours is tiny for u pc players) so this game starts out soooooo frustrating don't get me wrong. but if u stick with this game you will most likely end up loving it. its one of my best survival games i have i Recomend this so highly
5798,suiiiiiii
5799,if you want a grind game well you found it but if you also like to grind for 8+ hour then have all your work be gone in a matter of mins then rust if perfect
5800,"very good game, sometimes makes me rage"
5801,Prety Sad Game
5802,makes me wanna kms sometimes. feels good.
5803,"Rust is a unique playground.
There is no other game like it.
It's a love or hate unfortunately."
5804,skill factor is gone
5805,worst game ever cant join a server without getting shot immediately fucking shit also fuking pigs everywhere that have 500 hp and can kill u instantly
5806,cool game
5807,"How do people enjoy this piss pit of a game? It's probably the most toxic, degenerate game in the world. Granted I guess if you actually have friends and if you play on a private server it might actually be enjoyable. But good luck surviving in a world with random players. This game is hot garbage. Like if Bethesda made a survival crafting ""roguelite"". This game is bad."
5808,"No, I want more hours."
5809,good
5810,It is really nice
5811,if you want a life don't play this game i am sad with life after playing this game
5812,"This game is a love hate relationship, I love the crafting system and PVE aspect, but full loot PVP is too full-on given the grind involved. Add to this fact that bases can be raided and taken from you, and that you are only ever one death away from spawning naked armed with a rock and owning nothing.

Unfortunately the current rule set seems to attract a toxic player base who are happy to use an AR to gun down a stone age player who has just spawned and is only carrying a rock. It is for these reasons that I cannot recommend Rust in its current state, but with a few changes to the PVP rule set, it has the potential to be an amazing game."
5813,"Collect wood make tc make 2x1 stone base, hear a sizzling sound and ur wall is gone and u get killed and everything u worked for is gone ur family is dead its a massacare - anyways good game :)"
5814,good game .. need some work though
5815,yes good game
5816,as
5817,good
5818,very good and not racist game with minimal cheaters
5819,"This game is fun. I wanted to start with that so i don't give people the wrong idea with this comment. The game is very well designed and has few bugs that you'll worry about while playing but if you want to hop on here and have some fun going on a solo journey maybe taking a bong rip or 2 while your at it Then i promise you, you will not enjoy your time playing this game. You need to find a group of good people ( by good i don't mean  3000+ hour sweaty Self absorbed dickhead's) you want to find yourself someone that you can see yourself staying up late raiding and having a good time with, And that is the way i suggest you play this game."
5820,i dont like how recoil go br when shoot
5821,"Rust is not for the faint of heart.  Overall it's an Incredibly fun game that is very hard too  get bored of, but if you aren't willing to loose your stuff over and over again go play something else. But if you enjoy a challenge this I a good game for you.
"
5822,its  good survival game with lots of lndscape and monuments to build on and near

Step 2. delete the game along with all data and request a refund immediately"
5830,"One of the best games out there it is just amazing how nice this game is. I love that it require skills and IQ, Amazing Game"
5831,None stop action
5832,this game started off fun i got a base down cot some scrap plopped a teir 1 down in my base ... I was starting to enjoy this game  and was wondering why people think this game is so bad for only if i knew the 5 british kids with m249s AND THIRTY ROCKET WERE STANDING OUTSIDE MY BASE READY TO PUMMEL ME TO OBLIVION I WOULD OF LOGGED OF RIGHT THEIR . me at the time not knowing what c4 was i thought some naked was outside playing with my code lock but to my little supprise my wall blew up[ and then i got 16 mags worth of 556 in my head I respawned on the beach knowing what had just happend i screamed a no no word and my moms comes in and beats me with a belt after swimming in my own teirs from the wip lash i was just given by my moms belt i waled over to my base to see it completely foundation wiped and i went over to to start over as the rust cycle begins agian only to find that they had come over to me and called me some very no no words and droped me a not that said get better and shot me in the head with a m249 fopr this reason is why i hate britsih kids the  next time i see them i vow to take everything they have for what they did to me was so so mean and they did it for only 1000 sulfer that being said  this game is a cancer that you loike and hat otherwise meaning you have a bitter sweet relationship with it and ones you go there no coming back you have been warned .

5846,At first it was very hard but after playing for a long time i got used to it it may be very hard for beginners but once you understand every thing its a great game. best for teams and friends to play together. It has many modded servers too and official server with almost no hackers.
5847,naked people

5871,"What can i say... started the game and as i was told by friends, i hated it lol. Its true 9\10 people will kill you and grief you as soon as you come across them lol and you cant true no one. But stick with it they said. after doing just that and now with 52 hrs played i could not recommend this game enough to anyone. i cant get enough of the ongoing challenge from the game itself to the other players. Its great to go at solo once you have the basic understanding of the game, but so much more fun playing with friends. This game is awesome and an all rounder from solo to multiplayer. you just cant get bored when you think you have learnt everything you find something else or are shown something else. highly recommend this game."
5872,"Fun game with lots to do each wipe, and pvp is by far one of the best of many games in my opinion. Downside is that it requires lots of playing time to thrive."
5873,"My friend convinced me to buy this game for 40$

5936,"For as long as this game has been out, the bugs have never really been squashed, the load time is atrocious and needs optimization. Facepunch Studio's needs their own game engine and not rely upon Unity 3-D to do its dirty work. Their NPC needs some work, to act more human and not have laser pinpoint aim. 

The outposts need to stop targeting you outside of its tight perimeter, if mining or hunting you get the warning of deadly force even outside of the location, that needs to stop."
5937,"Easy Anti Cheat breaking the game every now and then and really bad optimized (some people getting 60 fps and stuttering with RTX 3070).
PS: if you need help with technical issues do not contact Facepunch support team, they send you an automatic reply then if you reply back they just ghost you."

5947,"Rust is either a 2/10 experience or a 9/10 experience.
This game can either be amazing or terrible. It just truly depends, and it isnt something that you can necessarily pin point to one or a few issues. Theres just too many variables to it. Personally, I bought they game back in Alpha. Once it updated to its now current state, I didnt really touch it too often. This game is virtually unplayable to me if you dont at least have 1 additional person to play with. It does have its kinks and issues. But in the end, this game is phenominal and I'd recommend it to those who wanna do dumb shit with the homies."

Step 2- Rage quit after dying when you spawn 7 times.
Step 3- Join a PvE server.
Step 4- Bond with people over your shared experiences in PvP servers.
Step 5- Learn the game.
Step 6- Join up with said bonded people.
Step 7- Learn from each other.
Step 8- Hone your skills.
Step 9- Go back to the PvP server with new group and wreak havoc.
Step 10- Profit.

6062,"Obviously, I'm one of those people that thought Rust was only for the gigachads, the people who have 10K hours and mastered every gun spray and every perfect arrow projectile. 

While that is closer to the truth in PVP servers, Rust is the first ""Multiplayer Survival Crafting Open World"" that has enough systems in it to make PVE gameplay actually good! I can go on a modded PVE server and have the time of my life, even with all the loot at 1X and having to play the game almost entirely vanilla, minus the PVP. 

So, if you're like me and not into the PVP but love everything else about this game, try to give it a try in a PVE server."

note: Devs you guys are so dumb the gun play is stupid now the only things that shoot properly is anything semi auto, the ak and M249 thats it."

6120,"I absolutely love this game and right now it is my main game. It has its survival elements but also a lot of PVP-oriented content. There are a lot of ways to play it and succeed. My first 1k hours were as a solo, but being in a team has its advantages. My favorite thing is the multiple ways you can approach a situation. You can adapt a lot of playstyles to this game. My only dislike would be the fact that the game seems to stride further from survival and more into PVP, but there are multiple community servers that you can choose from to match your playstyle."
6121,this game is good lol
6122,play rust waste hours waste life for it all to be gone in a month so yes recommend

If you want to keep your sanity, do NOT get this game. However, I love it so much, and honestly I have no idea why. My sanity was a good sacrifice. Get the game. Join us."

6343,"I am a 33 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 9 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6347,"Unless you are spec ed with no job and have the time to sink 23.9 hours of your day into this game running around with a hazmat suit and ak killing bobs with a rock, do not play this. People really play this game as a job on their pizza hut tip salary and have never touched grass a day in they life. I think if we took the people who played this game and sent them to iraq then america would be a better place. Just always remember, I'm in that i8 coupe door who tf wants some more. You remember that and you realize that Joseph Williamsom is the most try hard at Osu. This game I can not reccomend enough. The graphics are good and the gameplay is very optiomized. If you want to have tons of fn just spawn in and run to a radiation site. You might not make it because roof campers just pick you off from two light years away and then when you complain about aq ban they dont gaf. They buy servers and admins off with sloppy bj on imvu. I honestly love rust and encourage everyone to not buy it unless you get it gifted to you for free by a guy in a alley way. Thank you for my ted talk."

6363,"In the game Rust, there are 5 primary activities you will be doing. Farming, Building, Solving Monument Puzzles, Researching the tech tree, and last but most importantly PVP. This is by no means a PVE game and you should not go into this game with anything in mind other than PVP. Everything you do in this game is working towards the goal of end game gear and a safe base to protect said gear. 

This game can be played as a solo or as a group, however I would strongly recommend you find a nice group of people and play with them starting off. Solo is a near impossible task in this game simply because of the high skill curve. Your first group will likely be dysfunctional and obnoxious, however you will not be able to find a skilled and competent team with at least 1000 hours. 

I recommend this game simply because it is a lot of fun once you overcome the hurdle of experience. You can dedicate literal days to a wipe and then start all over again. If Rust is good at one thing, it is the balance of progression and server wipes. Rust has made the game customization to server owners allowing the community to find the perfect equilibrium. If anything, the devs listen to the community."

If you don't think so, lets be honest, you either can't aim, or just like to troll and get spanked for it.


The racism is not a game issue so much as a community issue and most if not all servers I've joined have clans that will actively target people that proclaim their racism or use slurs when losing fights. Even most content creators make a specific effort to raid and punk people that do so. Though it is an issue, I do not think it holds as much of a grasp on the overall game as some critics make it out to be. It is a smaller population of extremely stupid people and the efforts that the other side of the community makes to outweigh and stomp it out is tremendous and should be spoken about more often."

6462,"BUY WITH CAUTION IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE THIS GAME OR SOMETHING ELSE, for all else who are RICH BOYS ignore this review and carry on with your more money than sense.
You must understand these topics before you decide to buy this:
1. This game contains aim hacks that the devs (developers of the game) can't/won't address, I'm willing to bet good money that he NEVER WILL.
2. I've been with this since the start, so this has been well over five years of me waiting to post a review. The original system for the ""cupboard"" (the box inside your base which determines who gets build rights) was better. You are now forced to place it ground level. Long story short (other issues along with it) what use to take DAYS for someone to breach me, now takes 15 minutes TOPS. I have wasted many hours beyond what the steam counter says working up builds. etc.
3. Whoever did the guns for this game must've been a middle school aspiring genius that understood physics and damage at a high school level. Essentially, ITS TRASH.
4. This game is a project, guided by one man, who has more money than sense. This is his toy, and he has clearly stated in the past that he will work on it and do as he wishes, WHENEVER he wishes.
5. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 10. LITERALLY. Contains nudity, and you leave your child at the disposal of grown adults and foul mouthed/attitude like children.
NOW... we got that out of the way. It's a way to hang out with friends and do stupid things and laugh together. Survival is a major part of this, whether you be the hoarder or the man always on the go, there is more than one way to do all of this. Not for the feint of heart, not for those who play games on easy mode, and your first mistake in Rust... will always be trust. Expect tons of people ready to kill you on sight. There is no such thing as end game, as the spoiled rotten dev forces us to wipe once every 1 to 3 months. So ALLL that pickle ricking you did to make this twig into a fortress of solitude... has been wiped. When you log off, your character lays down right where he/she stands, and that's it... you are wide open to whatever from there on. If this sounds like your cup of tea, then go ahead. It had TONS of potential in the beginning, but now I only log in once every year or so... just to see if the dev ever decides to give a shift."

6575,This game isn't role-playing but there's server that people role-play in you won't find much and the game wants you to eat drink whatever you need to do for example: when you quit you won't quit you'll sleep in the game that's why you need a base. and that is the point of the game. I hope it helped you.
6576,sfdsfsf
6577,fun game but if you start playing with nearly no experience go on a 2x modded server thats like better if you start out and know (nearly) nothing about te game

With less then 200 hours and most my hours just playing on battlefield servers

Then going to an actual server an playing, The learning curve Is steep but once you grasp It I think everything becomes clear

There always gonna be toxic people In every game you play but this one brings It out In people
(Including myself)
There always gonna be someone better then you...If your new most likely every person you run Into!

6593,"the game is very good and if Ur new to this game there are a lot of server that are there to support new players and there are also server that don't just involve surviving and grinding,some server allow u to train and play different game modes with randoms players to improve Ur aim and more.would greatly consider buying this game:}"

Crazily toxic. (If the over all base of a game is this crazy toxic, you ultimately gotta blame the game design)  If you are a terrible excuse for a human being, the game might be for you.  If you are a normal human being, I would stay away."

One day someone might give you a better tool or weapon to defend yourself with, the next that same person may level your little base bc you made the mistake of building a bit to close to them or telling them where your base was. tRust noone, lol.

6808,"Rust is a griefer's paradise. There’s nothing quite like finding a guy sleeping in a forest and looting him before he wakes up, or camping outside another player’s fort and killing her when she opens the door. For those who enjoy deadly games of cat and mouse, Rust might just be the best survival game out there. But anybody more interested in building and exploration, or isn’t able to devote themselves to one game, may have a rough time."
6809,werry good

6812,"Rust is truly a fun game. Sure there CAN be some toxic people, but I have loved every moment of playing it. It feels more natural to have friends to play along side, but playing solo is just as fun as you meet others online. A lot of communities are super friendly and are willing to help new players. I hope I enjoy rust as much as I do rn when I reach 1k hours."

6825,"This is my 1000 hr review. This game will make you want to punch things. It’s not an easy game and it’s always a grind. But still sit back and farm a little. Especially when you loose a fight. Sit back and farm until you feel better, and by then you’d farmed back what you lost. You will always loose to someone who’s better than you has more monument knowledge then you and knows better angles. Good headphones are key. And practice on an aim train server if you actually want a chance. It will take hundreds of hours before you start getting higher tier loot on vanilla servers. Overall addicting and fun but god is easy anti cheat trash. You will run into hackers but don’t always assume people are hacking… I’ve seen people do crazy shit because they were good not because they were hacking. This is my 1000hr review I will continue to make these as I go."

Great news is you then get to start again with your rock, YAY! this can become tiresome until you figure out how to progress quickly and efficiently.

When I first spawned in I could have sworn if Groundhog Day was a game then this was it.

Try and play in a group/clan as this will greatly increase your chances of not rage quitting.

6876,before i got this game i had no friends my family didnt love me i had no girlfriend and i was bullied. But after i got this game all that changed it got even worse
6877,bad
6878,good
6879,Such an amazing game cant get enough of it
6880,you literally cant run the game with 8gb ram or is it just my pc?
6881,rust fun buy now or gay full homo
6882,its good with friends
6883,This game is super good buy now and get screamed at by 10 year olds.
6884,love this game
6885,"This game gives me crippling depression. The feeling of spending 10 hours sweating my fucking bollocks off to progress, just to wake up to a message from your retarded 12 year old eastern European teammate with like 4,000 hours saying you've been offline raided makes me want to grind my face in a fucking mincer. Whats more agitating is loading onto the server to access the damage only to have a fucking sign on the side of your grotesque looking 2x2 this moron constructed saying ""easy raid"". And for it to happen again is to no fucking surprise. Never play this game if you want to wake up in a good mood. I take the saddest morning shits just contemplating my life choices, don't let it be you. Don't buy this shit, it's addicting. My Nan now despises me. :)"
6886,Great game
6887,dogshit+
6888,pp
6889,got called the nword
6890,Hate this game no cap
6891,"My experiences with RUST...

I log in, press space bar to wake up.. walk 100 ft down the road and find a player made house. In voice chat I can hear a guy yelling, get closer to the house and hear him say ""You F***ed my wife, So i'm gonna kill your horse"" guy proceeds to shoot horse in the head with a nail gun and then runs away.. I continue down the road and spend the next 5 hours gathering materials to come back and find my person murdered while I was asleep (offline) I respawn, run literally across the map only to find my 3x2 house taken over and all my stuff stolen...


10/10 - Will listen to Kickin Wing want to be a veterinarian and how he only sells snakes and sparklers.. because they're the only ones he likes.. (he has 5.7k hours in the game.. he's real.. I met him lol)"

6898,good enough igz
6899,"It is really fun
"
6900,yes
6901,"Game is def a time dumpster. Great time investment gives a great reward. Having friends def gives you an advantage. Solo players have it the hardest since everyone runs with at least in duos. YOu start off with a rock hitting trees and rocks to make spears, bows and arrows. Then eventually craft weapons like guns. Very fun just like i said it can be a bit frustrating getting killed when your collecting stuff and makes you feel like you just wasted time gathering."
6902,"this game is terrible all my friends wanna play it for no reason its so bad to the point where im going to explode if i have to play some dumbass ukomako ukomako type shit

6917,"Just perfect, Rust is the kind of game that you always comeback to it"
6918,"I'm baffled by how common bugs and exploits are in such a full-loot PvP game. The game has been out for long enough for bugs to be ironed out and they are not being ironed out. On an Official Server, AI should not stop working and leave all of the most valuable loot free to take. Unacceptable amount of bugs. Don't waste your time."
6919,"great game

6920,AFTER THE RECOIL UPDATE THIS GAME HAS GONE 2 COMPLETE SHIT RUST SHOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON KEEPING US HAPPY INSTEAD OF FAGGOT ASS STREAMERS LIKE XQC BUT AFTER 6000 HOURS MY RACISM IS ALMOST CURED

Don't think about tabbing out it more than half the time breaks the game. No my internet connection isn't wonderful but i shouldn't have to switch network providers and swap to a solid state drive just to be able to play online with everything on low settings. No my pc isn't top of the line but its not old either, my husband could tell you in more detail for those considering buying this game with the same specs."

7105,This game is fun never had so much fun
7106,"I can't figure out why anyone likes this game. There's no point in making a nice base because glitch metas make ugly bases the only way to go and the server wipes often, erasing your work. It's just a really repetitive grind that pits you against trolls and sweaties."

That doesnt really make sense but i feel like this game doesnt allow you to play how you want and you kind of have to follow what everyone else is doing. It does get pretty intense but can be very toxic especially when ur a naked and die to some crazy people.

7171,fps shoot and loot love this style of game play reminds me of ark: survival evolved just purely geared towards pvp
7172,"Rust, the game of wins and losses. I have spent 12 hour sessions playing this game just to get offline raided and lose everything overnight. Rust is fantastic if you love to build up a bunch of treasure and then let someone e take it from you because they are a bigger loser than you and played 15 hours instead of just your trash 12 hours. You will mindlessly hit rocks, loot boxes, and kill naked people. I have 1.5k hours on this game and I dont know why. If you play rust you cannot touch grass but you can get all da loot and put it in your 2x1. Live. Love. Rust."
7173,good very good
7174,"game sucks as of right now, its no longer fun, new recoil sucks, number = win. Roofcampers increased and face punch is killing their game, 2 updates and the game is ruined."
7175,"Me when I'm not playing the game: ""Yeah rust is pretty fun just dont take it too serious and remember to touch grass every couple days.

Me when I have hours invested into a server: ""Not now Dad im being doorcamped."" Hours later ""Maybe tomorrow im doing Large Oil Rig right now."" End of day ""Ill get off once I finish this raid."" 3:00am ""What am I doing with my life."" Repeat untill raided

Long story short Rust is really fun maybe too fun but a piece of advise coming from somebody with 1k hours on the game, anytime you get stressed or stop doing things for fun, just get off the game, you'll thank yourself later."
7176,"1)Wake up on beach
2)Bash peoples heads in with a rock
3)Find a gun and shoot everyone you see
4)Destroy peoples houses with explosives
5)Go home and play rust"
7177,I waited a long time to be able to play this game and i promise you this is the best survival game you can play. It has intense game play mechanics that make it a heart pumping and action packed experience.
7178,Interesting game its fun until you get offline raided and you can't to anything about it. The community is also very toxic
7179,it is amamzing but you have to be good beacause its very salty a sweaty
7180,"Before you get yourself into this game, What you need to know is wipe system
All the servers wipe out the world completely, meaning whatever you had in the server won't last forever.

I like the fact that the game still has updates, It's more fun if you have friends to play with
you'll have to put decent amount of time grinding too

Steal from others, Keep your stuff safe
Do whatever you want to do, there are PVE servers too if you don't like PVP stuff.

I was lucky to have some players teach me the game if you don't there are some things that you'll have to learn.
watch videos and learn!"
7181,idk what the actual f#@k is wrong with my game but with a rtx 3060 i7 and 16gb of ram im getting 30fps on minimum graphics. the worst part is when i started playing i got solid 250 on max and for whatever reason it slowly went down untill its unplayable and even after restarting my pc messing with settings and re installing it it still runs like hot a@@. worst 50$ of my life

7193,I LOVE THIS GAME AND I AM YOUNG LIKE VERY YOUNG AND I LOVE IT AND I HOPE OTHER PEOPLE DO TO
7194,"Server browser is absolute dog water, you can't filter by EU only servers so while the browser might say 11 ping, it's actually 120+ when you try to join. 

Once you finally get into a server that won't instantly throw up a ping warning you are likely going to be spawn killed by one of the wonderful player base despite the fact that in many servers you spawn with literally nothing but a rock and a torch but that's just me being salty (I'm used to being spawn killed, I have several hundred hours in DayZ)

The game play is decent but these two issues seem fairly easy to fix but for as long as the game has been out it doesn't seem like the devs care enough to fix it."

7211,"ITS A REALLY GOOD GAME

"
7212,mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
7213,"Loved everything about the game. This game is about death and if you aren't dying and losing things, you're not doing something right. This game is not for the cautious and is for people that have a lot of time on their hands or just simply have more hours on this game. Takes awhile to get a grasp so don't give up and just put time to the game and learn that everything is replaceable and you can come back. Highly recommend this game."
7214,i smashed some ones head with a rock then went home to play rust
7215,"Rust is painfully fun, getting on during wipe day and setting up a base and such is a amazing experience. The game is full of idiots so be ready lmao"

7219,I died. A lot.
7220,its cool man
7221,"One of the best survival games I've played. I was a little unsure about the forced wipe and having to start from scratch every month, but honestly, it keeps the game from getting stale. After two wipes, I find that I really look forward to the opportunity to tweak certain things to make each game better."
7222,"this game is literally made for people who like have beef every day ong, so much fun and rage at the same time

only negative thing is you need a lot time to play it ( i did it during quarantine)"

7235,"Might of been one of the best games i have ever played. 

But you will have to put in the time becuz its almot like a full time job. 

I recommend playing this game with friends especially if you are new becaue you will have a better experience and it will enhance the gameplay experience aswell.

The only thing i dont like is its very toxic but not in the way other games are like cs or the gaming community in general this is more sitting outside your base or just sitting on their roof becuz people are afraid to lose guns. 

If you have the time i definitly recommend this game because there is a lot of content and it very hard to get bored of."

7264,great game :)
7265,good
7266,"Good game but it's hard to get anywhere if you work an actual job. There are players who no-life this game and are able to farm resources and offline raid to their heart's content, making it difficult for other players who can only spend an hour or two out of their day online. 

Good game, just not built for casual enjoyment."

EU or US server only chinese and russians here nothing else, complete waste of money for this crap if there would be a refund on steam definetly would choose it. Do not buy this"

7297,"I first bought the game back in august of 2021 because the game was challenging and had a steep learning curve. And the recoil was hard to master. now as of june the recoil system is based on luck rather than skill. if you want a challenging and rewarding game, Its not this one."

7310,"I am a 44 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

< They bring me into their base
""bring him in the thunderdome""
< they bring me into a prison with another naked
""NOW FIGHT!""
< me and the naked fight intensely with rocks
I kill him, everyone is screaming ""ALLAHU AKBAR"" in bad middle-eastern accents
< they bring me outside for a break
one ISIS member leaves the base, and I run outside while the door is open
< being shot at by AK-47's while zigzagging
I escape into the desert
6 men yelled racial slurs at me while i tried to break a rock😏

Most toxic game i have played🤫
In the end, you always come back to the rock and torch. The game is a great experience and highly addicting

Good Luck

7338,There is not enough recoil and i am outraged :<
7339,Really fun survival game with a ton of PVP. Would not recommend for people who have no patience or get easily discouraged by set backs. It happens a lot and be aware of weird random people door camping and constantly killing you for anything and everything you might find. Playing Solo definitely makes things some of the hardest!
7340,"i still don't know my friend got banned, just straight up out of nowhere. Made a good meme in my chat though."

7344,"I played Rust when it first came out on the PC and rather enjoyed it, I got raided and never played it again. Fast forward a few years and it came out on the Xbox (where I do most of my gaming) and played it with a few friends and fell back in love with. It wasn't until we realised the the Xbox version is so far behind that we came back to the PC version. Love the game, but be prepared to get raided and dont get attached to your inventory or base, because it can all go in a matter of minutes."

7590,"I am immediately down voting this because in real life I'm stuck with the look I have in real life, I'm okay with that, why do I play videogames because I'm supposed to be able to have some sort of control over my world, the fact that I have to be a female character is why I'm downvoting, I didn't know about the look being tied to my steam account until I played this and when I realized that I can't change my char or start a new server with a different look either. And the devs response is ""In real life you get the look you get and your stuck with it."" Mmmmm really?!? NO! Plastic surgery exists, you can change your hair color, for frick sake you can also get a sex change operation too, and michael Jackson freaking changed his skin color. Don't try to act like you are making a point or whatever by saying oh it's like real life...
No... no it's not, and I'm still going to play the game, but I am extremely disappointed with that type of closed character restriction when the game itself has no story or lore. This is just a crappy dev trying to impose a stupid system for whatever reason.
This game unintentionally helped me understand racism and sexism all in one go, I feel ashamed to have downvoted it... i am now revising it to up"

7657,This game eats you inside and kills you. Reveals the monster inside you. Other than that it's a really good game. Wheter it'd be the nakeds running around yelling you racist stuff or clans that makes your pc go airplane mode with the amount of players they have. It is a fun game. Would recommend. 10/10. And lastly if you're planning to buy this game the odds are you're not gonna have any fun in your first 100 hours. Watching some youtubers like Willjum might help cause he shows the primitive part of the game and not just the pvp.
7658,do not get this game
7659,"very fun game
"
7660,"why the hack is the name of the ""rock"" translated into bullshit? and FP doesn't know or do about it?"
7661,"So! I'd recommend this game only if you can do 2 things. 1) If you can take the gruesomeness of rust. 2) If you can rage without there being a broken keyboard. Besides that, groups of friends make rust a little easier but not much."

Never played on a computer for a game before, so i am learning how to use keyboard and mouse. So far so good, soon enough, I am going to become one of the rust gods. Runs great on Mac.

7723,"Game mechanics are great and most things seem well thought out. Of course, managing things like hunger and water are challenging but I think they did an okay job. But if I think that, why am I leaving a negative review? Because it's only online, you HAVE to interact with the players, which makes the game suck. The fact it's online only sucks, but more so the player base is a bunch of rude idiots with no regard for beginners; I played solo and died over twenty times, and only ONCE did I get enough wood and stone, essential resources BTW, to make a stone axe! This brings me to another complaint, resource prevalence. When playing on a server, unless you're the first few people in, you won't be able to find any resources to get started. Stone is already scarce because not all stone is minable but you need it for almost everything, and if you come in later, someone else has built their base nearby and will kill you if you get near it! The game mechanics don't break the game, the people who can't figure out that not everyone wandering in the world nude because they can't yet build clothes is a threat. Figure out why your game is unplayable by PLAYING IT. Also, add an offline/local play mode. Because I need to be able to play somehow."

7730,"My review will be short and to the point. Rust was one of the first games I ever played with a friend back in the summer of 2017. One of the best survival games ever made! Here are some of my advantages and disadvantages.

Pros:

- a massive user base

- stunning visuals and fluid gameplay

- Supports multiplayer gaming

- personalization of weapons and clothing

- Construction of a distinctive foundation

an abundance of PvP

- Invading the bases of rival players

variety in the server type ( modded, vanilla, community, etc.)

the daily and nightly rhythm of life

- Each month, the game receives a significant update, resulting in a server wipe.

maps with numerous landmarks, caves, icebergs, shipwrecked creatures, and much more.





Cons:

- You may be raided OFFLINE.

- a lengthy process (especially if you want to play solo)

Reducing the impact of a weapon's recoil takes commitment and practice (especially the AK)

playing solo for the first 100-200 hours can be mentally and physically draining, so be prepared for that.

find and learn blueprints in order to make items (also time consuming af)

TIMED OUT connections can cause you to be booted from a server at random.

A high-end gaming PC is needed for this.

- Some areas of the map have poor FPS optimization.

7747,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

7796,This game provides every single source of addiction while playing. Gambling issues? Go to Bandit Camp! Overdosing issues? Bring more stims when fighting! Adrenaline Rush? Solo take Cargo against a clan! The downside is that you will be severely beaten and degraded while playing.... unless you're into that. ._.
7797,no

Based? Based on what? On your dick? Please shut the fuck up and use words properly you fuckin troglodyte, do you think God gave us a freedom of speech just to spew random words that have no meaning that doesn’t even correllate to the topic of the conversation? Like please you always complain about why no one talks to you or no one expresses their opinions on you because you’re always spewing random shit like poggers based cringe and when you try to explain what it is and you just say that it’s funny like what? What the fuck is funny about that do you think you’ll just become a stand-up comedian that will get a standing ovation just because you said “cum” in the stage?

7815,"There are more cheaters than non-cheaters on rust. The game has basically become unplayable unless you're willing to spend 200$ a month on accounts and cheats. You know I can tell who has player ESP when I also have Player ESP....Right? Of course I'm fucking cheating, everyone who puts more than 20 minutes into a server is inclined to cheat because if you can't beat them, you join them. Nobody is dicking on rage hackers but other cheaters. I'm getting sick of the hypocritical kids who follow me 5 grid squares without making visual contact who weave exactly towards me everytime I run away without having been ""noticed"" they always homing missile right for me. I clap them and then they cry to admins that ""THEY'RE CHEATING"" as if they think it makes them look less guilty. Just call rust what it is. Hack Vs Hack"

7820,"I've played this game for 80 hours, yet I still just can't enjoy the game. I absolutely love survival games, I really enjoy shooters, and I love the multiplayer variants of both of these, so in theory this should be right up my alley, but something has always just been keeping me from having fun.

It's just too easy to lose progress through the fault of being asleep. I can never make any progress because some guy will just pull up to my base while I'm completely defenseless and steal all of my crap. This has happened for 80 hours and I never made it past T1.

It's a shame because on paper this sounds like one of my favourite games ever, but it's just too hardcore"

7829,"Before the recoil update Rust was actually a fun, competetive game. The game took skill to master recoil, gamesense, basebuilding etc. Even tho Rust always had their problems/bugs and game changing updates like the (compound bow bp) it has been a great experience and a great game, but currently my well known Rust has changed...The changing recoil made the game (non competetive) and more (casual) which many gamers sees as a good and positive thing, but I bought Rust bc it was described as a hardcore survival game, not the one winning a fight by luck/no skill and bloom which the current update (recoil update) gave us. The recoil is easier and can be mastered 100x faster than before and new players can outskill old veterans by just playing a couple of weeks learning the recoil. Of course gamesense matters aswell but Rust have been especially known for its hard recoil. Maybe the update gave new players a chance winning fights but the time (old players) spent on the game does not matter anymore. What about my 2000 hours learning the ak-spray. Gone for nothing? Atleast give the community no bloom and keep the game competetive with easier recoil like now. Btw Im traumatized by animal attacks!"
7830,fun keeps u busy for hours at a time
7831,"hard core game play, im bad."
7832,"The psychological influence this game has on the human mind is staggering, and modern science still cannot replicate the sheer destructive properties that it has.

You should play this game if:
You enjoy shoving nails into your eyes
Sleep is a foreign concept to you
You weigh over 300 pounds
You have a distinct aversion to plants as a whole, notably grass and vegetables
You are of the opinion that there is far too little discrimination in this world, and that it needs more slurs
You like building sandcastles, and watching the tide wash them away, just to start all over again
You want to commit suicide, but weren't sure, and needed something to push you over the edge
You have paranoia, and need an outlet for those feelings
You like survival games, but mostly like fighting other players


You should not play this game if:
You dislike the idea of shoving nails into your eyes
Sleeping more than 2 hours at a time sounds like something you can accomplish
You weight under 300 pounds
You do not get angry when you see trees through your window
You want to make friends
You want to make a permanent impression and change
You are of healthy and sound mind
You don't hear the voices
You love survival games, but hate fighting for what you need

its an ok game i guess"
7833,i think i kinda like rust now fr like i havent showered in nearly 2 months really but besides that i think ym right hand to god backed with scientific evidence i on god situation'ly like rust i think its a fun game for those whod like a very peaceful time and i think this game is just it for people who like those type of games because you know its like rlly peaceful yk yk???
7834,"yes
"
7835,Start on a beach and have kids scream the most insane racist insults at you. Dont even wanna bother.
7836,It's fun to play with friends but really hard to play solo because you'll most likely die a lot and lose most of your gear. If you rage or have anger issues don't play other than that it is cool game. I recommend playing with friends though.
7837,"good game toxic community

Within one update they managed to fuck up this game faster than you can even imagine. They took the whole skill gap out of the game and ruined every single gun, it used to be fun playing the game because if someone was actually better they would win that fight, now its just a whole bunch of speds using cod guns with aim cone and just hoping you can get that lucky tripple headshot.

8012,"For a game that gets updates nearly every week this sure is a piece of buggy garbage. On macOS must force quit application every time to quit. Achievements only sometimes unlock (even on official servers). Walls and floors have a mind of their own. Zero tutorial and a mess of completely unintuitive commands and actions.

An example: you go to chop your first tree. What's with the big red X on the tree? You just gotta figure it out. Why does it move around? No idea. Is there a way to hit it better and have it jump around less? Who knows?

Nearly every mechanic in the game is flawed in this way. Yes, if you spend 10 hours playing and 3 hours reading reddit and watching YouTube videos ""it makes sense,"" but that should not be necessary. Like, how am I supposed to divine that I cannot remove a wall unless I build a TC first? Was it written in the stars? Crystal ball? Sheep's entrails?

In short: yes, this is an addictive game, but it could be a hundred times more fun with a healthy dose of QoL changes (and bug fixes). For heaven's sake, someone should give the developers a kick in the behind. This is amateur hour."

8034,"This game is an absolutely horrible example of toxic community and poor servers. In most cases, halfway through a proper setup a server would disappear from the history list, only to reappear with all my data wiped, beds gone and player dead. ""killed by dumpy"". Loading is boringly slow in every case, its hugely competetive and therefore also festing with cheaters that admins just cant keep up with. That, the toxicity and the regular server wipes (or server CRASH wipes) serve up a dishearthening experience that just....doesnt reward you back in any way. If you're a masochist, do give it a go."

8049,making a base with friends can be really fun
8050,"look to begin with let me start by saying that rust isnt a bad game. Now, does that make it good, great, or maybe amazing? No. Rust is okay. Its a fun game when you play with friends and dont take it too seriously, but that isnt always the case. Some people play this game 24/7 and treat it like their lives depend on it. Now thats the case with most games, but it is especially true for rust. Now dont get me wrong sometimes of course you take a game serious let me give other moments in games as examples, you are losing in COD, matchpoint in ranked siege, final zone in apex/fortnite/warzone, but rust is different. Some people know how to have fun but others dont get how you could play Rust in an un-competitive way. I play Rust where i have fun but take it serious when i need to. But some people i play with they dont think its the right way to do it. And thats the only problem with Rust. People just dont know how to have fun. Rust is an okay game, but when you learn how to mess around and have fun in it it becomes a 100x times better."

8076,"There is a lot of negative talk about toxic players. Which granted there are a lot. But there are as equally amount of nice or anti toxic (they will hunt them down)  

The crafting and building takes a little bit of learning but once you get it. its pretty simple. Can be hard when your out looking for one resource (animals. or stones etc..) so set out for a few as to not get bored, but not lose track.

Playing with friends DOES indeed make it easier. but there are also servers with 2x-10x resources. Which is quite helpful if you plan to play alone. 

Combat is not to bad once you get the hang of it and are able to get some decent gear which does not take long. 

TIPS 

DO not set up camp near where you spawn or along the beach. Find a quite area. better if surround by trees to help cover it up. 

Not everyone is going to hurt you. Be friendly first. 
Dont Give up if u happen to get KOS (killed on sight) a few times as a new player. You are not losing much untill u get a base raided."

8088,"This is a cool game.  I really like how you can you shoot bear with a nife.  After I went into a really good church with the cannibals, I died from weight loss.  I raged so hard that I stepped on my pet Komodo dragons tail.  He was really mad so he called us his friends and they hert me.  Then over night, they put me on a boat to Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch in wales.  I then Skyped my grandmother to tell her what happened.  She told me she didn’t care because I put turkey in her pasta (she’s allergic to turkey[and she’s allergic to pasta]).  The moral of the story is never adopt a pet Komodo dragon from some guy named Ziggle McButtBooger under the street light in a random town in Tuvalu.  It turns out Komodo dragons run the streets.  My Komodo dragon says he wants to put my head In front of a pressure washer in the middle of a Arbys ( we have the meets ).  هشهش.  I really enjoyed the game and would play it again.  If only I can sell my Komodo dragon for some gold fish."

8100,best/worst game ever very fun when you get the hang of it
8101,"hard game, but to learn i would reccomend small map servers and low pop. hunting animals is a decent way to train your aim without risking really anything if you do it near your base. also if you're new just try to get a wood 1x1 down first and then expand, instead of trying to get a full stone 2x2 with airlock and risk losing everything. also dont make the same mistake i did and build 10 squares away from a road lol."

8144,"While not for the faint of heart, or those who can't take a little griefing every now and then, Rust offers a great deal of varying gameplay for a lot of different folks.  Very server-dependant, Rust can be an all-out pvp battle or a chill gather-and-build game.  Be prepared for losing everything at any time.  Rust is not a game where you should get attached to anything, but instead enjoy the learning experience.  Every time you log in your experience will be different, and there's a TON of aftermarket plug-ins supported that expand on gameplay and keep things interesting.

Rust is definitely a game where you need to keep trying when you start.  Don't give up, keep picking yourself back up, and you'll soon discover a deep and rewarding game with fantastic community and mod support."

8157,A great game to meet new friends. wonderful community and very nice player-base.
8158,"good game not for the average gamer a good challenge from dedicated players. Gonna be honest one if not the most toxic gaming communities, but just makes it great when you find one nice player. Would highly recommend having friends to play the game with as it is very slow paced and boring and strait out unfair while playing solo against other teams and solo servers have low population most of the time. $40 bucks is a bit high for a game this old in my opinion, but stay watching for sales as I got the game for $20 for summer sale and the game often goes on  sales along with the dlcs. overall I do recommend if you're interested  but don't be surprised about raging nor the amount of slurs and curse words you may hear."
8159,"its a good game and has constant updates, just deal with the strugle in the start and you will be ok later on"

8199,Fun game! Definitely recommend. Takes forever to load on my gaming laptop (it's ~3yrs old now) but likely an issue on my end only. Gameplay will get the adrenaline going but also fun to chill and collect and build in an area where you feel you're alone. You're never alone. Best lesson I can say is don't get too attached to your items.

8217,Rust is a great game i play it all the time. But on the other hand there is so many special ed kids in this game i mean the iq level of the players on a server is below average. I think instead of rust being somewhat above a certain age to buy you should have a high enough iq to play this game as well because i am losing brain cells.
8218,"just a great game
"
8219,"i wanna die got like 250 hours dont play

8220,its aight
8221,"I shall preface this review in stating a few things. First off I have never played this game on my own, so I can't truly tell you what this game is like without friends preloading into servers with you. Secondly, I have in no way fully explored the full potential of this game and I played it a bit ago, so my thoughts on this game will be different to what the game is like today. And thirdly this is my impression of the game, so take it with a pinch of salt...
With that being said this game is somewhat of a mixed bag for me personally, but overall a game I'd recommend for the fun I had with my friends in this game. So you start off in the world, naked, cold and afraid, and you try and survive in this vicious world in which sadistic people spear you for the measley rock in your hands. But luckily for me I had a team, and we'd build our own places and venture out to try and interact with the people out there. Most of the time we'd be met with violence, but it's the rare magical encounters that kept us going through the tedium of building a base (especially when you are constantly raided so have to rebuild all over again). 
I think this is why this is a game I'd recommend, because when you can serenade groups of people to your cause just by singing, or forge alliances to defeat a common enemy, this is where the game excels. And with modded servers with faster resource gathering you can easily build bases and have fun. So overall I'd recommend this, especially if you have friends with the game, 7/10"

8295,"This game will push most laptops to the limit, Ive put additional cooling on my MSI. The game play is really good. I think some more anti cheat would be great and perma bans for any sort of cheating would be awesome. Some server admins are really on the ball and everynow and again you see the 'xxxxx player banned' for hacking. I have had 2 bases raided from impossible ways. Admin couldnt find any historical data so assumed it was a hack as user admin. 
I have 1300 hours, im still terrible at pvp but at least I dont cheat, nothing better than having a fire fight with someone else who is useless and it goes on for 5 minutes or so.
I would like to see a way of seeing your own hidden stashes, I forever loose them bastards."

8301,"This game is very fun to play especially if you have friends with you, alone it can be boring but that's just any game.

8484,"One of the better builder / survival games i've played in a longtime. I got this game for free during giveaway back in its early release stage, i played it, hated it and closed it. UNTIL NOW. Recently, i played it again, and boy, this game has come a long way. The overall graphical fidelity is wonderful and there's so much more to do and so many people to battle or bases to steal / build and epic sites / monuments to loot and compete for. Essentially Minecraft mixed with some sort of fallout and tarkov / squad based survival fps blend. The largest drawbacks to this game honestly are the overall community of toxic players, the INSANE LONG load times (especially first time loading or whatever... jesus, can be upwards of 15-20 minutes..luckily you only have to load once..), and the optimization could be more efficient. Playing solo can be very difficult and brutal when squads of players raid you or gang up on you, hours of time are to be put in, but can easily be lost. Outside these factors, most servers seem to run by a weekly/ monthly basis, which is great until you realize half of them arent even weekly like they say they are, they just slap the tag onto the server. Another solid complaint is definitely the ""soft siding"" mechanic, where placing a wall from certain angles can simply ruin your own base or make a weakpoint, and sometimes you cant undo the wall to even fix it, even as the builder. This can be frustrating for starting players. Also server pops die incredibly fast, one day will be 200+ next will be like 30 players dead asf, i dont understand the mindset of quitting so quickly. Outside these factors, this game is one of the best survival builder fps type blends i've ever played, one of the best games to play with friends period."

8532,"
Michael ""Mike"" Ehrmantraut is a Marine Corps veteran, former Philadelphia police officer, and a calm and calculating career criminal. He worked for both Gustavo Fring and Saul Goodman as a private investigator, head of security, cleaner, fixer, and hitman. He has extensive knowledge of how to operate on both sides of the law without detection. As a former beat cop and true professional, Mike maintains an extensive, up-to-date knowledge of forensic evidence, surveillance equipment, and police procedure. Mike is also well trained and calm in all types of combat situations, once using science and long strategy to take down a large number of hostiles with ease.

Background
Mike was born sometime in 1940-1944. He remembers his father as leaving him a ""cold-water flat and a stack of bills,"" implying he didn't have a very good childhood. (""Coushatta"") It's implied that Mike served as a marine scout sniper in the Vietnam War (""Gloves Off""). It is possible he has a history in special operations or intelligence agencies, as he has extensive knowledge of surveillance equipment and is well trained in stealth tactics. He also mentions that he specializes in tracking individuals down, no matter where they are in the world. Mike had previously been married for 22 years. (""Wiedersehen"")

For thirty years, Mike was employed at the Philadelphia Police Department as a beat cop, frequently having to deal with situations such as break-ins and domestic disputes. His career was mired in corruption, with his fellow officers pressuring him into accepting bribes and participate in protection rackets. When his son Matt joined the force, and faced similar peer pressure, Mike was forced to persuade his son to go along with the corruption. Unfortunately, Matt's partner Troy Hoffman and their sergeant, Jack Fensky, distrusted Matt and murdered him by staging a gangland shooting. Devastated by the loss of his son, Mike fell into alcoholism and depression until he decided to take action. He announced his retirement from the PPD, and staged another bout of binge drinking, during which he tricked Hoffman and Fensky into believing he had evidence on them. When the duo came after Mike, he allowed them to drive him to a deserted alleyway with the intent of staging his suicide. Brandishing a hidden pistol and throwing off the illusion of his drunken stupor, Mike gunned down Hoffman and Fensky, suffering a shoulder wound in the process. He departed for Albuquerque the following day, where he reestablished ties with his daughter-in-law Stacey, who had moved there several months earlier."

8555,"First, they added those new uggly sounds. So I and other half of players had to put up with it. And now they gonna add those new horrible and unconviniet interface to furnices, seriously? The new design is horrible at least because players lose they possibility to use it as an extra storage and because it lost it's variability. So now they tell us we need to find more space just for f77king furnices? Really? Mostly I love what they doing to make them game better. But last updates doesn't make game better, but make game worse. So I don't reccomend this game because right now no one knows how worse this game could became in the future."

8611,hello and welcome to what is hopefully my final attempt at completing gta 5 without taking any damage. i have max hp of 1 so any damage from any source will immediately kill me.i also want this to be a no hit run so trevor's special ability is disabled because while using it you do will still get hit by things. i have successfully completed every single mission without taking damage but i have yet to do it all in one run. my personal best bit of damage therefore one death. that's obviously very close to a perfect run so i'm hoping this time this run will actually be perfect. per usual michael and brad are my human shields and i kill everyone while they're in cars to prevent them from shooting me but i make sure to shoot the cars at a time when they're aren't gonna block my line of sight

You will grind your way to getting some part of a decent little base together.

8750,New player so i couldnt really play because i just kept getting killed
8751,this game is the worst thing ive touched in my life
8752,I think I am fluent in Russian now.
8753,"I love looking at the naked aspect of the game, and before you say it, no I don't mean the naked characters (maybe I do). Its so awesome seeing the true ""raw"" nature aspect of the game, the rocks clashing the creating of bases, and mostly racist slurs with the voice chat option. It makes for a great game, but your soul is at cost and risk, adventure, exploration, grind for it all to be taken by a child up past his bed time. Unique game play but at what cost, humiliation!"

8761,"Many people are unhappy with some if the recent updates this game has released. I am not entirely against what they are saying. The game was definitely more fun before the recoil update, but this game is in no way a bad game. I feel the reason people disagree with this update is because they are not used to change. This change is what the game needed. Many new people are downloading this game from recent promotions through twitch. Therefore, the game needs a way to introduce new players and give them a fair advantage otherwise they will more than likely not continue playing the game. The consistent updates this game is releasing are necessary for the game to prosper. If you are considering getting this game I recommend it to you. I would recommend you quickly find a group to play with otherwise this game could get annoying very quickly. People that you may know or people that you may meet in this game will give you the confidence and drive to continue playing. Personally I met my group I play with now when I was at around 750 hours. Here we are almost 3000 hours in and we are still consistently playing games together. I would not trade the experiences and laughs these people have given me for anything. Every game has its negatives, but overall Rust is worth it."
8762,If you wanna hate yourself for playing to much its the game for you
8763,very good game.
8764,it is a really fun game

8769,"I woke up on a beach naked, next to hundreds of little ♥♥♥♥♥ that ran in every direction to gather some basic ressources. Me, being the absolute unit that i am, instead of acting like all of those peasants, i directly went for the kill, killing the naked next to me with a rock. Having bashed a skull with that rock and tasting the blood of this poor indian men made me go into a killing spree. Breaking every bones in my opponent's body made me fell powerful. Then, the same indian guy i had killed came back to me and started to pierce holes through my body with his fashioned wooden spear. My body, not able to withstand anymore damage, crumpled to the floor, like a piece of garbage you'd throw on the ground. My ennemy, whils't taking all the ressources i had gathered by killing all of those naked innocents, said quite a bit of racial slurs whom made me scared of him. As we say in rust, a man who's not affraid of using the n word, is a man you should ask mercy from. And i did exactly that. I asked him to spare my nude, pierced body. He seemed to think about it for quite a wile and then, to my surprise, said yes in an aproximated english. A friendship than begun.

With this man, i killed many. With this man, i built the best houses known to humanity. With this man, i laughed and drank. After 4 months of playing together, just before a raid, i asked him to sit in a plastic chair that i'd found in a crate. He sat down, thinking that i'd give him an impressive speach about why our incoming battle was our most fierce and hard battle, but that we'd still win. Then, i pulled out a weapon that made him realise what was about to happen. With this weapon, in a single blow, i made his body crumple to the floor. I then told him to remember when we met for the first time, and, just as he was about to pleade with me, i ended his life with that same wooden spear that had pierced my body 4 months ago.

Never trust anyone in rust, even your closest friends.

Also, bear in mind that your character is created randomly and you have no control over anything about the character, and you are limited to one character and that is it. Still, it can be fun.

8911,"I will be fast and clear with my review. I started playing Rust around summer 2017 with a friend. Simply one of the best survival games out there! Here are my pros and cons:

Pros:
- enormous player base
- beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay
- can play with friends
- weapons and clothing customization
- unique base building
- a lot of PVP action
- raiding enemy player bases
- different type of servers ( modded, vanilla, community, etc.)
- day and night cycle
- every month the game has a major update and all servers wipe
- large maps filled with monuments, caves, icebergs, ships, animals and more


Cons:
- you can get OFFLINE raided
- time consuming (especially if you want to play solo)
- weapon recoil requires dedication and practice (especially the AK)
- if you want to play solo get ready to be wrecked during your first 100 - 200 hours
- to craft items you need to find and learn blueprints (also time consuming af)
- you can get randomly kicked out of a server because of a TIMED OUT connection
- requires a decent gaming PC
- FPS optimization lacks in some zones of the map

I hope this review will help you!"
8912,"What happened, who's been feeding me?"
8913,good game  bud
8914,I love the idea of this game and how it seems to play. But..I only know of this through video due to the requirements of this game to run are quite high if you are not as financially stable as others. Due to not being very financially stable my computer was unable to run the game causing my experience to be nonexistent. So if you are thinking of getting this game make sure you have a computer that has higher than 8GB of ram. Good game I guess.
8915,"Game is very great, has many diffrent things for people"
8916,alright game not good for longtimes
8917,i may have lost my loved ones and my social life but i have gained the ability to stay up for 3 days straight
8918,"Of all the games I own, Rust is one of them."
8919,After 300 hours i wanted to kill myself. After 500 hours I attempted suicide. After 800 hours I started doing drugs. Now I've overcome my pathetic existence and ascended beyond this world. This game is ruins relationships and makes you suicidal. After the recoil rework the game feels like a survival r6. Only buy if you want to kill your self. 10/10 would do it again (with old recoil)

Then I realized I wanted to play again and kill the guy, but he was long gone, like my dad when he said he would get some milk. Other than that, it was a good game. I recommend it."

I'll never get the chance to play rust again so don't take any chances with overlays or modified game files such as reshade otherwise you'll end up like me."

P.S: your gonna hate bears after 10 mins of playing this game 9/10"

"
9054,"This has the same grievances I have with ARK, except there isn't any funny dinos
If I have to stay awake only so that my base doesn't get raided, and if I go to sleep than my entire base explodes because some no-sleep loser decides to raid it at 3 AM, than it doesn't deserve to be played.

1/10, there's not even funny dinos"
9055,Rust it’s a game that is outstanding from other survival games and you can do everything you want with your friends or alone. In my opinion it is a game that is very interesting and it is value for money these days because you also have -50% so it’s a big chance to buy it !
9056,maybe
9057,"Must buy for those named Kenny West on lucid city, some say he's friends with Aspect Ace now known as Aspect Clearwater. You might also be wondering what this has to do with rust.... nothing. Don't buy very shit game."

You will die and get raided but [b] don't sleep on this game [/b]. You can't get bored when something can always be done. Farming and pvping in this game is 10/10"
9069,TIS GOOD
9070,"haven't played the game in literal years, someone hacked into my account and got me banned from the game. 100% i get if it sounds like i just made it up to try and get unbanned. totally understandable reaction. but there literally is no other way to describe what happened. the dude reset my name (it was a really not okay name, so i deleted my name histoy, convienent i know but i didn't want a past name anyone could see and people think it was me), played some other games (though didn't get me banned from those). tried to talk with rust (i think, it was over 3 months ago, i talked with someone who said they couldn't help, idk if it was steam or rust). 3 months later still banned. i honestly don't even care, again, i haven't played in years. i just don't like it showing up on steam page. makes me feel like i did something i wasn't supposed to, but, i haven't had the game downloaded since i change PCs almost over a year ago now, and even when it was downloaded i hadn't opened it in years. so it's not like i'm gonna be upset if i'm banned. i just don't like it showing up my steam.

is it a good game? maybe. but i won't ever be able to tell you because i'm banned for something someone else did. but negative review until rust wants to figure this out with me

also ignore pfp, i think it's cringy af but that's the entire point lol"

9129,"I know damn well I'm not nearly as good as 99% of people in these reviews w/ my 40ish hours but this game deserves its reputation. So fucking sweaty, so annoying, but when you finally get that edge, you are addicted to it. Most new players quit as soon as they join. Thats obvious with my whole friend group. But that one gunfight.
That one fucking edge over them.
Anyways, who's down to get destroyed for 7 days then win one gunfight and pop open Vodka?"

Finding the right server can be tough but once are able to find one that fits you it is hard to get off of this game.I came from console rust and coming to this version of rust comes with a lot of more content. I highly recommend this game to people who like a challenge and being able to communicate with other players. Hope you find this comment helpful.

9278,"An in-depth review of Rust.
I spawned as a naked on the beach and begin hitting trees. In the next 20 minutes that followed I had been killed 67 times. Been called every racial slur known to the English language and apparently every 13 year old has had sex with my relatives. After this time had past i managed to build a small base with the wood I had gathered. I was then raided by full metal AK players who made monkey noises while they destroyed my base and killed me. 
10/10 would recommend."

9347,"I woke up on a beach naked, next to hundreds of little shits that ran in every direction to gather some basic ressources. Me, being the absolute unit that i am, instead of acting like all of those peasants, i directly went for the kill, killing the naked next to me with a rock. Having bashed a skull with that rock and tasting the blood of this poor indian men made me go into a killing spree. Breaking every bones in my opponent's body made me fell powerful. Then, the same indian guy i had killed came back to me and started to pierce holes through my body with his fashioned wooden spear. My body, not able to withstand anymore damage, crumpled to the floor, like a piece of garbage you'd throw on the ground. My ennemy, whils't taking all the ressources i had gathered by killing all of those naked innocents, said quite a bit of racial slurs whom made me scared of him. As we say in rust, a man who's not affraid of using the n word, is a man you should ask mercy from. And i did exactly that. I asked him to spare my nude, pierced body. He seemed to think about it for quite a wile and then, to my surprise, said yes in an aproximated english. A friendship than begun. 

With this man, i killed many. With this man, i built the best houses known to humanity. With this man, i laughed and drank. After 4 months of playing together, just before a raid, i asked him to sit in a plastic chair that i'd found in a crate. He sat down, thinking that i'd give him an impressive speach about why our incoming battle was our most fierce and hard battle, but that we'd still win. Then, i pulled out a weapon that made him realise what was about to happen. With this weapon, in a single blow, i made his body crumple to the floor. I then told him to remember when we met for the first time, and, just as he was about to pleade with me, i ended his life with that same wooden spear that had pierced my body 4 months ago.

Never trust anyone in rust, even your closest friends.

9366,"Unfortunately couldn't get it to run reasonably with a regular harddrive, so honestly can't recommend it.
The loading times easily went all the way to 20-30 minutes just to get onto a server and the game crashed upon tweaking graphics settings.
Having a permanent character that I truely disliked admittedly left a sour taste in my mouth as well and I know I would've felt like I'll always have it in my mind that I would've hoped to get something I actually dig. But ofcourse know that I could have never changed it. I know this is an opinion many people (who don't care about how their character looks) aggressively criticise and mock - that it's a ""non-issue"", but I can't try and pretend like it wasn't a factor for me. If there's a variable set of how characters can look, I've always loved customizing a character and said characters have always varied in race and gender too. But just being handed something you don't like shouldn't be an issue either. I don't know why it has been made one.
 
If the dev wanted persistent looks for the characters, I certainly would've appreciated a one time choice, not something just being pushed onto me.

Still, the majority of the cause was on the technical issues I faced of course, I wouldn't have refunded on that alone. Just saying that I likely would've had the motivation to keep on cracking down on how to improve my performance past the 2 hour mark if I at least had a ""lucky roll"" in a character I actually like. Weird that it's such a contentious matter that someone would hope for a character they like in a game. 

If I return in the future through a discount or once I get an SSD (and I get a new motherboard, as my still-surprisingly-good-but-dated motherboard doesn't support M2 NVMe SSD's), I'll ofcourse re-write the review."

9421,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

9570,"Before anything is said about the gameplay itself, I just wanted to say that this game can very easily become a complete waste of money. The EAC (Their anticheat service), alongside their human support team, do quite literally nothing in terms of appeals from bans. They've permanently banned accounts off a simple mistake on their end, and proceeded to do nothing to reimburse the holder of the account. Not only that, but they also hit you with many automated messages until you tickle their ballsacks enough to get a human to talk to you, which will only repeat the phrases the fuckin robot said. But the gameplay is great, solid 8/10 game. wouldn't recommend buying it tho, as there is a pretty moderate chance of them just terminating you off of all EAC-protected games cuz why not lmao"
9571,"It's really a relaxing game, you can build, hunt, explore, raid, pretty much whatever you wanna do, its like adult minecraft in a way lol"

9573,dan macelaru approves
9574,Maybe this game is more fun with a group but I tried playing solo on a server with a small amount of people (cuz if you go on a bigger one you just get killed constantly) and it just feels like a very dry & unimaginative walking simulator.  Maybe its one of those games where you have to play for a while before it becomes fun but I dont like those kind of games.
9575,good g ame ngl 6 hors
9576,shit game motha fucka's changed recoil that i dedicated my life too

9622,"Don't buy this game. Don't play this game. This game fucking sucks. I wish I had the 1.5k hours of my life back.  Pitch black nights, the most toxic community online - I'd rather vibe with League of Legends players then the scum of the earth that infests this game. Facepunch exists to give you 30 minute load times and the inbred cellar dwelling nerds at the company have created a day night cycle where the night is pitch black. Can't find your own fucking dick in the dark black. Nothing like getting some in game items only to get offlined. Fuck Rust. Fuck Facepunch. ""You've played an additional 12 hours - would you like to revise your review?"" prompt: Game crashed twice in outpost, lost 1.5k scrap. spent two hours of those 12 hours just trying to get game to load. FP makes a quality product."
9623,Game is amazing
9624,very good game
9625,very nice but very laggy even tho i have a gaming pc but no worrys if you got a good pc unlike mine its a fine game to play you can build bases play with your bros and have game time
9626,its fun
9627,"nice
"
9628,All this game is a bunch of no life kids who play this game 24/7 and have been for the last 8 years if your new to the game  you cant farm mats to make a base without being killed and having it all taken you cant go get loot crates to get weapons because the players with the best guns are gonna come kill you to take the crate where you get a pistol or shotgun you cant do anything on this game unless you dedicate your entire life to the game and even then when you do that youll just be destroyed by some hackers
9629,I want my 40 euro back
9630,the beast game iv ever played

9638,zaza
9639,I absolutely LOVE this game! It's so addictive and there is so much to do! I love the realism and the action that the game includes. The experience is definitely worth 40 bucks.
9640,gun go pew
9641,"i am currently not enjoying this game but there has been glimmers of hope. Playing on regular servers was not fun for me, because i was constantly getting killed by people who are better. something i did enjoy was just playing on servers where progress wasn't a major concern. I'm talking about minicopter servers and stuff. If you don't have many friends who want to want to play, don't get it. But if you have friends who are willing to either teach you or learn with you, buy it."
9642,"i love the feeling of being raped by chinese zergs and hackers 100% recomend
"
9643,good game. community eh.
9644,If you kill an admin and they ban you for no reason is even better so dont waste ur time playing rust if someone  is gonna get mad about it.

9662,"Good game very diffucult
"
9663,"very engaging and deep, if you like games that require you to think - you'll like it. It's not call of duty"
9664,"My favorite game of all time is all of sudden not my favorite game anymore.  4.5k hours deep.  My group and I are 20k hours deep and we all feel the same.  This is not rust anymore.  I miss the days when Alistar didnt listen to streamer and wanted his game to be hard.  Now its all about attracting casuals and not having a hardcore fan base.  The difficulty has dropped to an all time low.

If they add a hard mode.  Does that make the normal game easy mode?"
9665,ppp
9666,Yeah i enjoy the game and would push for others to play it to if you have friends and time to play i recommend Vanilla servers for those who dont have time or maybe even friends do a modded server like 1000X with a short wipe easy to loot up fight and doesnt matter if your base gets raided or you die you can jump off for weeks months years come back and it makes no diffrence then Vanilla taking days to build and loot up to die in 5 mins
9667,gg
9668,great game! highly recomend it!

9700,good game
9701,IT IGHT
9702,I cant stop playing this game.
9703,yes
9704,"Extremely solid and rewarding survival game. Do wish there was an SP or Co-Op mode to allow new players or others to fool around and learn the game without the worries of hostile players or map wipes. Aside from that, there is a more egregious problem with this game. Honestly, I'm not sure if anyone is willing to be honest about this, but I'll be the brave soul that says it. I would like to apologize to everyone including my family as this is a difficult statement that may trigger others and be seen as offensive. The truth is... this game has zero hot dogs. There I said it. The game needs glizzies. 

Other than that it is a fantastic game!"
9705,Everyone in the game is constantly mad. I love it
9706,fun
9707,cool
9708,"I really tried to like Rust.  The graphics are nice, the game play is adequate and even the newbie servers seemed nice.

Until, I logged off.  I spent a few hours learning the game, building myself a little piece of paradise and as soon as I log off, something or someone kills me and takes everything.

I thought that maybe this was a one-off or a fluke, but for the next week, no matter what I built (wood, stone, steel), I would die and lose it all every single time I logged off.

It's like getting kicked in the nuts every single time you login.

What exactly is the point here?  This isn't fun, this would technically be described as torture.

I don't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't like starting from scratch every single time they login and knowing that they will never get anywhere by playing this game.

The total opposite of fun."

9722,"Amazing
"
9723,has to be the most toxic dysfunctional community ive ever seen and its made worse by zerg clans and hackers popping up more and more frquently just makes this game unplayable and just infuriating to even try.
9724,"This game is completely broken, the idea is amazing, the implication of the game is absolutely easy to comprehend, but its broken, you will find wide variety of bugs, so many hackers and very bad optimization.
considering that in your minds, you will find hackers even in the official servers.

9739,"Rust has to be my favorite game so far. While DayZ has the upper hand with more craft mechanics and such, but for some reason it still doesn't really compare to the originality and thrills this game comes with. My favorite part of the game is the value of life is so much more important than everything else, taking into consideration that everything is literally trying to kill you puts the odds way against you and soon knowing that you cant just tank damage like in other games, familiar or not, it adds lots of suspense and thrill knowing that any second you could get attacked by a bear or shot in the back and you wouldn't have seen it coming."
9740,"Only played a few times, nothing major. Raided a base or two in my time. Stole a few peoples things. Is what it is. gg. I will camp outside your base for 3 hours with a DB just to steal your corn seeds. Get @ me."

9742,"This game either suits you or it dosnt
and if does suit you. You've lost your free time you will be addicted
goodluck"
9743,The game is good but those pesky little grubs with eoka and db outside your base for hours do make you a lot more racist than you already were.
9744,Not as rusty as I expected
9745,"i love going around and butt fucking people with rocks. fucking people up with rocks is probably the best part of the game. i love hearing the screams of thee ten year old kids screaming the N word. but the bad part is when you get gang bangd bay an 8 man.

9816,love it bashing others with rocks when im naked
9817,Best sandbox game I have ever played after No Mans Sky
9818,"This game is not good, i always get banned when i send my CP delivery in chat"
9819,"Join Server, Build, Kill, Die"
9820,"Not for me, too much of a grind. Would refund if I could."
9821,its very fun and great to play with friends
9822,pretty okay
9823,Toxic community and The game is too addictive. -2/10. Would not recommend.
9824,.
9825,love it( server im on rustafied.com - us medium III) or (Rusty Moose Us biweekly)
9826,great game recomend
9827,game is horrible
9828,very good game
9829,Very good. Got a boner when getting hit with a rock
9830,"So this thing, I don't even want to call it a game at this point, is a product for a very specific group of people. If you're not in that specific group stay clear.
- Rust will do everything in it's power to control your life, spend a lot of it online, have a shift system with your teammates to watch your base and such. It wants you to build your life around it
- even then Rust will spit on all that effort with offline raid, when you have a real emergency
- other players will be assholes to you
- if you want to progress by an inch, prepare to grind for hours
- Rust will tempt you into becoming awful human, because it would save you so much work to offline raid that poor fellow
- whenever you don't like anything about Rust, there will be many cultists, that will jump on you telling it's because you are bad at it, and you should git good (look at comments on negative reviews)
- the above is not a sign of a toxic community per se, it's a sign of those traits being required to enjoy Rust
- to be competitive you need to play it for 6 hours a day minimum, and should do so in a tribe
- when you're not competitive, you will get stomped and possibly humiliated
- it's addictive - it's not a good trait for a game, despite how many use it as if it was nice to be addicted
- feels more like a job, than my job
If any of the above are not for you, stay clear. Stay far away and never look back. I'm dead serious here, unless you're okay with everything above, you should never touch Rust, as it very well might drag you in and then you will experience all of it.
If you are okay with all of the above, go for it, I'm happy you found your place. But please for the good of humanity, try to treat other players decently and with some dignity. Also remember - your family and friends are more important than virtual base."

9887,"The game's mechanics are actually pretty easy to manage and figure out. The main reason people wants to put their foot in a glue trap when they play this game is because of each other. If you meet nice people, thats cool but never expect ""nice people"". This game is hell. You will only do good in this game if you put time into it so buying this if you won't play it much is a horrible idea. Solo play is a thing but its horrible so if you don't got friends who will or do play this do not get this game. Somewhat cool survival mechanics, cool big map to explore, toxic players, the n-word, people under 12 who play this for some reason. What's not to love. 999/10 game!!!"

9914,"if your a young christian boy looking for a family friendly game to play, this is the one. Over my 125 hours in rust, ive never seen or heard any profanity and content that would be rated over pg-13. The ratings may decieve you though, as this game should be rated E for everyone. Any young child should get to experience rust at some point before they turn 13, as its mostly a game for young kids and most adults will not enjoy the fun content behind rust.

I rate this game 11/10"
9915,"One of the most toxic but fun multiplayer game that i have played, tons of stuff to do.
Gunplay is finally fixed!

9930,good asshole game
9931,good game to play with friends
9932,I am even more racist now.
9933,Rust is a amazing game its mastery of teamwork and the felling of going from powerless to powerful is perfect. The PvP is vary good so is the PvE. A part of the game that i really enjoy is doing monuments this often consists of a hard challenge such as Parkour of fighting bots followed by a room witch you have to swipe a card to get in swipe a card witch contains loot that varies on the card type you are swiping. Overall a 10/10 would recommend.

9944,"i hate this game, constantly getting raided, killed, out gunned, murdered by zergs. but thats also what makes it fun. makes you want to come back for more and more. the feeling of getting a kill or successfully winning a raid is exhilarating. makes you feel on top of the world."
9945,"I am a 47 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, joined a server and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he made me join his friends server. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

This game is a contender to be the top 5 greatest games of all time. There's much skill needed to be decent at this game."
9982,"Before playing Rust I was disillusioned with life, my wife had left me and had taken everything from me, my dignity, my pride, my house, my money...I had nothing, I was no one. Deeply depressed and dissuaded from carrying on this burden that life had laid upon me. I purchased for 20 US dollars Rust which I then promptly played on my Lenovo G550 which was the only thing my wife didn't take from in the divorce settlement. When loading the game I had this feeling of intense excitement."

9992,game is really fun if you play on a server with only people you know but playing on a public server is kind of like dragging your face across a stove on full heat except for a bit more painful. buy the game on sale if you have friends with it but otherwise don't get it at all
9993,AWESOME!!!!1
9994,"dont recommend 
"
9995,"The game is a sandbox to do almost everything, generally limited by other players.  Find the right server to play on, and where possible, the right players to play with and against.  Avoid official servers - they are the worst possible servers to start on.  In my opinion, Facepunch are blatantly negligent in administrative duties, with cheaters ruining the game with little consequence.  Private servers are the only options."
9996,"it's very tough to start playing, but all round it's a fantastic game"

10012,"I played rust during the pandemic lockdown and became absolutely obsessed with every aspect of the game. Granted that I've spent most of my time in PVE servers with Purge PVP and to be fair, I played on One server in particular, Chaotic Gaming, that became RP and Chill late last year. The server is well maintained and there are so many different things to do because Rust allows map customisations and custom plugins there allows you to do things like Submarine events, boss fights and limitless Roleplaying possibilities. 

BIG NOTE
PVP servers are intense and definitely not for everyone. Would recommend if it's your first time playing, please try a less populated server or a PVE server to get the mechanics down first, i must admit, PVP servers are fun once in awhile but absolutely torture as a new player.

More than that, in Rust, I found the love of my life. I met my girlfriend in Rust and until today we still enjoy this game together. We're going on one year this August 6th and we were doing long distance in the beginning of our relationship and Rust has helped tremendously bridge that gap.

I may be bias, but this is the best game in the world ;)"
10013,only fun part of this game is playing oppa stoppa on the piano

10043,"do you like having ur ass hole ripped apart by 14 Russians at 4am while protecting ur shitty little base then get racially abused after they remove said shitty base and call your mum a whore well then this pile of mouldy steaming shit is for you so spend 20 odd quid of ur mums money and get ready for the molestation of your life which you are about to waste.

in conclusion this game is dreadful but if your like me you gonna waste many hours across many accounts which you loose to so called offensive language after the game turns you into a racist homophobic gremlin."
10044,you can draw in it which is cool ig
10045,Awesome game 😊

10048,everyone is very friendly and nice good game.
10049,"Got a game ban for absolutely NO reason at all, and the developer just passes the buck to ezy cheat who don't even respond to emails. Clearly no care for customer service because they make all their money selling in-game skins. meanwhile after 12 years on steam i have a  red mark on my account for a banned game thanks to a false positive for some third party software."
10050,"idk if I spent these 800 hours well but the game is alr
Better with friends"
10051,i ran up to my neighbors house blew up the door (idiot didnt have an air lock) then i ran up to him and shot in in the face with my home made pistol then i ran home them played rust
10052,"It's Rust. A game released in 2018 and has had constant updates to this day. Every update or change is always an improvement. Almost 100% of Rust is PVP based. If you're looking for a relaxing survival game this is not for you. You'll wake up in the middle of the night with cold sweats wondering if your base has been raided or not. You'll start to think ""Is 2 hours of sleep worth more than protecting what I've worked for for 13 hours?"" It's more hardcore than any other FPS. Most first person shooters I've played have been ""Run and Gun"" but Rust puts you to the test when competing with over 100 other people. Wipe day is like a Black Friday Sale and everything is $1 in the Best Buy. What's crazy is PVP isn't even the only thing in this game. Base building is so fun. There are so many different bases and build strategies. Pixel gaps, wide gaps, peak downs, there's just so much you can do to build a cool base. The cost of becoming the best in a server is dedicating your entire life. You become addicted and the game turns into job. If you stop playing at any point to get some rest after playing for 48 hours straight, you can lose everything in 10 minutes. Everything you do in this game is a risk. Playing Rust is gambling. Of course, if spending your entire week grinding for a base isn't your thing, the modded servers do a great job with accomplishing everything you want in a day. 

Overall:
 - A group of friends are not required, but is highly advised
 - Graphics are great
 - Game is getting constant updates
 - PVP is fluid, fast, and versatile
 - Base Building is unique and fun
 - Replayability

10109,this new update is so fucking dogshit. the guns are so poorly designed and balanced. now your screen goes red and shot cant see fuck all every time you take any damage. every time u pull out a bow your screen spasms. but dont worry guys. they added an easier way to suicide in gmae from the menus. so 10/10 for this new update honestly. game geniuses great fucking job u dickheads

10117,good game for good people
10118,Best game
10119,"The game is pretty fun if you are into multiplayer survival stuff. Better than the others in the genre I'd say. Gathering/crafting/surviving is pretty easy to deal with and the menus are easy to navigate. Big plus considering some games (No Mans Sky) have inventory management systems that make me want to punch the screen. Hunger/thirst are not a constant annoyance and are very easy to manage after the first 30 minutes of the game. 

The real trick to enjoying Rust is to find a server that fits your play style. If you are normal functioning human who has a job and things to do, you can find a server that does not allow offline raiding for example. Took me a while to realize that building a base and then getting raided when you log off for the day is not the only way you can play rust. While some people find that fun, I think I passed that phase of my life (on a computer game all day) a long time ago. More power to them, however, lots of people love that shit."

10171,"Rust has to be one of my favorite games thus far, it teaches you several lessons disguised as gameplay. The game and all of its mechanics work well to create what may seem like a ""slow-paced BR"", making Rust such a great game. Rust is a fun game to play with friends or alone, experience in this game plays a heavy factor and the come ups you make at each stage of the game provide such a thrilling experience. 10/10"
10172,ive never been called more slurs
10173,"While this may not be a game to everyone's taste, as a new player, I've found it incredibly entertaining. The crafting is crisp and sensible, the weapons work and aim well with a bit of practice, and the larger goal--gather, craft, build, and kill everything--seems to be a satisfying loop.

A few notes:
- Don't trust anyone. Yes, they may be friendly and engage you in chat, give you free stuff, and help your end goals, but they'll probably turn on you, ruin your base, and take everything from you. Like Dark Souls-y games, once you learn that you will die and lose everything, it becomes a *lot* more fun. You can always rebuild, and will, but getting upset about it won't help your next base or your blood pressure.
- Starting out, search for 3 hemp plants, build a sleeping bag, and drop it in an area you want to live. This should be close to some bigger areas with resources, but off the beaten path so you don't attract undue attention.
- Build a tool cabinet as soon as you create a base. It keeps other players from building too close to you; I think it gives you ~50m if I recall.
- Upgrade your base to protect it as you gather resources--wood and stone, hopefully with a hatchet and pick-axe, respectively--but remember that your base requires those same resources to keep from breaking down. Want a metal door? Awesome. It's great against nighttime ne'er-do-wells who want to take everything from you; however, you'll need to keep a constant supply of metal shards in your tool cabinet to maintain it. Stick with stone at the start; it should serve you well and is easily available.
- Enjoy a wild community of diverse servers and game styles. The servers that ban PVP killing and have unlimited resources can be a bit boring at the, ""Wait, so...there isn't much to do now with my awesome base since nobody is near me and I have all a fully-upgraded weapon tree"", but they're a phenomenal place to learn the basics of how everything comes together."

1 łyżka cukru wanilinowego
2 jaja

PRZYGOTOWANIE
Mąkę wsypać do miski, dodać proszek do pieczenia, sól, cukier, cukier wanilinowy. Wszystko wymieszać a następnie dodać jajka, olej roślinny oraz mleko. Zmiksować mikserem na gładką masę, tylko do połączenia się składników. Ciasto można odstawić aby odpoczęło (na około 15 minut), ale nie jest to konieczne.
Rozgrzać gofrownicę. Gofry piec przez około 3 - 3,5 minuty lub przez czas podany w instrukcji gofrownicy. Nakładamy ciasto chochlą i wypukłą stroną łyżki rozprowadzamy ciasto dokładnie po całej powierzchni.

Now if Facepunch could just fix their anticheat to get rid of the people hacking the game it would be a true masterpiece. Stay off of the official servers as they are infested with hackers. Modded servers with active admins still provide a very enjoyable gaming experience by actively investigating and banning people who cheat. 9/10, best game in the genre by far."

10250,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

Eventually the loading screens just completely stopped. When I realized this was gonna happen every time I load into a server, I decided to uninstall. Unless you have a $3,000 PC, don't bother getting this. It'll be a waist of your time, money, and storage space."
10608,the best game

10635,GOOD GAME VERY GOOD
10636,"3/10. If you have lots of time to spare, go for it I guess. I love survival games, but the playerbase is what makes this game unfun for me. There's basically nothing you can do unless you join a very new server or spend lots of time getting decent at the game. The loading times for this game are also absurdly long, taking upwards of 7-8 minutes. Not worth $40, wait for when it goes on sale once every 20 years if you do wanna buy it. In the meantime, if you want to play a game like this, go play ARK if you got it for free. Way more fun tbh."

Rust like to see good players as cheaters, if you do not have any connection with devs or facepunch with not being popular you are holding a perma ban. I personalty have had this problem with my first account getting banned for the first mass ban when they had a issue with it banning people. Then my second time because the easy anti cheat on facepunch servers. Hope this helps some with knowing what could happen."

10885,dope game.
10886,"This is a game that unless experienced with a friend/relative to share in the pain then you will struggle to squeeze the fun from it! If you couldn't tell from the thousand hour player reviews below, this is not a game but a way of life. Normally over a hundred hours in any other title would result in a pretty reputable opinion and review of said game..not here! Here your cred is measured in many thousands of hours and for those souls that live and breathe this game I can only salute your commitment and wonder at your life choices....but back to this game...

It is a challenging, unforgiving game that will reward your quick survival instincts if you are not assaulted by a heavily armoured individual or group that are simply patrolling, got bored and decided to gun down your naked rear. In the early days of rust, playing alongside my younger brother who had sunk more hours in, we managed to get into a server that had recently been wiped. This meant everyone had to start from ground zero, naked and afraid with a rock as your only tool for survival. We quickly found a spot to start constructing our small shop and soon (I mean hours later!) we had our solid structure that couldn't be broken into easily. We had a glass front for customers to approach and we used proximity chat to communicate the cost of better tools for resources. This worked for a time, we put on friendly Russian accents for some reason and things were going good. We even put on a small concert at one point, I as the guitar player and my brother singing. We managed to gather a crowd of naked survivors who for a minute enjoyed our show before they began bludgeoning each other.....we made a trade with the survivors and they went on their merry way. However, our small stint as Russian shop owners was drawing to a close when a group of armoured individuals approached. A large clan with plenty of firepower and bombs, two things that make short work of any base in the game. They had heard tale of our shop and so approached our window.....where they began speaking in Russian......They quickly figured out we were merely putting on an accent and took this as a declaration of war......needless to say we quickly found ourselves where we began....naked and afraid. 

I would like to tell you that all your experiences will be like this, a tale of survival and an interesting journey with a dramatic conclusion. Alas, I would be lying to you. For the many hours I have spent in this game around 85% of them were starting, trying to gather some resources to begin a base and getting grief'd or killed on sight by people that find endless joy in killing unarmed naked survivors. The worst part is even if you manage to make it to a point where you have a solid base, many supplies, a furnace and all the equipment needed to start building your own weapons you won't be safe. This game demands you live in it, when your character rests you don't, if you log out and come back the next day you can find your base has been destroyed by a larger clan and you have been killed. How you will know this is starting naked on a beach as if the last day of grinding was a mere false memory. You were always naked....you were always afraid......you never will progress beyond this unless you join a large enough clan or you spend the rest of your days living for real in this world. 

......but I still think you should give this a go!"
10887,"Very toxic at times, but very rewarding as well. Its an unforgiving game of pvp and pve. Once you start getting the hang of it though its a blast!"
10888,In this game toxicity is a feature
10889,"Whether you play vanilla, modded or RP this game has giving me many friends and laughs that would last a lifetime. Don't get me wrong you'll rage almost everyday at this game but wipe is just around the corner so gather some friends and build again <3"
10890,LOST MY GIRLFRIEND TO THIS GREAT GAME. I LOVE RUST
10891,"pretty fun, pretty toxic"
10892,"you will have no life after buying rust 
"
10893,"A nice, friendly game where you can hunt other people and rob them, skin them, make clothes out of their skin, chop them, cook them, make armour out of their bones, make camprife out of their skulls or keep skulls with player names for a collection. It may feel a little hard in the beginning, especially if you pick an overpopulated server, but, eventually, you can find a perfect place for roleplaying or surviving, because Rust offer more than enough classic and modded servers."

10931,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

10946,game is good if you like being raped
10947,"So, 400+ hours in the game you'd think I'd like it. I mean I do, mechanically and such It's a very enjoyable game. The base building, the electricity, water/piping exists tho it's never really needed. It's fun. The problem is that the game is not ""consistent"" in a sense it feels like 2 games. 

In particular pvp. 50% of the time it feels like I'm fighting a fair fight, win or lose, what happens is understandable. Whether it's a lucky shot or a back and forth fight drawn out 10 minutes. The other 50% of the game feels like absolute cheating shit. After googling what's possible, and what's for sale for this game, and what ""free trials"" exist, there isn't a single doubt in my mind I've been the victim of someone using ESP or AIM hacks. Across multiple servers. 

If pvp is your focus and your fun, find it elsewhere.  You will no doubt enjoy some part of this game, but eventually you're gonna get hit with the bullshit back to back to back with no break in between to fight some  normal players, and you too will find yourself uninstalling writing a review to hopefully warn others."
10948,Rust
10949,"Yes, because I enjoy others suffering as much as I have suffered myself.

P.S. GOOD GAME.

P.S.S If you like to get fucked consistantly, this is the game for you. Lube not included."

10975,FUN GAME OVERALL
10976,is this game on pc ?
10977,"best but its easier than console now

"
10978,this game sucks for solos and people without friends because all it is it you get a base down you get raider you get a base down you get raided you get a base down you get raided also people are always toxic and there are always roof campers don't play this game if you want to keep your sanity
10979,i liked everything im not that good at the game but still love it!!!
10980,Dick
10981,I started playing this game a few months ago ( the cracked version ) and i finaly decided to buy and they are going to fucking change the recoil.... these motherfuckers made the game boring af and i regret giving money for this stupid game
10982,"I can't fucking play this game at all. It takes way to long to load in, and then when it finally does after 6 hours it crashes pretty much immediately. Can't refund it either, it took the 2 hours just to get into a server the first time....."
10983,if you like gun and survival game get it / its so fun
10984,amazing game just make sure to have some skill at shooting and building games but over all its fun to play with friends but becareful there are toxic peopple in the game to noobs
10985,"like it
"
10986,Amazing game highly reccomend and dont give up in the first 50 hrs
10987,alright game super fun with your friends!!
10988,It can be a bit laggy but the recoil;is easy to learn and its a great game for survival!!
10989,.
10990,rust makes me sad. i work for hours and hours. i get good stuff. i go to sleep after ignoring my boyfriend for the remainder of the day. i wake up and an indian man on the opposite side of the globe blows up all my stuff while im away. i hit more stuff with my rock. i make things and blow up the indian guy's stuff. i leave. i attend to real life. rust is fun.
10991,rock is cool
10992,Fun game just start on modded servers instead of jumping in
10993,"you wont even let me load in to ukn so no
"
10994,i will continue to recommend and ruin my friends lives with this game.  15/10
10995,"This review is based on a solely solo experience. 

I'm kind of an oldie and a bit unsociable nowadays so I don't have friends to play games with anymore, and admittedly a bit of a loser nowadays. But never mind that, I DO NOT recommend this game if you plan on being ""Strictly solo"" like me. 

If you're good at making friends online or you already have friends playing this game, I can imagine this game being one of the most fun games out there you can play. Which is why I wish I could recommend and not recommend it at the same time.

So, problem with being strictly solo. Now you may of come from a few videos of people on youtube playing solo and having an amazing time, but do not be fooled. This will not be your experience, these youtubers have been playing this game for years and have many 1000's upon hours of experience and on top of that are much better than other rust players with the same amount of hours as them. To believe you will do as well as these people is arrogant...you won't.

I've done ""ok"" in community solo servers because there's no official solo servers. The problem with these servers is the population seems to die out very quickly, it's fun on the first day of wipe, (wipe is when the server resets essentially) and then the server kind of dies....

The official servers...forget it. Maybe if you get on the server straight after a wipe, but if you join a few hours later most people have guns and you're roaming around with a rock with absolutely no chance in hell to make any progress short of being extremely lucky.

An annoying thing I find with the game is I just wanna get a crappy bow, just some projectile weapon where I'm not just a defenceless moving target. But it cost 50 cloth...now cloth is not hard to attain when you have guns, because you can recycle stuff and get loads, but when you just got a rock and other people have guns, you ain't gonna live to get anything to recycle let alone get to a recycler...so you have to rely on hemp plants, which I don't know why but I just rarely come across them, and you need 5 plants for 50 cloths....I honestly think to give an advantage to people with f all, they should make the bows like 10 cloth, dirt cheap, so that at least I can shoot crappy arrows back at people with guns...but no. 

 Another thing which I find with this game is, when am doing quite well in a solo server, and I got a decent base and a few guns.. nothing spectactular, I seem to have an existential crisis, like ok what do I do now? Pvp...raid get more guns...then what? It's like ok every game is essentially a waste of time to keep us occupied when we're bored but this game seems to really make me realise it...so even when I start to do well I'm thinking what's the point....but that's just an issue of mine to be fair.

Overall, I think 10 years ago my mates and I would have had a blast on this game, but now I have no mates and yeh...I Enjoyed solo servers kind of, normally got outplayed but I did alright, considering, for some reason this is the only game where people brag about having like 9k hours in a game, so obviously they owned me..but...now I'm not calling anyone a loser, but who the hell brags about that. That's like a year of your life. 

I'm not exaggerating either, you'll always see in the chat people saying how many 1000's of hours they got in this game and calling people with 3k hours ""newby"".

11006,It is a fun and challenging game but definitely play with friends and if you get frustrated with more argressive players the softcore servers are a great way to get used to the game.

11030,"Rust could possibly be the best game in existence as a shooter survival game; of course its much more. 

Rust could also possibly be the most toxic game in existence. Racism, trash talking, harassment, griefing and idiots rule this world. Thick skin required. No escape from the rampant racism of american children..."

11042,"1 of the best PVE, PVP game ever!"
11043,Literally everything is rusty 10/10.
11044,"new recoil is easier to control which makes the game more appealing to newer players, its sad to see the learning curve leave but its still an overall fun game."
11045,"Really nice game beside some dickheads in there, but to be honest it wouldnt be fun without them so yeah. Can only recommend this game if you want a rather unusual exp. Oh and you should get the boys with you"

11065,10/10 would play again probably.
11066,"I have 9.2 hours on this game and i still haven't been able to actually play the game. loading takes at least 2 hours for me and then usually crashes. The one time I got into a server and had the ""you are sleeping screen"" I instantly crashed and had to restart loading into the game again. So after trying multiple times the game still doesn't work. My PC also runs much bigger games really well so it isn't on my pc."
11067,"So much fun! There's something for everyone. PvE, PvP, Custom Maps, the ability to host your own private server. It can be as stressful or fun as you want it to be. Or both!"
11068,i think the game is ok it can get very boring at some times but thats mostly alone trust me play with some friends and youll have a fucking blast the game can get hard if you wanna play and dont have friends add my discord PHONX#0053

I'm out here just trynna solo and some douche with 7000 hours comes and crossbows me while i don't even have a weapon. On top of that I log off for the night because I (somewhat) have a life, log back in just to find out someone raided my base and stole everything i worked hard on. I never slammed my hand on my desk from a game more times than Rust has. Overall yeah if your into games that make you suffer would recommend 10/10"

11133,"a
"
11134,Very fun and moderaters make sure every game and chat is appropriate.
11135,Rust is quite possibly the most toxic game ever created. The game dynamic puts the player in a dog eat dog post apocalyptic scenario.  one where you must grind for hours to get even slightly stable enough so the wild animals dont eat you. That is if you can survive that long. Other players who may and usually are more advanced in progression will rarely hesitate to kill you and rob all your hard work at almost every opportunity. Which means the player hast to start over literally naked. The game is designed so that only the most ruthless killers move forward in the game. I see there are children playing this game. I'm not going to get into the psychological reasons that might be a bad idea.
11136,i want to kill myself after playing this game. 10/10 would recommend.
11137,pogers
11138,"Grind for 3 and a half hours, die to auto turret."
11139,I really like this game but what i hate is people coming to you when your raiding a base and kill you and take everything but overall its a good game

Ripped jeans, skin was showin'

I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight, and it's real

11300,"This is a very fun game if you keep one thing in mind: You're going to lose. I originally bought this game a while ago but didn't play it for very long because I didn't enjoy dying often. Around a year later (I think) I started up the game again with the idea that I would lose and learn from my mistakes. I genuinely enjoyed the experience and was barely disheartened when I got raided. Within 2 wipes I learned how to play the game much better and have enjoyed the process of grinding for resources to raid, raiding, and then screwing around with the new materials. I would only recommend this game if 1. you have played video games on the computer for many years, 2. you understand that losing is part of the learning process, and 3. you don't give up easily."
11301,Simple strategic fun... easy to get lost in
11302,"Caused brain damage, would reccomemnd."
11303,"Every time you quit this game you will forget why you quit, and then the next time you load it up you'll realize after 25 minutes that load times are absolutely garbage...

You would think upgrading your computer would work but i'll save you that and tell you my current computer as of writing this review was built about 6 months ago and loads any other game within minutes if not seconds. Honestly someone just update me when they decide to optimize loading, since we really don't need to render 10k assets that we won't be in range to see for a few hours.

For the record, I do actually enjoy the game but oh my god my attention span can't last 20+ minutes just to load in especially when there is no indicator of how much time is left."

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

BUT cheaters ruin the game experience got raided 2 times by cheaters within 1 week lost all the loot and workbenches (2 sets of lvl 1,2,3) and the cheaters that were banned would use alt accounts and as there is no online admins in official servers (atleast I haven't seen any in facepunch large) it takes so long to ban their alt accounts with report and within that time frame they freely raid as many bases as they want with infinite ammo and godmode and aim hack. Moreover the second time I was raided it was by a cheater that was banned 3 or 4 days prior to that day which means cheaters that get banned will be back in less than a week. And tbh its not fun to see someone that uses cheat to be able to do whatever they want with other players and ruin their time and fun."

11435,game was good untill recoil update dont buy GAME IS NOW SHIT
11436,"I dislike Rust. Movement is unique but not it a good way, you have to duck before you jump to jump higher. PVP very unbalanced. PVP dumb, doesn't matter how many times you kill someone or how many times you die as long as you walk away with the loot. You get stuff like ""Projectile_Distance"" or ""Projectile_Invalid"" very often like 1 out of 10 shots. Takes me 5 mins to load mainmenu and 16 to load into a game... 21 mins to join a server... not the games fault though I have game on a old HDD and it is slow.

Things I like about the game PVE building, farming, electronics.... that is all."

11484, I HATE THIS GAME . I HATE THIS GAME . I HATE THIS GAME . 9/10. fun with friends. perfect for league players. I HATE THIS STUPID GAME AAAAH.
11485,Great game and really fun when playing with friends - on the downside game can be really toxic and not for the faint heated :D
11486,Absolutely fucking shit game do not waste your money on this shit it is filled with 10 year olds running around screaming racial slurs at the top of their lungs 2/10 would not play again

11491,"no, i would not recommend this game to other players, unless you are a masochist who loves pain and losing everything and getting your balls busted trying to be successful in this game. this game drains me so much and i hate it with every fiber of my being, ill still play it for 200 hours a week tho"

11498,"pretty fun game tbh, i know  havent played much but its fun if you just ignore the 45 year old virgins who raid beginners. the pvp part of this game and raiding aspect is fun, also many servers to choose from and each server has a different difficulty and community! Would def buy"
11499,"Rust is the most addicting and frustrating game I've played. It's like your ex-girlfriend... You have no idea why you keep going back, you tell yourself this is the last time I'll do this. Do you listen to your inner voice of reason? No...no you do not. 

[u] 👊 Welcome to Rust! 👊 [/u]

[b] You ever been beaten by a wet spaghetti noodle by your girlfriend because she has a twin sister, you got confused and fucked her dad? [/b]
"
11500,yes
11501,"Its a great game but disclaimer to anyone who wants to buy it you will hate it if you don't learn to lose, also you have to download the whole game map every time you log into a server which depending on your hardware will take a few minutes, Otherwise very fun friends are essential though"
11502,good fun hard but very fun to play with friend not easy but u have fun or u dont up to u . and the people u meet trust them or not is very hard and backstab friend they have it all and raid base is very fun . all kind serve u can join .  warn u the game is hard but u have fun once u get use to it or rage on it.
11503,L
11504,cum
11505,the addiction has started
11506,"Honestly, the recoil update ruined the game for me and a lot of others.

Other shit:
- One of the best games I've ever played (up until the recoil update)
- One of the shittest games I've ever played
- Fun
- Horrible
- Good with friends
- Makes me want to murder everyone that I know with a thermonuclear bomb

Real shit:
Up until the recoil update, this was my favourite game, hands down, no cap. 
I would recommend it like no other, I may have gone to the extent of calling it better than half life 2
However.
The recoil update made this game disappointing, it removed all of the skill and need to get any other gun than the ak, it became the most broken thing in the game, with no recoil, no kicks, and no skill required. 
It ruined the game.
The things I found fun about the game (aka sucking ass at it) was removed, all the time I and others spent in ukn trying to learn the spray patterns was gone, wasted.
Only for that time to be replaced by face punch probably trying to get Fortnite kids to play a game that used to require skill.

Sorry for the rant if you read this far.
This game sucks now, don't buy it unless you like games that need no skill."
11507,"game is fucking dogshit you could be the best player in the fucking game and a wipe an entire fucking 6 man and then more people will come because theres not a thing in the fucking world you can do when the people you are fighting have more numbers

11546,"This game is very good, I can't lie about that, but that is not the reason I dislike this game and wish for you not to buy it, it has just about the most toxic fanbase of any game I have ever played, the people in here are trying nothing else other than ruin your day, you will mostly lose in this game over, and over, if you give up fast in a game this will be no exception, but if you think playing more will make it better you are wrong and right, although you will win if you keep playing and the feeling of winning in this game is so good you will keep on playing and you will think just as long as you keep playing you will get better wins and you will like this game more, then you have spiraled into the rabbit hole of this game and you will find yourself putting 100s of hours in just a week, save your money and your free time, also go learn an instrument in real life or mend your broken relationships bif/b you do play this game. (This still applies)"
11547,cool and all but its still cool
11548,love hate relationship worth the money tho
11549,I play this Rust for the first time and I like it. I am a deaf gamer and it might be hard for me to play but I begin to use to it. Everything is great except the Toxic player lol.  It's great to build the base whatever you want it to be and good luck dealing with the raider. I will recommend this to my friend. I rate this 8/10.
11550,"Its fun but, dont start playing it. It will ruin youre entire life. You will have no other purpouse in life tan to play rust"
11551,i like the penises
11552,I like this game ALOT!!! but the Anti Cheat system fallsly banned me because I have 28 hours and was shooting like a guy whit 500 hours... Which got the system thinking I'm cheating;(

11566,.
11567,fun but unforgiving so dont play with anger issues
11568,"I want to recommend this game. I really do. It's so much fun and I've never played anything like it; it just scratches this particular itch that games like Tarkov don't. But until such a time as the devs take some time to fix the optimization issues that it has had for years, I can't recommend it and I won't be playing it. I have a pretty badass machine; it runs everything on max settings really well, but this game runs like crap with everything turned down. I've spent tens of hours trying to optimize on the software side, and I could maybe upgrade my ram, but if these guys really think I'm gonna spend even more money on my rig when I far exceed their minimum specs, then they don't deserve me upping their player count. They don't deserve you, either; they keep adding skins --recently they added one with changed stats which is literally just pay to win-- but they won't go in and add a texture for venison. It has looked like chicken for years, which screams that they're lazy or greedy or both. Or maybe just plain incompetent. Maybe one day they'll fix these things and I'll come back, but in the meantime, I'll be spending my time (and money) elsewhere."

11584,i love naked people

11590,very good game :)
11591,The game is fun if you enjoy wasting your time to get absolutely nowhere even on solo servers its a waste of time. you could spend hundreds of hours building a base to get raided overnight by some overseas player. save your money.
11592,gut sexually harrased by a naked guy the first few seconds. 9/10 would recommend.

11608,"Its super fun. especially on pc and i would recommend but you need to have a decent laptop or pc to run it sadly. but even if its console rust its really fun whether you wanna roleplay farm or pvp. so if you have a decent
rig then you will most likely enjoy this game. just remember you have to understand its a game so try to avoid becoming one of the many toxic players not only on rust but on the internet in general."
11609,best game ever
11610,"this game makes me want to kill myself

11611,i love the concept of this game and i would definitely love to play this with my friends. i have played on a few servers with my friends and we love it. i don't so much enjoy the big toxic clans taking over but when we find a good server with good players it's an absolute blast!!

11621,"graphics are OK, but not top notch, you can go 4k but its still a little off. The game is nicely build but sometimes you just get kicked out, i know its not a wifi issue becauise i am hooked up through cables and I dont get lag spikes in anyother games"
11622,"It is very fun to play with friends and by yourself
"
11623,Very good game would recomend!

11660,"I am a 53 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, find him in-game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he teach me what to do in this survival game. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since I've gone out from home to work. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

11681,great game
11682,"I'm an absolute noob in this game, never played anything similar before.
The description does not lie, everything wants you to die here. I drowned, starved / froze to death, collapsed from thirst, were multiple times eaten by bears and wolves or stabbed to death  by boars. I did fall from a cliff, eaten poisoned pickles, run into a field with cacti and bleeded out on the spot. I've fallen into spike traps above and underground, died from radiation several times. And these were just the passive killers - the other players are the real deal - they broke my skull with a rock, stabbed me, shot me with bows, crossbows, revolvers, guns.
The thing is, with all of the above possibilities to die, it is almost euphoric when you... don't. When you win a little battle, when you almost lose everything running back home but finally reach the door and make it. 
Ofc I'm at a really beginner stage of this game, still struggling to survive, trying to build a not-so-s*tty base etc., but so far I enjoy it."

11755,very friendly game and community that is fun to play with friends and explore
11756,"Someone killed me, unprovoked. Took all of my stuff too."
11757,"I love this game, It does take a lot of CPU power up if you are looking to buy this game I suggest getting a good Processor and or a better graphics car make sure you have a decent amount of ram too. The Look of the game is amazing I love the idea of it. Lots of fun if you want to play with friends. Takes a lot of grinding and practicing seeing as the game has been out for a pretty long time everyone's aim with recoil is good. It takes some raging and some time to get use to it but if your looking for like a more violent harder better version of mine craft here it is."
11758,you hit naked people with a rock and then got offlined raided by them and you need to restart
11759,good

11824,If you have no life and are suicidal you will love this game.
11825,"Once you play rust you won't go outside of your bedroom for a long, long time."
11826,"Toxic community. Everyone kills you on sight. As a new player, you have 0 chance to survive against someone with a ranged weapon, you are always 1 shoted. Where's the fun in this game? Unless you get a team right as you start and manage to get gear that way, you will never advance in this game. Keep away from this game if you dont want to see duzens of hours wasted because some kid got a gun from a friend and 1 shoted you, taking all your loot. There's no protection to new players whatsoever."
11827,fun
11828,not as toxic as you think on a good server its alot of fun

11848,"Amazing game, really fun and the community isn't as bad as it is made out to be (personal experience) gunfights are really fun and are really tense. Looting is fun, raiding is fun, building a base is fun. The rush of adrenaline when I made my first big play on a dude was insane and i love that feeling. Personally I like rust a LOT and I wish I had more time to put into it."
11849,amazing game highly recommend.
11850,"very funny and intresting

11852,"good game

11853,Unbelievable Geoff
11854,"I have a total of 7k hours. Facepunch youve had your ups and downs, but in the end you always fix it. Remember when you added xp system? Ive played this since legacy and youve changed the AK quite a bit over the years. But this shit HAS to be the absolute worst one so far. There is nothing unique about someone with a lot of hours anymore. OTV blew up rust and brought a lot of new players who sure arent as good and thats to be expected, a lot of grubs and camping, right? But now the main pvp is made so whoever crouches and hides wins the fight better? IF you are good you should be able to push and this shit is so wrong. At 100m first time trying all the guns I didnt look at the pattern hud I just pulled down and hit 80% of my shots. Thats not skillful in any way and completely RUINED all your OG players. But I guess the majority of new player flow and people with less than 100 hours knows what they are talking about, right? Fix your shit facepunch

EDIT: I can live with you changing the guns. Been there done that. But for the LOVE of god dont screw with mechanics we've had for YEARS. Standing and shooting should not be this fucked. I get strafing and shooting the bad players cant handle it but atleast let be able to uncrouch for an angle and shoot?????"

11859,It will ruin your life
11860,help me...
11861,"Ah yes roof camping sim. A glorious game. Cannot go wrong with an m2 on a roof. Don't be fooled tho, this looks like a survival game. It could not be further from it. If you want survival, go play forest or ark. Rust is for those that want fortnite building mechanics, with call of duty gun play and realism, with a forest style survival aspect. But, trap basing Russians is fun so it evens out. Solid game."
11862,"Get chased by 3 nakeds screaming their lungs out for no reason.
10/10 Would run from them again"
11863,good

11878,great game but can be laggy but its fine but its over all a good game
11879,"This game is awesome, I love spawning in on the beach to a new server and being called racial slurs by a black man with a spear, then spawning in again and eventually building a base then being doorcamped by an asian zerg while they are screaming some more racial slurs. If you like racial slurs and always dying, this is the game for you."

11892,big dick
11893,"I like this game a lot due to it's expandable play styles, the vast lands that you may see and the memories that you make while playing. I would recommend this game to people with friends to play it with (as this game is better played with 2-6 people at a time). While this game is very very fun, the players can be quite toxic and aren't very kind 99.9% of the time (there are a few kind players, but not many: trust no one that you meet in this game)., but there are always exceptions. All in all, it's a solid 9/10 game and I would recommend giving it a try!"
11894,"I feel like I waste so much time in this game progressing only to be offline raided with nothing to show of my hours of work, but like its fun and all."

11910,"I purchased these “Gummy Bears” thinking “Sounds like a nice purchase, 5 Lbs. of delicious candy for a decent price.. Can’t go wrong.” Unfortunately I had to learn the hard way.. IT CAN GO VERY WRONG!! First of all, I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before my purchase, and that was a mistake I will live with for the rest of my life due to the trauma I received after eating two handfuls of these. I was excited to try these first time and I will say this, they were surprisingly tasteful for being “Sugar Free” and I regretfully decided to try less than two handfuls within 5 minutes before I had to make a run to Walmart to purchase a few things that didn’t include a stockpile of toilet paper. Within 15 minutes of consuming these high powered laxatives, my stomach was making noises that I should have seen as a message from God warning me, “You should turn back around and go home.” I excused the funny feeling in my stomach, as I was on a mission to replace a Keurig machine that broke from Walmart. Yes I said it, “WALMART.” As I parked my car, I felt my stomach growing more agitated by the minute making gurgling noises that struck me as unusual but I proceeded into the store as I really wanted a new coffee machine..

GOD HELP ME.

I was literally in the middle of the store looking at small kitchen appliances before one loud gurgle after another and then I squeezed out a fart that began as a long squeak to a jet propulsion in a split-second that probably had some people in the store confuse the sound as a gunshot and probably had some of them ducking for cover. As my situation had just gone from a, on a 1-10 scale beginning with a 3, (I might need to use the bathroom at some point, I should make this trip quick.) to an instant 12 (I’m literally soiling myself in the middle of a Walmart with hand towels and shower towels as my only source of fabric to wipe my ass with) I said “F*** the Keurig” and I ditched my cart and went running all the way to the opposite end of the store to the bathroom while, what sounded and felt like, I had firecrackers exploding in my underwear, people were probably pointing at me while their kids are laughing and I finally made it to the bathroom to find one stall available..

The Hadicapped Stall.

Upon entering the bathroom stall while simultaneously crying and pulling my pants down I jumped on the toilet seat not realizing it was literally covered in urine and as I began opening the flood gates, releasing the evil that moments prior had begun rearranging my insides, I realized after the fact that there was no seat paper and I then I began holding on for dear life while begging God to kill me, sounding off gunshots out of my ass that most likely had people running out of the store..

USE THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR OWN RISK AND ASK YOURSELF, “WAS IF WORTH IT?” If the answer is yes, you should seek a mental health professional."

11958,"As a player that once really enjoyed this game, I do not recommend this game to any returning rust players. They ruined it to cater to the newer players. Its not like it used to be before the recoil update. However for new players looking to buy Rust and aren't sure if they should... Do some research and listen to what the community is saying right now and let that influence your decision. I wish this game the best of luck in losing all their veteran players, whilst gaining new players that are not guaranteed to stay like all their previous players did before them..."
11959,really chaotically fun although can be annoying very cool
11960,"Highest level of trash produced by any developer that only cares about money and not their community who its for.  The usual players you encounter are 37 year old, parents basement, jobless, cheating losers who have some sort of retardation."

11964,"I currently only have 2.9 hours on this game (just bought it). I have barely scratched the surface but can already confirm that this is a masterpiece of a game. I cant wait to spend countless nights getting dogged on by players w 1000s of hours played. All jokes aside, this is a must-have game. Facepunch studios have outdone themselves w this one."
11965,After all these years its still one of the best survival/pvp games on the market!
11966,the best game of all time
11967,scary game

11973,"challenging for the first couple hours, but once you get the hang of it it's a nice survival game, would recommend playing it with some friends and trying a beginner server to get the hang of things first"
11974,UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
11975,"ahhh where to begin, i met my girlfriend on this game while earaping a local outpost (turned out to be a 54 yo turkish man). the countless oilrigs at 2am listening to lofi beats, the sloppy joes behind oxums. the best part is, id do it all again in a heartbeat. although i am weighing close to 300kg and i am on the refferal list for several doctors for severe obesity. i feel like this game changed my life for the better and i will keep on making dear memories with the ones i love (24,324 hours on record)"

11989,"Game is Toxic, can be a time suck, and really get under your skin. That said I have played many hours and had just about the same fun losing as winning. One thing that happens to me alot is IMO an unreasonable amount of crashing on the loading into server screen. Hope they fix that - its gotten worse over time

When I woke up again, after miraculously surviving being beaten in the head with a rock I saw my first target MonkeyHater69 I snuck up on him with the stealth of a my friend Tyrone, when he is in the dark desolate place he calls his ""Hood"" . I raised my hatchet with the might of Zeus and struck him in the back of the head the first hit did not kill him so I, struck him again, again, and again, After his body was laying on the ground lifelessly I looted what little he had... a single hemp seed and a wooden spear. 8.5 would recommend."

12011,bought it in alpha for like 5 euros
12012,great game but there's also a lot of racist nimbwas.
12013,"Boring asf, run around looting just to die and lose everything you have. And if that doesn't happen then the server resets and you lose all your progress. Terrible way to play a game and wanna keep playing. Wish i could get my money back but of course if you play longer than 2 hours (short ass time) you can't refund. So overall pointless to play i do not recommend."
12014,If you like grinding this is a perfect game and if you dont care if you  get raided its okay
12015,More fun then i thought!! You do die a lot but you get a partner or 2 and it a whole new ballgame!! I am in the learning stages now my son teaching me:P Fun even when you die this much i win some lose some usually when i am farming ore or wood they sneak up on you player and beast. Listen and be aware of surroundings often and now it dont happen as much to me now i am kind of getting the hang of it.

Pros:

12081,"This very  nice game
"
12082,Was a great game till they changed the entire thing :/ I understand they want to draw in a new play base but there are people who have spent 100's to 1000's of hours training there aim just to be snatched away by the facepunch money grubs. Other then that tho good game 3.9/5 stars
12083,game
12084,cool
12085,"Start nude, learn, build base, get raided, build better base, try to raid, get shit on, keep trying, win, build bigger base, then enjoy the game. 10/10 would recommend"

12087,"I played this 2500+ hours over 1.5 years on my combined accounts, I met some really great friends who I now play other games with and would give them the shirt off my back. Facepunch constantly updates the game but not always with stuff people want or need, who asked for ziplines? idk.

I lived for this game over the last 1.5 years, weekly wipes always keep the excitement fresh, but the grind does wear on you, the toxicity wears on you and the cheaters wear on you. Checking your base every morning seeing you were offlined is exhausting.

Nothing will ever beat raiding the little bastards across the map that wouldn't shut up and sitting in their core talking smack, or rolling up on a group that's unsuspecting and taking all their loot. The game provides maximum adrenaline but at a cost of your mental health."
12088,"im basically a certified electrician after playing this game, i want to die"

12108,"Very brutal in difficulty, and at it's core can be something great. But the game it's held back by the people who play it. 

The game is fun, it extremely hard and it can be brutal. Dying with loot hurts, losing everything in a raid is worse. It's a not a bad thing if you're prepared for it. However, the players you encounter are unnecessarily cruel, and by far are the most toxic people I have ever seen in gaming. Not COD not even LOL compares to the hateful man children this game offers. Not to mention the game is extremely unfriendly to solo play and nearly unplayable for anyone who intends to play moderately let alone casually.

Player interaction is kill on sight. If you're hoping any kind of cooperation outside of groups or any kind diplomacy outside of the shit talking in global, this isn't your game. People will shoot first, they will kill you, don't expect to grey man or people gonna spare you for being a fresh spawn on the beach. If that sort of thing appeals to you, just be aware it's 100% of the time and you're not safe outside of a handful places in game. It gets tiring to be on guard all the time, even offline because you will get offline raided eventually.

When they do kill you, and you will die... a lot. Usually they will just quickly execute you and loot your body. Cold but impersonal, like it should be. But 1 out of 10 times, people will play games with you, teabag, and talk trash. People are vindictive and juvenile when they don't have a reason to.

The stress you go through doesn't stop once you leave the game, you're always wondering if someone picked your base to raid while you're offline. It's far too easy to raid in the game's current state some explosives is all is needed to blow down a door. Not much stopping people from walking in taking all your shit. The final straw for me that not only was I offlined, but the people killed me sleeping in my bag AND MOVED IN. I couldn't even try to salvage the hours and hours of work I lost because it was all theirs now, and had the gal to rub it in. 

And of course there is the racism. They monitor chat, but they can't monitor proximity chat and they don't do anything about the graffiti. No I am not talking about fragile snowflake racism either. I'm talking about swastikas and n words with the the hard R.  I've seen someone was discriminated against because their character was black, which is stupid since appearance is randomly generated and players don't have control over that becuase facepunch is dumb that way. There is a large overlap with people visit /pol/ and people who play Rust.

This is me playing somewhat hard, forget about achieving anything as a solo casual. You have to no life the game and even have an app to keep an eye on your base when you eventually have to get off. You can't ""unplug"" from rust until you either give up or your server gets wiped. 

TL;DR. You either no life or don't play at all, and it's not even worth is since the community is straight cancer."

12173,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
12174,Great game but the recoil update makes the game like COD now so its not as fun anymore or a challenge so its lke a 40/60 game for me now it use to be 100 percent fun but it is what it is

I even payed 10$ to see if I could get in to play the game, but guess what, that was a wast of 10$. I would like my money back for the game and 10$, I will never go to a friend and say u should check out RUST... But I would say, if u want to wast a lot of time and money go check out RUST, I'm pissed off."

If you are thinking about buying the game and you don’t want to just die, then play on Community PvE servers. These are perfect for learning the game. But you can also build on them with your friends and try out new base designs.
There are also moded servers where you can have a lot of fun."

12267,All you need is a buddy to play with and it'll never get boring.
12268,deez
12269,touch grass
12270,10/10 i saw booba
12271,the game is awesome but still misses a few good QoL updates imo . but overall awesome survival game and u can play it however u want ! there is different servers for everyone .
12272,u will be in agony every day
12273,Jersic R3n3 is POG :thumbs_up:
12274,this game takes time to learn and needs friends to learn faster i enjoyed learning everything in the game.
12275,good game
12276,my favorite game
12277,There are a few things to add and fix. First off Performance now its not the worst for some people but the game isnt optimized very well but you can just put your graphics lower worst case scenario. Next is offilne play i would like to see this be a thing offically added to the game those are the only big complaints i have so so far into the game (60 hours) and its fun so far and worth the money.
12278,legendary game
12279,"i haven't play for very long but so far the gunplay is horrible and luck based, the building and monuments concept is cool though. if they fixed the gunplay it would actually be a solid game."
12280,this game would be better if you have a friend to play with
12281,it cool
12282,Rust is life.  Rust is happiness.  Hop on Rust
12283,Mnogo teska igrica da si scines svi zivci
12284,GOOD GAME TAKES HOURS THO
12285,Seems racist
12286,good game
12287,Less obvious cheaters now. Actually fun.
12288,really good game make sure to get this
12289,"downloaded the game, didnt touch it for 2 weeks.
finally started playing. stayed up multiple times for 36 hours straight playing.
mentally exhausted, paranoid, looking over my shoulder constantly.
is my base going to get offlined? probably.
did that dude who hit the 300m shot on me have hacks? almost certainly.
is the casual racism really as bad as they say? without a doubt.

10/10 would recommend"
12290,i like rusty spoons. -salad fingers

12298,love it
12299,good game
12300,good
12301,"Word of advice: play heavily modded and/or chill servers first. They will introduce you to the game and its mechanics. ""Diving headfirst"" does not work in this hardcore hellscape of a game unless you are a prodigy.
Then, when you go on to lighter-modded servers, or even (god forbid) vanilla, you will get raided by a 30 man zerg who speak nothing but chinese.

Great game, 11/10
Creative/sandbox servers on top"

12316,very good big penis
12317,125hrs and not a single moment was fun
12318,Loading times after picking a server are atrociously long. Good luck changing any graphical settings without getting kicked from your server. The frustrations are too many to mention to be honest.
12319,The game is good and all but some of the players are toxic but 8.5-10 pretty good game
12320,Cancer

12348,dont waste ur money refund my time fix ur game
12349,Monke
12350,"If you're a person that likes to say 'Get Gud!' or 'Dat's de Game!' then this is the game for you.  For all others, it's not worth the time/money.  The game itself seems pretty good/deep, but it's just a toxic cesspool of a bunch of idjits that take joy in being the trolliest bunch of dinks ever assembled into a small gaming group.  I've been playing games online for 20+ years and I've never come across a more screwed up community than those that are playing this game."
12351,woke up on the beach with 3 other nakeds killed them with my rock got back home an played this game and got killed by 2 ak guys
12352,if you like all nighters this game is for you

12374,"Unoptimized game with a dumb system that spawns me in a place surrounded by houses on my first play and I just get killed right away.
Since my game experience is a long loading to get greeted by getting surrounded then this is my rating."
12375,ive always loved rust and i find it fun.
12376,"The game is good but do not be friendly you have to kill or be killed, also play vanilla it's a more original experience."
12377,Its fun to be killed....................Constantly.......................on a beach................with just a rock and torch.

12392,yes
12393,good game.....
12394,very toxic lots of 9yr olds playing the game even though its a 17+ game so security is crap if you like toxic and a non controlled age restriction game this is for you P.S. turn mic volume down because the underage players scream alot

12402,cool game
12403,its very addicting but very fun worth my money
12404,sexy game
12405,great
12406,Playing Rust is like merging onto a busy highway and everyone is running late for something.
12407,I like this game very much. I play it with my girlfriend who is on mobile and she was top rank. We are very good. I can't imagine leaving a bad review on this game because you are bad at it. I play video games with hot girls so it is always fun. Lonely men who can't get satisfaction from women leave a bad review on this game because it is too easy. They can only find fun through stupid hard games like dark souls and Pokemon ROM hacks. Get a life!
12408,its amzing

12423,tthis game is very fun to play can be toxic sometimes but you can play non toxic servers
12424,Its aight
12425,I recommend Rust to other gamers because it has such a positive player base. Everyone is extremely friendly and generous. It's kinda crazy how overwhelmingly kind people can be. Every second is a complete and utter joy when you are playing Rust.
12426,a

12439,"The main reason I'm reviewing the game now and giving it a negative score has nothing to do with the game, but I am for a reason that will affect every Unity developer going forward. Unity is merging/partnering with ironSource, a company with an utterly terrible track record and a company who has actively created malware installers disguised as legit software for PC that backdoor installs adware, malware, etc.

Unity is making this ""business move"" because their s##tbag CEO (former EA, because of course...) wants to introduce built-in data tracking and monetization tools into all games that use the Unity engine, so that developers can use these tools to track players and enable them to gain a deep understanding of our psychology and effectively use that to influence us even harder to spend on micro-transactions. These practices are predatory and only growing more  and more by the day. We as consumers have to fight against the tide in any way we can.

I refuse to play/buy/install any Unity games going forward if this is the way they intend move forward. I'm sorry to the developer, but there's not much else we can really do to spread awareness and cause enough backlash. Developers are the ones who use engine products, they have more sway than anyone else to go against Unity right now. Please speak up."
12440,I got banned after 13 hours and nobody can tell me why or help me fix the issue. would not recommend if all you wanna do is play the game.
12441,its my therapy
12442,.
12443,just dont
12444,.
12445,like minecraft but with big boy pants.

very slow, the people who play the game are jerks, and its not a good time unless youre playing with a full team. and even then it just feels like youre wasting your time because you dont know what youre working towards. not worth $50. the devs should be ashamed that their game is literally ridden with racists, but they dont seem to care"

12548,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

12561,"this is a game where you would meet friends who would end up stop playing in a few weeks. people you only know for the duration of the wipe, they can betray you or be honest people, each wipe is a stressful fun but fucking tiring journey because this game demands non stop attention to make sure you don't lose things that can be gone by you just going offline.
if you are not dedicated this game is not for you, and that is what i learned in the little hours i have. amen"

12580,Beware. This is not a game. It is a bag of white powder you find on a bar floor that you decide to all do and end up having one of the craziest nights of your life. But it happens every Thursday on the first of every month. Its suffering. Its BLISS. And I think it has taken at least 5 years of my life. But every moment was worth it
12581,ok
12582,"this game ruined my life

12601,"Ok so to start this review I used to play rust on console (ps5). My friend that I played console rust with got it on PC. He was saying how much better it was and I didn't believe him. So after him telling me to get it for a while
I bought rust for PC and he wasn't lying on my first wipe of playing on pc I got AKs I ran a large oil rig with my 2 0ther friends (trio) and we raided some bases. Now I have started playing a lot of minigames on rust and also PVP servers such as (splash 1000x and a few others). I firmly believe rust has something for everyone with it having minigames, creativity, and a nice challenge for the skill curve it took me around 30 hours to get good but I still suck and every hour I have played so far has been fun. - corner camper"

12659,"This game has a pretty steep learning curve.  Unless you are jumping into this game with friends, you're going to spent lots of time trying to figure things out for yourself, and dying in the process.  Theres no real tutorial to help you out, you get assigned a random gender and no options to change your avatar."
12660,"The Game has it´s own touch. At one point you fell like the King in the Castle (like in the Borat Movie), in a splitt of a second some random Dude living in the basement at his moms house on gamersonly, levelup, holy energy, mojokaii, zec+(headshot gaming and learning booster 200g) sitting in an DXRacer half an meter away from his SAMSUNG Odyssey G9 C49G94TSSR, Gaming-Monitor fucks you so hard you dont even know if you still want to watch Lana Rhodes, or Luke Longly for the rest of your Life.

12684,"Basically if mad max was a video game played exclusively by racists, transphobes, and homophobes. The grind is fun but due to my severe lack of combat skill I end up having to resort to fishing for hours straight to get scrap. I can't say much about the gun play because I always die before I am able to shoot my weapon. I would highly recommend this game if you hate yourself and want to have a bad time. If you are anything but a cis hetero male you are probably going to have a especially bad time. I have been called every trans slur under the sun and have been subject to nonstop harassment whenever I open my mouth(about 75% more then the usual control variable amount of harassment and that's saying something). There are some nice people though they are few and far between. I will play again but from now on only with a group because I don't stand much chance as a solo."

12695,"If you are looking for a review on this game you have come to the wrong place, but you are looking for a outstanding Swirl Spice Cake Recipe you have come to the right place.

Ingredients:

Makes one 8½""x4½"" loaf

Streusel

1 cup coarsely chopped pecans
⅓ cup Savory-to-Sweet Coffee Spice Mix
6 Tbsp. (75 g) light brown sugar
3 Tbsp. (24 g) all-purpose flour
1 tsp. kosher salt
4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
Cake and Assembly
Nonstick cooking oil spray or room-temperature unsalted butter (for pan)
2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour
½ tsp. baking powder
¼ tsp. baking soda
½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more
1¼ cups (250 g) granulated sugar
¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
3 large eggs, room temperature
½ cup sour cream, room temperature
2 tsp. vanilla extract
¼ cup (28 g) powdered sugar
1 tsp. (or more) orange juice
Streusel
Step 1
Whisk pecans, spice mixture, brown sugar, flour, and salt in a small bowl to combine. Drizzle in butter and mix until clumps form. Set aside.

Cake and Assembly
Step 2
Preheat an oven to 325°F. Lightly coat an 8½x4½"" loaf pan with nonstick spray. Line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on long sides. Press paper into pan, then turn over, so greased side is facing up. Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and ½ tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine.

Step 3
Beat sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on medium-high speed, scraping down sides of bowl halfway through, until very light and fluffy, 6–8 minutes. Reduce speed to medium. With motor running, add eggs one at a time, beating to incorporate and scraping down sides of bowl after each addition. Reduce speed to low; add half of dry ingredients and mix just to combine. Add sour cream and vanilla and beat to combine. Add remaining dry ingredients and beat until incorporated.

Step 4
Scrape half of batter into prepared pan. Top with streusel (yes, it will look like a lot, but use all of it!), then scrape remaining batter over. Starting at a short side of the pan and working your way to the other short side, drag a butter knife back and forth from one long side to the other through batter to marble streusel; smooth surface.

Step 5
Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 80–90 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes. Run a small knife around edges of cake to loosen if needed, then, using parchment paper, lift out of pan onto rack. Peel away parchment. Let cake cool completely.

Step 6
Combine powdered sugar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl, then mix in orange juice, adding up to a teaspoonful more if needed, until you have a thick but pourable icing. Drizzle over cake and let sit until icing is set before serving, about 15 minutes.

Step 7
Do ahead: Cake can be baked 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature."

12703,"Addicting, fun, pain in the ass sometimes but in all honesty if you love FPS, grinding, and survival this would be the game. I find many buy it, play it, get offed as a naked, rage quit. This is all online, expect to get raided online and offline it happens, it's Rust. Friendly and toxic in it's own ways but that's what I personally love, thanks to my friend Brandon who got me into this months back. Sometimes when I get off I forget what life is like until I go touch some grass, then find myself back on Rust a few hours later. Well worth it, don't buy it if you're a snowflake prissy who gets upset at the small things. Remember, it's just a game, but one hell of fun one when you get used to it after several hours of gameplay."

"
12725,"Roaming around playing meme midis on the acoustic guitar when I run into a hopping group of pantless raiders and we end up hosting a concert in the courtyard of their recently devastated conquest, joined by nearby rock-wielding nakeds. The improvised moshpit only had a few casualties.

Started a farm where I grew obscene amounts of potatoes to give to passers-by, playing some anime medley on the piano when a guy blows my head off from behind - before coming back wracked with guilt and generous of spirit and scrap. We vibed for a while, played midis for eachother, then he headed off into the sunset for the promise of gore and glory.

Yes, the playerbase is... a lot. But you get what you give, most of the time. And it's got some visual charm, best experienced crawling on your knees mashing the belt slot button that has your bandages and praying for a bit of luck.

If the vanilla experience gets boring, the modding community is frothing with creative endeavor and oxide makes the game extremely moddable, if you're willing to code-dive. Sure there's all the OP server concepts, but there's also some really developed and balanced ones too - like My Nice Town or one where you live on a mars colony. I find the best approach to keep gameplay fresh is a Low-RP one - choose a gimmick and play it well, without necessarily forgetting the violence (it's the end of the world after all). Come to terms with losing, just take it as part of the story. Every wipe is a chapter of bananas bullshit waiting to be written, most likely in your tears."
12726,"This game is like politics and natural selection, one man lacks power to overwhelm others whereas a group is undefeatable, progressing too late ends up basically being kicked off the server for the wipe by others who looked at you funny or speaking in a different language / accent. This game can be fun, I do have fun, HOWEVER, IF YOU CALL OUR BASE PHONE AND SAY RED ROOSTER IS BETTER THAN KFC, MATE! YOU DON'T KNOW WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN. So yeah, outpost trapping is hilarious and gets me one step closer to hell... sorry Abyss, I wanted your AR..."

12773,"After almost 3.5k hours on this game, they hit it up with a massive update which made it noob-friendly, and that's not the problem, the problem now is that every person can spray guns basically overlapping any sense of skill with numbers. You hit up 20 people, form a team and you run people over, it was different before, you had 15 people that couldn't shoot in a group and 5 that could and you'd have a chance at wiping them instead of instantly getting tripled from absolutely everywhere. You turned your game to shit, i sold all of my skins and i will not be returning until you do something about this and many more players feel the same way that i do but i feel like i've said enough, this game took enough time from my life and i won't give it another second, thanks for the fun times but this is just a freak and shit show now. When your game completely dies after summer ends because the people who were truly passionate about it all ended up quitting, come back to this review, Devs and see what you did wrong, which takes us back to you making it noob-friendly, but now, even that solo or duo players that just joined the game, although they can shoot, they will get rolled by that 20 man i mentioned. Good job fucking up the single good game that was left on Steam, Facepunch, instead of focusing on your 80% cheating community, you do this shit, good job, Alistair, Holmzy, Jakb & co.

12796,"The general idea of the game is pretty good and on player versus environment servers you stand half a chance of getting somewhere but the game seems rather pointless when on player vs player servers. You will gather a few resources which takes quite a large portion of your time within the game only for someone with a gun to appear and slot you in the head, take all your gatherings and there you go back to square one.
 The more players on the server the more chance you have of this happening and it does get very frustrating after a while."

12829,"The game is very fun and overall solid. The people who play this game will make you question humanity. Find a good group of people to play with and don't take it too seriously and you'll be fine.

I wish the game had a small ""safe"" part of your inventory similar to EFT so that people wouldn't be nervous about doing more online raiding, fighting, etc. The gameplay leads people to wait for players to log off to attack a base, and that's just a bad feeling time and time again. Not much you can do when you're offline and then your wipe is all but over."

12864,"I am a 31 yo single mother, probably one of the oldest females playing this game. I am a single mother to my Son, who is 16 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his baby daddy's brother, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 60 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my little boy, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my boyfriend had left me. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

basically if you're the most chill person on the planet that GENUINLY doesn't give much of a crap, you might enjoy this game. best bet with this game is to join a discord and join a clan. less effort less pain, more options to do anything fun in the game which is only fun for specific people. if you're considering the game, but you're not sure... do not buy this you will most likely just hate it after an hour. 90% sure."

12959,"Since the changes made from the recoil patch, the game just hasn't hit the same. Not complaining that it should be reverted, just saying this has become like Doom Eternal's TAG 2.0 update. You can check out what I mean in this video here that talks about Doom Eternal TAG 2.0: https://youtu.be/JC3hLlhyhZ0

Currently the game has the same problem that the TAG 2,0 has, where the game has gotten too easy, especially for a survival game. The recoil update did solve a lot of problems in combat, but it also introduced a lot of new issues, one that I would say was unnecessary. The biggest issue I have with the game as of now is the new gun sounds. They just don't work nor do they have the same punch to it as the original sounds had. Its difficult to know how far someone is and most of the guns sound the same, even after they tweaked the sounds in the last two patches to sound distinct. I had no issue telling what or where someone was shooting. Its just frustrating to hear a shot being made over a hill and to go up that hill to see no one in sight. I've noticed that I stopped playing all together after the updates and I have put in about 70 hours since the changes. I've mostly played vanilla after the recoil change, before the changes I've stuck to battlefield servers where its just a giant PvP arena since I didn't have time to play. Facepunch, please just revert the sounds, they just don't fit the game, or at least have the option to switch back to the old sounds. At least then, you would please both sides without having to choose what people want to hear.

Anyways, lets talk about the recoil changes. As I said earlier, it does address some of the issues it had before by not curing the issues, but remedy them. With the recoil changes, it did level the playing field by making the recoil patterns easier to learn, but it also loses a lot of the skill ceiling. You can probably get all the recoils down in about an hour, before it took a couple hundred hours to get all the guns. Sure it was quite the investment, but all the other aspects of Rust take a long time to master as well, such as building, which could take hundreds of hours to learn and master all the tricks to it. One of the biggest issues that got remedied was how snipers felt useless. Personally thought they were okay as it was more for newer players to use for long range pvp before they got good with automatic weapon spray patterns. Snipers are still being used mainly to roof camp and there were weapons such as the LR300, Thompson and the m249 they could use to PvP with. Those weapons were designed to fill in the skill gap for newer players (well the m249 being easy to spray is more because its a hard weapon to obtain for solos or small groups, but still). Currently, you don't have many long range fights as you use to so I would say in my experience, it becomes more sniper focus.
I've also noticed a big inconsistency to weapon damage. Normally you would get 5-6 body shots before dying from an AK, but now it ranges from 3-8 for whatever reason (no headshot damage either). That might also be a reason to why PvP just doesn't feel good right now. Damage is all over the place and its as if the game doesn't calculate the damage properly anymore.

Performance in the game has changed a lot and the recent updates have really and I mean really destroyed performance. Sure, they say that performance is fixed, but there's no reason for my fps to be 180fps two patches go, to 17fps last patch, and now in this patch I'm not even cracking past 117 fps. All they did was change recoil and add trains, how did I just lose out one third of my performance for no reason. I invested into a 5800x3D for this game alone (and at the very least enjoyed that performance for a few months), which got its shins broken. I've heard complaints in the past on the subreddit about the random performance hits and after 4 years, I've finally experienced it myself.

I suppose the highest point in the game for me was the patch in where they added the combat knife. There were reliable ways to build large compounds, turrets didn't need electricity and things were pretty alright. You could reliably setup a good offline defense even in small bases with a few turrets. If you plan on offlining someone, you shouldn't have an easy time, but there's also the aspect for onlining. If we're all being honest, onlines are rare unless you're in a clan, so it doesn't really have a place in this discussion. Anyways, then they added all sorts of visual handicaps, like Sun glare (why was this added?) and visuals when you're either too hot or cold. Then there was the stealth nerf to food/water. Food was and still important when I started the game. Around the time they added horses, they stealth nerfed food and water with no developer notes on it. You would be able to walk around for quite some time with a full bars and a stack of 8 corn, Since that stealth change, you need half a stack (32 corn) to travel the same distance. Speaking of food, personally I was sad the growing system had to change, but I didn't mind as it adds a new layer to master (not very difficult either).

Let's touch on raiding, offlining now is a lot easier than before. You just need an ore tea and get some MLRS rockets. Before the MLRS and the new military base was added, raiding was pretty easy to do (since everyone only offlined raid). Didn't take much to raid small to medium size bases. Now with the new inclusion of MLRS, small to medium bases take nothing to raid and even large bases cant last longer than a day. I thought teas were perfectly fine, gave a risk/reward to farmers and helped those with less time on their hands to play Rust, but MLRS just destroyed raiding balance (not like there was much of a balance to begin with). Word of advice, don't play in maps with a Military base, your base will last longer.

There's also the changes done to building textures. I personally had no issues with how it looked before, but it was really a downgrade back in 2021. At least it was no where as bad as the sound changes/update.

Then there's the roaming NPCs. A while ago there was a bug where NPCs weren't spawning in by the roads. The game was lot more fun since farming scrap already had a lot of competition and challenges. There was no need for NPCs to be spawning on roads, but monuments, I was semi-okay with until you find out the NPCs roaming monuments were MP5 NPCs (the hardest hitting NPC). Just why. The fact that the Facepunch also added to a patch that made it so NPCs caused players to bleed after dealing damage just made it worse to farm roads for scrap.

The new semi-automatic changes do feel great. Semi-Automatic Rifles feel like the sweet spot, its a good cheap all rounder, however the M92 got nerfed. The M92 was already a bad weapon after they broke its kneecaps a few years back. Its a weapon that you needed to purchase for a large some of scrap as its the only way to obtain it (outside of airdrops and event crates). There was no reason to use the M92 before and even less reason now. Why make it hard to obtain if its just complete garbage now.

I felt the combat knife patch was where Rust had its highest point of enjoyment, in my opinion and experience. Of course others will have their own opinion to where Rust was the best, but I felt raiding, farming, and pvp was great. Unfortunately the current state of the game just doesn't appeal to me anymore. There's so much unneeded additions and changes that were perfectly fine beforehand (again, in my opinion). Even with the terrible visual additions and offline raiding buffs, I didn't quit the game because I was at least able to enjoy the game in PvP battlefield servers where those weren't a factor, but now I can't even enjoy the PvP aspect anymore due mostly to the sound downgrades.

Rust was a game I didn't quite love, but had a fun addition to. Rust just isn't worth playing anymore.

Should new players check it out? I'd say no."

12998,"This game saved my life.

I am 37.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that."

Would be a decent game if there was actual FPS aspects to it. But that part of it is a really small part of the game, its mostly people just hiding in dark corners/in the shooting floor of their base/right outside the door of your base waiting for you to come out.

I can count the number of actual gun/bow fights I have had on both hands with almost 500 hours."

And the devs just dont care at all... a massive step in the right direction to stop this would be region locked servers but nope even the modded/community servers are filled with South americans/russians/chinese (EU) servers. 

From what i hear NA its better but if you're in the EU be prepared to be constantly shit talked. Racial slurred and pretty much anything and everything. People will literally dedicate 10s - 100s of hrs to screw you over for the smallest pettiest stuff. 

TL;DR community is so bad it makes league of legends look like a friendly neighbourhood..."

13074,"People running around with automatic weapons and flying around in helicopters blasting you with missiles and chain guns before you can gather a few rocks or wood. Standing just out of the safe zone at stores waiting to kill you, with automatic weapons, as you leave. There is just no possible way to get ahead in this game. I understand it should be challenging but this is just plain unfair and I fail to see where it could be referred to in any way as ""FUN"". Big waste of money in my opinion. Also there are no type of instructions with this game To figure it out is hit and miss....mostly miss. Plus not being able to save any progress is irritating as hell. Then right when i think i'm making progress the browser resets and all is lost. Played for around 60 hrs now trying to figure it out and am still just a naked guy running around with a rock every day."
13075,Great game would rlly recommend
13076,"So this is a review for the type of Rust player I am. I get in the game try to build a base and just upgrade a bunch of stuff do a lot of farming and mind my own business. I will help someone out if I can. I don't kill anyone, I don't raid and I basically just stick to myself. I've played 12 hours the last two weeks after taking a couple years off playing this game. All this game is these days is just a bunch of sweaty door campers and people that have nothing better to do than kill someone with a rock, torch and a couple hundred rock/wood. I've tried probably 8-10 different servers and it's just the same old thing over and over again. I'm all for if I shoot at you then kill me or if I raid you take all my shit but I do none of that. I only have weapons for hunting and stuff like that. If you're new to this game or thinking about getting it for the first time be prepared to never get anything done, die constantly from people with no life ruining other peoples time and basically getting nowhere in the game. The people that kill nakeds and just fuck with people minding their own business have sincerely ruined this game for me. I don't mind getting the shit kicked out of me if I mess with someone else but just me walking around trying to farm and getting killed for no reason is why I can't recommend this game."

Getting use to the fact you will loose everything is usually an easy turn off for most new players, but its what makes this game what it is and something you have to look past and understand the game is about what you accomplish and interact with each reset as you farm your blueprints for the month."

This game is actually way too fun. I love playing it with my friends and just building our base up just to raid other people's bases. The server wipes (weekly, biweekly, or monthly)  help to make sure no one stays on top for too long and there are so many server variations to make sure you have the best experience playing. The community can get pretty toxic but there always seems to be a general consensus that veteran players always want to assist new players.

Highly recommend everyone downloads this game and gives it a solid chance! Some of the most fun I've had with my friends."
13130,not fun ngl
13131,its rusty
13132,"Firstly I would like to say this game was a GREAT game, I absolutely love and would recommend old rust.

However the new update which changed all the recoils and gun sounds has made it so shit that many of my friends with way higher or similar hours wont touch it anymore. The guns sound absolutely awful and its basically a point and click adventure game.

Great to let in all the newbies to play, killed all the long term gamers that spent so much time into the recoils ie. ME lol

I would definitely not recommend the game until the recoil gets fixed and put back to normal at the least (and the sounds, its ass)"
13133,hotdogf
13134,good game
13135,7/10 game if you have others to play with and don't mind losing a few things when you die. I've played several of these survival games and aesthetics aside this has to be the best one. The graphics are great too if you can support the optional features.

and 1 more thing :
rust has to remove that when you start you start naked , just let the player wear a booxer at least. 
imagine playing and you are new near your father 😂

13149,yes this is a game it can be played

for one, a black  *naked* man on the beach came up to me, screaming profaneous slurs while chanting in some abrahamic language, and he beat me to a pulp with a rock.

for another, i built a base and a ful metal cunt shot me inn the face! i vcant beleive it!"

13157,"the game was fun untill arround 2016 then the tryhard get good no recoil updates killed it

you cant customize your character the way u want its all random unless u get another steam account + a new copy of the game rinse and repeat untill you get the desired look never understood why

god forbid if you ever make a constructive post on the facepunch foruns with suggestions or get into an argument with a mod u will just get dev ban

you happen to kill a nobody thats actually a streamer with a lucky shot from ur bow while the dude had a gun he will get angry and report you for stream sniping cheating exploiting to his friend mod and u will get a dev ban ( yes not EAC or VAC )

Rust is not a game it's a job and a lifestyle unless you plan on doing nothing with your life do not play this game or you are in for a bad time ."

13176,probably one of the most toxic games on the market but never the less its a amazing game all around. its very life consuming so do not get involved if you dont want to spend a large part of your life hidden in a room grinding rust.

13212,"The only negative review I've ever made on steam. I'm a big fan of survival games, and I also like pvp full loot, so I figured this would be a great match. The problem is as a solo player, you are just farming for the clans. They don't need your 1x2, but they will spend more resources than you will ever have just to wipe you off the map. They will shoot you with an AK, you have a rock. I honestly don't understand the point in that. Seems like 95% of the player base actively tries to get you to quit. Toxic, racist, cheaters, you name it. It's a real shame, because Facepunch made a good game here, but I guess as a reflection of the world itself, other people have ruined it. Of course, Facepunch caters to these folks, the whales spending money, the no life's with 10,000hrs. 

You have people on Youtube making it look like fun, but they are spending 18 hrs a day in the game. You are not going to have fun. If you are an older gamer with a job, who plays a few hours after work- this is not the game for you. If you are considering trying the game as a solo, don't. If you are a toxic person who wants to join a clan and prey on new players- well then sure, have at it hoss.

I built a research table, got an achievement that only 10% of the player base has. This is a very early step. Rust is losing at least 90% of the players who try out their game. It's not because they are salty or weak or whatever, they are people like me totally willing to start over a few times. But eventually you have to ask yourself, what's the point? Can't build, can't farm, can't make progress. Get good? Why though, when you are just going to be offline raided? There is no benefit to getting better at the game, no benefit to playing it at all really. Let the clans enjoy their virtual kingdoms, I'm moving on."

They are going out of  their way to force players (which are 99% male, lets face it) to play as a girl, and there is no good reason for it. I will not be forced to play as a girl, a am a man, and i want to immerse myself and roleplay as myself, a 35y old male, i dont want my mic voice to be coming out of a girl, i don't want to and will not be forced to play as a girl character.  You should all stop playing this game and let it die, to make a point to this insane developers! Even in real life you can change gender if you want to, but not in his garbage game!"

13244,"I have always wanted to play this game, and recently it came to console. Played it there before PC. I love the crafting and building aspect. I suggest playing with a group or finding a PVE/Solo servers to play. The community is very toxic and unforgiving. Im a casual player that plays 3-4 hours a night if that. And I can have a great start, build a nice solo base. And the next day, after a hard day work, login into absolutly nothing. Base gets offline raided every time. I found enjoyment playing on my own server in God mode with friends or playing on Community/Modded servers for RolePlay, PVE, Zombies. It truely is a great game. Its just the player base is so Toxic, theyll grief you over and over. Door camp you.......frustrating, stay off official servers"
13245,theres too much shit in the game now i have no clue wtf to even do anymore to get half the stuff that just kinda spawned in before

13300,"Why in the hell there is no local server option? I mean set it up with steam cmd is not a big deal, but why do you want me to go through that? At least I can learn the game.
Also, going into public servers is quite annoying if you are trying to figure the game out, so Facepunch should take example from games like 7 days to die, can play pvp, pve, local, on remote server. Big fun!
Concept is cool, NPCs sometimes are OP, good times. Haven't reached the 30 day stage where apparently everything resets, which is fine in PvP settings. Idk, feels a lazy implementation.

I'll wait for some of my friends to join me in a server, and maybe it will become fun"

13335,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
13336,"the new recoil i personally hate and i don't think i will play the game after the last update, i have spent 3.3k hours on the game and have loved every second of it but after the new recoil change its just not the same game i hate that they added aim cone. however i did get used to the new recoil and i think there is no point of practising as you just pull in a line and you basically get beamed buy people with 10 hours also they have wrecked m249 and any gun with 8x scope along with gun noises any gun. they dont care about their old loyal players they don't listen to the community and basically if they continue to wreck guns i feel like rust will die and my over 15k invent will be lost but anyways i haven't had fun because it is to easy to play in groups and they have wrecked solo/duo so i don't recommend rust after the recoil update."

much more with friends so if you gonna decide to buy this
game talk with your friends about it and buy it together

You never know what you're gonna get in a wipe on this game. with RP, PVE, PVP, and training servers that feature gungame with recognizable maps from COD, ESCAPE FROM TARKOV servers, ZOMBIE servers, just about anything you can think there is probably a server for it or for you to make it. you can build in the desert and be a cowboy, you can build next to a monument and be a chad and kill everyone with no mercy, you can build and open up shops for other players to trade for resources. the game as a single game, has so many different and exciting things to do and opportunities for fun. 
BUT THIS GAME IS ONLY WHAT YOU MAKE IT!
So do be aware that this game is a game of chance, and you can lose everything you've worked on in an instant if you aren't careful, so if you're someone who doesn't like those types of games, id suggest you to try the RP servers first to try and get a feel for how to play and if you like it before you jump into the actual game and decide you dont."

"
13499,"I bought the game a week or two ago (June-July 2022) and I've played about 20 hours of Rust so far. This includes setting up my own server and playing with another friend. Note: I did not do any substantial play on official servers yet, mostly because I expected it to be a miserable experience due to not knowing how to play the game very well and getting killed constantly.

I played on maxed graphic settings on a 3700X / 32 GB RAM / 3060 Ti / 2TB NVMe SSD. My PC handles the game no problem at 144 FPS on 1080p on my 144 Hz gaming monitor.

Summary thoughts:
It feels really old. I looked it up and the game originally came out in 2013. Yeah, you can tell. The way the assets load in, the graphics, and quirkiness of the game overall just feel like an old game. Nearly all of my complaints are probably tied to the game being built on an old engine and that isn't something that the developers can easily fix and thus probably won't be fixed. And that's fine. I don't expect a developer to switch gaming engines 10 years later. I knew I was buying a game that has been around a long time.

Things that really stood out (Cons):
1. It takes a REALLY long time for the game to load in. I'm not talking about getting to the main menu. That happens pretty quick. I'm talking about loading into the world after connecting to a server. It takes forever. I never actually timed it on the client, but I'd guess 3-4 minutes. It feels like forever though. I can't think of a game I've played recently that has such long load times. I can't even imagine how painful this would be on a slower computer. 5-10 minute load times for slower PCs are probably not uncommon. Painfully long. Ark: Survival Evolved loads in a lot faster for me. I'd guess about 1/2 to 1/3 the load in times for Ark. I tried it both while running a stand alone server and not - and they were about the same time for me.

2. Server start times on my PC were around 5 minutes. Also really slow. Ark server boot times are also long, but Rust server boot times are longer by 1-2 minutes I'd guess.

3. The way assets load in is funky. Probably most people don't notice, but it stood out to me as weird and janky. Something that you would expect from a 2013 game, but not in 2022. Again this is the engine's fault.

4. Really strange collision boxes. There were times that I was trying to mine rocks or ore. It felt like I was right on top of it, would swing, and would miss. Probably happened to me about 10% of the time. Often even repositioning would not fix it. Often the only way to solve was to crouch. Just bad engine collisions which is problematic of an old engine.

5.  A lot of stuff is not intuitive.

5a. Like trying to figure out how to water plants was way harder than it should have been. Water tank / water bucket usage was very unintuitive and had to look it up outside of the game after getting very frustrated.

5b. I also found the armor and gearing system to not be intuitive. It isn't clear which piece goes where on the body and which ones are mutually exclusive with other pieces. TBH I still don't understand it, and it is very trial by error. It drives me a bit crazy to be honest. The progression isn't clear, or obvious - neither are the pros / cons. I blame this largely on UI organization but also the design here feels bad from a progression perspective.

5c. You can't move or pickup walls after 30-60 sec of placing them. You can't easily destroy them either. You have to manually destroy them. This is probably understandable from a game design perspective. However, I wasn't able to destroy a stone wall in my base and it wasn't clear to me why that was. Other games give you a clear indication as to why a weapon you are using is doing no damage, or they show you the damage. In Rust, it wasn't clear to me what was going on and why my tool / weapon was ineffective or nearly ineffective at damaging the wall. I nearly broke two weapons, only to discover they did no damage after equipping my hammer to check. Again, trial by error stuff - but newer games often provide more in-game info to make this more clear.

Pros:
1. Lots of skins, some of which look really cool.
2. The build UI looks nice and feels good and is quick. But also it doesn't match up from a styling / theming perspective. I was fine with this though as I mainly only cared about ease of use / functionality.
3. Requires a lot of in game knowledge and personal skill to be good. A lot of room and variance in player skill levels and knowledge and it really shows in game which is great
4. House building is done well here. Lots of variance from build styles which affect strategic options during raids. It is well done and adds a lot of interesting gameplay which other games lack.

Overall:
- I'd give this a cautious recommendation if you don't mind quirks and oddities of playing on a nearly 10 year old game engine - and want high skill / high in-game knowledge gameplay. This enables a lot of really fun pvp opportunities. I would not recommend for PvE as it is fairly minimal gameplay and lower PvE depth compared to Ark (which has a lot of PvE by comparison). Pick this up for the PvP high skill gameplay, but something that is less twitchy than fortnite / League - and includes some persistence aspects and progressions tactics / raiding tactics around housing build strategies."

Want to spend 20 hours for nothing? here we go again :D"
13511,"Still pretty new to this game, it's enjoyable for a good few hours until either someone kills you or you get guns and literally have nothing to do but ruin other people's lives. The game has a good concept but is ruined from the community since the game is filled with specimens, the whole base build and gathering resources is fun until someone who has already got an ak from the first day of wipe kills you for no reason. The game has everything but is shot down by the people who play it

9/10"
13512,"great game
"
13513,One of the worst games ever when it comes to performance it does not matter what computer you have you will not have a good time + it is a no lifers kinda game you will need to be online 24/7. and every server you join groups in the server already  have everything so you wont have a chance to build up before they raid you.

13526,"this games at least five years old and is full of hackers. servers advertise ""we have non playing admins to catch hackers"". the devs are barely competent. on top of that the game is full of these weird little glitches, even if you just want to build something, you come back the next day and someone glitched your base and stole the entire thing. its so frustrating.

if this game was in early access i'd think maybe it could get better. but it won't."
13527,Just buy ARK Survival Evolved instead it has dinosaurs

The old gun sounds will still be in my heart as in I'll still be in fear if i hear a M2 or an AK sound near my base hoping they dont come my way, but they made them sound all similar or non threatening anymore. Ill miss rust the way it used to be."

My only beef with this game is the monthly/weekly server wipes, it kind of sucks to put all the effort into building and gathering only to lose it all, but I understand why it's needed.

13615,"Awesome Game
"
13616,"Lots of my friends thought to try out rust, most of them are upset you cannot change your appearance.  Rust creators even went to the extent of forcing this so no one could change it.  Game play is OK , without mods very little non PVP content.  Overall minimal effort on the game makers part to provide anything else but mechanics and a world."

13688,"Do you like being the ""content"" of the game for others? Because thats all it is. 
Strange interactions with other players is fun all but you can't fuckin' quit the game or you lose everything you worked for. 12 of my hours has been spent on one server, Had a big fort going, 3 walls thick, stone upgraded, and metal doors.  After spending all day defending against a few nakeds and the occasional shortlived pvp away from my home, i decided my base was fortified as i could get it and logged out.
After 2 hours i thought to check my base before i go to bed and sure enough. They took EVERYTHING.
ITS A GAME FOR OTHERS TO TAKE FROM YOU. YOU ARE THE CONTENT. YOU ARE PLAYING TO SUPPLY OTHER PLAYERS. PIECE OF SHIT GAME WASTING TIME AND EFFORT."

Before I played rust I was a loser and couldn't do anything failing classes, no love life, even my family hated me. But now after playing rust I am now a grade A student I have all the bitches in my school my family adores me and I am ripped. Rust changed my my life."

13772,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

13808,"Maps are too small - even if you look for the lowest population server you can find, there's still bases literally EVERYWHERE you look - totally not a ""survivor"" game feel when it's always overcrowded.  Also, the wipes are WAY too frequent for anyone who can't devote hours every day to playing one game.  Extremely frustrating to work for a month to learn half the blueprints and then it's all just flushed away - WTF, seriously? So lame.

The game has promise, IF, they could:  1) make the trees dense enough that you could actually hide your base, 2) make the map large enough that if you want to get away from people YOU CAN, and 3) reduce wipe frequency to 3 months or longer (at least on some servers, for those of us who aren't gaming 80 fuking hours a week)."
13809,Communication is the most important part of this game.
13810,"very good fortnite rippoff 
Approved"
13811,nicee
13812,"What can be said about Rust that hasn't already been said? Rust, in my opinion, is one of the best games ever made. It can be incredibly challenging, but easily one of the most rewarding games I have ever experienced. And this game is definitely an experience. Ranging from amazingly vast and calm landscapes to head pounding PVP action, from deep underground in the tunnels or take to the skies in a helicopter. Few things can replicate the feeling of your base being assaulted while you defend yourself, as in Rust. Win or Lose, I cannot help but feel a great sense of great pride and accomplishment in building a base or two and living through a wipe on a server.

I will be completely honest Rust is one of the most difficult games I've ever played. The game is not difficult because of the mechanics (which may I add are really good) It's because it has one of the most toxic and un-forgiving fanbases in the world. However, if you can get over the community's ever-growing toxicity then I believe this game is amazing and 100% worth your time. So far I have accumulated 30 hours of playtime solo, and 20 hours in a duo with my friend, and they were really fun once I got past the difficult beginnings. This game offers a lot to do especially if you are willing to put in some hours and grind. The combat is nice but complex; at first, It takes like an hour of running around with a bow to understand how it works, but to any dedicated gamer that is an hour well spent. Rust requires a healthy bit of dedication and grind, as well as needing some skill in order to protect yourself and progress; but if you are willing to put in some hours I think you can squeeze out a nice 100 hours before it all kinda gets stale. Understand that Rust is 50% mental and 50% skill, the players that have the most success when they first start are the people who don't cry and throw a fit because they lost shit; it’s the players who get up and keep trying to play and have fun. Trust me being in a good mental state is in my opinion the most crucial part of the game in order to enjoy it.

Thanks for reading, any awards given would be rly appreciated."

13840,"I've played rust for maybe 3 years idk how long exactly but i played it a lot.
This is going to be a long review.


I loved this game up until June 2022, the combat update i hate that, i feel that all my hours are wasted i would've much preffered not knowing about this game at all since the one thing that had stayed the same one thing you keep every wipe in rust the gun spray all changed cant do anything without crouching bye bye to cool clips insane shots and s**t. i wish i would've played CSGO the whole time I've been playing rust.

But that isn't the main reason i am writing this review right now if it was i would've done it when the combat update came out but the reason i am writing this review today is because of the lag, game freezes, crashes, etc. i just launched rust today for the first time in 10 days and the lag is unbelievable i asked a friend about the game freezes and he gave me a command to use in console, it worked but not too well. Anyways, 2 minutes after that i respawn in a bag given to me and take out a few things from a box and my game freezes everytime i pull something out (this is usual for me at least low specs pc) but then low and behold i go to type in a code (hold e on the code lock and press enter code) and instant game crash bear in mind that i just loaded this game for 1 hours and 20 minutes in which i have already experienced 2 crashes, rust is unplayable for me, I quit this."
13841,community is toxic sometimes but its fun. Better when you have a group.
13842,its class

13864,Hey people looking a reviews i would recommend this game if u have a pretty good pc if u dont like mine i would not because u need really good parts for it and u will lag if u haave a bad pc so do it at ur own risk but ye
13865,this game is very fun

13867,best survival
13868,Bro why is White Screen on join server??? every time
13869,ITS WILD AS F*** (actually good though)
13870,"I liked Rust, I'm sure you did too. It has been an awesome work in progress, and had massive potential. Do not recommend anymore due to devs focusing on combat and guns only with a few map updates. Rust lost it's crafting audience along with environment-feel open crafting. 

Rust is now a bunch of sticky-fingered kids shooting each other, if you have a gun-you win. Look elsewhere to find a PVE crafting game. Thanks for the fun times Facepunch, but we are done."

13880,"Whoever made this game had a good idea and then hired a group of washbuckets to program it. You will download this game and then excitedly sit at your computer and load up the game, only to sit there for 10 minutes waiting for the damn thing to load and then, boom, you're in. So you excitedly look through the servers and pick one and sit there waiting and then oh wait, whats this? Loading map 0/12 000. Ok well i feel like the map should've downloaded when i downloaded the game but ok... then its finishes and you cant wait to hop into this new world but wait... whats this? warming assets 0/9 000? well i woud've thought it had done that when the game was loading for 10 minutes but ok... then that finishes and it says its loading the game, you sit there, waiting in anticipation, waiting, waiting... 10 minutes later it is done loading the 20 different aspects that shouldve been loaded when you were loading the game... or the map... or the assets... Then guess what? Loading prefabs 0/ 3000... Fantastic this is great... then that finally finishes and after your prefabs have been at 3000/3000 for 3 minutes you finally get put into the game. You get a loevely 10 minutes of playing and exploring this new world(In which you just get slaughtered again and again by toxic players with guns) and then what happens? Your computer freezes... Now you, not only have to restart your computer, but you have to reload a game that has a loading time that takes longer to load than GTA 5 if GTA 5 got hit on the head and became mentally disabled. And no, it is not my computer. My computer has literally never had a problem running a game and my friend has a top of the line gaming laptop and has the same issue."

13913,"Rust is a beautiful survival game that has competitive aspects that make it shine in the dark gloom that is PvP survival games. The mechanics are simple to learn, but a master uses them even better. The fights are good and the PvP aspect is balanced and well-thought. The base-building is realistic and very strategic and has to be done effectively and quickly. This, unlike a lot of survival games, makes Rust fast-paced and feel exciting; you are trying to survive and it's not easy.

little bit buggy graphically sort of like early pubg days random things floating ...rocks etc but meh look past it as its just not a serious game at all the voice chat is hilarious"

13947,"Rust is a game that's hard to get into if you play official servers as a solo beginner. If you have a group, you'll fair better the bigger it is. I definitely recommend getting into youtube videos first about the game so some of the meta comes easier. If you try community/modded servers you might find it easier to get the basics down. 

I learned the best on a PvP training server and a 5x modded server so I could just think about techniques not the actual grinding of the game. Once you have that down, go for the official servers and become a Rust Chad.

Remember to upgrade all door frames and foundations or else your base is gone!"
13948,"No way to change appearance, if you dont like what you get, too bad. Stupid game design, I dont need games to be teaching me ""values"" or bullshit like that"
13949,this game is very fun
13950,"The problem with Rust is it rewards players with no life or responsibilities. It's not to say those good players don't get ahead, it's just that you are punished severely for having low-tech items. The teams that play the most the first days of wipe and secure T3 BPs quickly then go onto dominate and raid everybody else. The ""Always-on"" nature of the servers is half the problem. The game encourages you to spend all your time neurotically guarding your stuff, at all hours of the day. The game is ruined by zergs also. There are zero attempts to balance for players that don't have a large team. You will never meet more sociopathic 12-year-olds, racists, and assholes than you ever will playing this game. The game is built to encourage griefing. It's not a game that promotes mental well-being. Played 50+ hrs of it, and decided to walk away. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
13951,"Well, I have a decent amount of hours on rust, but I'm not the type of guy to go on about how good it is and stuff. It's an 'ok' game. I don't LOVE it or anything. It's worth it for the price. 
It's kinda like minecraft, your into it for a good couple of weeks or to a month, and your watching every video that pops up, then one day it kinda just gets old and you don't touch it."

[b] What I Liked [/b]

I love the survival aspects of the game, scrounging in dangerous areas for loot, building up my little base to store items, and equipping my character.  Traveling at night was also a lot of fun.  Never knew who or what I would run into.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

The PvP.  As someone who solo's these type of games, I was just at a disadvantage.  Stepping a short distance from my base I encountered four players killing me - over and over.  I respawn at another location, and even though I'm naked, I get killed by any player that passes by.  I get it, that's the point of the game.  But I'm old, and it's just not fun fighting against those who gang up on me, when my reflexes just aren't as sharp.

Also, the community is laughably childish.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

By the second day of a wipe, I was already being ganked over and over by groups using guns and in fully body armor.  I imagine my little stone building would be destroyed just a couple days later.  Decided to save myself the trouble and stop playing altogether.

I know it's a good game, but I am leaving a negative review for those who think they may enjoy it, but really won't.  I watched a ton of YouTube videos, which made it seem fun.  Unless you're willing to start the day of a wipe, play a ton, and find a group, it just becomes a frustrating experience.  That, or you're a masochist.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!"
13977,"Great game, beware of toxic community and general people who dont care about you starting out"
13978,i like game game is hardcore game is ok
13979,"make me sad, modded sever make me happy

13986,cool game!!! play on m1 macbook air 2020 and its the craziest thing ive run on it. crashes rarely and deals with some lag but pretty solid for a laptop fs!! the game is a tonna fun... brutal but fun. if u wanna be good at the game you gotta play for dozens of hours... only to be reset by a server wipe. so if you got some time to kill or if u were sick like me it is absolutely amazing!!! the companion app is dope to so get that fs. love it!!!... but sadly think I will never have enough time to get good lol
13987,Fun
13988,ITS GOOD BUT HARD TO UNDERSTAND and people just kill you when  ya trying to farm

14003,yes
14004,no because im better and kill them easily.
14005,"This game has some of the best building mechanics I've ever seen. 
I highly recommend finding a PVE server to play on that lets you focus more on the tech tree and less on the other players yoinking your stuff lol. 
I'd still watch out for animals though lol, and some PVE servers have zombies. 
Lots of modded servers to play on as well, don't let your experience on 1 server ruin your perspective, they're all very different to play on with different rules."
14006,gewd
14007,if they didn't change anything like the new recoil and new gun sounds then i would recommend it but now its too easy to play and there is no challenge to the game

14010,"Game was good up until they changed the ak 10 hour kiddos just fucking beaming 400 metres away and if you say some gay shit like get good or the game is good now cope idgaf im giving my opinion about the game legit its so fucking not fun to not grind for anything anymore i personally enjoyed how hard the recoil was and how hard it was to do something in this game now its so fucking easy to get anything legit game ruined by own devs and when it comes to updates they add nothing new just some shit new thing and when they say its ""performance update"" there is none im still on 40 fucking fps with no changes happening they add the most randomest useless shit ever."

14083,"Imagine you, as a very nice individual, decides to visit The Outpost for the first time, you notice that the game registers the Outpost as a safe zone. Things are clearly going well you talk to a very lovely Lumberjack who needs help finding a bottle. After finding the bottle he gives you another task, a pretty easy one at that, cutting 2.000 wood. The Lumberjack also happens to give you a hatchet. You start cutting down the trees eventually accumulating over 2,000 wood. Unfortunately you've drifted out of the safe zone and it has become dark. When suddenly a very, very mean boar attacks you. You try and fight back but you didn't come equipped with the right tools, you try swinging the hatchet but end up dying. You re-spawn looking for your stuff and notice that you can't find it, after deciding to go back home and wait out the dark, a BEAR living in the forest decides to kill you. Frustrated you decide to just cut down trees with your trusty rock only to THEN GET KILLED BY ANOTHER PLAYER WITH A CROSSBOW. You've had enough you uninstall the game only to comeback to it a week later. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that thinks games are too easy."

14124,change recoil so pokimane can spray the ak!!!!
14125,"This game is truly amazing. You may encounter a few toxic players here and there, but otherwise it's a great experience. During my first near-10 hours of playtime I have never experienced a single crash, game breaking bug, or significant exploiter. 

[i] Rust [/i] is one of those games that you get stuck playing for hours and hours each day, and so far it hasn't gotten old. I can see myself playing this game for a while! Due to the easily understandable controls, exciting atmosphere, and PVP battles, and countless other factors it never gets boring.

I have got hundreds of hours on Ark, which is one of the games I used to see somewhat similar to this, but after playing rust for the mere amount of time I have, I can already tell the difference in which is more fun to play!"

14148,ITS ALRIGHT  if you don't have a team mate that always messes up the base
14149,leave the game=getting instat raided
14150,"Great game overall: survival, play with friends, feature to talk with any other player you come across and oh wait that's all. 

It's not fun unless you spend your life on the game. new players like my self (9 hours) have no way of learning, progressing or getting better, you will die over and over and lose everything you grinded for. that's if you were even able to get a good 1 hour grind if your lucky and again just to lose it all. many many try-hards with insane amount of hours, which is fine its a competitive game but no way for new players to enjoy the game or overall get better at it. i suggest not buying this game.

edit: forgot to add that even with a fresh wipe even if you're lucky enough to get a base started with resources get a bow and set spawn. other players already somehow get guns and fully kitted armour by 15-20 mins of a fresh wipe, after that they just go about hunting other players. 

and other thing to note the anti cheat is terrible so be wary there is many hackers with paid subscriptions: another reason why this game is just not enjoyable."

14271,"I started playing and immediately stopped sleeping, they threatened to take my family and skin my dog if i didn't keep playing. Its a tough lifestyle door camping 24/7, many racial slurs are thrown at me through game chat. But, the psychological damage still doesn't even compare to the fact that I can no longer walk after playing consecutively for 7 days. I have not eat or drank in 48 hours, send help."

14287,"Too start off, I was a huge fan of the game, it was the most fun I have ever had for majority of my 2k hours. But now it is just a mess, they completely ruined the part I liked most about this game. The new recoil update is just horrible, all my 2k hours of skill just gone down the drain so new player can enjoy it, it almost feels like the developers want money. There is potential however, if they just change the gun sounds back I might go back to playing, cause right now it is just horrible, they kinda sound like they would come from a trashy Roblox shooter game. I am soon going to be selling all my skins, and I will quit for good, unless magically a miracle somehow happens and they fix their damn game."
14288,good
14289,"fucked up game, totally recommended"

14310,its only fun when u can get some weapons but that takes so long cuz when ur in a server with more than 50 people as soon as u spawn someone with a bow kills u and u cant join a server with less people cuz then once u get weapons theres no point in having them cuz theres no one to kill
14311,yes
14312,hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
14313,this games stupid as hell. when game updates it wipes all severs and they don't tell you when update is coming. i spent 20 hours making a nice base after sever wiped since the first was 10 hours were spent on wtf i'm doing. A time waste game not fun. a running and mining simulator. i wouldn't recommend this game to anyone at all.

14335,Some dumb update
14336,great game! best played in numbers or if you like the hard difficulty play solo.
14337,Very cool game. I love it.
14338,"I would have recommended this game before the major update changing the recoil and gun sounds, but now it it trying to be like every other game and have easy gun recoil which made Rust unique. I spend 1.4k hours learning the recoil patterns so they could just change them. I loved the challenge that the recoil gave you so that you could keep practicing and eventually get really good and feel like you accomplished something. Now the guns have easy recoil and huge aim cones so you cant spray far. This update was to please the people that complained about the recoil being hard. I know I hate it, but Rust had to do what they had to do for the money. Its sad that it had to be this way but gl to everyone and RIP my skin prices. :("
14339,Dont upgrade your base. You will get eac banned
14340,fun
14341,fuck this game
14342,Great game and overall fun if you have a group of friends to play with. As long as you assume that everybody is trying to kill you and take your stuff you wont be caught off guard.
14343,cool
14344,"Game constantly breaks, multiple systems and features in the game just don't work well, nah."
14345,very good game but very addicting! (please send my family back)

14349,bobo
14350,i like this game
14351,"Really nice looking game graphics are really nice
People on the other hand are not do not trust anyone 
I've been playing before the new COMBAT Update where they made  guns really easy to use (lower recoil) and hard to hit people further away anyways game was more competitive before the Update since u had to learn how to control recoil for guns 
people wasted a lot of hours practicing like i did for nothing but i still enjoy playing the game and making little toxic and racist kids cry is the best feeling ever"

14362,fun
14363,"it is a very good game you can spend many hours on and have fun with your friends, And that you can do raids and get better gear."
14364,eh
14365,"even on day one there's jerks with guns already running around killing naked noobs.  it might be fun if i ever get to see what happens after basic tools. seems like you need to dedicate your entire week to it to stand a chance... time most people don't have. also wipes happen often so if you manage to progress far, all your time and effort will be deleted soon."
14366,full on reeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Logging in for the first time and some bambi randomly cracked my head
14367,"Hmm, unsure if I like it or not yet...Might need to play a bit more..."
14368,NO
14369,very good game <3
14370,"i made a little kid cry other than that, i hate this game"
14371,yes
14372,"So I've obviously put a pretty decent amount of time into this game, and I enjoyed it quite a lot, until the combat update. One of the things in this game that really kept bringing me back was that you can put so many hours into this game. The progression/grinding was always fun because it was mixed with pvp, and that was the great thing about the game, the pvp was extremely unique. The combat update completely destroyed this for me. With this update, you can master pretty much any gun in a few hours, and when you do, the guns aren't satisfying to shoot. This game doesn't have the right pvp aspects to make things like tactics or strategies very viable or interesting, meaning that when the one major thing that made the pvp fun and unique, the very difficult and interesting spray patterns, were removed, the pvp is very bland. Because of this, I believe that the change is good in the short term for the playerbase and the devs, but in the long term, will have negative effects for both parties, as you can no longer sink that much time into the game. Alas, I will probably still play this game, but I can't find myself playing this game for long spans of time anymore."
14373,good
14374,omg this game is so fun. Hoping for rust 2 to come out

14397,Good game to play with friends especially but it hurts when you lose your loot.
14398,"The most toxic community but its the Rust experience very unique to this game. Despite the game being played in 2022, it feels as if you are walking the streets of 1960s building your character and testing your patience."

20/10 would definitely recommend"
14411,"If you wanna learn how to play the game look up tutorials on YT if you dont you are in for a rude awakening! You spawn  in naked with a rock and get killed by an AK dont matter what server its on, You farm for 15 min to make a base no one shoots at you and then you start building your base someone walks through your front door as your placing a lock on it and steals your loot, or you go farm comps for 30 min and right as your coming home 6 dudes pull up on you and your dead, -5/10 do NOT reccomend"

14425,"The game is so sweaty and try hard that you start to ponder about what the other players are doing in their life. Are they working? Is Rust their full time job? You start to think that these people probably never touch grass for consecutive days. Finally, you start realising, you are also on the same boat as them. You try to be better than them at not touching grass, sacrificing your sleep just so you can get an edge over them. BECAUSE you are as addicted to the game as they are. Addiction is real, buy this game at your own risk."

THIS IS WHY WE LOVED THIS GAME! Now its just big updates with little to no care and a more time spent on what will give them money ARTIC SUIT they added a monument so they could sell a skin in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that you had to buy. If you take a indef look at the last year of updates they are sloppy and just to grab players to play for a WEEK OR TWO not somthing that gives them Months to work with. !!!

14569,Rlly fun! The game has a great concept and is carried out wonderfully! Do recommend however it is insanely hard to make the game look pleasing and have a reasonable frame rate on a mid gpu. For context I have a 1660 super and a ryzen 7 3800x and the game runs 87 frames (and lower in foliage) on lowest setting and 39 frames on max.
14570,this game is pure hell but other than the 100% recomend
14571,buying this game will ruin your life
14572,GOOD BUT ENRAGING

14629,"I personally have a problem with this game, I don't really like pvp. I feel that if everyone formed an alliance and worked together you'd all prosper. After all, 1+1 equals 2. But greed and the just desire to shoot other players makes, 1-1 = 0 ... I don't know how to explain it very well, I do know that if you just take from other people you're not adding to the economic growth of the server, therefore not contributing to the advancement of server society. 

There are creative maps, where you build things. However, other games can do this better. This game just feels like a ""punch to the face"" in a lack of better terms (looks at developer and publisher names). 

Overall Review: If you enjoy raging and frustrations, Buy this game. If you enjoy fps and league of legends, this game is for you.

BONUS REVIEW (response to comment): You can have the same amount of fun in 7 Days to Die, looking into a chest and finding something good.. But if you look at the youtube videos where people have the most fun, it's them doing funny things, looking for ways to play the game out of the normal. It's interesting to watch, people getting shot down by their own greed in a trap base.

But I'm a fan of striving through cooperation, thinking of Star Trek Voyager Episode ""The Void"" where they're thrust into a battle royale environment and have to survive and find a way to escape, which they needed to work together to do.

It also applies to things like the science facility, it's much more manageable with a party of people trying to survive with you, than constantly getting stabbed in the back. It feels to much like Star Trek's ""Mirror Universe""."
14630,wasted my life just for it to all be ruined with the 'combat update'

14658,"You can play this game for a very long time and find an extreme amount of fun. This game brought me some of the most fun I have had playing video games ever. Although personally I find myself drifting away from the game because of being burnt out and because of the updates I think are making the game less fun. What I found most fun about this game was finding a group of friends and experiencing the game and learning it together, mastering recoil and then giving the new players what the experienced players did to us when I first started. But the new updates just seem to decrease skill gap and make the game easier, sure this is good for new players for like the first hundred hours or so, but this decreased skill gap is just going to make big groups become harder to beat and solo play much harder. Even though I think the game is going downhill and drifting away from it, it still can be loads of fun to play for new players. Just the experience is a lot of fun from making friends to getting back stabbed by them. A piece of this game will definitely stay with me forever"

14688,games super fun can become addicting but is very toxic if you like faction type games where you can build bases etc this is def for you
14689,"The community is absolutely toxic. The game hinges on teaming up with other players but there is no mechanism for that to happen when anyone will kill anyone else for a few scraps of wood or rock off a new player.
The graphics are nice and the progression is awesome, but without some kind of team building mechanism or at least a less toxic community that is willing to work together, the game is just frustrating and annoying."

14782,"Ever since I was a wee lad, I noticed my penis was a bit large. I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large cock. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners. I loved watching the other kids take quick glances of my cock in fear and shame. Few years later when I was about 11 years old, my penis has started to become a burden for me. Having a 24 inch cock in 6th grade is no joke, I had to come up with creative ideas of where to hide the magnificent beast. Usually I hid it inside the right leg of my pants, kids always thought it was weird how my right leg was so ""muscular"" compared to my other, which meant I had to workout only my left leg in order to not arouse suspicion. I remember I went home depressed one day, crying to god on why he cursed me with such a shaft. I was tearing my pants with anger, when I started to feel a tingly sensation in my penis. I started rubbing it, and suddenly it GREW EVEN LONGER, I was devestated because I thought it was already too large, but the feeling I had when I was rubbing, it was too good to stop. I started holding it with both my hands and stroking it, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy my monster with mere hands, so I began using my feet too. The feeling was incredible, god was on my side again. As I was rubbing it faster and faster, I thought of my science teacher. My cock was throbbing, my nipples erect, my eyes wide and open. I was on my bed at the time, and I felt my Johnson about to erupt with tremendous force, I didn't know what to do so I hid under the bed, and then I came. It was like 4th of july. At first the stream was steady, of white cream in about 1 liter per second, then it was chaos. My penis was going up and down dancing with explosions of cum (Only later that day I found out my grandpa died at that moment of a heart attack because the sounds reminded him of bastogne when he was fighting the Germans). After a few second I realized I might drown because my juice covered the whole floor about two inch deep, I quickly slid across pools of cum gasping for air, I stood up and finally, my cum gun started to relax. My mom came into the room shocked and disgusted, she yelled at me that I must see a doctor and get my manhood shortend or even removed. The day after my grandfather's funeral, I came to the doctor's office, and told him my story. After a lengthy cock inspection, he said that I have a rare condition, which makes my cock grow exponentially with each year, width and length. He calculated that my cock would weigh 200 kg when I turn 30, which is about the maximum weight my spine can support, beyond that and it would fracture and I'll die. I asked him if I could remove it, but he said no because I would die of blood loss. He also said I need to do blood transfusions everyday to feed my absolute unit of a schloong the blood it needs. Needless to say, I was devestated, my once blessing, became a curse, again. One day when I was 16, I was in my math class when I heard a terrible noise, it reminded me of the first time I was beating my meat, but it turns out it was just a gunshot. Kids all around me were shouting that there was a school shooter. I immediately got up and ran to the door, carrying my pack with my hands. Suddenly I heard shots very close to my ears, and saw dead bodies on the ground, so I ran into the closest door which was the janitor's room, closed the door and hid under the table making as little noise as possible. Little did I know, my crush was under the same table, hiding there in fear, when she saw me she almost screamed, but I put both my hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. I heard the shooter opening the door slowly and looking for me. I was completely silent, but then I noticed my crush's incredible bajongas, and I felt my cock starting to throb and expand. She seemed to notice, and I could see that she was impressed with my goofy goober. Her facial expression made my ding dong enlarge even more and I could feel my pants starting to tear apart. My shclong abong seemed to send electro-magnetic waves all over the room because the light above us started to flicker with every throb of my cock. The shooter noticed that and walked to our table. I knew I had to do something quickly or me, my crush, and my beaver basher would all die. Then it hit me, and I knew what I had to do. I looked over to my crush, and I started playing with her milkers. At first she was trying to resist, but then she figured out what I was trying to do and played along. My cock grew more and more, and when I felt it about to burst out of my pants. I got up and looked straight at the shooter. He hesitated for a single moment, which cost him his life. My pants exploded as my sexcalibur shot out a single hardened white cum shaped like a 7.62 mm sniper bullet right into the shooter's head. I was about to celebrate but then I noticed the smell of smoke in the air, turns out my massive  shot not only the shooter, but also a gas pipe that was in the vicinity. Fire was all around us, as I held my crush close, I knew there was no way both of us would get out of here, so there was only one option. ""Get in!"" I said. ""What?"" She asked. ""Get in! There is no time!"" I said and pointed to my foreskin. She climbed inside the pocket between my foreskin and my cock. And I started running, breathing smoke and caughing, kicking doors and running through hallways, longing for fresh air. Finally I got out of the school, and I saw everyone looking at me and my dong. I slowly walked to the benches, and sat down to breath. Then I saw my crush's mother, and she asked me where her daughter is. I got up, and said ""I know where she is!"". I pulled my foreskin and there she was. I expected to hear claps and cheers, but when I didn't, I looked at my crush and saw she was dead. Turns out she suffocated inside my yogurt hose. The police arrested me, and here I am, with my massive schlong and 15 years in prison. If your penis is small, do not despair, for at least you did not have to go through what I did. Farewell."

14791,this is the best game
14792,there are lots of sweats but it is still fun
14793,"I love survival games, and I like shooters. I hoped for some mash-up of counterstrike and valheim - gather resources, build a base, go shoot things. But the PVP in this is just too hardcore for me. You spawn naked, you get shot by some guy with an AK. You survive long enough to build a hatchet or a pick axe. You get shot by some guy with an AK. You finally craft a bow and some armor. You get shot by some guy with an AK. You survive long enough to scrape together enough resources for  your first base. You get shot buy some guy with an AK. You manage to build a simple base. You log back in, and you're dead. You got shot by some guy with an AK.

You finally find a good weapon in a crate and you get the drop on some poor sap who just spent the last 2 hours gathering resources. You're rich! You get shot by some guy with an AK.

You have a good 4 hours to play with a buddy and you finally get a solid base. You find some sweet weapons. You kill some poor sap and take all his crap. You log off. You log back in. Everything you collected is gone. You got shot by some guy with an AK.

Once I realized that all I'm doing is running around gathering resources and building bases for other people to steal, the fun pretty much died instantly. I'm over losing everything I have every time I log off, or usually 3 or 4 times in a row before I even decide to log off.

I'll stick to games with some PVP where I don't constantly lose every single thing I've had to grind to get. Starting over for the 50th time in 40 hours was my breaking point."

14807,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

14851,"For the price, this game is seriously lacking, save your money and buy something like 7 Days to Die instead.  The game spawns you on a beach with nothing but a torch and a rock, and within moments you are likely killed by wildlife, or other players.

The crafting menus is awkward, and unwieldy, and the building mechanics are needlessly - well, not exactly complex, but certainly protracted. Not that you will ever get this far on a PVP server - which is the way you will unlock acheivements as all the Offical servers are PVP.

There are a handful of Community servers that are PVE in which you may be able to learn the basics of the game, assuming that asshat PVPers are flaunting the PVE status to go around murdering newbies.

hackers, and cheaters are rife within this game, in the space of maybe a few hours I noted more than 20 players get banned for cheating (this is heralded in chat) ranging from a few to nigh 100 days. This is of course only those caught to be cheating, I am sure may more get away with it regularly.

I would suggest that unless you are a masochist, avoid purchase of this trash."

14860,good
14861,My hours should talk for themselves
14862,no singleplayer
14863,i defenitly recomend this game i am getting addicted its so fun and even more fun with friends a bit unfair when there is 20 pepole coming to you but fou can always play on a solo/duo/trio/squads server or evem a modded 2times server with faster nigths i like that a lot because its more fast pace but you could always hit up some nodes you know
14864,Amazing game
14865,Took 30 minutes to load onto a server. Dropped the hard R and got booted and upon trying to rejoin it tried to start the 30 minute entity loading again. Didn't realise Rust was just loading screen simulator. This shit is so unbelievably ass.

The community Is very big, you can find so many good servers that you will enjoy. There Is also big community with Russian servers, but when you join mostly everyone Is speaking In English which I quite like.

15001,good
15002,"There are a few problems with this game. First is the community of nocturnal incels, second is the lack of people playing on vanilla servers because the game is boring, and third, this game causes me to want to jump off a hot air balloon onto someones base and take a dump into their mouth for rooftop camping. I give it a 6/2."
15003,"i woke up on the beach and saw a naked man hitting a naked woman in the face with a rock when i took a rock out and hit the man in the face with the rock and the man died and i went home and downloaded rust and did it again

15060,FUN GAME UNTIL SOME GOOBER COMES AND RAIDS YOU WHEN THEY USE MLRS TO REMOVE YOUR BASE
15061,"Overall, the game is great, nice graphics, nice mix of primitive cavemen feel, working you way up to higher tier loot, the downsides in my opinion is the amount of toxicity in larger servers, and more. Some smaller problems I hate is that the Mini helicopters have good hp, but blow up really easily and now strong the normal scientist along the road are. Overall I highly recommend this game."
15062,I might have some thing more to say about rust later but for now i must say that the game is quite fun but annoying its as easy to make progress as to loose it all and that's quite annoying however i do like the fact that you can play piano and have the game read MIDI files so that the game will basically play the songs for you and i sometimes like to go to the out post and play music for people
15063,do not play this game
15064,Games alright i guess

15082,"It takes a lot of time, sure its a fun game but, 1: You will waste a lot of time here, it may not seem that long from my accord but i have almost 800 hours played on this game total over the past many years. It is fun at points, you get your highs and lows.
I'd say for the casual gamer to not play rust, it is extremely competitive and you will get clapped at every encounter, even more so if you dont have a PC build that lets you move and internet with very fast speeds.

To those just starting your rust adventures, good luck, i wish you great luck with your monument runs and PvP, along with raids"

15098,"Buy this game
this game simultaneously ruined my life and has made everyone around me pressure me to seek professional help. I have not left my room since I have started playing, this shit has made me want to kill my self in several different ways every time I play this game I want to shove a cactus up my anus and sit down because I personally believe that it would be better for me, I have made so many different bases and every time I've made them not only have I not been able to get a chance to try defend, I didnt even get a chance to see who tf done it. I get offlined every time. Not only have I became very homophobic due to the actions of other in game players I have also become very racist. All my friends tell me to buy scripts because they just triple everyone in the head but I'm here struggling to hit as shot. They have still not been banned for cheating. This also brings me to my next point of how tf can ""easy anticheat"" be so easy to bloody work around. This game is infested with scripters and cheaters.
So in conclusion I would recommend this game to everyone who wants to get fucked up the ass and get their entire social life ruined. If not stay away from this game for as long as you can please. This is no longer a review this is a cry for help. Please help me"

15172,"If you enjoy playing for 10h just to lose it all in 10min, then this game is just for you. A massive nerve killer that will make you spend hours watching twitch or paying money for skins that no one else will see other than you or your team. A perfect game where you can die few seconds after joining. A game where you can spend hours building a base just to be 1 pr 2 rockets more expensive just for it to be destroyed while your offline. A game that you will play all night without sleep just to protect your base, but still the 2min that you walk off your chair are the ones that some one attacks you. A game where you can lose your best kit to a bunch of naked spear wielding randoms.

But over all its a great game! (should play it 100%)"
15173,so bad
15174,If you have a VAC BAN under 100 days since it happened i wouldn't recommend you get this game since most servers need VAC BANS over 90-100 days since it happened so you are able to play

15310,"I have a love hate relationship with this game. Its one of if not, the most toxic game I've ever played. High risk, high reward type of game. You spawn in, get resources, build a base and either protect it or go and try to raid other people for their stuff. It's like minecraft factions but for beta males. Only thing this game has going for it is skins. Otherwise its a buggy, hacker filled, mess. This game will give you anger issues."
15311,it good
15312,"This game was not what I expected but also exactly what I expected.

I came into the game expecting toxicity, a bad community, etc. But that isn't where my bad review comes from.
The game's first impression to me was bad because it's a very demanding game, for one that come out in 2013. The game has had significant updates since then, but is nearly impossible to enjoy unless you play on the lowest possible GPU settings for a rather standard GPU type. 

Other than the poor optimization. The game suffers from a lack of character customization, unless you make another steam account to ""randomize"" a character. Very poor decision on the Dev's end. The lack of customization and the randomness of the player character model pushed me off of a game that honestly would be better with it than without. The game idea is fun, I got the game because the gameplay seemed really fun, and it can be.

I had to refund because lack of optimization and character customization. Maybe in the future I'll try Rust out again."
15313,really good game for sure play worth the money
15314,Can't have shit in detroit
15315,"Ive been watching people play rust on youtube.
then i finally got the game and downloaded it. at first its a little confusing becasue for new players that dont know the keys it doesent really do a walk through, but in the end i figured it all out and i do love the game to be able to finally play it.
great job on making the game more and more exciting"
15316,"idk
"
15317,"I think this game is quite fun!
Sometimes people are toxic but most people I have met inside of Rust have been really nice/kind especially with me being relatively new to the game!
I have gained a lot of knowledge and friendships due to this game and I think other people could do the same!
Definitely worth the money if your PC and budget can handle it though!!"

15358,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
15359,i give one rule in this game ( in rust don't trust and just be an asshole ) and you will be happy
15360,10/10 racism

15366,its good
15367,FUN
15368,"i like how intensive this game theres alot to like but the more things to know about toxic players so be ready for things people will offline raid you as there to scared to do it online if you mess with someone they will always bag someone in, some cheaters takes ages to get banned and you need to play every day to able to come back to something everyday"
15369,i love thissss gameee so much
15370,"Worst game ever, the game would be perfect if it weren't for the f slow loading screens
not gonna talk about the server loading which takes hours on HDD even the freaking game takes +5 mins to load into the menu itself.

actual playtime wouldn't reach 3 hours max."
15371,get murdered by bumsweats
15372,yes
15373,ive been banned for being racist
15374,"Like many other review, I agree there are too many griefers for sure. Because of the map design, anyone acn just camp the spawn beaches are murder new joiners non-stop if they want, preventing anyone from making any progress on the map.

The fundamental flaw in the gameplay is that you can't be a casual player. You need to have an absurd amount of time to devote to a server join, or else you'll just get constantly raided."
15375,great game cant be bored. would recomend
15376,"hi

15390,amazing a tad toxic but highly recomended
15391,"I have a love hate relationship with this game, at times I love it and others it makes me want to punch a whole through my monitor but overall its a great experience. It will also consume your life for a short period until you realize the amount of responsibility's your ignore so you can get that phat loot."
15392,"If you are looking for a survival game that feels like a kick to your balls every time you log on to find your shit 
raided and hours of work gone, this is your game.  I can't be on this game 24/7 to protect my shit.  And just when I think I'm figuring it out, I come back to yet again, everything gone, starting from square one.  I really wish I didn't waste my money on this game."

15420,"Игроки:
Игроки в Rust встречаются разные. Большинство, конечно, будут против Вас, но если Вам удастся найти друга по выживанию, то добывать, сражаться, выживать будет намного легче. Но доверие друга надо еще заслужить. Здесь, игрок едва завидев Вас, либо убежит, либо попытается атаковать. Иногда они сами идут к Вам на встречу и предлагают мир, после чего Вы можете вместе обустраиваться или же охотиться. Если вы новичок, то смотрите видео гайд. по Rust, ведь игроки более опытные даже Вам не помогут, у них своих дел по горло. Однако встречаются и хорошие люди, которые с радостью отдают Вам необходимое. Таких игроков очень мало, всего около 10 %, а ведь на одном сервере от 150 до 750 человек. Только одни игроки заставляют тебя играть в это игру, это шедевр!!!"

15472,"Wanna Know My Review on this game?
[b] Pros: [/b] 
1 - Game play is fun.
2- easy to understand whats happening and play
[b] Cons: [/b]
1- map is really small, U can cross the map in 10 min , while in game such as DayZ it will took U 30 min at least to cross the map
2- geared player every where you cannot even play as fresh spawn always some Russian player KOS, every one are aggressive no matter U are fresh spawn, some one see U, U are dead xD
3- you cannot learn to play while on populated server.
4- Also lot's of toxic player, literally faced some one whom had downed some one and was telling him that she is going to be his sex slave ://// - actually WTF
5- because of the bad map design you cannot find any where safe in case of learning to play or enjoy the game, always need to be ready and KOS because every one wanna kill U no matter fresh spawn...

"" They should be considering changing map size and put some looting rules such High loot area and low loot, make north or south spawn area and than more get far from spawn area better loot U get, in this case players whom wanna find better loot and high gear for fighting will need to travel far from spawn area rather than just camping freshies !!-

overall, DayZ is much much much better than this game, more realistic game play and also more Mature  player...
played DayZ for 1600H and had lots of great time,
played Rust for 4H not even was able to walk, spawn and some one was trying to kill me with rock and later faced some KOS players with AR guns..."

15639,cant do shit in this game i hate it
15640,good game toxic doe
15641,Totally recommended. No other comment needed.
15642,a very fun survival game
15643,This game is honestly ass The servers are all shit and the whole playerbase is toxic as shit still gonna keep playing it tho wouldnt reccomend u purchase it unless you want hours of getting pissed of at annoying mfs or loosing hours of work
15644,this game makes me wanna kill myself on a day to day but yet i still play and put my dick on facepunchs lips.
15645,fun
15646,Very nice idea. Very nice implementation. It is not REALISTIC at all as you cannot close your playing session under penalty of loosing everything you have. It is like having a very demanding job. There are other PvPs where death is not catastrophic. You die and respawn as full fledged player. It is a pity as the game is really good.
15647,nice
15648,why do so many australians play this game?

15670,Great game. 100% recomend it.
15671,This game is insanely fun depending on how lucky you are with who you play against. Its fun because there is so much to do and there is never something you cant do. And even if you get raided its still fun to restart and try to get back!

15688,Nice game
15689,"Rust is a great game, has some very good mechanics, I have played with friends and by myself and is every enjoyable. So why are you asking why I am not reccomending it? The fucking water breathing system, only 3 seconds for holding breath underwater and you lost like 30hp every second after that. It is the most abosulute shit mechnanic, I have ever seen. Either the devs fixs this or deal with that absoulte of a garbage mechanic. Straight bs"
15690,really awesome game with a lot of features to learn. love it
15691,Good
15692,gud game
15693,SHIT GAME. Crashes everytime I open it. Even google chrome dinosaur game can run better
15694,"I played this game for a few hours and then asked for a refund. It appears to be an excellent multiplayer game for those who enjoy being slaughtered as a newbie by existing players who likely were slaughtered many times before finally gained an upper hand or who perhaps were able to join a gang of others for mutual self-preservation. In that regard, the game is probably very much like what a post-apocalyptic world would really be like with immoral predators at every turn in an eat-or-be-eaten environment. It's principally for this reason that I rarely ever play multiplayer games with strangers. It really looked llike an excllent game with best-in-class missions, etc. but it is most definitely not for single player, casual city-building/architecting wannabes (like me)."
15695,very good
15696,"black ops survival, pathetic recoil update :/"
15697,if you want to see people terrorist would be scared of play this game
15698,"It's fun , when you are new just join PVE (Player vs Env) and learn stuff. If you directly join normal server you are just gonna get killed"
15699,"one problem that really made me hate the game is that there is naked charecters and thats not appropriate

Its kinda like Minecraft but better cause you've got guns in rust and disco music lol."
15715,very relaxing and mindful experience 11/10
15716,Gud game but fucking bear
15717, o
15718,"I'd been wanting to play this for a while. It's fun on most accounts, so long as you're unfazed by innevitable gear loss, losing it all or gamers being GaMeRs.
I would recommend it normally, but if I'd realized ahead of time that the ""Arctic Pack"" skin going for around $17AUD would get you a modified hazmat instead of a cosmetic item, that let's you survive in snow biomes with the most negligible of drawbacks compared to the normal hazmat, in a PVP game - I'd have refunded this and bought something else on sale instead.
Buyer's remorse ahoy, kinda. Guess a no will have to do until skins become skins again."

15745,"How the Trailer make it seem:
- Great Survival Game
- Wide Open World
- Scenic Adventures

What it's actually like:
- From your Spawnpoint you can already see 18 different bases. Shots from 5 directions. You try to find out how to craft an axe and get mowed down by assault rifles after which you will be mocked by 13 year olds. Rinse Repeat.

I'll pass."

15786,"I am Losing My Marbles.

If you like hearing 12 year olds scream every slur imaginable while destroying all of your hours of hard work.
Then this is a game for you.

Also your grass privileges automatically expire the second you purchase so please do not make the same mistake the rest of us did.

15807,"Its like playing depression... 
You start your life and hope for the best just to be killed by a 12 year old yelling the n word.. then you do it again and again, spawning and dying slowly putting things down and slowly progressing forward.. 
Just to go to bed and get raided by 12 year olds who dont have lives.... 
Then the server wipes and you do it again.. depression"

15835,nice
15836,Yes
15837,fun
15838,"Definitely a steep learning curve, base building, monument knowledge, etc. but is quite fun. 
I started after they updated combat so can't really comment on that"
15839,Game is so toxic. Only the toxic survive though.
15840,yeessssss

15852,"its a fun open game 
"
15853,This game will hurt your mental stability.
15854,we like rust we like rust we like rust we like rust we like rust
15855,"I thought Rust was a cool game, not too difficult and begginer friendly. I watched so many videos and I loved it. But when I got it the first thing I noticed is that the loadings are endless, not even GTA. As soon as I spawned I didn't know what to do, every animal seems to be possessed by the devil who chase you halfway through the map at the cost of killing you. Each area is radioactive even in Chernobyl its better. The game does not explain a fu4k. Where to find food, how to understand crafting, let's say that when you buy Rust, Facepunch tells you HaH tHatS n0t mY pRobLem gOod lUck.."
15856,very cool
15857,yn
15858,i like it
15859,would be nice if i could ever even open the game
15860,killed somebody with a shotgun made from plumbing equipment 10/10
15861,"racism 
11/10"
15862,fun
15863,"You'll die, a lot.  However, that's part of the game. Embrace that fact, and endure in learning this game. Be friendly even when getting killed, and don't whine. Eventually you'll connect with others and roll up into a group. That's when things really kick off.

I describe this game as high highs, and low lows. It's addicting, like all great games.

"
15864,"definition of pain and sorrow 
8/10 definite cop"
15865,"EXCELLENT SURVIVAL GAME. SIMILAR TO FALLOUT EXCEPT YOU CAN FORM A TEAM AND ITS A LOT MORE CHALLENGING AND FUN! i LOVE THAT THIS IS PvP AND NOT A PROGRAMMED RPG. ITS A WIDE OPEN WORLD YOU GET TO EXPLORE AND FOR A GAME, IT IS THE CLOSEST TO REALITY I'VE SEEN!"
15866,"It's a very fun game, particularly if you play with friends. The biggest problem is that the tutorial is very short and unhelpful. Once you understand how everything works, you can have some great moments though."
15867,very good game
15868,One of the best survival game if you have a lot of free time
15869,"i got false banned
"
15870,"it ruined my life, 9/10"
15871,very good get to twerk on teamates
15872,"if you are very sensitive i wouldnt recommend this game as for it can be very homosexuel racist and etc but if you dont care about those things then get it. it is worth 40$ you can do so much on all of the servers that range from pve to even roleplaying. yea roleplaying dont excpect that from a game thats about killing. the moded section is definetiely wild in the best way possible from 2x to 1,000,000x or if ya like vanilla gameplay just go to the vanilla section and i have yet to explore the community section! you can do so many things with power. from solar panels to windmills from 2x2 to compounds. i reallly would recomend this game to many and i already have cause it is amazing!"
15873,good
15874,טים ביצים
15875,it's funny as hell with friends lol
15876,s fda;lkjfdsa j
15877,buy if u are willing to  completely give up on your real life and are ready to break your table or monitor.
15878,As long as the admins arent a bunch of bitches the games decent
15879,Games is great. Can be very brutal but you just need to find a good server and still after that trust no one. Everyone and everything is after you. So far 41H have pass by really  quickly.
15880,game good
15881,rock
15882,no.

15898,"this is an amazing game and really fun game it is really addicting and i love its so competitive
"
15899,Fun game to play with friends.
15900,Rust is fun .. but the old Rust was way better
15901,this game is the best game i think i have ever played the reason for that is because there are so many things to do and the new update made it really fun and made it alot more fair and it made this game really fun
15902,"its good
"
15903,"ruins ur brain functions
"
15904,"It's a very fun game to play, it can get stressful but if you just do what you like then it can be very fun. Some words of caution, the game's community is very toxic and playing rust will require a certain amount of dedication. Something to keep in mind is that It's just a game though."
15905,"i no longer get any joy from this game. the latest update made it even worse. they ruined the recoil and the gun sounds are waaayy out of place. rip ak recoil, it was fun while it lasted"
15906,Hard
15907,"Didn't think I would like this game, but it's addicting as hell"
15908,im new to rust but im loving it good game so far
15909,Its super hard by you self early game however as you learn how things work you can make progress! Don't trust anyone everyone is the enemy!
15910,It's very fun. Escpecially when playing with friends.
15911,get good lol
15912,Don't do it!
15913,"this game is so toxic, i like it"
15914,caxx<
15915,"bought the game and went and played it all i remeber from the start off the game that i got called a N***** over and over and they all camped my base i dont remeber much apart from taking on the live style by going to random bases on the beach door camp them and screem N***** over and over 


Great game recamend"
15916,yes very fun game but you need a good pc to run it with good fps and no freezeing. :) (:
15917,"is good, very nice, much wow, many aweseomes, multiple not bheds and alot of fuck you moments
"
15918,good game
15919,fun and entertaining and easy to play with freinds
15920,Combat update ruined game
15921,Hobo simulator
15922,This game suffers a case of an amazing game but its major flaw is the community. For most games this wouldn't matter but for a game that you can only play multiplayer it can ruin the experience. The community is well known for being toxic and I 100% agree with that.
15923,I say No because the game non stop crashes and the loading menu is kinda buggy and when the game load it crash automatically.
15924,good
15925,funni rst rrage morons i nokill nobs
15926,VERY SLOW OPENING UNTIL YOU HAVE THE GAME ITS TAKE YEARS TO OPEN
15927,best game!

15929,"great game

15933,Filled with Russians yelling racial slurs

15935,-
15936,"So far, this game is fun but it takes an HOUR AND A HALF to load
I have played for about 30 minutes and already am denied a refund becuase of the 2 hour limit
They need to improve the load times for this game because it takes a really long time to load up every time
its about a ten minute wait to get into the main screen of the game and a 30-45 minute wait to load into the world

Overall the game is super fun though
"
15937,"dog poop update, go back to normal tbh"
15938,"blood for the blood god.

15944,"Takes ages to run, players are utter asshats, running your own server to get away from the asshats takes so long and is such a pain in the arse that I've given up.  Screw this game. 0 stars. Avoid."
15945,its a good game and it smells like cheese
15946,for the first three hours of this game i have became a rasit anf homophobic this game was worth the 40$ dollors and when i wake up to my base gone i would love to break things
15947,"when p2 was better than AK. Elite era of this game. Nothing else is like this game though, good for when you need to be un-humbled and turn into a piece of shit. 10/10"
15948,"i am bad at this game. but instead of taking accountability and improving my skills, i will blame the game instead"
15949,"Fun!
"
15950,"Vedy god game, i injoy it vedy mych"
15951,pefect
15952,i wake up i go to the store i buy rust i install rust i get a python and kill 10 people and then i get a tommy and i kill 15 people i go home and play rust
15953,dont play the game its really addictive and its good mentally to grind
15954,+rep
15955,"Addicting game that will make you stay up all night building, pvping, farming and more."
15956,"Amazing game with constant updates and regular new content. This is a rabbit hole you can fall hundreds or thousands of hours into if you can handle the emotions. This game is one hundred percent: grab as many friends as you can, build a sand castle, knock over everyone else's sand castle, rinse and repeat. The player base is a petri dish of humanity, the best and the worst and its a glorious thing. Wipes are usually every week with blueprint wipes once a month. You would think it would get boring and it can if you stay to yourself just building little 2x2 shacks on the beach but if you get a little group together of even 2 or 3 friends every week is like a fresh start with endless potential and wipe day is one of the things you actually look forward to."
15957,yes. just yes.
15958,i keep crashing
15959,very good
15960,"good game
"
15961,"There's really just nothing to do. Feels like playing an incredibly slow burn battle royale with no payoff, where you take 20 hours to grind resources & find gear to then lose it while you're working, studying, or sleeping."
15962,3.33/5
15963,"This game brings lots of fun and entertainment. Solo may be rough sometimes but you meet actually friendly people every now and then and it's wonderful. And the view? Amazing, the graphics are some of the best I've ever seen. The gameplay is smooth and the idea of the game is brilliant. If your looking for a nice relaxing game with a little bit of spice and action, this game is perfect. I will still continue to play this game."
15964,made me fuck my dog. Can't recommend.
15965,"Its a good game, nice concept and kinda addicting. 
But honestly i would've liked if the game was more enhanced in terms of functionality and smoothness.. 
also its 11gb(download) which for some people including me doesn't feel right, [DEVELOPERS plz] make it like 25-30gb atleast by improving stuff adding more things just overall making it run smoother and improving servers as well. This is what i hope for the future of rust ;for the betterment ofc:  .,None the less ,i enjoy the game very much. 8.5/10 worth it"

15992,good
15993,"I've spent more time staring at the main menu loading screen and the server loading screen combined. I literally have more hours poured into this game by staring at menus and other screens than actually playing the game.
I don't understand what it is, I've tried plenty of tutorials trying to get something to work. Making the graphics and other settings all the way low (even though I have a pretty good graphics processor and cpu and plenty of open storage), but nothing seems to cut the 45 minute - 3 hour wait time to even see what the game looks like.
Like all I've done is walk my naked body a few steps and get to a tree only for the game to refresh and set me back at the server loading screen. It's genuinely killed my mental for this game, or my day/night in general."
15994,i like it
15995,ooo
15996,good game
15997,good game mid people
15998,"i like it
"
15999,"So, even though I had door campers my first time playing, I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far. I do wish it didn't lock you into a random gender based on your steam ID. Would like there to be more available looting abilities, ie breaking rundown vehicles apart, trash can looting, cash register looting, etc. Definitely a game I am going to keep playing. Crafting in of itself pretty decent, and depending on what server you choose, some resources are more abundant than others, I'm looking at you stone and animal spawn points.

the only real con I can see with this game, are the door camping. That's pretty much it."

16016,"If you have friends with over 50 hours playing this game that can you show you the ropes and you're able to dedicate multiple hours to each session, then buy this game.

If you don't have friends this game will be extremely brutal and unforgiving."

16018,game has the best community. love being yelled at by racists
16019,not very good
16020,"After playing this game for years it has now turned into absolute garbage, their is 0 skill required to play this game, they change recoil patterns to help people with 0 iq and brain power. only reason they changed the recoil is for stupid streamers with MC Donalds haircuts and enough fat on them to supply a village. #SaveBeamersNotStreamers"

16028,"I have become sleep deprived, haven't seen the sun in over a week, all to keep my base from getting raided before the server wipes. I have wasted so much of my life that my friends, well the people who were my friends have cast me away. Every day that I play this game brings me one step closer to becoming a zombie. Therefore I highly recommend this game to everyone. I don't want to be the only one suffering. So please, play this game."

16060,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

16061,"very racist for the most of it but otherwise, veri nice"
16062,YOU'LL HAVE A BLAST!
16063,"The basic concept is:
-grind for 6 hours straight
-Build a massive base
-log off at 2am
-Wake up at 11am and log on
-Realise entire base is gone
-Repeat

This is somehow very fun after repeating 40 times."

"
16074,THIS GAME IS SO FUN TO PLAY WITH FREINDS ITS A GOOD SURVIVAL GAME I RECOMEND IT
16075,"First experience:
Spawned in with mate (B), to meet up with a more experienced mate (C). Was night time and couldn't see a thing.
I tried to swim to mate C, and almost froze to death.
Mate B got eaten by a bear and re-spawned.
I went up a hill where it was snowy, and almost froze to death.
Mate B fell down a hill and re-spawned.
I got really hungry and almost starved to death.
Mate B was second guessing his purchasing decision.
I found a horse and rode to mate C when he made a little base and mate B finally made it.
Mate D joined and drew a childish yet hilarious picture on the outside of the base.

The next day was a server wipe.

I rate it: 7 hemp seeds out of 10 chicken bones."
16076,Awesome endless fun. whole reason i bought a PC

16087,"I love the games aesthetic, I wish they didn't screw up the Mp5's spray pattern in the most recent update.
But this game is a hell of a lot of fun! BEWARE OF THE CHINESE ZERGS they are pathetic."
16088,"How To Get A Fast Start In The Wipe
1-Grab A Rock And Run. Spawn beach is infested with clueless NPCs chasing each other around the map. ...
Collect Wood, Stone, Hemp, and Food. ...
Every Essential Item To Craft. ...
Build A Sensible First Base maybe 2 by 1. ...
Move Out And Loot and get scrap and craft a work bench ( you can craft a lot of things with it). ...
Start Progressing. ...
PVP Later and kill farmers to get a lot of loot In The Wipe.
have fun i hope you enjoy the game"
16089,dont plan on only playing 2 or 3 hours

16115,"You cannot edit or change your character. It is randomized and locked to your Steam ID.

My theory is devs forced this is eliminate all the race war tendencies or just to force their weird ideology.

If you like to RP and customize your char, this is not your game."
16116,"Been playing this on and off throughout the years and this is my current opinion on the game.

~ System requirements ~
Even with most settings turned to low, this game makes my GTX 970 cry and it eats more RAM than Chrome with an unethical amount of tabs does. 

~ Performance ~
Even with the game on a fast M.2 SSD and a 5820k running at 4.2 GHz, loading the contents of a given large vanilla map is painstakingly long. We're talking 4-6 minutes. Like mentioned earlier, if you even want to consider running this game with moderate quality you need a pretty beefy computer.

~ Content ~
Base building is really fun. There's some really wacky stuff you can do like multi-TC and floor/wall stacking.

Big plus for all of the updates this game receives. There's so many cool things like modular cars, snowmobiles, submarines and so on.

There's tons of monuments to do but the current state of the scientist AI makes fighting them relatively boring. In short, they're fairly retarded. Take oil rig for example. As soon as one lays their eyes on you, you can just hide behind a box and they'll know exactly where you are no matter where you go, chase you down and you can just exploit this to immediately gun them down as they become visible before they barely get a chance of doing anything against you. The elites you can just tag them all and hop behind a tank. They'll all pile up strafing endlessly and two F1 grenades will kill them all.

~ PvP and raiding ~
Invalid projectiles is one of the most infuriating causes of a lost fight, and it happens VERY often. 

The new recoil change makes gun play more realistic as people who had sat for days practicing a spray pattern can no longer beam people with an MP5 from 150m or more. The MP5 among other weapons are not supposed to be long ranged weapons, that's what we have DMRs and snipers for.

Raiding isn't really in a good spot. Massive clan bases aside, if you even attempt to raid someone with honeycombing, there's a very high chance they're immediately going to:

a) Upgrade the core to armored, which they usually cannot sustain causing the base to begin decaying
b) Wall off and start despawning loot
c) Both a) and b)

~ Overall opinion ~
Due to the overall performance of the game, alongside AI issues and lame experiences attempting to raid player bases, I can't really recommend the game."

I bought several planning to give away as gifts...so glad I took the time to play some of it before gifting. Could have been a disaster! Full of hateful alt-right propaganda and fundamentalist type religious beliefs. I am a firm believer of protecting our 1st Amendment rights, but disguising this level of hatefulness under the pretense of humor is not appreciated. If I could rate this zero stars, I would!

16177,"I'm going to post this so people can be wary. DON'T GET THIS GAME, and if you do make sure to not play over 2 hours unless you really like it. The game is super slow on low end computers and takes very long to load (not including queues), which I didn't know and made the mistake of waiting like 7 hours to play for like 1 hour. The game is also pretty toxic but the gameplay is alright. I am sad steam cant refund even though I haven't actually ""played"" for 2 hours."
16178,"I watched a few vids on the game and waited for it to go on sale.  the vids are better then playing the actual game.  
First.  There is no story mode.  the devs wanted it to be open ended and you could come up with what ever you wanted, which is just lazy.  Most people love a good story/mystery, not happening here.
Second.  There are no ""boss"" fights, pretty much just you against nature with pvp thrown in.  thats it....Call of Duty with Zombies is better than this.
Third, and really the worst part, the devs do a server wipe from time to time and removes all of your buildings, so you have to start all over.....

I uninstalled, just watch the funny vids instead.

Props to Facepunch for taking such good care of the game with their monthly updates and sick cinematic trailers."

16191,"Rust is a game that expects an unreasonable amount of time from players, to farm, to craft, to build a base. After which what will most likely happen to you is a more experienced player or a larger group will kill you and erase all of that progress. Rust is a game designed from the ground up to be as tedious and frustrating as possible. For the most part, unless you are able to find a vehicle and not have it stolen immediately, the entire map will be a giant walking sim. 

To succeed in this game, you need to have an insane tolerance to frustration. In the sense that you need to have the will to continually waste days of time in order to have the amount of fun you can have immediately in many other games. 

I have played rust for over 500 hours over all of my steam accounts, and it has been a constant cycle of slowly gaining resources, losing it all, and deciding that i was not about to stay up another 4 hours to get it all back. Almost none of your standard FPS experience will carry over to rust. I can clear an entire floor of demons in seconds in DOOM Eternal, however in rust you're more likely to be standing still, aiming down sights, hoping the sun is not in your eyes, it's not too dark to shoot, and that the guy who is gunning you down from half a mile away doesn't have a friend to finish you off if you're lucky enough to kill the first. 

Overall, like real life, Rust is not a fair game. Which for many people like myself, is not what we want from an escape from reality."
16192,I cant even play it it crashes on startup i tried everything i can it just wont start
16193,change mind game good
16194,"Brutal and addictive game that you will hate and keep playing for a very long time. good for casual and extreme players... if you can handle your frustration, this game is amazing."
16195,"its a good game, if your good at pvp then i recommend it, its very easy to learn the mechanics and your key binds and the recoil isn't hard to learn and even master

16223,BEANS are good
16224,"Rust, its a survival game and you need to grind for multipule hours to get far into the game but in the end it turns out worth it"
16225,"Rust is the kind of game that will make you laugh, cry, and rage all in the span of a few minutes. It's a game that is constantly surprising, and always keeps you on your toes. There is no other game quite like it, and it's this uniqueness that makes Rust so special.It is a brutal, unforgiving game that takes no prisoners. It's a survival game that throws you in the deep end and doesn't let up until you either die or manage to eke out a victory. The game is tough but fair, and it's this balance that makes Rust so addictive. The game world is a hostile place, and you need to be prepared for anything if you want to survive. The best way to do this is to team up with other players, as the game is much easier when you have friends to watch your back. But be warned – even your allies can turn on you in Rust, and betrayal is commonplace. This is a game that will push you to your limits, and it's all the better for it."
16226,its preaty cool its so cool its cool
16227,so fun worth it
16228,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now.

This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
16229,Best game ive played so far
16230,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
16231,"Recoil change fucked the game. Now instead of naked double barrels in bushes I have to deal with naked tommies in bushes and get absolutely beamed in a full metal ak before I can even react. Fuck off with the aim cone and letting bad players become absolute beamers with fucking T2 weapons when I snowballed to AK and their tommy is the more meta weapon to go out with. What the fuck is the point of roaming or doing anything when you get rolled up on by 8 groups of tommy grubs and hella nakeds picking up their guns and shooting the tommy for the first time but quad headshotting you. Fuck off facepunch this update was awful.

P.S. Game is hella laggy now."

16243,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

16252,"Back in my day, making the jump puzzle at dome separated those who had skill and those who did not.

10/10 experience, there is no other FPS game that lets you approach a problem in so many ways.

That being said, this game teaches you to look on the bright side. It will remind you of what disappointment is. It will completely relate itself to your pace of problem-solving and what you consider as an end goal, considering there is no objective. 

If the game were to magically make performance reach over 200fps on high quality it would get a 20/10. That's two whole games in one."

16271,"1859 hours on the game. Yes, I have no life. lol. I have been playing it waaay back since it first came out, like long before the overhaul and everything and truly this beauty has come a long way. To date out of my 88 games, this is my favorite. I could talk about all the things you can do in the game, unique experiences but I will leave that for others to discover. All I can really say is Rust is a golden game, official servers, community and my favorite, modded. ;P So much endless fun, so much potential and so much to always do. On a twig scale, I give this over 9000 sheet metal. xD"
16272,PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE. IT TAKES UP ALL YOUR TIME AND YOUR MOM WILL YELL AT YOU CONSTANTLY FOR ALL THE PEE BOTTLES THAT YOU WILL COLLECT WHILE WAITING FOR A RAID THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN
16273,"This game sucks 
10/10"
16274,"Solo/Primitive game-play needs a significant overhaul if I'm ever going to play this again, this isn't Rust anymore; it's base building Call of Doody with sub-features. This game also needs a new take on moderation. We shouldn't have to worry so much about people being offensive as much as they are at being hackers. 

Offensive material is subjective, it gets people banned and excommunicated for no reason, it's used as a manipulation tactic to ruin someone else's weeks worth of work. It's an unnecessary  waste of time and resources trying to control other peoples speech, actions or behavior outside of hacking. They need to implement a filter setting for offensive/politically correct chat formats that people can choose for themselves in game instead of ruining someone else's game that they paid for, or for their patronage on servers they choose to support. 

They also need to address the fact that this isn't a game for sensitive people, if your sensitive go play Minecraft. This game is meant for adults, with adult content, literally spawning butt-naked on a beach with boobs, buttocks, vagina, and penis all hanging out. So enough with the 'no this, and no that' and let people enjoy the game in it's entirety. What is the mantra we always hear when we get squatted on by a corn crunching naked with a tommy? ""It's Rust, don't cry."" 

I don't play Rust to be babysat, if I wanted my mommy to monitor my video games I wouldn't let her see one inch of Rust. That is just a fact. If Rust isn't something you'd show your grandma or grandpa, maybe your little nephew or perhaps even your parents. Then maybe FacePunch shouldn't give a damn what you say and do in Rust just as long as you aren't a dirty rat hacker. 

When the communists are finally gone, and they finally do away with their ""communist standards."" When they are ejected or quit cause of the incessant whining and prattle of butt-hurt cries from actual children. Then I'll play this game again, then I'll give it one more go.

Until then, fuck off FacePunch."
16275,AMAZING GAME! The only bad thing I have to say about it is that sometimes you can spend days/weeks building your base up and boom/materials/etc only to have some cheaters come in and destroy all your stuff and take everything you have. That really sucks. If they can fix that problem this game is hands down one of the best I have ever played.
16276,its good
16277,its such a fun game recommend
16278,"PSA: I have 4000 more hours on other accounts, and I started playing in 2019. 
    This game still has the potential to be great, but it has lost the magic spark somewhere along the line. Gunplay is flipping a coin to see who wins, and guns don't have a well defined role in the gameplay and progression at all. 
    I think the downward trend I see is mainly caused by the framework of monthly content updates. The dev team is fantastic, and listens well, but the outline of outputting new content every single month fosters a dynamic of creating and adding things to the game that don't align with its existing features and themes. 
    Given the complex nature of gameplay in Rust, any updates will massively affect gameplay, and a month just isn't enough time to examine whether the impact an otherwise beneficial update will have on the game. At the same time, Rust is a game of change, and these monthly updates are without a doubt what has kept it alive over the years. As players and metas settle, the game loses its uniqueness, its unpredictability that made me and many others love it. 
    I think that Rust is a game too big for Facepunch. They are a fantastic team, but the sheer magnitude and maintenance required guarantees that something will be missing each update. This isn't about player count, or codebase. It's about the infinitely complex nature of a game like Rust. Regular updates and new content are both instrumental to maintaining the most unique aspect of the game (its inherent chaos and unpredictability) AND harmful to the complex mechanics that make up the gameplay itself.
    Every content update, every item added, will affect different group sizes, player types, metas, and ideas separately. This is both the thing that has kept Rust alive, and the thing in my opinion killing it. It's impossible to strike that balance of constant change in the aspects listed above, while also ensuring it doesn't become unbalanced where a change of one type is overweighted. My final review, my summative statement is this: Rust is a fantastic game that you will inevitably grow to dislike."
16279,Worst game ever
16280,o
16281,This game is shit please dont buy it
16282,This game is not for everyone. That includes me. The combat is some of the best you are going to get trust me. In a situation where you are one of the last ones alive going to any major monument and winning or losing what you've spent the last hour (if you are not in a group 6+) farming you are going to be attached to your equipment. While holding your emotion hostage makes for great game-play because your adrenaline going through the roof every time you are doing anything major it makes for a pretty bad experience overall. That is because everything else about this game is mediocre to bad. The community is toxic imagine black ops lobbies where any kid will bust out the hard r at anytime. The graphics are pretty realistic and good if you own a computer that cost more than 2000 dollars or else the game will run like crap. The game-play when you are not raiding (notice defending a raid isn't mentioned for later) or doing a major monuments is pretty boring. As it is mostly building your base or farming and hoping to sweet Jesus that you don't get polled up on by 3+ people because in most cases it means you are losing that thing you've just farmed for the last 20 minutes or so. Now it is time to mention getting raided. I've got to say I only experienced it once as it only has happen when I am on the game once because most of the people that play rust are sissies that have no life or are built different. Imagine this scenario you've done really well this wipe everything gone great. You've won almost every fight and you did your monuments and it went great better hope your friends don't have anything planned tomorrow because if they do you are getting offline raided (which means you are losing everything). I kid you not there have been at least 2 wipes (stopped caring eventually) where our group are all offline for like 2 hours and in between those hours we get offline raided. It's part of the game so learn to not get upset about it if you are into the game. Now to conclude the review. Throughout my review I have constantly mentioned time and that is important because the main reason why I don't recommend Rust is that Rust is not a game it's a job and a lifestyle unless you plan on doing nothing do not play this game or you are in for a bad time (as everyone is better than you).

16301,I decided to log in for the first time in months because I noticed they changed the recoil and combat so I wanted to check it out. And turns out THEY SHAT ON THE ENTIRE SKILL BASED SYSTEM AND TURNED IT INTO THE LEAST SKILLED RECOIL SYSTEM IVE EVER SEEN IN A GAME LIKE THIS. I have player for thousands of hours on my old account and trained with the AK for a good portion of them and I know many others have done similar things and they have just shat on those combined thousands of hours of training for a more welcoming system overall fuck facepunch fuck the new recoil and fuck this game.
16302,"its good, new update is weird
"
16303,"this game is fun with friends but if your alone its annoying ass hell and there is always ""those people"""
16304,"Rust is my favorite game!!  The dev's have done an amazing job with the graphics, the music, the sounds, and almost everything else. I am floored by how beautiful this game is!! Loving all the updates as well!! They have come a long way. I was a beta player and I can tell ya when the updates come out I am ready for the next wipe! 

If you want to be ruthless and try to take on clans, duos or solos and claim  their loot for your own, kill your enemies and  monopolize an area, maybe you just want to take on the NPC's, grab your friends and hop on Rust. I promise you will not be disappointed!!! 

PvP and PvE platforms, vanilla and modded. 

My only complaint to date (I've been playing 5 years) is I don't like how I cannot choose and customize my own avatar though. I would love to be able to do this."

16351,"This is the best survival game I have played in years! By the way, if you buy this game, even if you think your PC is good you will probably get 50-60 FPS with default settings. IF you have recently purchased a new GPU, CPU, and/or graphics card, you should have better FPS with default settings. One more thing, I recommend purchasing Crosshair X ($3-$5) if you buy Rust. Crosshair X just lets you have some custom crosshairs that you can create yourself, or you can use the ones made by the community. I like using the yellow dot make by Kunfusion (Rust Developer). And thats all you need to know!"

16402,"Here is your Everyday Small Content Creators opinion.

Gameplay: 10/10: Getting Swamped by an army of 200 Nakeds at fresh wipe, absolutely inhuman.
Overall 9.5/10 Game. Between dying to animals and falling 2 feet and taking 13+ Damage, standing in a lift and getting ""Squished"" to death, I am proud to say this is the True Gaming Hardcore Parkour Experiance.

16464,"playing solo is hard at first, try playing a modded server with a low pop. Fresh wipe is when servers are the most difficult, i recommend playing with a group if you wanna play on vanilla. it's a cycle of getting loot, but it's also a long and hard painful process of dying over and over. don't give up right away keep trying new things."
16465,"rust is very fun but hard and sometimes a pain, just stick to no kos severs and you will enjoy a more casual experience."

Walked to the street and broke barrels with my rock

Hear somebody screaming racists slurs

Run up to them

Told me to follow them into their base

Looked around and saw badely drawn pictures of cocks

They pull Ak-47's on me and said ""drop your loot""

I gave them everything and ran out of their base

They start firing rounds at me

As i jump and zig zag through incendiary bullets

I ran home and bought rust

11/10 would play again"

I will play more cause again..game is free, even if I like it im still gonna keep the negative review, this game dont deserve good reviews, idc."
16490,Ok
16491,Easily one of my favorite games of all time. Spent so much time on it which will probably not be worth when I look back at it. At least I had a great time I suppose. Sadly though this is probably the most toxic game of all time and as a famous man said.  ¨𝒯𝒽𝒾𝓈 𝒾𝓈 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝒸𝑜𝓂𝓂𝓊𝓃𝒾𝓉𝓎¨
16492,ye
16493,"I am a 41 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 11 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Couldnt even build a base without getting killed. Base randomly despawning although it had 3 day upkeep and i got on a few hours after building it. Would not recommend this disgusting moldy chicken of a game."

16776,"Saved money to buy this game but can't even play the game cuz I have a Bloody mouse!
I always seen people play this game but i cant afford another mouse just cuz this is banned
is there anyway i can play with ma mouse or i need to request for a refund?
i would appreciate if i can refund and get the game for free. in this way i can get a new mouse and play"
16777,ok
16778,good
16779,is the best
16780,Whenever I'm contemplating suicide I get on this game to remind myself that this sucks way more than real life so I might as well keep living and blame all of my problems on this soul stealing game that makes me angrier than I get at my wife when she forgets to do the laundry before Sunday church. Dumb bitch I swear
16781,racism
16782,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
16783,good
16784,The game has fell off after the combat update. would rather shit the bed then play this again.

16788,"I spent around 30 mins loading into a server, only to get shot and called racial slurs
I tried to get the basic tools, only to get shot and called homophobic slurs
I managed to get some good gear, but got shot and called slurs
I shot a guy, and had slurs screamed at me
I got raided, and ended up shouting slurs into my microphone
As you can quite clearly tell, if you don't get called any slurs at all, you are playing it wrong

16800,"Such a great game, literally one of the best games ever, but as a solo you have two options: Suffer at the hands of zergs, clans, and teams, or spend hours grinding until you are a solo god. I have decided to spend hours grinding and it is making the game a better experience. Unless you want a game that will slowly suck away at your soul and make you question your will to live, don't play Rust. I wish I never heard about this game, cause once you start playing it no other game compares to the satisfaction you get from succeeding in this game. At the end of the day the devs did such a great job making this game but it does take its toll on you. I would only recommend this game to those you have a strong mental, or if you have hella friends who also want to grind hours and hours with you. I will not stop playing Rust but it has forever left its mark on me and my soul."

16802,Awesome

16808,no
16809,"You won't get ahead unless you sell your life to this game, but if you play more casually it can still be fun with friends."
16810,Although I think this game is truly wonderful and super enjoyable. I think that no one who wants to keep a semi-normal day life should buy this game. It destroys your sleep schedule as all you want to do is play rust. all. the. time.

16826,"This game is very toxic!! i have never in my life played such a toxic game, i could not get anywhere in the game as far as building a base or anything without getting killed and griefed every 5 seconds, i do not recommend this game."
16827,I liked it better ten years ago or so when it had zombies

16840,Really fun if you have a good team. Was really frustrating at first. but... it's got a charm to it. I have over 2k hours in valorant and 4k hours in apex and i can say this is incredibly competitive...... You need really fast reflexes and an understanding of the gun mechanics. I watched alot of youtube prior to even downloading this and it really paid off.
16841,"Game was good before the recent update. The game is no longer the same, instead of making important changes they removed the one aspect that made the game special. More cheaters then before, game is unstable and freezes frequently. Nothing to do with Pc specs, this game has always ran like hot garbage, but its worse off now."

16869,its a really good survival game personally believe its better than ark but just my opinion but I think you should by the game while is on sale because its a really good deal and even if its not on sale I would recommend still getting it you can also so play with your friends and get good and get a zurg and a compound and make the base of your dreams and it has a really nice game intro video and also good update videos but i would really recommend getting the gaming.

16959,"The game itself isn't bad, in fact it's actually quite fun, but it's hard to recommend because the community is easily the most toxic I've ever experienced. The building mechanics are interesting, and even normal competition between players and groups can be pretty fun too. If you can find a couple friends to play with it might be worth it, if not, probably just play something else with a community that's less hostile. Kill or be killed is fine enough, and I could accept people killing you for resources, but the lengths many players go to inflict suffering on others, with no personal benefit makes me think the game is mostly a haven for sadists and psychopaths."

17003,"Loved the game for past 2-3 years but lately devs made a lot of questionable decisions ruining whole experience for me. I rly liked that Rust was like a Dark Souls of the PC Shooter world. Sadly for past year devs added to many monuments and made it 2 ez to progress. Even when I'm playing full pop officials the map is empty for half the time due to players being able to run low risk, low reward tasks all the time. The last straw for me was the recoil change witch killed the last bit of fun i had in this game. They justified the change saying that the new recoil will bring new players to the servers but frankly that couldn't be further from the truth. Whole player base is declining in a rapid pace and devs are focused only on making new sales instead of keeping their current player base. If U'll check the Steam reviews u can clearly see that most new players stoped playing the game due to cheaters and huge loading times but They'd rather ignore it and gave in to few reddit kids crying about recoil being 2 hard. I rly loved Rust and had a blast playing it but after latest updates I'm pretty sure that it will never get back to the state of the game that I've fallen in love with. Mark my words, they are trying to make another Battlefield/COD type of game just to please 12 yo kids playing in 20 man zergs."

Overall, I think rust is a good game, its definitely an amazing game if you have a friend or friends to play with, but the community is a lil toxic. 9/10

17075,"With the latest recoil update game suddenly became more accessible to me as a player who has 20 years experience playing arenashooter games and never touched anything Recoil Base. This game just keeps growing and getting bigger and nothing shows it would go worse. Recoil update only hit players in the mid range, those who are still unexperienced in general combat orientation, but did sink thousands of hours into mindless UKN aim practicing. Top dogs will quickly adapt as their combat experience stays on and beginners will not even feel a thing with it."

17093,"good game

17094,"
this game is very time consuming but it gives a way to show your stratgy and if you like a lot of p v p then you would really like this game"
17095,"I am a 49 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

*300 hours at time of review*"
17115,w game
17116,Its very fun but the only thing is that it takes a while to join servers.
17117,This game is like like having a child you must care for it and protect it. But then it grows older and brakes your legs.
17118,"A total example of overcoming time, the game started out being terribly poorly optimized, for today it not only supports many players simultaneously, but also improves many aspects in terms of gameplay.
It is a game that I would recommend, but the bad part of this is when you start to incorporate content that slows down the meta-game, or that ruins the PvP experience (the main attraction of the game, in my opinion).
If you have hours to grind and a lot of patience for learning progression, play Rust.
"
17119,love the game depending on what server you play on but over all a really good game
17120,is not as fun at the start but the people in the game will just kill you bc they car there all ass hols     but i have 5h in so i have a lot to go
17121,"Men with rocks that are naked kill you. Then men that aren't naked with machine guns kill you. Then you kill a man with your rock. NOW YOU HAVE 2 ROCKS AND A MACHINE GUN SO YOU TAKE A BASE THEN YOU GET C4 THEN WITH THAT C4 YOUR RAID MORE BASES THAN SPAM THE CHAT SAYING YOU RUN THE SERVER!

17136,im actually rlly good so thats prob why i like it maybe?
17137,very fun game to play with friends
17138,"This isn't really the game's fault, it just wasn't at all what I thought it was when I purchased. I was expecting it to be like other survival games (Ark, Conan,  the Forest, etc). First of all you don't even get to choose what your character looks like. That's a real deal breaker for me. 

Secondly, I thought the game would be set up to cater to both PvE and PvP. There really is no PvE or any sort of official servers where the players fight against NPCs. I have no problem with PvP, I just don't want it in my survival games.

Last of all the official servers wipe all the time.  I play survival games for world-building and base-building. I don't have the time or the type of personality to spend my energy on a base just to have it destroyed by other players or wiped by the admin every 2 weeks.

I was shot in the head within 2 minutes of logging in. That's fine as that is PvP. However I was repeatedly killed on the starter beach, naked over and over before I could even get the map out. Not for me man."
17139,"I started playing this game in May of 2022. I bought it for my son and I to grow closer together. Not only did we grow closer together, we fell in love all over again, and not the love of a married couple or even a father and son. The love of 2 college kids that  met blackout at a frat party and couldn't make it back to either of their dorm rooms. The love of kneeling in the mulch in the next door neighbors yard."

17181,"This game is a wannabe ARK. It is poorly designed. movement is choppy, and riding horses is ridiculous. you cannot even select how you want your character to look.
This is pitiful. Wish I could get my money back, now I know why it is 50% off."

17186,love love this game
17187,"As a Noob in this game, it is very difficult to gain experience unless you like dying a LOT!  There isn't a single player option, they are all public servers.   If you have several friends to watch your back and allow you to develop, it is very possible to enjoy this game, but there are a lot of predators in this game who take great pleasure in taking out vulnerable players.   It is a very difficult thing to play for hours and to find you lost all of that investment in time . . . it is certainly not a game for everyone.
It does have a good research development tree to explore, and the survival aspects of the game are interesting, but it takes a bit to get the basics of the game down and to be proficient in the game. 
Generally, I would recommend to not waste your money on this game.  Fallout 76 is a superior game with a PVP option if that is your thing."
17188,very fum
17189,"not sure, need more hours to see if truly good"
17190,game bad

17193,"The game was at its peak with old recoil half of the streamers and people who voted on the change don""t even play it anymore and also fixing scripting has disabled the ability to get kills from more than 100 meters due to there terrible aim cone that they added. both accounts are added up to 5k hrs"

Every time I get basic resources and have the slightest hope of getting a base down I am killed immediately by some team of 2 with guns, roof camper, or a nail gun user. A real painful 3.5 hours of my life gone really. To top that off the its an extremely toxic environment."

17320,"The game itself isn't that fun, it is only fun when you are playing with friends. The only thing you need to worry about surviving against is players as nothing else is likely to kill you. The developers don't listen to the community so expect the game to change a lot for better or for worse."

even with optimizations"
17324,"Very fun w friends, you can make restaurant hehe"
17325,If you enjoy dying 100 times in a row to someone with a machine gun versus you with a stone and then starting over then this game is for you. The game is kinda fun but I feel like it's a waste of your time if you just wanna hop on and have fun.
17326,Amazing Game!
17327,it banned me and i dont know how to fix it
17328,"Hit tree, hit rock, grab hemp, kill players, build a home, kill more players, go to sleep... wake up to being offlined. Do it all again."
17329,"Great product, I bought this for my mother's new build house. I also bought a £10 signal tester. Downloaded an app which gave the direction of the transmitter (65k from Solihull) and started the install. Installed in the loft and it gave 2 green lights out of a possible 4, turned it towards the transmitter and I got 3 green lights (at home I have only 1 green light which gives a good signal). Finished the install and all done.
I was extremely sceptical about this product, based on the size of the unit and apparent ease... was also worried that I was asking a lot as 50ish miles from the transmitter was a big ask.
It did work straight out the box and in a loft. This saved hundreds of pounds in a pro install of an aeriel on the outside of the house. I tuned the TV and it found about 200 channels.
It does need power to work, I tapped a fuse spur in to a 6amp smoke alarm."
17330,"Imagine you have a loving family, couple of kids, nice home, plastic tits wife and you live a quiet life for like 20 years, the neighbours are nice and have a little dog named Percy that doesn't even bark. Then one day out of the blue a clan of 20+ people takeover the neighbours house, kill the family, kill Percy and start firing rockets up your arse until you blow up. Then you decide to start again in a different country and the cycle continues.

That's rust."

17348,lots of naked people
17349,very toxic
17350,very fun game bt can be hard for new players to have fun and get a good start. i reccomend starting on low pop servers. but when you start grinding it with firends it can be realley fun. I think there is are large variety on how to do things and it is very fun because there are so many things to do. A problem that comes to me as a tenager is it is very time consuming so sometimes you just dont have time for it.
17351,I want to be happy again

i now dont have a sleep schedual and im miserable :)"

17370,dont buy if u have a family or job
17371,game sucks
17372,"you know what, i came to rust expecting delay times. AND i TELL you now this game going into it with this expectation was necessary for me to have any remaining sanity, reasoning this can be traced back through the wait time to get into a server not actually the game. do keep in mind my pc meets the requirement other than the exception of having 8gb of ram not 10 although many people have had success playing the game without this 2 gb. and yes you may wonder but how the hell do you have 12 hours on the game and to answer you this its all in waiting for a server to load. So overall is it a good game yes, load times into server is a no. but you know what after the 1 or so hour that ive actually played the game in-between the pain it made it so that it was ok as there was little to no chance to getting in but there was HOPE nevertheless."

17395,"This game is awful.

Long load, freeze, crash, load, microstutters, play for 2 hours, crash, load, kicked from server for ""unknown error"", friends died on a boat waiting for me to load back in.

Somehow Rust Legacy on a browser ran better."
17396,"Explore, Loot, Build, Kill, Die, Repeat. ...
Add in some Trolling randoms, Annoying friends then back to ... Explore, Loot, Build, Kill, Die, Repeat....
At least there are regular Wipes to keep everyone on the same playing level without being outdone by others. 
There is always a bunch of servers to pick from whether its hosted by the company or others. There is ALWAYS a way to play YOUR way! So grab your friends and go have some fun!"
17397,help
17398,"All you can do is make spears before getting killed by someone else with a shotgun. Almost no cloth generated in the game so advancing is clunky and time consuming. For a game that makes you restart all the time it's just too much of the same thing. Spawn, get some items, die, respawn and start it all over again. Worst game I ever purchased."
17399,"This game is terrible, my first day of playing consisted of Racist slurs and poster of nazis, the only way to win is to play in a clan."
17400,ok
17401,"gooooff
"
17402,i hate peopleW
17403,the monthly updates keep it interesting
17404,"   Friends advised me to play this game, the impression, according to them, was interesting. Without finishing breakfast at the university, I still collected money for the game, installed the game. Having entered the server in three seconds, a flight with a request to remove the a4tech mouse, okay, I think it’s not a problem to have an office mouse. Connected. Again I go to the server. Another problem, why? Restarted the computer. When I join the server, I get a ban for 7 days. Sorry what?? All my friends play on the server. And so on every official server I get a ban for 7 days. I explained the situation to my friends, they understood everything for the mouse, that they kicked, but for the bans for 7 days, for the first time. What's wrong with the game, maybe I'm doing something wrong.
     Therefore, I would like to get my money back for the game. Since I didn’t get the pleasure of the game, but some disappointment was the time I spent. I'm sorry but I have to put a negative review of this game. I'm sure I'm not the only one having these problems."

Do you hate your friends, family, and any hope of a social life outside of your computer chair? Don't have a significant other? Then Rust is the game for you. The crippling anxiety, constant agony of the unknown for that ten second hit of dopamine every twenty four hours sound fun to you then buy this game. You wanna sit in a bush yelling racist comments at people running by, then buy this game. Want to open a box stare at the inventory and open it again hoping the item magically appears, then buy this game. Do you want a game where its almost impossible to play alone, then buy this game.

17494,Best game of all time
17495,"A common misconception about rust is that it is a pvp based game. This is in my opinion: entirely false. Before the so called ""combat update"" which pushed rust towards the first person shooter category rust could (and still can) pass as a simple open world survival game. Because of the ""open world"" and ""sandbox"" features of this game and with no story or path to follow this leaves the format of the game to the individual who plays it. And with the entirety of the content of the game being left to the player means that every part of this game is subjective to the desires and personality to whichever uncaged gorilla decided to log onto the server that wipe. In my opinion i believe that every combat aspect to this game is entirely optional and only there to open opportunities to the player the same way that there is farming tools or dive sites under the ocean. HOWEVER the one non-optional part of this game that sets it apart from EVERY OTHER BULLSH*T SURVIVAL GAME MEANT FOR DERANGED ALT WOMEN AND PYTHON CODERS (ark survival) is the spectacular community which has permissions to paint and say WHATEVER THEY WANT. And the best part.... its completely anonymous. so imagine a open world survival game with complete anonimity where the target demographic is freshman in highschool who just finished reading ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" where they can say and do WHATEVER with ZERO consequences. so the next time you wake up on the beach and are immediately called the most inhumane slurs by a white child who cant even grow ass hair. bask in the glory knowing that YOU are part of something so special and unique that entire ESSAYS are being written about them in a place no one will ever see them.

17552,"Rust.....is what it is. You have to know what you're getting yourself into. It is a hardcore game with hardcore players. You will die a lot. A LOT. Be okay with that. It's easy to get stressed out. Don't. It's just part of the experience. Do your best to fortify to the point that you can't be raided, but if it doesn't work, learn from it and rebuild. It's just a game. 

Highly recommend for anyone who is into FPS, Survival, Base Building, or Crafting. It masters ALL of those mechanics and continues to improve with every update."
17553,Its a very good game would recommend unless you'er short tempered.
17554,fun

17679,good
17680,Its rust so its good
17681,i dont understand this game..
17682,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

Average Rust player"
17773,"i like how you can do want ever you want
"
17774,"TLDR: Worth it.

After hearing a seemingly infinite amount of people explain how the game was terrible, I had to check it out for myself. After buying this game, I quickly began to realize that most of these people had never actually experienced Rust and were going off of the popular opinion that it is terrible. Rust is not the game for someone who has a busy schedule. I’ll say that straight off of the bat. If you work nearly every day or are a full-time student, this may not be the game for you. If you have many spare hours of free time, then it is worth it. The biggest factors that contribute to the hatred of this game are 1. The grind, 2. Community. I will start off by saying that the grind of this game can be very overwhelming and annoying. You can work for 20+ hours on a base, and one morning you wake up to realize it has been decimated by other players in the night. Boom. Start over again. It’s something that you have to be willing to accept when you play. Having the mindset of “I know that I WILL lose my stuff eventually, so it doesn't matter too much.” really helps the experience. The community is toxic. That is something that most likely every player will come to realize. There is no filter in the game. If you are not the one that can handle the bare minimum of swearing, this also isn’t the game for you. 

If you’re not “in it to win it”, the play of the game is still incredibly enjoyable. The graphics are great, though you may not have the best experience if your internet sucks. The sounds are really great, and realistic too (drinking noises caught me off guard). 

Overall: It is an amazing game if you are looking for a game that can make you feel every emotion within 5 minutes, that you can have a great time with, and is one that can give you a literally infinite amount of playtime to it. If you can find this game on sale, or If you have friends that are willing to play it with you, that would be for the better.

Maybe I just suck but its a very difficult game where you can put in so much effort just for that effort to be thrown away by someone who already has guns. and then those same people with the guns argue with people who say this game sucks
17786,"10/10 i hate this game i am now racist,homophobic, and suffering from bankruptcy from gambling with rust skins. My family has left me and im struggling to live. Thats why i give it a 10/10 should never buy this game ever i hate my life."

17788,"first off make some friends in this game, with more people the game is a lot funner and you get a lot more out of it. i didn't do this i was solo for all of my wipes it was still fun but hard cuz all the damn clans running around. a perk of playing solo is hiding and out playing the players on cocking teams trying to raid your base or a near by base and a rule everyone should know and do is if you see a racist  base stop at nothing until they are dead"

17837,"I have 7000 hours of 2 accounts and played since 2019. I went about learning the hard way for abour 1k hours as a solo and learning the ways of Rust the hard way, made and lost friends along the way. But since the new recoil patch, I am sorry to say. The game has lost its spark for me. What made the game hard and enjoying it was learning the patterns and actually being able to hand a far spray and how to manage fights with game sense you learn and you play. But the new update killed any SMG for any reliable range other than close/medium with terrible bloom (even with a laser its terrible), damage drop off has made any medium distance fight useless unless you hit a target 5+ times with the terrible bloom good luck. Ak is decent but still need a laser to be anything close to alright at far distances. The rest of the time I am watching people run away as I have to tap them to death hopefully then dont out heal the dmg or watch as bullet drop is even worse. I understand to change the meta and feel of rust a little but this update honestly has killed it for many veterans that I have spoken to and for the new players they will really never know the fun of learning a spray and dropping someone at 150m+ As of now I dont feel the game fun, it feels like a grub fest and chicken fights because unless you have an AK you will just hope to hit your target with the random bloom added + dmg drop off. All in all, new players goodluck but for the most of us who have had to the game and have to deal with this now..... Im done and will go to something else hoping Rust will change things back."

17860,"I've tried for many hours, gone through multiple PAGES of Google and Reddit search results. This game still hard crashes my PC causing a hard restart. My PC greatly exceeds the requirements, I don't have any weird overclocking BS going on... I'm just trying to play the fucking game, and I can't recommend parting with your money for this headache and experience. I've spent more time trying to troubleshoot than actually managing to play anything of rust. So far I've hit trees with rocks and my PC just black-screens and reboots. I could set my watch by how predictable this outcome is.... 

TLDR;
If you buy this and the game crashes, just refund it before the refund window expires. you likely won't get the game running in a playable or enjoyable state even if your PC exceeds the recommended specs. If it runs for you, kudos, the code gods or something are happy with you. I have no fucking clue."
17861,"Terrible: takes forever to load. I tried to load it once, then second time I figure out it takes over 35 minutes to load (I have good video card Nvidia 1070, but the Internet is only 100 Mbps), then I tried to return and the support just saying I played over 2 hours and not eligible without even reading my explanations about loading time. Once loaded the game is just a stupid shooter with little bit crafting, but I'm not gonna wait 35+ minutes again to look more. Avoid."

What an amazing first 20 minutes.
Nearly refunded and then I found the right server.

Don't let the bad reviews or toxicity deter you. ESPECIALLY the solo players. I solo most games and nearly refunded this one after my initial experience.  Then I found a noob friendly, solo/duo/trio server with a low pop, a supportive community, and some set rules that actually gave me a moment to get off the beach. The community is large enough and there's enough active servers to cater to any play style.

So play it how you wish.
Are you like me and need to jump into a solo or noob friendly server to get your bearing and learn the game?
Are you someone that prefers a chill experience and just wants to build? Well there's PVE servers too.
Or would you like to just dive into the toxic shit hole of the official servers and be murdered over and over by 12 year olds that seemingly know every profanity in the book? The choices are endless. And yet, all satisfying in their own way.

This game has scratched an itch I haven't been able to scratch in a minute. I now fear for my job and my relationships. Thank you Rust. I shall call out of work now..

17918,"This game saved my life.

I am 69 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that."

18075,Like all survival game this is very much like Ark or pre standalone Day Z im not personally into micro managed game however if your into the grind then there a lot to do in Rust however it bores rather quickly.

18162,one of the best hunting games out there
18163,"“The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.”"

Then the game throws the worst it can at you. Bad spawns, dying to fucking animals, more bad spawns. Now, you're not having fun. However, you keep wanting to come back because of that original bit of fun you had. This game isn't actually a game, it is a CIA used torture device. It is pretty fun with friends though."

18227,"Various people are drawn to Rust for various reasons. Some come for PVP, some for farming, some just for socialising. A lot also come just to blurt racist obscenities and to be toxic to others. I, on the other hand, came for the ability to create, to build bases, to be an architect. It was back in 2018. and I still stick around. It's that good. Along the way I also learned to love roaming the ever-changing landscapes, it feels like hiking in nature. AI and unfriendly players add to the excitement of it. Devs work constantly on it, improving it incrementally bit by bit. So, if you're into anything aforementioned, it's a good game to spend money on. But a word of warning in the end, it can be highly addictive. See you on the beach."

Got in a server and walked around for 5 minutes not even to try to find my friend, dies multiple times, then gets game banned from the developers and now I can never play rust again, fix your anticheat. for the love of god. just wasted an hour of my life waiting for the game to download then to join a server just to get game banned after breaking down a tree. thanks facepunch, your names really living up to the expectation. -10/10 not good (peep the hours on record)"

18253,"At times it can feel like all odds are stacked against you, because they are. While you reside in your humble stone 2x2, a nearby clan is constructing a new skyline to fill the once barren rust landscape. These gargantuan groups of people want nothing more than to have control, they play this game to assert dominance over other players, with no remorse for their actions. However, this seemingly unbeatable force will always have an Achilles heel, something to take advantage of. This possibility of success in such a dog-eat-dog world is what makes Rust such a rewarding experience. I would not recommend this game to anyone who is not ready for an immense challenge with no guaranteed success, or to people who are easily frustrated. Nevertheless, if you are up for the difficulty of not only surviving the already harsh conditions of the rust world, but also putting up with the even more intimidating threat of “other players,” give it a shot, you might have some fun…… or not."
18254,I like games
18255,"ITS A FUN GAME SOLO OR WITH UR FRIENDS EITHER WAY SURVIVE AND GET TO BE THE BEST IN ANY SERVER
"
18256,"Purchased this game back in 2017 when it was in alpha. I started off playing in a medium sized group for my first thousand hours and have mainly played solo ever since. I have always played on official vanilla servers.

I have not been able to find any better open world survival game that has managed to make playing with a few hundred random players on an island possible, let alone great. With Facepunch providing continuous monthly updates you shouldn't run out of stuff to do or look forward to.

However, this game is not for ""soft"" players unless you are in a clan.  You will have to grind a lot, You will die a lot, your base will get raided a lot, and you will want to quit a lot. Especially when you encounter a ZERG (Zero Empathy Ruthless Grunts) who make areas of the island uninhabitable."

18274,"I played these 2500+ hours over 1.5 years, I met some really great friends who I now play other games with and would give them the shirt off my back. Facepunch constantly updates the game but not always with stuff people want or need, who asked for ziplines? idk.

I lived for this game over the last 1.5 years, weekly wipes always keep the excitement fresh, but the grind does wear on you, the toxicity wears on you and the cheaters wear on you. Checking your base every morning seeing you were offlined is exhausting. 

Nothing will ever beat raiding the little bastards across the map that wouldn't shut up and sitting in their core talking smack, or rolling up on a group that's unsuspecting and taking all their loot. The game provides maximum adrenaline but at a cost of your mental health. 

Play it! or dont I dont give a shit."
18275,This game makes me want to throw my PC out the window. Pretty fun though

18298,monke.
18299,- I used to love rust but removing the skill gap and this latest June update has killed the game for me if you are looking for a skilled survival game this is not the game for you anymore. Very disappointed in the game devs and the community for letting this happen to our beloved game that allot of us have sunk countless hours in playing and learning skills for.
18300,I RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF U LIKE PVP ACTION AND PVE AND MUCH MORE ITS A OPEN WORLD WITH FANTASTIC GRAPHICS.

18308,"I am a 38 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 9 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Such an interesting take on a survival game, with thousands (no shit multiple thousands) of hours of content packed in. 
Go head to head with the enviroment - or raid your pesky neihbour(s).. buy a submarine go kill scientists in the underwaterlabs. Buy a horse - equip it with armor and ride it into combat... Helicopters, trains, snowscooters... 

Man just buy the game - it could be 200 euro, would still be worth imo.

18331,"You'll lose your life and your friends. You'll wake 4:30AM trying to farm some resource before most of the server is woke up. You will never have a refreshing night of sleep anymore, waking up in the middle of the night to the sound of rockets crumbling your base down while you can't tell if it was real or just another nightmare.

18335,"Rust, what to say about it. It's a game you love to hate. I really enjoy all the crying Facepunch has caused due to the recoil change. People have been saying ""This used to be skill based."" That's not true at all. Those same players go into a modded server with all weapons available and the spend (not kidding) thousands of hours to learn a recoil pattern and then call it ""skill"". They're just mad that they're now on an even playing field with new players and it hurts their little egos. They're mad they ""have"" to dump more time into THE ONLY GAME they play to learn recoil patterns all over again. Here's a WILD idea, just play the game and learn the recoil patterns as you play.

I'm absolute garbage at this game and I'll be the first one to say it every time. This is the only game that I've dumped over 600hrs into and people will still say ""Lol only 600hrs, gitgud"". The community is wildly toxic and N bombs get dropped regularly if you kill someone. It's a literal rarity that you'll come across anyone willing to have a funny or cool interaction with unless you find a ""No kill on sight"" server. If you're coming here after watching Stimpee or Memeio videos DO NOT have the expectation you're going to have the same level of fun they do. They spend easily over a 50-100 hours trying to get content for their 10-20min videos. This is also the only game you can outplay someone and while they're down they say ""Wow you suck at this game kid, get better."" Yeah, sure dude, how's that full metal jacket tasting?

The biggest glaring issue with Rust besides the community is the amount of cheaters that run rampant on: Every. Single. Server. Every server too will say ""Oh don't call them out in chat just DM us on Discord"" nah man I'm not joining your shitty discord to report someone. The minimal I'll do is F7 report and that doesn't do shit. Your only option is to start over on another server or move across the map and HOPE you don't run into them again or another cheater. This is single handledly Facepunches lack of caring or even attempting to get serious about a good anti-cheat.

Even with the above out of the way, would I recommend Rust? Yes. The building is fun, crafting is rewarding, raiding is awesome, and the PVE monuments are challenging and also rewarding as hell to do. There's always an update every month whether it's small or large you can look forward to new stuff. There's tons of modded servers that offer different experiences. If you want a relaxing experience with mild gun fights join a PVE No Kill On Sight (No KOS) server. If you want double loot/resources and heavy gun fights join a large 2x server with high population and go ham sandwiches.

Just starting? Keep the below in mind:

10 Tips for the Noob:

1. When looking for a server to join they will be tagged ""Weekly"" (Usually every Thursday) or ""Monthly"" (Usually the first Thursday of the next month) that means the server fully wipes (bases, loot, items on your character). Most (not all) servers will keep your blueprints (BP's) though so you don't have to relearn them. HOWEVER read the description of every server as some do wipe BP's. (I personally prefer no BP wipes monthly servers)

2. There is one exception to the above, when Facepunch does a massive update they sometimes have to force wipe everyones BP's. This is unavoidable and they will announce it in the update if this is happening.

3. A lot of servers are ""P2W"" meaning you can go onto their website and buy full kits (Metal armor, AK's, ammo, explosives) unless you like winning with your credit card or like an uphill battle I suggest avoiding them. 

4. Find a build only server where you can experiment with Rusts building and watch Youtube videos on how people achieve some of their elaborate bases. Keep in mind if you copy a base off a Youtube video that means anyone can know where your TC (Tool Cupboard) room is at. You gotta get crafty with trying to hide it.

5. Don't get attached to your loot. Run out and lose it, that's the only way you'll get better. I still have a hard time with this rule myself because you can spend hours getting shit only to lose it in a matter of seconds. High risk=High reward here.

6. Outpost sells stuff, there's level 1 work benches there as well, recyclers, repair benches, and research tables. Utilize the hell out of this if necessary. It's a ""Safezone"" meaning if someone shoots at you in that area they will get fucking beamed by all the NPC turrets. You can also farm barrels & trees here in the beginning to get a quick base down. Be mindful that this is a popular idea and you will run into more people which equals more dying OR potential for a come up on killing an unsuspecting player.

7. ""Alt"" looking is your best friend. Running across the map? Alt look A LOT. Farming a tree or node? Alt look. Flying a helicopter? Alt look. I seriously want this feature in every FPS I play, I out of habit will do it in other games and get sad when I can't.

8. Crouching makes you SILENT as the very air you're breathing. Hence the Alt looking tip above. I have caught several people trying to sneak up on me crouching and alt look has saved my life. Pro Tip: You can spam crouching while sprinting and the first running step you take will be silent. Use this when sneaking up on someone to get the jump faster or to get away.

9. Close your doors and put locks on them. The amount of people that leave their doors open deeper into their base and then only close their front door is astonishing. Use this to your advantage as well.

10. Learn ladders in the T1 workbench quickly. You'll find walled in player compounds and they will leave boxes of shit outside thinking it's safe. (Plot Twist: It's not lol). When going over a wall find some cloth (hemp) and make some bandages. External wood & stone walls have barbed wire but you can heal through it as you ladder over the wall. It's a pain but you can sometimes come out with stacks of wood, stone, sulfer, metal frags, or anything else your greedy little heart desires. (Shout you to Youtuber Tesla for teaching me how to be a greedy little grub)"

18345,"I dont have any review about this just have a bunch of questions. 
Have they optimized this POSH?! I remember in the begging this game was fun.  Toxic as F! 
Have their given up on their skin sale market and focus some resources on the game ?! 
Does this POSH game still needs SSD meanwhile other games achieve better loading speeds performance and player count without having a beast of a PC?!
AND ANOTHER ONE THAT BUGGED ME AND MY FEMALE FRIENDS AND GF. 
Why Is there no option to edit ur character, we don't give a Flying F about the looks but my GIRL FRIEND does not like to roam around naked with a big flaccid cock. Whose Idea was this? BTW  I don't want to sport tits and a pussy either, 
We made a Statistical Analysis and It came out that almost 85 % are fed up from ur steam profile, MEANING THEY WILL FLIP UR GENDER ON PURPOSE,  No-one gives a shit if the game is good but we need that option. 
AND THIS IS WHY YOU WILL NEVER BEAT ARK, RUST WILL ALWAYS BE THE TOXIC LITTLE SHITHOLE BECAUSE THEY AIMED FOR THAT SORT OF TARGET. 
Heh and the the biggest problem is not her gender pro trans to gey agenda, there is a good game underneeth it, but they forgot to optimize that shit! It looks like shit, It plays like shit, Its basicaly shit. 
NO WONDER MY BEST MEMORIES OF THIS GAME WERE IN EARLY ACCESS! (Im still willing to give it another try, but i doubt anything has changed.) RUST COULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ARK, Add a decent character creator and dont let my girlfriend walk with a dick, she hates it, If you guys are that supid as to think you RE INVENTED THE WHEEL THAN U DESERVE WHATS COMMING FOR U!"

18356,"rotten game full of no lifers, every server full of campers and random killers. You start chopping a tree and youre already getting shot at. Only way to actually progress here is wait for wipe and grind 5 hours just to have a chance at survival or you gotta get a full squad of people to advance faster. People say that rust community is good, and that is far from true. Only thing people say in voice is n*gger or they just dont use voice at all. If you have a shit ton of time and you are ready to spend a lot of time just to progress a little then this game is for you. I havent even mentioned the shit optimization.

The gameplay looks like this:

Spawn.
Look around
Start getting wood, and eventually make a spear and other basic tools. 
Start walking around to find a spot for a base or other useful resources.
Get shot and killed in the middle of the last step.
Repeat.

Its not worth the original price of 40 dollars.

"
18393,"I can't recommend this game, after many hours of me playing and many years of devs just revamping the same system over and over again, besides adding three interesting things per year. The devs refuse to do anything meaningful besides redoing the research system several times and effectively returning to square one with components added...

Game is badly optimised, and has been for several years aswell."

Fun game, you would think after being out for so long it would be optimized at least a little. Takes longer to load than any other modern game I can think of."

18442,i havent played for that much but i can say this game sucks
18443,132
18444,Worst game I ever played
18445,"The game is a fun game for sure. 
But it is time consuming. You have to put the hours in every day to make progress.
Also this is a game best played with friends or with a clan. Playing solo is often not feasible as its quite often on most servers to have clans of 10+ that can destroy your base in minutes.

On a technical standpoint. The game is a huge open world and its pretty good.
The load times do suck though, especially if you have an average/bad PC.
"
18446,"Very interactive with friends and other players

18447,Fun game if you have friends

18501,very good
18502,"The game is very openlandish and you always have something to do, with different servers having force wipes that make everyone restart from the beginning and the game making you spawn at random areas helping you explore the entire map willing or not and different servers having different mods that can change your experience on the game.

-A lot of Hackers
-There is always someone willing to wait for unlimted amount of time just to raid you
-Again, some people always end up shooting you in the back even in complete darkness.

18539,10/10 game untill they changed recoil i spent lots of hours on aim train servers and all that time was wasted rust is changing the game so much to help new players with the cost of loosing current players.A big part of rust was the hard recoil and thats gone now rust isnt rust anymore

18706,"Rust is very fun both with friends and solo (in my opinion). 
Rust is one of the most immersive games I've played, with hours flying by without me even noticing 
The dopamine hits after killing a loaded guy or getting big loot are high
And the sorrow of losing it all an hour or a day later is sad asf. 

Although due to the games extremely cutthroat and cruel nature it is safe to say that Rust is not for everyone. But personally I love the games competitive nature. I try not to take the game too seriously and try to keep PvP from being my only focus but the PvP is satisfying and with the new update it makes it easier to pickup for new players. 

W game. 
"
18707,"Very good and fun game,but new recoil is sucks!"

18710,i like men
18711,amazing game i love hearing ppl rage when killed
18712,The new recoil makes me want to shit in my hand then eat the shit and die. No one should ever think about buying this game anymore simply because of the previous update. Old Recoil on top #BEAMER #DEADGAME
18713,"I am going to review this game based on 4 things. Gameplay, graphics, community, and price. Hopefully this review helps you on deciding whether or not to buy this game.

 Firstly, the gameplay in this game is extremely immersive and unforgiving. The npc's and the players roaming around the map add a sense of liveliness that makes the game very immersive. On the other hand, most of the players and the npc's will be out to kill you, and when that happens, you could very well lose everything in your inventory. 

Secondly, this game has decent graphics and some beautiful monuments. If you have an expensive PC and you are able to max out the graphics this game might look good but either way the graphics are decent at best.

Thirdly, this game is known to have a toxic community. Although, I do think a toxic community fits a game like this. You really never know when you can trust somebody as they can betray you at any moment. You are most likely to be shot on sight. The chat can also be toxic at times but it's very easy to ignore. 

Lastly, this game is most definitely worth the price. I have only owned this game for one and half weeks and I already have 100 hours. You can most definitely pour thousands of hours into this game without getting bored. So in conclusion, if this sounds interesting to you at all, buy this game. I rate it a 9.6/10."

18728,This game is super in-depth and worth the buy if you have the time to dedicate to it!
18729,"Rust is Rust. Do some research, and figure out if it's a game you'd enjoy.
There's tons of content, pvp servers, pve servers, fun/creative servers, and an endless amount of content to do.

Do be warned: It can easily get boring/tedious if you hate repetition, as servers do wipe weekly/bi-weekly/monthly depending on the server. And also, skins can be a huge money sink if you want cool looking stuff.... but overall love the game"

18751,"I have played this game for 1400 hrs by far and away the most time I have put on any game. Until now I would say its my favorite game of all time but I can no longer say this. There are many things I like about Facepunch but at heart I now truly believe they are cowards. They won't pick a script and stick with it. I play with a group of players who all have atleast 1500 hours in the game and we are very good and came up the hard way..putting in the time and effort to get good at this game. We learned to get good at the game by learning the guns and practicing them....Alot.... with the roll out of this coming patch and taking away the skill we've spent countless hours perfecting I can't help but feel this is about taking from those who saw the way to be top tier and then followed through and giving it to the masses. You robbed us Facepunch. So now I can say for sure that my group of friends who together have over 10k hours on rust will be moving to a new game Tarkov, or Scum, or Dayz. It bothers me that you basically sold out your dedicated player base Facepunch in the interest adding training wheels to the game. Lastly the new recoil update sucks and it ruins the amount of time people have put into the game to learn it just for some roleplaying noobies, we had to learn it and we didnt complain so why did they have to complain? they are all just little pussies and basically ruined the game for everyone by making it easy. THE GAME IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY. TLDR: Was a fun game if you put the time in but developers have become sell outs. PSPS: You aren't going to change anything best players still going to be the best players, just pissed of your most loyal fanbase/cause them to no longer play."
18752,The perfect game for a masochist
18753,its ok
18754,I love this game.  I love everything about this game.  The devs are amazing and are always working on it.  I find myself losing a huge amount of time just messing around.

18765,"Story:

The story really is the main part of this game, and it’s quite enjoyable. The game takes place in a small house in the woods, where you play a little girl who has woken up alone. On your bed is a storybook that leads you on adventure between reality and a fairytale. You must explore and solve puzzles to make it to the conclusion of the first part of this trilogy. The story is aimed at a much younger audience, but still kept me entertained enough to want to see it advance.

Audio:

The audio in this one is great; it really helps create a nice sense of immersion, and pulls you in with all the little extras. From the click of a locked doorknob to the shimmer of a star, the spatial audio shines.

Visuals:

The visuals in this game are phenomenal, really one of the best dark house atmospheres I have seen in VR. Everything is extremely crisp, and other then a slight chug on the menu screen, it all ran smooth as butter. I have to give some credit to this tiny team for creating such a visually stunning game.

Gameplay:

Now this one is a bit light on the actual gameplay, there is far more exploration then anything else. You have a small inventory, which they don’t really explain, but other then that, there really isn’t anything to worry about. There is no rush to do anything in this game, and the puzzles aren’t particularly difficult, but it does take a little thought to get right. I did have a few issues with the movement system, it’s all teleportation, but it’s a weird point and follow footsteps thing that I didn’t care for all that much. I also wasn’t the biggest fan of some of the voiceovers; they were a bit overacted and didn’t fit, but nothing too bad. Overall for a playable story experience, I think they did a fantastic job, especially for such a small team, just don’t go in expecting some next level VR puzzle story game. This one is all about atmosphere, and they nailed it.

Verdict:

So for 14.99 you’re getting an extremely atmospheric story puzzle game with fantastic audio and beautiful visuals. It’s not the longest experience, netting me a little over 2 hours, and there really isn’t any replayabilty, but it’s a wonderful first part to a story of which I’m excited to see the conclusion. So if you’re looking for a relaxing bit of storytelling VR, you’ve come to the right place. The small team at Dimforst has done a wonderful job on their first VR title, and I’m excited to see how they grow from here.
After months of delays, the time has finally to come to get our grubby little hands on the virtual dinosaur park of our dreams. What initially started a Ark, a wonderful massive online first person survival game, has since been spun off into their own little virtual reality playground. You can feed, raise, discover, and shoot a wide variety of dinosaurs and other pre-historic creatures, and of top it all off most of these modes are also accessible to play multiplayer.

Now that sounds pretty cool right, and like your initial ride into the theme park, you might be both overwhelmed and enamored by the possibilities that lie on this island of your dreams, sadly a lackluster movement system and general lack of cohesion kind of crash the party.

The main problem is Ark Park just tries to do too many things at once, I’m still not sure if it’s a crafting game, first person shooter, or educational experience. A menu or a loading screen separates each area, and once inside, most are relatively small. The arrival area is for hopping on a train, and I must say the train ride really is pretty spectacular, but sadly what starts as fireworks turns into sparklers.

You’re dropped off and immediately greeted with another load screen, whatever this is a big game I said, it’ll be fine, it’s gotta load, sadly the area you load into, albeit cool, is very small, and upon leaving, another load screen. This general disconnect echoes throughout the entire title, the menu system feels very outdated compared to the glossy futuristic environments around you, and although it does offer a number of areas to visit, they all feel like just a taste of what truly could have been.

The movement is another nail in the tire, not only is there no settings menu, but your only option for locomotion is teleportation with 30 degree click turning. It works, but in my personal opinion, it’s not in any way optimal. Like most VR developers have come to realize, the players want options, what works for one us is completely immersion breaking for the next, and without any way to customize the game to your liking, it can easily ruin what could have been an amazing title. Now I don’t think a movement system is what could save Ark Park, but I do believe options would make it a much better game.

Now it’s not all a bad trip, I really did enjoy exploring the environments, which do look stunning on PC, but sadly just fall apart into a blurry mess on psvr and with no pro upgrades, the game certainly isn’t the shining star it could be. I also liked using my scanning gun to catalogue new critters and interact with them in the environment, but sadly none of this really offers any replayability. Sure it might be a cool experience to show off your VR to friends, but if you were expecting some next level dinosaur fantasy zoo where you get to be Richard Attenborough, you’re not gonna be too happy.

Finally there is a wave shooter and crafting weapons aspect to the game, but it just doesn’t feel fully fleshed out. The gunplay is extremely low quality for a VR game, and it really just feels kind of tacked on. I can’t comment too much on the multiplayer considering there really weren’t too many people online while I was playing, but it’s really just the same half-hearted gameplay from single player with some more people, not really my cup of tea.

So if I had to throw a rating on this one, it’s looking like a solid C-, which worked for me in high school, but just doesn’t cut it these days. Now like all games, I’m sure some players will enjoy trying to raise dinosaurs, have fun upgrading their weapons, and love defending the various posts. They may not even have a problem with the movement, visuals on psvr, or cohesion. So like any VR game, it’s really more what you personally are looking for in the experience, and I personally think your fifty bucks could be much more happily spent elsewhere. Finally there are a few coming soon areas to the multiplayer section, so make sure you subscribe to stay updated if anything great comes along.
It’s finally here, the moment we’ve all been waiting for, Beat Saber has landed, and with it a new take on the classic rhythm game, but once you get past the lightsabers and bass heavy tracks, is it really any fun? Well I’m very happy to tell you, that it might just be my favorite new VR game.

One of the big things I’ve been wanting out of VR is a solid lightsaber title, I mean who doesn’t want to be Ewan McGregor saving the galaxy, but seriously, upon first seeing Beat Saber a few months ago, I knew I had to play this one. I was a big fan of guitar hero and it’s quick rhythmic gameplay, and this felt like two my favorite mechanics mixed, lightsabers and beat drops.

So when Hyperbolic Magnetism, the two man Czech team that created this work of art, reached out to see if I wanted to demo a pre-release, I leaped at the chance. As of now I’ve played around an hour or so of Beat Saber every day over the past week, and I’m still hooked. I sing the songs at work, I hear them in my dreams, and I practice quick slashes when I’m in the shower.

Upon hoping in for the first time, you’re greeted with a sweet message from the devs, and a main menu screen that allows for solo and party play, something I still haven’t tried. You can change also change a wide variety of settings within the menu, and I found the room rotation & movement to be extremely helpful in trying to get the perfect play area setup.

Solo play offers 3 modes, standard, no arrows, and single blade.

Standard is the mod"

18779,"Depending on your playstyle, rust has many ways it can be played. Although the community is rather toxic and losing fights can be enraging, rust has provided a lot of fun for me the past year or so. There are modded servers that give you more loot than usual if you dont have much time and official servers if you do have time. The recoil has recently been changed to suit a newer audience so pvp is more fair for new people. This update made many people upset but those people were ones from a few years ago that have spent hundreds of hours practicing aim. I highly recommend Rust as a whole game."

18796,"Too many sweats who kill you in 5 minutes after spawning in. Give players like a 10 minutes protection bubble if you spawn at a beach.

18843,bit rusty but still decent
18844,"I´ve been playing Rust occasionally for about 2 Years now, and due to the many servers, you can always find something suiting you. 

I recommend Rust for Players who don´t mind gaming for 4-13 hours without a brake, because in this Game Progress takes Time, a lot of Time, but it is worth it, especially flying the Minicopter, or as I like to call it 5 metal rods welded together"
18845,play rust if you want to enjoy playing for 10 mins then want to kill yourself!
18846,i hate grubs
18847,love it
18848,"Hi there, I have no life!

As a fellow long term player I have spent my days watching chaotic shit happen in this game. If you wan't pure random fun then you might find this game enjoyable. But that being said, there's a twist to this game. While you may be having fun at the moment. Things can quickly turn into a keyboard smashing montage. For those who have anger issues, then I recommend that you turn away.

Facepunch developers are the most dedicated bunch I have seen from a game. A while back they were pushing out updates every week as they promised, bringing lots of content to enjoy. Now still pushing content every month to make sure the game follows its track. As for the following plans of Rust, they're very open on how they operate. And the type of content that we might be seeing in the future. This game was not the same game I played back in legacy or beta. Many designs were scrapped or replaced. 

As I mentioned before, this game brings a welcome change most of the time. There are various items for you to take interest in, plenty of freedom and lots of blood for you to dig into! Rust features a hardcore survival with the intentions of being 90% player manufactured. If you like spraying guts all over the place with shotguns, Tommy guns, or even a flame thrower? Then you might want to try raiding or live a simple life as a farmer and get raided by a zerg. Like I said, plenty of content. 

Well you made it to the end, so enjoy this ""Lr 300"", have a nice day. Oh and welcome to Rust.

18896,"Beautiful game! The concept, idea, graphics and everything. But constant struggle with cheaters and game optimizations. 
To clarify ""game optimization"":
- Problem with FPS and FPS drops ( randomly FPS drops from 70 to 20-30 and stay there). To fix that problem you need to restart game.
- If you do not have the best GPU at market, you will not enjoy in the game and play the game with normal FPS.
- If you have ""normal"" PC (from 800 - 1800 EUR or USD) you will struggle with FPS between 20 and 60, and you will have to lower a lot of the graphics settings in the game to squeeze out few more FPS."

18900,NGL this new recoil IS HOT TRASH plus this game is aids @Cribbyy @Zephyra #rustysaloon                           https://tenor.com/view/rust-rust-bad-gif-23039807   https://tenor.com/view/eoka-beamed-roblox-eoka-gang-rust-gif-21533744   I Recommend you waste your 40 dollars on drugs preferably crack cause at least crack wont be as bad as this game
18901,Rust is an amazing and very unique game. There will be many like it but never a clone. Rust is special and with the new recoil change it’s friendlier to newer players and that’s what the community is about. Listening and making changes
18902,"If you want to experience the worst of the human population and waste your time, play this game. The amount of time and effort required to be proficient at this game isn't worth it unless you're a content creator and will make money. There's no dedicated servers for new players, so you will be mixed in with a bunch of low life idiots that will ruin all your progress. The game could easily implement servers for people with less that 20, 100 and 1,000 hours, but the developers won't do that because they're depraved like the patrons of the game.

You can instead play a game that isn't demanding (in a bad way) and invest the remaining time and effort into something that will actually be meaningful for your life."

18905,very good very nice
18906,jop
18907,Game offers plenty of very unique interactions with other players. The rises and falls really help get you involved in your own story each wipe.
18908,"Rust has come a long way and for the moment I think its in a super solid state gameplay wise, still a lot of optimisation is needed. the community like others can be super awesome and also cancer and rage inducing at the same time, If you want a new challenge picking up this game is a great idea."
18909,It is a fun action game and if you have friends even more then fun
18910,"honestlythis game is dogshit, but its fun at the same time...recently the  performance has been pretty bad other than that the game is actually really easy for new players since they changed recoil which is much needed for the community  (also if you dont like toxicity this definitely isnt the game for you)"

18955,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him."

19058,"Over a few accounts I have 1K plus hours and yet still somehow have a girlfriend and a good life, this game isn’t bad👍✅"
19059,"Both some of the most fun I've ever had playing a game and some of the worst, rage-inducing, hate-fueled time I've spent in my life. I should note, I am strictly a solo player. I'll occasionally make an ally for one wipe (usually a neighbor where we agree to look after each other). Sadly, I've come to the conclusion that unless you're playing a solo only server, that way of playing is largely unfeasible. You will get your base raided, your shit taken and called an n-word 9 times out of 10. The community often feels like an arms race of making the game so miserable for the other person to play that they give up for this wipe. It's not about stealing resources and killing but breaking the other person's spirit to play the game. 
But the mechanics are great, the idea is terrific, everything is so well done outside of the community. 10/10 game with a 2/10 community."

19133,ITS MEH FIRST 100 HRS IS DYING THEN IT GETS RLLY FUN ALSO SOLO IS JUST PAIN REPEATED PAIN BUT IN A GOOD WAY
19134,"Its been an awesome game from the day i bought it 5 years up until today. but now it too different of a game, compared to the first time i played it. i feel like its lost the survival touch and gained more of an open world call of duty aspect to it, not like it a bad thing but i enjoyed roaming on a server with casual interactions without people all on foot. For new players i reckon this game could bring heaps of fun, especially with the new recoil update. new players might actually have a chance to get a base down within the first 3 hours of wipe.

a couple tips if you really want to enjoy the game:
1. Play with friends, you have much more of an advantage over solo players even if you have one friend with you
2. dont waste money on the skins, unless you can really afford them and dont use your parents money
3. DONT ROOFCAMP, (sit at the top of your roof and kill people all day long) People will hate your guts!
"
19135,It is by far the best survival game that is or ever was. Different servers for all styles of play.
19136,best game
19137,"While the concept of the game is great. I can't recommend it to anyone. The amount of hatred, racist, toxic behavior is off the charts. The vast majority of people are so angry and aggressive it's ridiculous. 

I play games to have fun, not be frustrated. I'm not the kind of person who can check their morals at the door. I don't find fun in ruining others fun. I enjoy being competitive. I don't enjoy hearing people telling others to kill themselves or saying crazy pedo stuff. 

There are modded and community servers and I think that's where I'm going to look to see if there are better servers without so much of these things. But the fact that this is the official server experience is what I'm basing this off."

19182,"Do not buy this game anymore. The PvP used to be unique and fun. After this update it isn't worth it. Many players have quit and the game's gunplay is essentially the same as COD Vanguard's. Similar sounds to it, no recoil, and rng determines who wins fights. Go save your ~40 bucks for COD at this point. If you want a game that's better currently just buy Escape From Tarkov."

19213,"i came from console rust, considering i got console rust not knowing D11 is an incompetent studio, and let me tell you, after looking at hours upon hours of youtube videos, streams, movies etc. and watching some great content creators like Welyn, General Sam, Aquafps, Blooprint, and even the ""newer"" generation of rust youtubers, i was highly dissapointed to see that it wasn't anything like it had been protrayed on PC. i mean, how do you mess up things so bad that there are literal game breakin glitches? spawn on a beach, find a compound, and literally fly in by just crouching on another players head. want food? INFINITE PUMPKIN DUPLICATION! want stable servers that dont lag? nah, here's a 3k map that lags with a 100 player cap. everything is different on there, besides the toxicity. i met some good people that can run servers without using m&k, some friends that have branched out to other games than console rust, and i can gladly say we're genuine friends. Most of us are going on with life, but some are getting PCs soon. from the little amount of time i have on legitimate, non-console rust, it's so much better. at this point, it'd be better for Facepunch to buy back Rust from D11 so they dont ruin the games reputation. its been a year since the games came out and all we have to show is OIl Rig, and hundreds of glitches. when my friends get computers, i'd say we're going to have a much more fun time than we did playing crust. 10/10, hard to even think about playing crust/dust/ whatever nickname you can give the monstrosity that D11 made."

19223,"Love the concept of the game, the graphics are great, map generation is good as well. However this game's problem is some of the player base, the 12-16 year olds who must kill every character on their screen. Take the reason I just quit, half an hour in, I've made a small shack, TC, got basic tools and a gun, all of sudden I get rushed by 5 guys with ak's screaming racial slurs. They kill me, they don't even take my stuff because they don't need it. I can see why its fun for them, but its not fun for new players. I was even playing on a server that was 'new player friendly'.

I'm sorry, I'm really trying to like this game but its hard, if this game dies, the reason will be these types of players who play 12 hours a day in massive groups, killing every naked guy they see :/"
19224,"Fun game to play with friends. An open world game that benefits from cooperation, planning, and skill. It will have you and your buddies up all night raiding bases."
19225,"Facepunch only listens to beginners, roleplayers, and streamers when looking to make changes to their game. The opinions of    those who put thousands of hours into what was a pvp system like no other game are completely ignored. As a result they have completely destroyed the recoil system that made rust such a challenging and unique game. Additionally, they make changes that no one asked for, like changing the iconic sound of the AK to a shitty stock sound effect. I have many great memories of incredible wipes with friends, but these changes mean I am not interested in returning to rust.
tldr -  retard devs, RIP Rust"

I absolutely fell in love with it, from being able to build crazy bases to farming resources to being able to raid other players and more. I find the game controls were pretty easy to learn for a new FPS player and it's a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game!"

19314,"I was extremely addicted to this game prior to the combat patch and spent hours upon hours learning the guns recoil patterns and building/electricity. I highly recommend you do NOT buy this game, it's great for all the players that are new to FPS games but for anyone that wants a challenge of learning recoil patterns etc this game is not for you. They have ruined the game and I will not play again until they revert back. If they don't then they will suffer with a dying game, why every game company ruins their game? H1Z1 is a solid example, you are going down the same road Facepunch just look at all the negative reviews it's gained already.

Summing it up
- gun audio is dreadful
- combat feels terrible, a monkey blindfolded can kill any player, 0 skill required to shoot guns

+new to fps games? try this, very easy, no skill ceiling

You've got a successful game here, don't ruin it by changing what everyone already loved."

19319,"Looking for a hardcore survival game to play with friends.
Well look no further.The game is based on some realistic mechanics of survival and combat,ranging from a rock to top tier weapons such as an AK ingame.
From chopping down trees to doing ore runs the game will test both your mentality and physical skills to survive in a harsh enviroment filled with players to get to the top as fast and as easy as they can.

The motto for the game is RUST no trust for a very good reason as both the closest of friends to your worst enemies will compete against you for the top.

Stay cool gamers and enjoy."

19322,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

19460,best game fr
19461,Fun with friend Don't trust anybody
19462,"It was cool to see some of the new items they added, one in particular that shoots messages to your phone when your base is getting raided. But load times into the game is way too long compared to ANY other game. While base was getting raided it took 30 minutes to log in. In that time, they raided the base, replaced the doors and now I no longer have a base. So won't be playing again, I'm not going to upgrade to a M2 SSD just for a game."
19463,who doesn't love toxicity?
19464,its fun to craft boom !
19465,good game
19466,"Very Very fun game, best survival game I have played (better than Minecraft)"
19467,its a pretty good game should play it
19468,"In 1 hour this game changed my life.
I used to be a fcking loser but playing this game online and obliterating everyone made me gain self esteem and confidence. I started working out, I started getting girls, I started following my dreams. In 2009 I was elected as the 44th President of the United States and it would have not been possible if I never played this game.
Thank you Rust."

19476,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

it would've been good if it wasn't surrounded by possibly the worst community possible. so much of the game is pushed onto the combat. because of that, the combat has BECOME the game. if you don't get good at pvp, you might as well avoid this game as much as possible. it's also overpriced."

19505,"Kinda fun, just gotta be good and play loads. that that god of a game overall though"
19506,amazing game if you can handle racism and toxic people.
19507,"This is PVP, no other game is PVP ;)

Very good for your stress levels :D"
19508,its a great game in genrel but it can get toxic at certain points and you must learn to not get butt hurt about certain things
19509," i Love the flexability in playing styles.  You can be a role player, a pvper, a pveer. What ever you feel like at that time.  I don't like the night time. I understand wanting to keep the game as realistic as possible, but Ive been outside at night. It is not that dark. You can still see a little bit."

19524,dad?
19525,"Rust sucks now, recoil removes the entire skill gap. Complete waste of money a player with 2 hours and 3 brain cells can contend with a regular player of many hundreds to thousands of hours. Facepunch has made one of the best survival games to just another call of duty rip off. Then instead of trying to create some form of a skill gap they instead start to work on a clan HUD update. The game no matter what skill you have or how long you spend practising is just a game of complete numbers. The guns are no longer balanced with a t2 weapon (the thompson) being much better than a weapon from the t3 tech-tree."

19533,"It is a dope game, yet extremely unforgiving with raids and such. still, 10/10."
19534,"I will never be good at this game. too many campers on roofs, in monuments, and at my own base. big groups and and i can only get 3 in a squad maybe 4. we always lose a 2v1 with bows. the only time we get guns is from decaying bases and buying them. everytime i win a fight i die on my way home from some random guy lasering me from the back. this game just gives you depression. building a base is no problem but when you try and get loot you either die on the way or die on the way back. if someone gets the drop on you then you just die and even when i get the drop on someone else i die. i've tried practice servers but still lose 99/100 fights and after 500 hours of saying i can get better its clear that i am not meant for this game and never will be. this is the first game that i cant get good at no matter how many hours i play. i can handle the toxicity but i cant handle dying everytime to campers and random people that come out of nowhere. All i do now is basically talk to people at outpost and gamble my life away."
19535,"The human brain is monstrous even if compared to our closest competitor, the great ape, but our truly unique property is the physiological (as opposed to habitual) upright walk which includes special anatomical features such as a narrow pelvis, the slightly inward-directed thigh bones, and plantigrade feet. Upright-walking species show a foramen occipitalae at the base of the skull rather than the posterior aspect. These are unmistakable markers that are readily recognized in the fossilized form. Anthropologists will always be looking for ancestors that do not show these features because the old school says that the upright walk developed slowly from a quadruped animal by gene duplication and mutations. That proposal is of beguiling simplicity if one forgets the biology and biochemistry required for that transition. Looking back in time one is faced with the fact that the brain had all but disappeared at Lucy's (A. afarensis) developmental stage, yet she was fully bipedal.4 To find the presumed quadruped ancestor would lead to insurmountable identification problems unless, as shown in a cartoon by an unknown artist, step-less melting of one form into the other can be observed. Large brains relative to body-size are always associated with bipedality whereas bipedality is not invariably associated with large brains. Once a chimpanzee-brained creature has the features of upright walk it becomes a hominid, and when that hominid acquires cranial features that suggest a larger brain and when artifacts are found next to the fossils, it becomes a member of our genus Hom0. Did the apes change, as in the old model, or was a new species introduced, as the Genomic Potential Hypothesis predicts?"

19542,"I am a 49 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

19546,"If you are into survival games, Rust is a great experience, as long as you don't have a short temper and can wait out the learning curve. It is brutal out there, even worse for a solo player like myself. Just take some time and don't take anything too personal, but never, ever trust a soul. Good luck out there survivors"

All in all such an amazing game playing solo or in group. Very unique survival game and the constant updates and development keeps the game fresh and exciting and you will come back every other month playing it differently.

Great game, I don't think they released a single update that left me scratching my head like other games do, every update has been impressive and well-thought out to fit the era, graphics, concept, and so on..."

19686,this makes humans mentally unstable especially when u have boars bears and fully naked 50-60 year old men and women chasing you with rocks and if it couldnt get any worse dont swim y because it takes a lunar new year to get even distantly far out and or come back to the island of wild pigs bears and rabid humas but wait now they have guns lots of guns and now youre dead *respawn* now its just a part two good lUCK! says one man then another calls you a slur 10/10 would recomend

19765,"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."

I would suggest finding a ""newbie"" server or at least one that isn't super crowded. I've built my first base and learned quite a few ""bluepprints"" to build weapons, tools, base improvemnets, etc. and I have explored about half the map in 5 or 6 days. I haven't had my base totally destroyed yet, but I know it's coming....

So if you are ok with getting teabagged 1-20 times, starving to death, dying of thirst and starting over each time it might be for you."

What's that? You scraped up enough mats to make a starter base? gl finding a fucking decent place to build, that isn't on the doorstep of a massive fucking clan that will raid you at 4:30 in the morning. Oh and make sure you have enough flat space to actually build there, because you see that tiny little fuck-off hill? NOT ENOUGH SPACE. fuck this game, it's shitty balance, shitty servers, jank-ass building system, and the fucking mega clans."

19890,"I am a 69 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 60 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
Shortly after this we both suffered from severe brain damage and realised we now know how to speak russian, now after a year of playing with him and many vac bans later we have gathered 10,000 hours of well spent bonding and i have a very happy life"

19938,poop
19939,games dogshit the recoil update makes this call of duty.
19940,"There has been a group on official facepunch servers called PMC that cheats for over a year now. I hate to be rude but it really seems that you aren’t doing anything to fix the cheating problem at all. I really appreciate the monthly updates and streamer interaction but this is killing your game.
Almost all of my wipes end because there is a cheater on the server. They come back on new accounts, so one time bans aren’t effective, and EAC doesn’t detect them at all. I’ve had cheaters flying around me and walking on water and it took 8 days for them to be banned.
I doubt this will be seen but please, I like this game and I can tell how much effort you’ve put into it. I have 2700 hours so I can say I have a large data sample when I am telling you cheaters are running rampant and ruining countless player experiences.
The core of Rust, its beating heart, is work. This is a game that requires dedication and effort. It is absolutely expected for there to be some emotional attachment to what you’ve accomplished. When you make a huge play, you feel the adrenaline pumping, and you keep coming back for more. When you lose it all, it’s a punch in the gut but you take it from the other players who you know work as much as you do. This is a careful equilibrium, and it is present on any server. Cheaters upset this equilibrium, obviously, but what makes this different than any other game is the meaning behind the items they’ve cheated from you. You worked for it, you put real effort and skill into these items. And when they get taken at a moment’s notice by a cheater, you have the punch of losing loot, with none of the resurging motivation to ‘make it back’, or to keep accumulating loot. Most players get off the server when they notice a cheater.
This is why it is so important to not only condemn cheating but to also put tangible measures in place to prevent and discourage it. Again, I am trying to be as polite as possible as I recognize the effort you’ve put into this game and I would be remiss to ignore it, but it really feels like you guys aren’t doing anything about this. The voice inside me is saying you just add fluff and shine such as the twitch events to the game to attract new players without any attention to the issues that are so prevalent, that you are more interested in racking up as many new players as possible. There is an issue with this. New players are trying the game out. They have a smaller sample size to form an opinion of most topics, and are likely to move on to the next big game. This is opposed to veteran players, or even semi-experienced players, who have some sort of investment in and attachment to the game. You need to maintain your game, and keep the players not only sated with new contentas you have been doing excellently, but happy with the competitive aspect of the game. Having thousands of new players may be exciting, but this is just short term. Keep your players happy, and happy players keep playing.
To wrap this up, over a long time cheating has become more and more of a problem, and it is disappointing and aggravating to most players to see that this is going unnoticed, or at least untouched. Updates bringing new content are fantastic, but they need to be balanced with gameplay maintenance. Having lots of current players is good, but what counts is your recurring players. I think this game has a lot of potential and holds a very niche place in the gaming community, and I am excited to see where it goes. Cheating has no place in a game as involved as Rust. Thank you.

19972,"The game is designed to encourage established players to hunt new players instead of engage with players of similar level of equipment and base. They can spend 20 minutes collecting resources, or 30 seconds killing an unarmed player to get what they just spent 20 minutes collecting. Even if they don't need the resources, they can ruin someone's day with minimal effort.
The one saving grace is that there are modded servers that discourage this in various ways, but as long as the base game is so friendly to griefers it won't be one I recommend."

19984,Rust Developers completely bent over with this new update and gave no thought to the OG players that spent hours learns Spray Patterns. Ruined game with bloom and terrible sounding guns.

19987,"the only reason i played rust is for the high skill ceiling and grouping up with a couple buddies just roaming around the map.  with the June 2nd update, the skill ceiling literally disapeared over night, it went from a game with recoil to a game with aim bloom and weighted shot patterns.  I personally put a couple dozen hours into aim train over the months that i have owned the game.  now it feels like theres no reason to play. if you enjoy the new recoil mechanics, more power to you , but i cannot recomend a game that spits in the faces of all the players who put hours and effort into actually being good at the game, and then just removes it all after testing said update for about 1 week
"
19988,ohh yaaaaaa
19989,GOOD FOR RACISM

"
19995,"great adult version of  minecraft, if youre down for a fun game and a alot of laughs would highly reccomend"
19996,Fun af just annoying zergs XD
19997,"I have 6k hours, played the game for 4 years 

honestly the new update that changed weapons / recoil / aim cone / rng killed the enjoyment for anyone who plans to get good at this game.  its not unique anymore. 

the game was on the downturn and this was their solution to appeal to streamers & new players.  its really unfortunate that's its turned into another basic game with no depth. 

 Its not the fact that recoil is changed, it actually could use a refresh.   its the fact that aimcone / bloom / rng has been adjusted to the point where its a lame point and click shooter where even if your good some jimmy will roll up and get better point and click rng on you.

The entire reason this game lasted and became popular was because over time you could get better and reap the rewards of being a dedicated player.  now you can log in for 5 minutes and be as good as someone with 6k hours in terms of weapon skill."
19998,Terrible development team
19999,they ruined the game
20000,If your thinking of getting this game. DON'T.
20001,"very good game 
"
20002,TOO MANY GLITCHES AND BUGS!
20003,"nice game, really toxic
LOL"
20004,Spelet får nya uppdateringar ofta och är ett roligt spel att spela tillsammans med nära och kära. Min enda kritik är det läskigt accepterade och normaliserade språkbruket i spelets öppna röstchatt. Där brukas språk där grova svordomar och andra fula sägelser inkluderas. Annars är det ett stadigt spel som jag skulle rekommendera till de flesta
20005,this game is good but playing with friends is better
20006,The best survival game every very fun with friends
20007,"Let me first start by saying, I've had rust since Alpha on first release, so my hours do not reflect my actual play time, but rather the newer ""polished"" version of rust.

Rust in it's current format is just an objectively bad game. There are so many tools, things to do, and worlds that can be built, but the community in of itself is so toxic that 99% of the games content will never be used. It's a constant struggle of survival in any scenario as mobs of people cheat, break rules, or grief you from ever wanting to play this game. 

I could not tell you of a game that has a more harsh learning curve than rust. The weapons are difficult to aim properly, and even harder to control with recoil. This is a game where you'll need hundreds of hours to ever come close to being accurate with a weapon, and EVEN STILL there is going to be servers full of cheaters who will just purchase the game again using a VPN for $3 from another country if they're banned.

The economy of this game is ""scrap"". Pieces of rubbish that you use to learn or create other tools. This is also where the unforgivingness of Rust truly shines. Players can have every possible blueprint created or learned, and they will still find the naked guy who just spawned 5 seconds ago and kill him for his resources. On top of this, you'll be dying to elements, animals, and NPC's. 

This game could be so much more, but streamers have encouraged this game to be more about griefing other players, as opposed building something out of the sandbox world."
20008,"It's like real life. 
You get fucked over and over and over and over again."
20009,fun
20010,It's rust bro who tf wouldn't play it. Just no lgbtq crap.

20013,its good
20014,"good
"
20015,i mean i wasted hella time just to be offlined so have fun
20016,Do not try to play this garbage game solo because they removed the skill gap making it harder for solos to out skill a team and making it harder to play for mainly solos. Also I don't know what they were thinking when they published this update lol removing most of the og players and letting the newgens take over at this point they're destroying their game and more than likely everyones gonna get so bored of this bad update that they're all gonna leave because instead of the developers fixing the performance bugs instead they change the whole unique part of the game because new players don't understand that to get good at a game you have to put time into the game and I'm not saying that you need to sit in ukn all day. Btw to all the kids that bought hella skins might wanna sell them fast because this game isn't gonna last long!
20017,black tree people with spears got me

20034,love it just sad i didnt get to see old recoil
20035,"Game was amazing with the new updates every month, new items to mess around with, new monuments and everything. Until the big update that was shit and changed the whole recoil pattern for no reason, all they had to do if they really wanted to get rid of the skill gap so badly was change the recoil pattern to something just as hard as the old recoil was but completely different. but not as easy as it is now. but instead they changed the whole recoil pattern against so many people saying no and they have now lost 67k+ people since the new update. Good job face punch your fucking stupid."
20036,"Build a base or home, fight other players to obtain loot, and make friends! Rustamazing game thats become a full time job now! Rust recently added a new update that changed the recoil of guns, making it  more new player friendly, allowing noobs like you and me to have a chance against sweats! In my opinion, it was money well spent :)"
20037,more servers in sea pls
20038,want to lose brain play this game :)
20039,good if you have friends and no life

20093,"Rust is definitely not for everyone and even though it has been in Early Access for ages it has come a long way. From a game that required you to play for numerous hours to just be able to use one of the automatic weapons to a game where a player from console can join on pc and gradually learn the game at a proper pace without developing a hate relationship with the game. In my opinion, Rust is fun with friends and has a great love-hate relationship that a lot of games have now a days. Definitely recommend this to someone who is new as long as they are prepared to build a love-hate relationship with the game."

20177,"I miss the old rust.
too much new shit imo, was more interesting when it was just naked ppl on an island.
now theres helicopters and npcs and quests and underwater looting and timed loot crates and crosshairs and its just lame.
not to mention how unoptimized it is for lower spec systems. I used to have a 1060 with 8gb of ram and that used to be perfectly fine, but slowly over time the feature creep made it actually unplayable on it, I upgraded my pc to a rtx 2060 and its still laggy on medium graphics settings.
oh yeah and the hackers lol but whats new. rip vanilla servers.
bad game"
20178,poop
20179,"I have now been rusting for a few days. I have been playing it for 3 hours and will play this game more in the future. I started by watching it on youtube when I saw a guy playing rust think it was 2018. But I did not have the money to test this game so I only got to watch it. Until now, I got money for it and bought it. I think it's a very fun game and would recommend it to all gamers. If you have the money for rust, buy it. It's worth every penny. then because I have lots of other games so I have not been able to play rust so much. Because if you only play rust, it can get boring. If you would not be sure to buy it I would recommend you to check more on youtube. Because if you think it's fun to watch, it'll be fun to play it too. Adios mis amigos y que la pasen bien"

20196,fun but nightmare fuel in solos friends make it a blast
20197,"To be fair, i understand that this game is designed for a pure competitive gameplay, which is something that i don't like, nor take enjoyment in being part of.

My positive review is due to the fact that i have only played on a PVE setting with strict PVP conditions (Only during purge night). I also do not play alone, as i find myself lost without purpose due to the game design, though with friends (specially with someone that understands and enjoys the game) it is a blast of an experience."
20198,fire game tho ong
20199, Good game overall just hard to get into if you don't know what your doing.

   Conclusion
╰─━━─╯

Rust can be the most rewarding and the most unrewarding game at times. The whole basis of the game is to survive in the wilderness while fending off dangerous animals, NPC's, and other players looking to steal your loot. The game (although extremely infuriating at times) is a work of art. It genuinely is beautiful and has basically unlimited replay value. If you are a solo player, the game is much more difficult and progression becomes tedious at times. With that being said, the game is still very fun while solo. If you do want to play with friends in a group, the game becomes much easier and fun at times but can get much more hectic quicker. All together, it's a great survival game that I believe should be played by everyone at least once. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but Facepunch has executed a vast survival game brilliantly with very minor/minimal issues.

20230,"I am a 61 yo grandmother, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single grandmother to my grandson, who is 14 now. My grandson got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my grandson, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my grandson for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my grandson since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought me and my grandson closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my grandson many happy memories."
20231,watch out for this game its addicting but it will take your life forever
20232,Game is addicting and leads to gambling on certain sites proceed with caution.
20233,"Tutorial :
1. Spawn on the beach.
2. Get Killed by a guy with guns/by a horde of nakeds.
3. Respawn again and get loot

Repeat.

20249,good game
20250,"If there was a guide to selecting the right server for you, this game would be much bigger. Took me and my friends a while to mess around with it but honestly, this game is so much fun. 

Pros - Play the game how you want. Depending on the server you can focus on building, PVP, farming, PVE, a mix of some or all. Fast progression, vanilla progression, or just chaos. 

Cons - About to lose my job I cant stop playing. Also insanely toxic community. Every kid on summer vacation is a racist. Hopefully they can monitor cheating and racism a bit better."

20271,"solid, fun game to play. To get the most out of the game, I personally think you need around 3-4 other people to play with at least. While in certain servers, experience plays a large role in how you enjoy the game there are a variety of servers that serve different peoples preferences such as a more chill game or more hardcore. One issue is that it is quite time consuming if you plan on doing especially well at the game"

20366,"Rust, I've watched people play it more than I've played it... I finally have a new PC that can run the game so my journey is about to begin... the game (from what I have watched on Twitch and Youtube) is a game of skill, determination, and survival smarts... you get killed... A LOT, and this will happen until you start learning how to avoid these situations and loot faster and when you get a full day (IRL) to yourself and just grind on 1 server for like 8 hours it feels like you are in the game and there's nothing happening around you, you become fully immersed in surviving and creating your 200 foot tall base and reinforcing it until even a nuke can't damage it, so yeah I 100% recommend the game, just make sure you have the Specs to play it (10 gb RAM - 20 gb free storage space) 10/10 I like Rust 👌👌👌"
20367,Everyone is so racist
20368,"very fun, when you play you have no sympothy of time so time just feels very fast. Several hours can go by without even knowing and is just very intertaining when playing with others"
20369,"The weak die and the strong will live. You can gather strength through numbers or through determination. It is a game, but one where trust is loose, hope can fade, people driven into insanity, and impossible to fight agaisnt the odds without help.
"
20370,"If you love getting chased by naked men as soon as you spawn in and them yelling slurs at you this is your game. You will sit and grind for hours and get loot or not but, then to get your base pummled by rockets while your sleeping. This game will tear your mental stability to pieces. But all in all 10/10 would recommend."
20371,yes
20372,"Top tier game
"
20373,"Do not buy this game. The game is so insanely badly coded that it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an HOUR to load into a server. There is no way to fix or change this. The game is not fun enough to justify this. If you crash, good luck. Back in for another hour wait."

I personally don't like the getting robbed by people who may not even know how to play.  Basically it's us farmers versus a whole world of spastic Modern Warfare/Fortnight children.  I hate everything about the ""Chad"" culture, so I stick to PVE.  Game is awesome, if you want to die every three seconds and learn the hard way choose a large PVP Server.  The people not murdering and robbing you are cool though."

20399,"It was quick to figure out that unless you were unemployed or played with a massive group that you would not get anywhere in this game. Some examples being grinding for days just to get offline raided and lose everything over and over by players who seem to only have this game in their steam library. I reckon this game could be fun if you're a school kid or adult deadbeat who can invest 12+ hours each day. In conclusion I would only buy this product if you are unemployed, in school or have a large group which individuals in different time zones in the world in order to have players around the clock. Without that expect to rise and grind whenever you can until a team finds your base and deletes all your progress."

Goodbye rust, its been real."
20448,THE BEST GAME ALIVE I KILL ZERZE
20449,"Wake up on the beach, naked with only a rock and a torch. Smack a tree. Smack a rock. Try to work your way up from there. Die. Lose everything. Rinse and repeat.

That's Rust in a nutshell for you. Brutal survival where your biggest enemies are everyone else you meet.

Visually, it looks solid. Not the prettiest, but good enough. Could be better optimized, though. If you're not on a high-end system, you'll probably notice your system running hot, and the load times can be pretty egregious.

Not much to say in terms of audio. There's a bit of music, and it's actually pretty good. Too bad it's very sparse.

Mechanically, the gameplay's fairly simple. More realistic Minecraft. Gather supplies, craft better supplies, build a base and try not to die and lose your stuff as long as you can- although it only delays the inevitable. Satisfying to play, devastating to lose. The gunplay is satisfying enough, and some of the latest changes help make it a bit more balanced. If you're a primitive like me, you'll mostly be running bows, spears, and melee, though. They function well enough, but there's nothing too fascinating with them. It's a far cry from the complexity of Mordhau or even the fun simplicity of Skyrim. The building mechanics are alright, if a bit barebones, more focused on snap-grid type construction which is fairly limited in what you can make. You'll typically see little stone boxes and octagonal towers more than not, and that's partly because of the limited designs, and also because of the necessity to design optimally against attack rather than make anything particularly interesting.

One of the best features is the Wipe. Maps and blueprints get reset regularly, meaning everyone has to start over from nothing. This keeps anyone from becoming too dominant on any server that others are effectively blocked out

The biggest thing to be wary of is the other players. This game is... very competitive. You can't really trust someone if you don't know them personally, and 9 times out of 10, they'll kill and rob you on sight, and there's a good chance you'll be called some form of racial slur or something equally derogatory and hateful. I'm not gonna lie, it's a toxic place. For that reason, my recommendation is to avoid vanilla servers at all cost. Play community servers, usually a noob server or something that has a 'No KOS' (Kill-On-Sight) tag is the best bet to get a decent Rust experience that offers everything, but in a more laid-back, enjoyable experience.

Another thing is that, by the nature of the game being an always online and evolving situation between wipes, this is a game that effectively demands constant attention and play. If you're not online regularly to ensure you have the materials to keep your buildings from decaying, gathering your farms, or simply ensuring someone hasn't blasted it all to kingdom come and taken everything, then things aren't likely to go well.

If you've got the time, and you want the challenge of a game like Rust, I'd enjoy it. Just stick to the safer servers and be wary of others. There's plenty to enjoy if you just take it easy and explore more than just trying to ruin someone else's day. Though that can be fun, too. If they deserve it."

20483,you will suffer but good suffering
20484,even tho it takes 45 min js to load and then another hour to load into an actual game. its worth it if your willing to spend hours js loading then hours grinding just to get trap in a cave and die

20493,"While i do appreciate the frequent new content that gets dropped each and every month. It will 9 times out of 10 just result in  backlash (rightfully so). the game is trying to put out too much new content and doesn't give the player base time to adjust. and then they do a major update with way too many new concepts at once? Just doesn't make any sense. if you want a larger player base to stay onto your game this isn't how you should go about it,  Though the past is in the past and hopefully they will learn from there mistakes."

The game can be very fun, and rewarding. but it can also be time consuming, frustrating, and discouraging at points. Once you learn the ropes the game becomes easier. If you are not into farming for your stuff and being on the grind this is not a game for you. this is a great fps, survival, adventure and pvp game. i highly recommend this game, i give it a 9.7/10 only because there are a few minor things that could be done better/differently other than those few things id give it a 10/10. hope this was helpful."

20632,"I bought Rust when beta came out, and i had alot of fun with it, but eventually got bored as i made a base as big as possible and raided other houses for  more resources then i could use.

I have been letting the game develop more, and now i felt like re playing it after a couple of years of development. So i reinstalled and launched then game, but to my astonishement, i could not connect to any server to play the game...  The reason?

I own a mouse that i purchased even before i did Rust that apparently gives some sort of advantage over other mouses...
Thats some bullshit. And as of now i'm unable to play the game unless i go out and buy a different mouse... wich i dont plan on doing for as long as this one works.

On top of that after a did a little research on this ban and why it came to be, i realised that the reason had to do with ""recoil"" which seems to have been removed in a recent update. So why the fuck am i still blacklisted ??

To the developers: i appreciate the effort you guys have put in this game over the years, but its all in vain if im not able to play the game...

I started as a humble solo player and rose to become a clan leader with a meer 800 hours. From there we met tons of people on rustoria medium in which i executed my first big raid of over 50 people. I learned from that clan leaders what it takes to run a larger clan and the ins and outs of the game to progress quickly. Eventually, i graduated into ""main scene"" rust which delt with some of the highest competitive players in rust itself ranging from Burstgang, OT, Moo, zzz, Gank, Freaks and so many more. I met both some of the most toxic people ever and some of the most wholesome. Either way, the journey to get there and where i am now with the community was amazing. Now, i run my own podcast ""Main scene Tonight"" focusing on clan drama/server drama all while running my own clan. To think, it all started on the beach...."

I still think the recoil update was stupid as fuck, but you can definitely still have a fun time with friends. Solo would probably be fucked considering how guns are lasers now. Rust went from being an amazing game to an okay one, in my opinion anyways."

But now its just sad all guns are no skill to use and i think that is a huge slap in the face to all the people who spent tens or Hundreds of hours over years learning the guns spray and now any kid with 10 hrs can beam with ak or with mp5."

20740,"Simply the best game I have ever played, Don't get me wrong it sucks constantly getting raided but finding a small server and playing on it is fantastic. Find someone willing to show you the game and go from there. Honestly tho my only two complaints is not being able to customise vehicles and the fact that you need a high powered game to run it well (an rtx 3070 mobile or 2070 super will run this at 2K, 21:9 90fps, medium getting towards high). Already the best game and yet still so much could be added to this game, more content, bigger and more complex knowledge machines, larger maps, easier ability to host dedicated server games without port forwarding, rather than 1 big island multiple big islands, more soundtracks, more ways of getting places and so much more! 100/100 full marks, fantastic job Dev's and keep up the good work. Price also could come down 10$ to encourage more to play.

P.S. - Play with at least one other friend otherwise it's nowhere near as good."

20749,"The game was very fun until June 2nd with the new recoil update. Rust was unique for its gunplay being known as one of the most difficult which also meant that mastering even a few guns such as the ak was rewarding. The fact that the new recoil was only out for a week before being implemented into the main game is a joke, there wasn't enough time to review how terrible of an idea it was because of how drastic of a change it was. There was no gradual change, it was as if you went from swimming in the kid pool to being chucked into the deep end. If the devs spend 2 months reviewing the opinions and changing it to have a balance of some kind then more people would be accepting of the new changes. Also, as much as I enjoyed and appreciated the monthly updates to add in new content, the game is broken in more ways than one. If they spent a month or two, after adding in something big, optimizing the game and fixing bugs or other issues, this game would be easily one of the most enjoyable to play. There are certain changes to the game that made sense, nerfing the holo and making the p2 a viable gun were good. The noise changes for the guns was a mistake along with adding in a new lmg that originally cheaper than the ak, easier to get to, and better in every stat. It was the dumbest thing to see and honestly the game needed something to put between the t1 and t2 instead of adding a new t3 gun. Honestly the devs are more focused on listening to the streamers, who are temporary to the game instead of listening to people who have played the game for thousands of hours and can list almost every little issue in the game like its the back of their hand. The only way this game comes back now is if the devs revert the update so that there wasn't a recoil and sound change."

20751,Very good game all the updates are really good the community is great and i would roccomend to anyone that likes open world pvp.
20752,"Love this game, but be ready for the hell this game gives you lol. Its fun having a team but it is possible to be a solo just pick your fights."
20753,It's a shit game save the $40 and spend it on something worth while.

20768,(:
20769,"It's honestly sad to see how games change with money. Once the OTV servers started they slowly diminished the skill gap for this game. They started by removing dome jump. I remember when I first started this game, that jump would terrify me but as I got better with movement and just figuring out the game I slowly got more comfortable with it. Once I reached a point where I could do it without even thinking I knew at that point that I was better and the time I put in made a difference in my gameplay. And I was thankful I could see the progress of my gameplay go from dying every time I went outside to people not standing a damn chance against me. Even bigger groups I would destroy partly because I played like a rat but I could genuinely feel myself getting better. Now flash forward to today they've revamped the guns and made them take absolutely no skill. Someone can hop in the game and slap a suppressor on their gun and shoot 100+ Meters with no prior knowledge of the spray. Now I'm not against changing the sprays to an easier alternative but I feel the one they went with has almost completely got rid of the skill gap. When I started playing rust I slowly learned the spray more and more learning to spray 25 to 50. It was a huge success for me. I slowly worked my way up to 200+ meters and I loved being able to look at my old videos of me spraying 50 meters struggling to hit my shots to be able to spray reliably at 200m. I hate that some people won't be able to have that same experience of achieving different goals and feeling like your time wasn't wasted to just have the same spray as the next guy."

I prefer to play Rust on my own private whitelisted PvE/PvP server with friends with Umod plugins to actually enjoy the game without all the previously mentioned problems with other servers.  I do sometimes visit other modded servers, but only to get new ideas for my own server to make it better."

20887,so good this game is so much fun but sometimes toxic but thats what makes it funny
20888,"It's a very good game if you got the correct build for your Device. If you have anything less than the specified requirements, you'll lag out and get like 10 FPS or at least that's just for me. If you plan to buy Rust, make sure you have the correct specs."

20902,"After 4 years and nearly 6000 hours I'm uninstalling Rust. The game just isn't fun to play any more. The awful AI, the boring metas introduced by FacePunch, the low skill gun play with the latest update, the never ending, never fixed mountain of bugs and glitches in the game and dismal performance (5600x & rtx3080 btw) have combined to make for a generally miserable experience when playing. Let me describe a wipe for the average player you'll find on an official server. Load in, build away from monuments, farm PVE sites endlessly to tech tree and every item in the game, farm sulfur during peak hours, offline raid your base at 4am. Rinse and repeat. It's an incredible boring meta that most of the player base is now using. Roams don't exist anymore. The only counters you will have if you raid or take bradly, heli etc.. are just kids ratting with double barrel shotguns. Everyone's excuse for being bad is ""sCripTerS"".  The tech tree and scrap farming tunnels & labs ruined this game. The hdrp texture update ruined the maps. The base size to sulfur ratio has become so out of whack that you have to spend 2 entire days farming for a box of rockets (90) that still won't full raid most decent sized bases on the server. TC costs need to be exponentially higher. There's too many safe zones. I haven't even gotten to the latest rework of gunplay which is a total failure. It's sad because Rust was a nearly perfect game around 2019-2020 but its had such a massive decline the last two years."

20936,"The recoil update made me have a lot less fun in rust, they went from one extreme to the other. In the process they split the community and encouraged a lot of people to be extremely toxic. I have been called a scripter, UKN warrior, ... simply for not liking the new update, for example. I have even seen major content creators make fun of (polite) people in their chat for not liking the update. I have seen this happen in both directions, however most of it was definitely aimed against people that dislike the update.

I understand this was probably not the intention of the devs, but I hope they own up to their mistake and fix it.

They tried to bring in a lot of ""casual players"" but those players are not interested in rust, or play it for a week or 2 and then go back to COD (as is clear from the steam charts, a week after the update). Regardless of the recoil system, rust is just not a very casual game.

So in short, it used to be a great game, but for me personally I have been having a lot less fun since the update hit, and the community has turned extremely toxic against eachother, so I cannot recommend it anymore.

UPDATE: Uninstalled, the rust i loved is gone and i will have to accept it."

20962,"I think i am racist because of this game, the influence is not amazing but, i feel it should be experienced"
20963,"rust. the most racist sexist and homophobic game on steam.
to play this game you have to have a insane mindset ESPECIALLY AS A SOLO
a game were you will stay up till 5 in the morning so you dont get offline raided then you get off at 5:15 feeling good you wake up ready to play to see you got raided at 5:25 to the guy who has been grubbing you all day
at that stage most people give up. then there the players who play for a day straight to get there revenge on the person who offlined them < not me.
playing rust will drive you mentaly INSANE and make you rage time after time but we still play every wipe again and again
us rust players are a different breed we can do anything that comes in our way EXCEPT SEEING AT NIGHT TIME
anyways see you all another time. its time to go to sleep and get offlined

21005,"Rust is probably the best game I've played, period. The ability to create your own story, interact with other players, and build your own slice of paradise among the chaos separates Rust from any other game I've played."
21006,"Is it fun? Yes.
Do i recommend it to any of my friends or peers? Absolutely f***ing not."
21007,"Man what a game where do i even start, this game is really decent in most areas you can play it part time or full time if you have no life. If you want to play full time this game is a 6am to 3am job, long hours. Most people in this game are the nicest people i have ever meet online :). Its not like they are all racist but what is racism, i have to hand it to facepunch for eradicating racism from online world, rust really bring such a warmth to my heart. The Ai programming is the best part with myself sneaking up behind one and the scientist doing a full on  180 degree turn taking off all my health. 
i give this game a 11/10 it really does have funny moments even better with friends :)"
21008,fun game

21025,"I've spent 5000 hours in rust and the game used to be the most fun you would ever have in a video game, however the game peaked years ago and FP  has slowly ruined what made it the best game, making it too easy where it feels pointless to even try anymore. Hdrp ruined the frames and every update seems to just buff clans so everyone else can no longer have fun in the ways they want to. The game could still be fun as a new player but it wont ever hit the same as it used too."
21026,W game
21027,"The devs on this game don't understand what a brain is and how to use one. They make impulsive changes in the game to fit there dream lifestyle while they go home miserable to their 3/10 wife because they are sad. I would not advise buying this game if you want to touch grass in life. The better alternative is to buy rust on console.

21030,"Rust is a ton of fun. The regular updates add a lot to the gaming experience and make up for the main downside, the games community. If you enjoy the game for what it is, an awesome videogame, you can have a lot of fun here."
21031,Great game all around
21032,"very good game, toxic community but overall a fun game to play with friends"
21033,"One of the greatest games I’ve ever played is Rust. The game’s developers frequently update it and add new features. Bug fixes can take some time, but I don’t mind. Finding the few people who are enjoyable to play with despite the community’s nasty nature is definitely worth the frustrations. I swear it gets better as you get through the learning curve. The only thing left to do is to simplify things for individuals or small groups while nerfing group play."
21034,"Fun, very time consuming"
21035,yes
21036,reeeeee
21037,SHIT GAME DONT DOWNLOAD CAUSES GAMBLING ADDICATION LOST 4K

ps i spelled it like that for a reson
"
21064,"Tbh, this game really isnt that vibey. First of all, what kind of name is rust, next games will titled oxidation or something wack like that. Next, this game just isnt bussy, you spend some time #grinding and then a couple days later all your progress is reset, thats not based. I also dont really vibe with how i cant make my character a non-binary pansexual asexual they/them femboy catgirl, which isnt very inclusive in todays climate. You know who else didnt allow you to be non-binary pansexual asexual they/them femboy catgirl? Hitler. Hitler and Rust are the same thing."

From PvP to PvE, Casual to Hardcore, there is a server for everyone. Vanilla is the best experience, in my opinion, but there are some really great community and/or modded servers. Be careful who you trust in Rust."

Thur the years he as introduced me to ""first person shooters""  from time to time that I ended up playing for years. Infestation Survivor Stores was the first...and Now last year ... comes Rust.  I think it is the best game I have ever played.  Have over 6000 hrs on it and see no end in sight at the moment.  Ben"

21161,Very good game very fun and takes skill
21162,"k
"
21163,Game was Fun when there was a skill Gap. Now Rust has entered its HOT GARBAGE stage sadly
21164,"Here is the best rating I can give to this game after the most recent combat update. This update has been predicted to ruin the game I agree with that statement. There is no reason for veteran player to play this game anymore as the main reason they were vets is because of the time they had affored to put into this game in order to improve there skill level, sure you can still have more game sense then people but this update ruins rust #1 appeal to tons of player. The difficulty. When they remove the main aspect that has made the game so hard to begin with they remove tons of player wills to play this game. For all the people saying they dont have time to learn the recoil then either find a dif game because you need time to play the game it cannot be enjoyed fully within the 1 to 2 hours you can affored it. If you really want to have the full feel of the game then you need time. Therefore this update is dumb and dose nothing but ruin the skill level of the game. Coulda at least made the recoil much hard and or maybe even harder than before. And for all the people saying that its for scripts. Scripts were created before the recoil was even in the game. My final rating for the game is going to be a thumbs down because the game is to easy and its skill aspect has been reduced and ruined and now groups will rule the game even more then they did before. Sorry for all the solos"
21165,don't play solo
21166,Turn back before you get trapped
21167,Fun game better with friends

21179,good
21180,"I really do love Rust but this new update for recoil? I don't know man. This seems kinda fucked. You can say all you want but I miss the game actually having a huge skill ceiling. I think thats what made Rust special meanwhile now its a mix between Warzone, CSGO and Tarkov's sprays."

21231,Great game so far
21232,game is filled with disgusting ape people who have never held a conversation in their life much less with a woman. these freaks lives must be filled with so much abuse that they have been traumatized beyond belief because it is physically impossible to act like this even ingame without having some sort of mental deficiency. The only comfort i get from playing is the knowledge that if i ever stumbled across one of these inbreds i would stop at nothing to assault them.
21233,good fun game just racist

21264,"The Deanster enjoys playing this game. the possibilities they provide to the player is limitless. The exciting adventures and devastating losses make it over all enjoyable to play. Although, most of the player base is toxic and can ruin your experience, but this makes the positive ends of your Rust adventure all more lovable. I can still remember the overwhelming dopamine rush i received after my first raid.

 That being said play this game at your own risk, if you can't handle toxicity or losing your base overnight to a restless goblin, then don't play this game.

but that's okay, because then i just troll those people with my rock and torch, now including with the megaphone XD i now can be loud and troll them hahahahahaha
Sometimes, i end up getting me some bonus loot for doing so, as they want me to leave them alone..

21312,"You think you know what it takes to survive? Can you make a hatchet that will in return give you wood to make a temp log box to safely cook food, and smelt iron? If you said yes, think again . . . Rust isn't fair, not one bit. You will have spent hours using that hatchet to make a massive base, a place of goods, a strong hold! However it takes one little naked rat to find you, find your location to study your every move. . . to watch when you go out for goods, or when you go take on a clan that took out one of your own. . . that naked, the one you walked past 100 times before, the same naked you figured was harmless. that's the naked rat that will sneak into that wonderful unraid-able strong base you and your pals spent days creating.

21323,"Alright, the game itself is amazing. It has its issues especially some very triggering ones for a survival game with building. However if you've ever heard of this game you probably know about the community. KOS is a real thing (kill on sight). The community is truly the worst of the worst in the gaming industry. I would go as far as to say its worse than league of legends and overwatch, two games notorious for their toxic communities. Rust has some of the most toxic, racist, scummy assholes. They're all basement rats. Unless you want ruin your mental or have friends to play with, don't buy this game. It's awful Solo. There's better games to play. Oh and the performance optimisation is not great either lol."

21412,"After playing on and off for a few months, this game is really fun in that it provides a way for you to constantly improve, set up bases and gather materials/weapons and upgrade them. The progression style is certainly one of it's positives as everyone starts over bi-weekly and gives the chance for new players to have an equal playing field. 

The community however is quite toxic especially in the more popular servers. Spawn killers and people purposely ruining the game for new players is common and unless you learn how to avoid other bases and get lucky as in you build your base before getting killed, you'll have to get used to spending hours without really progressing. If you can deal with frustration and the feeling of starting over constantly, this game provides a challenging experience that definitely gives big rewards. 

Also know that no base is unraidable. If a group of 10 players decide to attack your base, they will be able to so don't grow complacent and be prepared to login and find yourself starting from zero again."

They need to understand rust isn't a game meant for streaming. No one wants to watch hours of farming they want to see action straight away. The devs changing the recoil and making it RNG is whats going to kill this game. The streamers and new people will play the game for a month max and leave. Trash game but use to be the best by far."

21505,"Ive been playing games since the N64, to the 360 and one x and now a pc. The main reason i paid 1400$ was to play rust at its fullest experience. i know what makes a game bad and what makes a game unforgettable. Rust is and unforgettable experience that you don't get anywhere else, from bow fights to countering cargo and even being in a heli chase, moments you cant forget. out of every game i played rust is number 1, outside of campaign based games. The most recent update feels amazing, it looks great and up to date, even the cross hair i can handle, along with the hit markers, but the recoil itself was an absolute fucking kick in balls 10 times over. rng based fighting and easier pray control was not the move to make. It feels like fortnite all over again. I think instead of random recoil they could make brand new patterns for each gun. all the new players can practice their sprays along with the people who have sprayed for 5 years. everyone starts at the starting line! the games keeps its competitiveness and allows new players to not be left in the dust. rust is a hard game its always been hard but that's what makes it rewarding when you put the time in. But now the games is being made easier for everyone. I recommend this game to the new players its so worth it but i cannot participate no longer :("

I don't like the direction the Devs are taking the game now and I'll cherish all the memories. I was drawn to the game for its unique pvp and hilarious social interactions. Tried one wipe on Rustoria and it was just full of suppressed weapons and LMG's on roofs. The satisfaction of winning fights was gone for me as well. The stagnation and pace of the game with every one sitting and shooting was the Cherry on top for me. GG

21550,"I often praised the developers, not many push monthly updates and content at the rate Facepunch do but since the ""OTV"" surge in players they have really feel out of touch with the veteran players and failed to listen to most feedback then June 2nd they butchered their game. Read into the history of H1Z1 and Daybreak games, I might be wrong but it I believe Facepunch have just done the same to their game. 

The game has transitioned from a game with a high skill ceiling and a steep learning curve to a game with a very low skill ceiling with very little to learn other than the controls and basic map knowledge.

I'm not gatekeeping and was never against making the game more accessible. This update was rushed, testing lasted [b] 1 Week [/b], keep in mind this is the biggest update that has been released since Legacy Rust transitioned into the Rust we know today.

Recoil - The pattern could've been changed to lower the amount of time investment needed, could have stayed the same but reduced, certain attachments could have been buffed but the changes that have been made remove any type of skilful gun play make every gun trivial to use. The game has now turned into who sees who first, you will die in less than 1 second to everyone regardless of game knowledge. There is no time to react, wall, or attempt to get into any type of cover when somebody shoots at you, if they see you first you are dead.

CSGO is a perfect example of a good recoil system, there is patterns but the game is still very accessible however if you take the time to learn the recoil system you will take your game to another level, I think this would have been a better direction to go in.

Sounds - On the testing branch there was ""placeholder"" sounds, a little into the testing they added the new sounds, keep in mind testing lasted 1 week so they probably had 3-4 days at most to gather feedback on them. If you are sitting in your base and somebody shoots 4 grids away it will sound like they are in your compound, the directional sound is also very bad and sometimes you can not tell at all where shots are coming from.

Optimisation - It is great that the content flow is so high and new things are being added to the game however, since the HDRP graphics overhaul the game has simply looked worse and performed worse declining with each update, it is nice to see new monuments added, small touches like the ziplines and graffiti but when performance is so bad surely it should be improved before more assets are added to the game. 

Game Filters - Whether it is reshade, nvidia game filter or some other method that you can use to change the game appearance is irrelevant. The game without sharpen, vibrance and other colour modifications is very grey dull and quite hard to see certain things especially since the HDRP update. On top of the aforementioned the developers force a PITCH BLACK night time in this game and there was a game filter that allowed you to see a lot greater than any other player leading to some people being disadvantaged. 

Disallowing these programs and not addressing the reason they are being used in the first place is the problem not the filters themselves. Another huge issue is they still work for some people making the game even more unfair as now they only work for a very few and are not available for everyone.

21551,i say nword a lot
21552,"Ever since the combat update this game has gone down hill The people who took hours to learn the ak spray dose not mean shit now, they made the game so bad... i hope they understand that they lost people playing this game and i hope they revert back.. dont see me playing this shit of a game anymore def not worth the buy and shit 100% percent"

21560,"This game is probably one of the best experiences I've had on a survival game. Starting off within the first few minutes on a server, you're encountered with some volumptuous female bodies that sound oddly like 40 year old men. Once you've began your bond with them, the plot thickens... and they back stab you by shooting you with this thing called a ""Double Barrel Shotgun"" outside your own home! It's ridiculous that the neighborhood watches haven't caught onto these hooligans disturbing the peace... Hope this helps paint the picture of the wonderful world of Rust! :)"

21573,"Really fun game with a lot of in dept content, played this game for thousands of hours but now its like playing cod, only thing missing is sliding and vaulting, maybe they will add it in 2023?
Uninstalled when combat update released since it made the game less unique.
greedy owners and developers, do not recommend anymore."

21579,  Shitty game that people with 5 hours can now be as good as people with over 1000 hours.
21580,"It's really not as toxic as it used to be, but still very toxic nonetheless, lots of cheaters, whether it be scripts or hardcore hacks.  Although it is still very bad when it comes to those areas, the game is still a master piece, several different things to do, not too hard to get good at it, and it's fun to get better and is genuinely rewarding when you do get better and practice.  If you aren't good at PVP, get good at building, or something else and then join a group with the other half of your skill and make it an effort to be a good group of players."

21616,"They removed the one thing that made this game unique, it's recoil. It allowed players that wished to take the time to learn it, to stand a chance against large clans. With proper awareness, and gun control, a solo could take on trio's. Now this is nothing more than COD or CS:GO with building."

21625,"The developers are constantly updating the game, along with the map. They're not afraid to try new things, and they're clearly not giving up on their game like so many other developers do. They care about the newer player base, adjusting recoil so its more noob-friendly, aswell as not making it bland and try making the game harder in some aspects like lowering lighting in most monuments. 
Truly an amazing game.

21698,Rust is not a bad game at all. there is severs you can play that is roleplay or like training or like pretty much anything. rust is a pain in the buns if you are having a rough time going though a wipe or you are not ready for a real sever and you think you can do good but it dont go as planed as you wanted to be. you can do any sever you want to. you can stick on that one sever and get 2k hours or more play time in a pve sever dont let anyone stop you from doing it you can do anything in rust if you put your heart into it. but to play in a real sever you gotta learn how to walk before you can run. all that matters in anyy game is fun dont matter how you do it just know.....that you are having fun. hopefuly this will help newbies or give anyplayer the comfort and the condfedence to play rust.. gl everyone :)

Other players steal EVERYTHING, no reason to grind because it just gets stolen.  No easy way to create your own solo server, if you're already raking in huge dough as a network admin you might be able to figure out the various batch files, firewall, routing, IPs, scripts, special STEAM cmd window, etc to get your server up and running, wasting valuable memory, then be unable to log into it."

21775,"IDGAF about recoil and changes made to it. What I do care about is ""Stable"" versions of a game pushing updated day after day after day. Each update requires a client patch, usually a server patch. Steam forces you to update on launching the game, but the server can runs outside of steam and DOES NOT force updates on launch, resulting in mismatched server/client versions unless a significant amount of manual restarting and patching of the server happens.

If somebody had the brains to figure out this is the bullshit that the ""experimental"" server is for, I'd be confident not calling the entire Facepunch team edge-lord idiots. But, apparently, nobody has those brains, so there you go Facepunch: You're GARBAGE. ""Stable"" servers shouldn't even require the auto-wipe they force down everybody's throats already. The fact that ""stable"" servers need small, daily updates is absolutely pathetic and demonstrates Facepunch's utter incompetence."

21784,"There's a lot to love about Rust but, to me, the core gameplay loop is flawed.

Raiding is the biggest part of Rust. You build a base and defend it from those who want to destroy it. You build strong walls, spikes, traps, shooting floors to thwart oncoming attackers. It all sounds well and good but it has one fundamental flaw: you are rarely ever attacked while you are there to defend it.

Unless you manage to be online most of the time, you and your team will likely disconnect for hours. During this time, people who did NOT disconnect will blow a hole in the side of your base, avoiding your spikes and traps and undoing your progress.

Facepunch has added Rust+ integration where you can wire up electronics in-game to send you alerts to your phone. If you've done it correctly, you can get alerted when you're being raided. But then you need to make a decision - should I abandon my night out and rush home to try to defend my base? Should I get up at 2:00am to save my guns?

Ultimately, if you want to be successful in Rust you need to be able to prioritize Rust over most things in your life.

That being said, the music is amazing, the resource gathering, crafting and the combat are all well and good. I even enjoy the building system. The electronics part of it is a lot of fun. 

But building a base will forever be a futile effort as you will constantly be destroyed by people who have far more time than you do. It is possible to play for a few hours, build a base, get some guns and have some fun shooting people. But the moment you log off for the day, you gotta be OK with the fact that everything you built today will likely be gone tomorrow. It's simply how the game works. Since people generally play on servers with low ping, everyone in a server is generally in or around the same time zone and there are generally times where most of the server is offline to sleep. Some people will stay online then and take advantage of the risk-free environment to raid bases. So if you need to sleep on a regular schedule, Rust might not be for you.

Raiding is a core part of the game. You can't have Rust without raiding - the whole game is balanced around it. I'm not saying it can't be fun but I think the entire implementation would need to be overhauled to come up with a design that doesn't just appeal to those without other responsibilities. Since it DOES appeal largely to those without responsibilities it follows that the majority of people playing Rust are kids. Needless to say, the environment is generally very toxic with kids screaming racial slurs and obscenities. Which isn't exactly an enjoyable environment.

Rust has potential to provide enjoyment for people like me who simply cannot dedicate the amount of time and energy Rust requires. Many modded servers will provide a more relaxed environment or different gameplay styles entirely. However as long as the core game is balanced around raiding, modded servers will simply feel shallow.

Overall, Rust feels like it's SO CLOSE to being something wonderful and every few months I forget about the bad parts and give it another shot but it doesn't take long to remind me."

First timers can have a bad experience while learning the ropes, my advice is to stick with it and see what kind of modded servers and communities are out there first if jumping into a Vanilla servers feels like too much.

The game's what you make it and if you find others to play with it's one of the most rewarding games out there!

ALSO, HOT TIP!
When you die, just say ""GG's Good Shot M8!"" and there's a 70% chance they will help you up and you might make a friend!"

21815,"This is going to be an unpopular opinion for older players of Rust, I already know that, and if you are reading this and thinking about telling me that I don't know anything, and that I don't have enough hours to understand, well then you're missing the point, and that's totally okay.

Rust is a harsh survival game. As a whole, it is not a game where you can hop in, make friends and have a good time, it's a grind.

Rust is basically a Rogue-like, in that every time you load up, it's the same, but a little bit different. Runs (Wipes) can be fun and last the entirety of the Servers wipe length, or you could get wiped out and have to start over after one day. You make enemies, you make alliances, you build your base and race to get better gear and weapons to stake your claim on an island of death, hoping to survive until you're satisfied.

And it's fun. Rust is a good time, if you can have a positive outlook on things, and not take the game too seriously when things go wrong, it's a great game. Whether it's the content creators putting together 2 hour movies about their wipes, Spoonkid doing whatever the fuck Spoonkid does (bless his heart), creative base builders pushing Rusts building mechanics to the limit, or just dropping in and scrambling to throw a base down and fighting for survival, the game is an amazing experience.

But there's too many people who take this game WAY too seriously. 

There are players in Rust who are under the impression, that Rust is a game you can win, and while the argument could be made that surviving until the end of the wipe is winning, Rust is just more complex than that. Some people find it a win to take a rival out of the wipe, some people find it a win to successfully online or offline raid some massive clan base, some people find it a win just to complete their favorite monuments. Rust isn't linear. What gives Rust so much replayablity, is that it's never the same. And if your soul goal in Rust is to spawn in with 7 other people, rush to be the biggest and most geared clan on the server, and wipe everyone that you see out until you're all alone in your HQ Metal Tower, then that's fine, but it's not fun to be near you. Nobody else enjoys getting shit on by 8 people who collectively can have anywhere from 25-100k hours. 

And that's why this update was necessary. 

People who couldn't buy Rust before, or didn't know about it, who have come to the game after all this time, shouldn't have to train for 1000 hours to use a gun to fight when they're already up against people who have been practicing. There is no way to make up that time, and making the gun play more accessible to a player base, means more players. More players means more diverse experiences. 

It just doesn't make sense to tell an incoming player base, ""Thank you for spending $40 on this game that you've learned about and want to try, go spend 1k hours in a PvE server learning, or hop into one of the Official servers and have a bad time til you figure it out.""

And finally, if you are giving up the game because of these changes, then you don't like Rust. It's that simple. You liked playing a game that you put time and effort into that allowed you to compete with other people who put in that time and effort, and you enjoyed destroying new players. And you can tell me that's not true, and that I'm speculating, but they same people who complained in Global about it, were the same people telling kids that they're trash and should uninstall because they don't have enough hours. Rust isn't the same for everyone, and saying you don't like that they're pandering to new players, means that you don't want the game to grow and succeed. Plus if you can't dominate with the new changes, then you weren't very good in the first place, you just trained your hand to move in a specific movement, and that shouldn't be the deciding factor in a fight. Game sense, strategy, comms, should all make way more of an impact than muscle memory.

Rust is a wonderfully fun experience, in it's own unique way, but a lot of the toxic seasoned players gatekeep and shit talk until people don't want to play the game. And if you can't shoot the guns, the majority of people killing you are telling you to stop playing, and you can't even get a base down, why would you keep playing? 

TL;DR: New changes are what the game needed, salty kids are salty, buy the game with some friends, make some memories, and go nuts.

P.S. Dude Ranch is coming back - It's currently live for testing."

21893,"Scavenged a measly existence to make a 2x2 wooden shack with a buddy. We spend the evening raising our arms to the campfire, praising Satan, before logging out for the night. I log in the next day to find a gaping hole in the wall of our shack, my friend dead, our entire savings of 8 lumber, 2 cloth, and 3 stone tools GONE!!! Luckily for me, when I logged out, my soft unconscious body fell behind the bed, and wasn't noticed by the pillagers. I collect myself, mourn my dead friend, step out into the mid day sun, with renewed resolve. Ready to survive, and rebuild again, not just for myself, but for my friend. To honor is memory. HEADSHOT!
12/10"
21894,toxic and enthralling. both the best and worst way to spend 16 hours a day
21895,gutz
21896,NEW update makes it more scary and fair for new players
21897,12222
21898,horrible to deal with 4 man roaming squads and clan members roaming in 5 man squads every single time u step out of your base for more than 10 min. its so annoying trying to make that nice play only to not realize after killing 1 the other 20 are going to rocket jump out of his ass and kill you immediately solo servers arent even active just no point in playing if ur a solo player.
21899,after a while of building and farming and then getting offlined and wanting to kill yourself and losing all social contact from people you start to not feel anything anymore

21918,2.3k hours best game I've ever played but now its horrible nothing to show for it rust made up for the terrible graphics by amazing pvp but now that gone down that drain honestly if I want any advise for rust change your game from cpu based to gpu based ( took to 10 years too long ) revert the recoil cus nobody be play this garbage anymore worst update rust could've possibly done and YES I did main ukn till I got a perfect spray but thanks to this update 500 hours of ukn and 1 million bullets fired for what? a RNG deciding if my ak recoil goes left or right like comon facepunch your best selling game is gone down the drain used to be a 5 STAR game now to 1 or 2 star at BEST

21925,"Good god... This is one of if not best game I've ever played. And i'm being completely honest as well, I've found multiple people, friends that are amazing and fun to talk to on this game. The game play is decent, the recoil is different from most games, so many key components to just boost your skill by a little bit. But rust's big up's are the people in it from angry people from Europe threatening to raid you in broken English, players who just act borderline autistic, and the nice player's who help you out. I love this game and highly recommend playing it, because you might meet some great people and have fun with it."
21926,like
21927,"It was fun screaming racist things at my friends and others but the fun had to end in June 2, 2022 when the new recoil and gun changes came out and ruined all the fun. i have dedicated all my life and life savings into this game and they give me this???!!! NAH i had to skip skool to protect the base i built because apparently i was a farm bot?? I had to steal my moms surgery money for my steam deck so i can play in sckool even though i was still a shitter... NOW that my rust days are over i can finally shower and go outside. SHOUTOUT MY slaves Goob, Sloth, yayo, snail, ogblackdude, lag, and our racist but canadian friend matt.

P.S. go fucking kys who ever decided that the new update was a good idea."
21928,Pretty trash if u ask me
21929,best game i have ever played
21930,"One of the most fun games ever if you dont take it to seriously. Hop on with some friends, screw around and grab some loot and expect some no lifes to raid your base in a few days. Ive met some of the coolest people in this game, you just have to look through the haystack of incels lol, but thats what makes rust Rust."
21931,ratio for the update complainers
21932,"This game is like a job. Very time consuming and annoying. Unless you want to dedicate your life to playing this game, I wouldn't buy it."
21933,new update ruined game dont buy this trash

21962,good
21963,"I'm new to the game. Try to imagine my disappointment when I realized I couldn't design my own avatar. I am female in rl, and my avatar looks like a cross between GI Jane and Gomer Pyle. Even old games let you customize your avatar. Yeah, but you can have 5 pages of skins for your storage box... that makes up for it. It feels like the game is not finished. You get a reluctant thumbs up for the pumpkins."

21972,Cool game with lots of potential for fun
21973,"This game will consume your soul. You will play only for the mere possibility of a dopeamine hit, which you might achive every 10 hours or so if your lucky. As soon as it hits though, you will have it stripped away from your hands by a 10 man roaming with silenced m2s."

21987,"After 9 years, they for some reason decide to change the main component of the game people spent countless hours training and perfecting. It has genuinely ruined the game in my eyes. Now the combat feels like no build Fortnite it's so bad. I don't understand why this extreme change was necessary. Not to mention adding a craft-able LMG that's arguably better than the m2. In situations like this, appealing to the casual player base will only ruin your game in the long term. This is causing a lot of your formerly dedicated fanbase to leave the game they love, and the people I think you're trying to appeal to will leave the game after a month or so anyways."

22211,dont waste your time just play cod also congrats on the dumb noobs that cant learn recoil the game is now made generally for you low IQ people its now easy to do everything so now you dont have to waste your miserable lives learning recoil
22212,Kys
22213,This is the most exciting game I have ever played.  Thank you for all your work
22214,Bunch of sweats review bombing and upset they wasted their lives training in a video game like it was some kind of Olympic sport. Recoil update was good. Game is okay.
22215,Wow! What an amazing game! It has a very helpful community (especially to new players) and is also a very pg safe non toxic game.
22216,"If you like beating naked's to death with a stone IRL, oh boy this is a game for you!"
22217,If you have no ssd you need to wait 15-30 minutes to get into a big server

22220,best game
22221,"Pretty hard to play for a beginner in this present i guess, But Real Fun and enjoyable AND chilling game, Real nice worth of buying."
22222,"Im still faszinated by that game, after such a long time they keep on working, editing that world.
Its getting better and better. A lot of impressing things to discover and fun teamplay, even if there's a lot of toxic players around."
22223,Very on edge
22224,yes

22226,very fun game

22228,"TO HAVE FUN MORE.. PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS
"
22229,"New gun update completely ruined the game, It's supposed to ""make it harder to get beamed from 200m"" and such, i get on the day after release everyone has already mastered how easy the new recoil it is. i have 1.5k hours and get clappedby someone with 50."
22230,love offlining people!
22231,Game is a massive W but the people on the game are mean like Scott fuck scott
22232,"Rust is a great PVP open world game filled with tons of interesting encounters and random events that all possible by hard work of players. PVP is nice, but when people forget about it and start to do funny stuff on the servers - its when this game becomes a true gem: you could make your own dance club, casino, marketplace etc. 
Game also filled with tons of different content and developers doing a lot to improve game with every update, hell for the past year we had: combat update, added new 3 new monuments, whole underground and on the ground railway system.
Game could be boring for starters so I'd recommend to grab yourself some friend or join some clans or groups that could teach you basic stuff, cuz you gameplay will be much more enjoyable with someone to talk to or spare your struggles with."
22233,beriberigud
22234,im not good at this game but for some reason i always play it
22235,"This game is so fuarked, I love it.
If you like suffering and somewhat enjoy it, this might be the place for you.
Imagine CBT without the CB."
22236,Great fun. Good for happy times
22237,"It's a good game to play with friends, and it's very easy to pick up on. Usually all the players are nice and respectful to new players. There are a lot of different modded servers so you can easily just hop on to a 10 times server if your new to the game, and find some of the better items to get a better feel of the game. Because if you were to hop into a regular match when you first start, you would get incredibly angry in my opinion because everyone already knows how to craft, make a base, raid, etc. So its easier to start in a 10x. overall i would give the game an 9/10."
22238,"This game is worth the money and storage. I really like rust and it is super fun with friends. You can build trap bases, build storage bases, craft guns, armor, and other stuff to then raid other bases. Raiding other bases is super fun especially the more fortified ones because you have to grind to break into them which makes it fun."
22239,best best survival game
22240,Turned me gay cant recover
22241,Thanks to this game I am racist

22376,yghyb b gfvb h
22377,"Something strange deep inside makes me consistently come back to playing this game, even though all it seems to bring is pain and suffering. Maybe its the small glimmer of hope during a wipe when you finally win a fight and get the loot back to base, or maybe its the friends/foes you make along the way. 

No wipe is ever the same, and no other game makes your heart beat so intensely when everything is on the line. That is why I love this game, and what encourages me to come back time and time again. 

Everyone should give Rust a chance, once you eventually grip the mindset the game requires, things will start to work out in your favour. 

Just remember, you're going to die... A lot!"
22378,I love this game FOREVER
22379,it good
22380,"gud game

22386,THIS IS A AMAZING PVP ONLINE GAME. WITH AMAZING FEATURES I WOULD FOR SURE BUY THIS GAME!
22387,
22388,aaaaaaaaaaafggggggytttttt yea
22389,"Rust is one of those games where its really good at good moments. However, it's also one of those games you loathe and wonder why you are playing this piece of S*** game when it's bad, and there can be a lot of bad moments. In saying that, there are very few games like Rust. Games that give you an adrenaline filled rush during a firefight, or raid, or base defense. The downside is you have to make Rust a full time job in order to play and see everything the game has to offer. If you don't, you will have a bad time. It's not for everyone, but it has its moments."
22390,Best Game.
22391,goodie
22392,its fun
22393,If you like children screaming at you and 40 man clans raiding the base you put down five minutes ago and not to forget the door camping this is the game for you.

22413,New recoil update changed the game a lot. Lot more focus on game sense and knowing things to do and angles to push rather then learning recoils for weapons. 
22414,This is the biggest risk reward game on steam with highs and lows like no other
22415,great game def worth buying way better with friends if you can but still amazing if solo and great customs servers to even practice if your new or a little rusty if haven't played in a while
22416,good
22417,ABSOLUTE Shit devs wont listen to the OGs and only care for money.
22418,honist reviw this game is super fun and good its not as fun if you have no friends to play with but if you do ike me the game is super fun its better to play in the summer when you can grind and when your not in school definetly worth the munny

"
22436,"like most games, the community ruins it. I've had some very fun and good interactions on Rust but the game is a serious waste of time in my opinion, especially since the graphics are not good at all for low end pc's and lag the game to the max unless all graphics settings are on 0 and even then it still lags."

22445,They ruined the game with this update
22446,"This game cured my cancer

I was a poor boy in hospital with no fun or joy until my dad bought me a pc with rust on it. I got to experience racist homophobic players who would make fun of my cancer and it made me very sad so i emailed facepunch and they came to my hospital. They said they will kill them irl for being a naughty boy. All of their life savings was spent on my cancer and i was cured.

I am now a 29 year old man working in my local asda and have never touched rust since. Good game if you have cancer

"
22447,"This game is so fun, the players are friendly and very polite, the best community i have ever seen.
In my opinion this game represents our society very well.

22451,"Rust is a shit game. anyone who loves it will tell you that. Please for the love of god, play this shit."
22452,good
22453,"The game in itself would actually be incredibly good, but, right now, there are so many issues that make it almost unplayable. 

1. To be able to run the game properly (or at least in an acceptable way), even with the lowest graphics settings, you need a top tier pc (with the recommended requirements your pc will likely struggle).

2. You also need a top tier internet connection, otherwise you have no chance for a normal gameplay (the game will frequently freeze, lag and disconnect).

3. To be somewhat competitive on any server you need a ton of experience (the game isn't exactly noob friendly).

4. You cannot really play on your own on most of the servers, considering big clans will have a huge advantage against any solo player (the game is mostly designed for group playing). 

5. This isn't a game that you can play one or two hours a day: you need to fully commit and dedicate a large portion of your time (very large) to actually compete against others and have any fun.

6. The game has one of the worst communities you can find online: racism, vulgarity, anger and hate speech are incredibly frequent during the interaction with the other players and most of the time are even tolerated by servers and mods.
 
7. The base game does not include a large part of the available content, missing interesting dlcs and items. This goes against any form of roleplay you could be interested in (to play the banjo and the trumpet right now I would have to spend 10 euros).

8. The cheating problem in this game is actually huge: you could lose hours and hours of progress in two seconds to a cheater, and it happens a lot of times, too frequently to be acceptable. The anti-cheat is a joke and you can only put your hope in the admins. 

I could keep going, but the list already seems long enough. 
My advice would be to save yourself the 40 bucks, as well as your 3k hours (don't make my same mistake).There are way cheaper games that are far more enjoyable. God play CS or Lol, or any other game actually.

22505,good game but there slowly starting to ruin it
22506,"I have watched this game from day 1. I never really wanted to play it as I am so bad at high tension PVP . as the years went by I forgot all about Rust until one day on YouTube, auto play decided I was going to watch Comomo_10. I think that was in 2019 -2020. that led to Oblivion, Stevie, Friduwulf and a few more. the content was so funny or well made and the game had grown so much over the years that I just fell in love. The other day I was waiting for a sale but just got the ""Rust Itch"" and got it at full price. This game is crazy fun. I kind of know how to play it from all the videos I have seen but man is aiming going to take time to master. building is so fun and smooth, the world is beautiful all day, the night is so dark LOL. all in all I knew going in I would love this game, even if I learn playing on zero/low pop servers. I highly recommend you get this game if you have been doing what I did and watching from the sidelines. 10/10"

22529,"Disappointed the admins decided to go with the new recoil and completely fuck over all their OG players. The whole point of Rust was for it to be a difficult and grinding sort of game so that when you first joined up you weren't instantly as good as the higher hour players. It gave Rust the perfect competitive side and also that mentality to grind the hours to become a better player. The admins have really let down their original player base just to get a few extra bucks, next thing you know Rust will end up like Fortnite and not have a player base anymore. Personally I'm uninstalling but each to their own. Good luck Rust."

They think of streamers streaming their game so more people can get into the game. but atleast 10,000 people have already quitted and im apart of the 10,000 not sure what they were thinking on this one, not just that but all the other updates like underwater labs. its so easy to get look now and you usually dont have to fight for it.  p.s the new guns sound gay and they spray is just pulling down. - sincerely big boy"

Super positive change for new imcoming players and good to see change. For existing players I know it leaves a salty taste to the person that spend 100 hours a week in aim training to play the game but I'm sure too you will realize you will spend more time playing the game and not dealing with the Silly Snake Spray of every weapon. Good Luck to everyone playing the game and I would recommend"
22604,rust
22605,Rust is the only game u can play for hours on end and it's humbling you can have beautiful moments and hardships in the matter of 5 minutes it's an emotional roller coaster and always will be but that's what give the game its life. One of the only games in the world you can find yourself addicted to all the time but it's different from other games in the fact that your time isn't riddled with micro transactions or pay to win systems. Its gaming at its purest form. It's what all games should feel like and the devs clearly care about the game compared to other games on the market adding content regularly sometimes it's too much but no games gonna be perfect and that's why this is the best game i've ever played and it will always be remembered as a part of my childhood.

It not only was a super brave move for Facepunch to do, considering it would hit their longest standing players the hardest, however they did it out of the betterment of the game itself, and the community. Sure it might be a bit more like some of the other FPS games out there now, but it also doesn't feel as if you're climbing a mountain until you reach the summit with everyone else, its now a plateau where everyone can finally fight in a more equal footing.

First of all, game is only about ""farming"". Yeah you gotta work your ass off the entire time. Aaaand then we have people who STEAL your items by killing you. Yes, remember the items you farmed? They're all gone now. Start farming again, this loop is the only thing you cannot escape in this game. ( you can even escape a helicopter crash too but not farming lol) anyways, the game is not for me since I like the items I farmed to stay. Also the cost of the game is ridiculous!"

That being said, i still vastly enjoyed the 6,000 hours i played before this review and would 100% state that my time playing has made rust my all time favourite."

22676,"I thought long and hard about whether or not I was going to recommend this game or not. Rust has such a special place in my heart. I first purchased this game in it's early access phases, and watched it grow into what it is today.

If you asked my a couple years ago whether or not I recommend this game, I would've told you it's by far the best game ever made! 

What changed my mind? 

In short, the development team unfortunately lost vision of what I believe the foundation of Rust was supposed to be. A brutal survival game that focused on a BALANCE between PVP and base building. Throughout the years, its seems every update pushes further and further away from the balance, and more in line with what we've seen with any other game that has gun; battle royale. 

The building mechanics of this game were fantastic, then it got forgotten. Even though youtube is filled with build exploits that secure bases to the max, the development team has yet to address that it is an ISSUE that players need to exploit building mechanics in ways they weren't designed to do, simply to be better fortified again people who solely focus on raiding. Have a full blown raid strategy is fine, thats apart of the game, but the limitations on the defensive side is horrific. Someone that jumps into a fresh wipe and focuses solely on base building has 0% chance of survival if a person that is focusing solely on C4 gets ahold of them first. There is no built in opportunity to have close to equal chances against an offensive strategy. The best you can do is grind for Tier 5 Armored doors, which take the same amount of C4 to blow through than a Tier 2 Garage Door..... like what? That's not balanced, and players will quickly learn that any other strategy than being a nomad that grinds to raid is the only truly successful route to take in Rust.

And that's what it is now.... a server filled with nomads that raid as soon as possible, and quickly diminish the population of the server to be a war between the toxic. 

How did they address this? They removed the ONLY last balancing feature that kept PVP somewhat hard to master. Previously to the most recent update, all guns had a very difficult learning curve to master the recoil. This prevented a numbnut from hopping in and just taking over with PVP. It forced people to grind and learn the combat mechanics before going into full blown PVP mode. It forced people to learn how to Rust..... hide, build, defend, and scavage the land to give yourself a better opportunity to survive in a SURVIVAL GAME. 

Now, even that is gone. There is no more reason for anyone to learn to Rust. The new recoil update turned Rust into Warzone.... you can hop in, never learn to craft, never learn to build, and simply have warfare immediately because the recoil pattern is quite literally exactly what COD games have in place. 

Rust is no longer the Rust I fell in love with, and it's truly sad to see."

22682,its good
22683,Great game
22684,It takes so long and basicly 4-5 hours to load in and you also need about a 5-6k dollar pc just to be on 200fps horrible and you need a more than decent about of storage to play.
22685,game is absolutely fun but keep in mind that there are a lot of sweaty and toxic players
22686,russia shit cantri Rust shit game
22687,this game is awsome there is nothing bad
22688,This is the worse game you can buy not because of the most toxic community you can ever have (even worse than league of legends) and not because of the game blowing a load on your screen making you perma blind if you are shot in anywhere that is considered cold. No the main reason why the game is horrid is that the AI in the game has aim bot and even with end game gear you still get beamed down by 1 AI that will make any other player you face seem like the newest noob that has never touched a mouse in years.
22689,Don't play this
22690,good game but you really do have to commit to it
22691,WOOOOOW this game really took a turn to shit! what the hell is this combat update forget my fucking 1k hours in this game they dont mean shit cause little timmy over here who just bought the game can beam better than me not to mention the shit gun sounds they where just fine before what the hell. this game is so aweful the last update that was actually good was when they released tunnels. no i do not recomend this  game at all anymore the developers dont listen to any one and honestly have ruined their game. u guys suck facepunch
22692,"Go to a lighthouse to break stuff down, hear a boat outside. Naked guy gets out of boat and we open fire. He tries to get back into the boat and starts tearing off when we headshot him. He falls out of boat - boat keeps going. We make a raft to go get the boat, and my friend wants to try driving it. We both stand up, and I drop the paddle to give it to him. It falls through the boat. We swim the rest of the way to the boat. Get a scuba tank. Take scuba tank out to wrecked ship and loot a computer. Pull up to another location to try to break stuff down, get killed but not before I take out one of their guys too. 11/10 would recommend."

22697,"Still the best game of its kind as far as I'm concerned, if you don't know what to expect going in chances are it will be a brutal toxic experience at first but engagement is optional in most cases if the toxicity is too much for you. Personally I like the new changes to the guns and recoil and feel the survival PvP experience is still unmatched if that's the kind of game your looking for. I wasn't a fan of the gun sounds before and they're much more tolerable now and sound closer to what I'm used to in games."

22748,"After playing the game for 300+ hours. The game was great and fun at the beginning as the learning the old assault rifle recoil pattern and eventually getting better at it, but to then ruin it by releasing a new recoil and only spending a hour on it and already mastering the recoil. Literally took the fun and determination factor out of the game. It was fun but releasing the new recoil just made it easier and boring, its either ""get seen"", killed instantly before actually getting a shot off. Now people like me who spent very little time compared to those who spent long hours (3,000+ or more) are now on the same level and playing field. It would have been simple to make the recoil  pattern a simple ""S"" pattern without the sudden random kicks off to the left and right of the on the assault rifle making it easier but somewhat difficult to learn. However the new sounds are ""eh"" but the recoil patterns on the smgs are good as it gets rid of the long range fight using an smg..."
22749,"Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish-brown oxide formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the catalytic presence of water or air moisture. Rust consists of hydrous iron(III) oxides (Fe2O3·nH2O) and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)3), and is typically associated with the corrosion of refined iron.
Given sufficient time, any iron mass, in the presence of water and oxygen, could eventually convert entirely to rust. Surface rust is commonly flaky and friable, and provides no passivational protection to the underlying iron, unlike the formation of patina on copper surfaces. Rusting is the common term for corrosion of elemental iron and its alloys such as steel. Many other metals undergo similar corrosion, but the resulting oxides are not commonly called ""rust"".

you can challenge players or groups to battle you can have as many people as you want up to 8 players in a team depending on the server you wish to play.

i definitely recommend this game it is very fun but can be frustrating at times if you're a persistent person you will love this game. :)"

22805,"If your someone who is looking to buy the game then read this. I would have recommended the game if they didn't release the new recoil update. If your someone who wanted to actually play a hard game that took time to get better at and it wasnt like cod that every gun had no recoil like me then your not in the right place. This game used to be a game where it was known for having hard recoil, that made it different from the rest of the other games, but now its like cod or ever other fps game. Where people with 10 brain cells and 1 hour can beam like someone who had 1k hours. Everyone who says to stop crying about the update don't know what they are talking about, because the only thing that made rust different from every other damn game was that it was actually hard and took time to get better at. And for all yall saying that scriptors are sad becasue everyone else has a chance to beam now is just supporting the point of the game losing all its difficulty. Now like yall said everyone seems like they have scripts because all the guns have no recoil or diffuculty to it. I have around 830 hours and im considering uninstalling, the game is no fun anymore, I cant even tell the difference between an Ak or tommy anymore and semi guns can shoot as fast as a automatic rifle without having barely any recoil to it."
22806,is like fortnite but hard to build so 3/10
22807,"great game but some advice would be dont start on the main servers as a beginner you will learn faster but you also wanna stop playing faster. warm up with low player servers and or modded server to get  just for the game. one your used to it its the most insane game you will ever play

22822,"After changing the recoil of the guns, Rust has lost a lot of its uniqueness. The bullets/shooting is RNG now and the audio is extremely glitched. The game definitely is not worth the time investment anymore to learn about the game as it is no longer as rewarding. Would not recommend."
22823,"This game uses the Easy Anti-Cheat software to stop cheaters in their game, however it does not work how it is supposed to. I have played this game since 2017 and have logged over 1400+ hours in it and was banned over a year ago instantly out of nowhere by an EAC autoban. Obviously coming as a shock to me at first I wondered if this was a mistake or something so I contact FACEPUNCH themselves, they tell me that RUST bans are handled by EAC themselves so I go over to their appeal system. I have written over 5 appeals and emails to them and have not gotten a single response. Not to my email, google+, steam support, or anything. This is absolutely terrible customer support to a veteran player of their game. 

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU VALUE YOUR 40 USD.

Do not pay for skins, buy their DLC or support this game at all. There will possibly come a time where they ban you for NO reason and give you no support to help the problem.

Easy Anti-Cheat is a terrible anticheat software that barely works half the time, when I was able to play the game I was getting triple headshot by cheaters from across the map with AKs and nothing is done. It relies on mass reporting which can be used as a way to abuse the system as well. 


DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, YOU WILL GET RAPED BY EAC."

22847,"disappointing. I finally found a fun game that I could grind and have fun time with my friends. now gone. Sad that loyal players who loved the grind and who played for years now their grind is for nothing. The reward of grinding is gone. The sense of getting better at rust is gone. I was bad at ak spray and mp5. I could be in a perfect spot and could maybe kill someone. Now i can triple ppl. I played thursday and friday and killed many ppl and won many fight but felt like I haven't accomplished nothing. I had every gun, had boom, had a good base, but felt nothing.The grind and challenge to get good is what mad rust what it is. On the facepunch website thay have a quote that says the following,""Rust is one of the cruelest games on steam, and that's what makes it so compelling."". Is this referring to the fact that 20% of your shots hit or that no one knows what gun someone is shooting, or maybe that fact that they took away the fun part of rust, the grind. This update is to get newer players into rust and grow the game, its done the opposite. Another point was to reduce the power of scripts, sure you reduced that, but now all the players who hate the game are now going to cheat because they won't play the game again. The last point was to improve the game and make it better and more fun. That has failed. I have a hard time finding any joy from that game. Now in rust little timmy is good and can spray a gun. Now 8 year old blooprint viewers run this game because the better players see the game is bad. You saw that blooprint couldnt get better in his 10k hrs so u make the game easier. Save your money and don't pay the streamers and youtubers to say the update is good, let it speak for itslef if you think its good. Rust is dying because the heart of the game and purpose of the game are GONE. Please revert the update. For the joy of players and the game. Dont disregard loyal old players because when has that worked out for a game. dont follow your previous thinking of dont worry, dont grind we will make the game easier. SAVE THE BEAMERS NOT THE STREAMERS.

22869,YES
22870,"Gunplay is now entirely RNG, mind as well roll a dice instead of fighting. I've been fine with most updates but this is the worst update hands down. I still love the game for the memories, but I doubt I will play this game anymore. If they change the recoil back or remove the bloom then maybe I'll come back. I just wish FP would stop listening to streamers who rarely play the game though that would be nice."
22871,"The New Gun/Recoil Update is so bad its unfair to all of the other players that spent there time getting the old recoils down now it takes no skill to kill someone at all, so now all of the good players are trash that devoted there time into this game. They are going to start to lose people if the don't remove this update its turning into Call of Duty with a open world map with guns that you can craft. 3/10 for now"
22872,I love it. It is a very fun interactive game where you can build and survive and fight with other people.
22873,"Hello everyone in the rust community I have been playing rust for 10 k + hours over multiple accounts. I cant say this enough, that this has been the worst update to this game. Rust dev's want to make the game easier for new comers to the game. understandable, but this is not the way you should have approached it. The recoil was not hard to learn at all maybe 200 hours over the course of a few weeks of practice and you can become fairly decent with most weapons. the problem isn't the recoil in the game its the clans, the 20 + member clans that now dominate the game even more. The recoil was the only way to fight off clans due to the skill gap of skilled players compared to someone who has to play in a clan of 20 to be traded for. This is not a fix to anything but making the game more unplayable due to large groups being able to shoot any weapon without even trying. I will now be quitting rust because of this update, hopefully the dev's will see that very few if any likes this update on recoil change. The sounds of the weapons are awful you cant even tell what weapon is shooting they all sound like a paintball gun. I hope the dev's read reviews because i have been looking for hours at reviews and reading them and no one is happy with this. change the game back, add new guns, cap clans at a certain amount of people you can have in one clan, add new monuments, anything but change the recoil and sounds of the weapons it doesn't even feel like rust anymore! good luck face punch on slowly destroying your own game that you care so much about."
22874,"Honestly i LOVED this game until the new update, there was a small skill gap. If you practiced maybe 1-10 hours (have a buddy that that can teach you the sprays) you can be decent if not beam and roam any gun. But now that everyone can spray the same its boring and it doesnt feel like a survival. If you're making it a ""survival"" and going under that genre, sprays shouldnt be the same and guns shouldnt sound the same. ALSO why make a gun that has 60 bullets and is better then the m2? If you guys are more focused on pvp switch your genre to pvp, i didnt buy a pvp game. This game is one update away from call of duty warzone it feels like."
22875,"Its Rust.  Yes, it can be toxic, but almost every multi-player game is now a days.  All the internet tough guys, who are actually cowards in real life, need some place to free like they matter in this world.  Ignore these people and it's funny how quickly they disappear.  There are enough servers to play PVP, PVE, solo, duos, etc.  From vanilla to modded, you will find something to your liking.  Just remember, its only toxic if you engage."
22876,Das ist gut
22877,This game is very versatile it can be whatever you want it to be. It can be laid back and chill or all out warfare.
22878,fv
22879,"was great game. now is not. new recoil all luck no skill. if u try to beam from past 125 meters u will hit 2 bullets. old recoil was fun had to learn it to be good. now u just have to be lucky. dont buy unless they change the recoil back.

22903,"This game is simply different. Its like no other game, from the realism to the arcade action. Rust is one of the most original games out to date. there are many decently similar games, but not one hits the mark quite like Rust. FacePunch mastered the gun play with the difficulty of AK and many other guns spray patterns that add a large skill gap to encourage a grind beyond building a large base and ""getting that guwap"" as some Rust users would say. There is also a strong community of non racist, non obese, wholesome individuals who want nothing but to see one another succeed."

22935,i like this game
22936,Only care about the twitch streamers not the community and the impact on the game has been shown in these last few days with the recoil change.

22946,Great game. Community is full of some of the most racist and talented people I have seen in years. I would rather pluck out my finger and toenails and remove my eyelids before considering playing this game. Absolutely miserable experience that will always have me coming back for more dread.
22947,"Game is good and all but;

After recent patch gun play blows and the sounds are straight from a chinese mobile game."
22948,"To cut things short don't bother playing this game unless the devs decide to either remove the LMG entirely or bring back the old recoil.  I fell in love with this game due to its ability to bring a group of friends together, but recently devs have made it so that skill is no longer a factor in pvp and numbers dominate the world of Rust.  This game was appealing due to its uniqueness, but recent updates have made this game almost unplayable for someone like me who has been playing it for so long.  I'm in a tough spot rn trying to decide what new game i should play that gives a similiar experience and provides a thrill that Rust once did."
22949,"Jackass my friend raids in wow with makes him play it which then makes my friend make me play it and honestly waste of 19 gigs and 3 hours of wasted time doing nothing but telling my friends friend to shut the fuck up.
:) dont buy it"

22951,"You really just have to surround yourself by trustworthy people and choose wisely or you can end up team raided and they will take all your stuff but this is a game of dedication, courage, and patience or you will lose your mind if you try to rush the game and if you do the game will start to drag on you. recommended"

22956,"Combat update is refreshing, definitely a good one in my opinion. Gun play feels more enjoyable. Small aim cone is good, lowering the skill floor will hopefully bring in new players"
22957,good
22958,You spawn in hit 2 trees then get killed by a naked who spawned on beach. Very good game!
22959,"Can be a very infuriating game; fun with friends, but not as much solo. 8/10!"
22960,fun
22961,new update bring the weapon handling too all players making the skill gap  a bit lower any one can now shoot most of the wapons and if they realy like one of those they can train it again and improve . overall game has improved a lot in context of PVP and is always bringing new stuff to doo in the normala spects off rust.

22975,"devs catered to the people that play on controller and complained about the recoil being too hard. added unnecessary UI changes like low HP bloom effects, directional damage indicators, and a crosshair that make the game easy for shitters. it's been fine since 2013, all the MW kids found out about rust and started complaining they cant laser people like in warzone and then suddenly it wasnt. dont waste your time or money"

23016,"ive played this game for around 3-4 years it was an amazing game, my favorite for years but they decided to do the worst update ive ever seen they fully changed all the gun sounds all the recoil and added bloom to the guns with rng that makes a % of your shots miss even if on target. they have taken all of the skill out of the game killing off there OG player base in what seems to be a money grab to appeal to the masses. the game play feels nasty now, more like a browser base fps or mobile game. hopefully they fix this fatal error but until then i would not recommend. save your money!!

23110,"Sad, is the only word I can find to describe what has occurred with this game in the last few days. Rust has easily went from one of my all-time favorite games that never seemed to loose its sense of fun and spark of joy. To now nothing but a depressing excuse for a game, all facilitated by the new recoil changes. The skill gap in this game was what truly made Rust what it is, the toxic community and large desparity between good and bad players was what mad the game fun, you never knew if someone was scripting or just extremely good. It was this sense of the unknown that allowed for the skill gap to be as large as it was, players could easily just script which I understand is an issue that needed to be addressed within this new update with the new recoil changes and the 20% randomization. But did the devs really ever take into consideration how this would effect the players who have been playing the game for thousands of hours legitimately? To put it simply, no they did not, these game developers have slowly turned into money hungry machines, ever since the OTV server rust has been in a downward spiral. This was not made apparent until these most recent changes which literally have dug a grave for this game and is now nearly unplayable. I can guarantee it that you will not find me playing this game until these changes are reverted, and I think I can speak volumes for the large community of long-term players who have spent countless hours learning sprays and working on their gamesense to be better than other players. Now that anybody can pick up a gun and triple someone is simply a joke and makes no sense at all. Please listen to your community facepunch, you cannot continue to do this to your game that was once so great, I just cant seem to let this game go without a solemn goodbye. And if it means quitting forever, then so be it, I just really wish that game developers had a better grip on what is actually good for their player base and whats not. So please facepunch, just for this one time, listen to your community and revert the changes, your new generation of rust players and streamers who don't like to spend time learning the sprays does not bring justice to what you have done to your game. If they don't want to put the time in, then the game is not for them, bring back the old recoil to at least the AK and MP5. It is all I ask out of you facepunch, don't let the high skill communities' countless hours in UKN go to waste over some silly update. 


With kind regards,
                     The better half of Rust.

23151,my game is starting to crash now dose anyone know how to fix it?
23152,"if u still have a brain after 10 hours in this game you are god
"
23153,"This was such a great game for so long. A game where you had to have skill to beat your opponents, thats why so many of us players poured so much time into the game in order to learn sprays and just be good. The new recoil update changed everything, a player with 20 hours could have as much ability as someone with 2000 hours. The devs ruined the game for the player-base in order to help people who are bad such as streamers.

Save the beamers not the streamers"
23154,its rust just get it and shuss
23155,e
23156,fucking hate this game
23157,pain.
23158,I am an absolute noob at this game and didn't even start learning the AK spray yet because I wanted to get somewhat better at all the other more easily obtainable guns. It was like slowly climbing up. I finally got ahold of MP5 and learning its recoil was a run for me but it was insanely ENJOYABLE. Rusts lows are low but highs are much much HIGHER. This game was about learning and it was supposed to be hard. But I can not even comprehend what you did with this update. I just dont get it. It is absolutely AWFUL. I don't even want to start on the new gun sounds. Old sounds made the game even more different and unique than any other game i've played and now they sound like fucking COD or any other shooter. They all sound the same and have no character. So sad you ruined something that was amazing from top to bottom this much.
23159,Banned for being racist
23160,WTF..... This game is horrible. I can't aim on controllor or mouse and keyboard. The recoil in this game makes it unplayable. you spend hours just trying to get weapons. and then you get lasered across the map every time. not even remotely competitive. I had to turn the mouse sensitivity up to the maximum because i cant keep the mouse on the desk with the amount of recoil reduction needed in this game. I am infuriated.

23172,"its on another level if you looking for survival game, 
the only issue it has is the fps optimization issues cause its a CPU Dependent game and tbh for the amount of content you receive its a great deal"
23173,"a game where the toxic playerbase is a feature; people will wish ill on your family, call you the worst things in a multitude of languages, purposefully ruin hours or even days or hard work....

....and it's brilliant. in this way, Rust turns even your nicest, most well-intentioned person into someone willing to do what it takes to steal everything from these players. It has no real drivers like plot or much structure outside of the core loop, and yet has a very dedicated following, with people averaging either a dozen hours, or thousands. it's a good game. 

-Because you are pitted against people who have literally tens of thousands of hours in this game, you will see and experience (and maybe even do) every type of play imagineable. sneaky grubbing, crazy headshots, having a grenade chucked at your face or chucking the grenade. the game rewards awareness and working within the confines of it's systems. basically, you can and will learn to be good. and the process is challenging, but rewarding. 


There are also different types of servers you can play on that offer unique experiences, like PvE servers where you can play the features of rust without worrying about a double-barrel behind that door. Servers where gather rates are crazy high, custom UI features, addons that allow for personal minis and cars, teleportation, to almost making rust a different game entirely. tech-limited servers so the best gun is a Python, servers designed to be on mars, or the moon, or underwater. there really is a Rust for everyone. 

And of course, not everyone you meet will be Human Trash(tm). you will occasionally find some lovely people playing the game that simply want to do their own thing, and these people shine all the brighter being studded in the sea that is the rest of the playerbase. really, i mean it - a rust for everyone. 

I do recommend watching a video or two first no matter which you play (but particularly pvp) as sometimes obviously new players will get pity after being easily decimated.....but generally, it's better to avoid that decimation in the first place. where you can. 

If you get really angry, remember it's okay to take a break and have a drink. at the end of the day, it's all a game where your progress gets reset every....well depending on the server, it could be varying levels or progress reset, and it could be every week, 2 weeks, or month. but yeah - this fact makes it really not toooooo much of a loss when you do get wrecked. You can start over, or you can go to a new server and wait until the next wipe. there's a lot of freedom to choose your own experience. 

Probably not for children under 16-17, unless you're monitoring what server they play on (which you will want to search for and test yourself to make sure. the game makes this very easy to do.) because again.....by design, it serves the core game play loop to have an absolutely horrendous player to player experience most of the time.

TL;DR list
Pros: 
-Very flexible player experience....if you know what to look for. not hard to find, though.
-Engaging gameplay; with headphones you can tell where and roughly how far something that makes noise is; and that brings you in with the need to be focused so no one catches you by surprise. 
-while the end goal is by all means ""obtain Loot"", and then subsequently what you do with it in order to get more, there are many playstyles that work toward this goal irregardless of server particulars. 
-the playerbase is some of the worst kids and adults you will ever interact with....and while it can be a bit much sometimes, it very cleverly drives the loop on pvp/official servers.
-Guns, arguably the most important part, are brilliantly balanced in terms of scale. While a person with a bow would almost always lose to someone with a machine gun....it IS entirely possible to use strategy or even luck to kill someone with better gear. In fact, that's the most common way to advance. it isn't meaningless at all to have better gear, but you get stronger - not invincible. 
-The game is, in fact, stunningly beautiful. there are some awkward animal animations, but the scenery is some of the best. on busy servers, having a quiet morning in-game overlooking a valley from your mountaintop base.... it's pretty good. 
-Good lord, some of the sounds in this game are so Satisfying. from firing guns to building walls, the sounds communicate a lot even outside of tactical situations. 

cons:
-The playerbase is toxic, and often go out of their way to be crude. it is a good driver of gameplay, but I can't say i find it enjoyable when someone wishes cancer on my mother because I downed them after they hit me. my hours are primarily on PvE servers, as I like the game features and those communities.

-The game is....awkward, technically speaking. it has issues running well on some of the higher end PC's, and Rust is a game where frames matter. it isn't impossible to play with some stutter, but it will severely impact your experience. Ping information is available, and should be considered when selecting a server to choose from. low ping is better, and Ping is listed next to the server name so choosing is easy. 

-also, you'll probably need to turn your settings down.

-More technical awkwardness, is that sometimes Rust systems interact in odd ways. Preventing building where a moment ago it said you could, preventing placement of objects due to meshes that are invisible, that sort of thing. Most if not all of these issues are solveable with a bit of creativity/luck, but can be infinitely frustrating as a new player with no idea of how to solve them. That's why I recommend watching some videos, just to save that frustration. 

-the game has a core loop, but no plot, story, or any sort of context. you just begin as a naked on a beach, and go from there. while i do like the simplicity, I can't deny that it's pretty bland and would probably benefit from even some partial lore information available inside the game. I have no idea if there is lore, because it isnt inside the game. of course, the lack of definition boosts the story-generation ability of the game, so it would probably be best to just do lore about individual parts. like the Cobalt company. Who the people are that drop air supplies, or at least what their stance is about naked beach people. i digress, servers can be hard to populate because rust is a social game. 

I'm going to leave it there. its not without it's flaws; however watch a video or two, select the right server for how you want to play, and you'll have an enjoyable time.

23177,"I think this game is quite fun in the sense of playing it gives me enjoyment, I also think this digital code and software (game) has a lot of racist and homophobic people and I hope one day it can become PG (for viewers under 10) but beside that it is ok"
23178,"Rust was conceived as an amazingly open game with endless potential for interesting interactions between players, but was utterly overwhelmed by a meta of constant resource-grubbing PvP, leaving all of said potential as nothing but a distant memory. If you're looking for a grindy shooter where every interaction with another player is an adrenaline-inducing fight over your slowly, painstakingly obtained resources, you'll probably enjoy it.

If you are however, like me, looking for a game where you can do something weird and watch people's reactions, that's something that remains only in the past. I have many fond memories of this game - teaming up with a bunch of fresh spawns to make a human ladder to get into someone's house, constructing billboards by the roadside with shitty jokes on them, lighthouses set ablaze by dozens of campfires, or creating veritable fields of bear traps in random places and enjoying the occasional ""WTF"" posted in chat. My best memory of this game was when, along with a couple mates, we'd built a church by the roadside, complete with paintings of holy figures, and held a sermon on a Sunday afternoon, causing a ceasefire as about twenty curious people participated in our shenanigans. Nowadays I don't think such a thing is possible anymore. The church would be shot at and raided, stripped of resources and instantly forgotten as another ruined base as soon as we'd open the doors.

Don't get me wrong, I've spent plenty of time enjoying the team-based survival-esque shootout gameplay, but over time it grows stale. The first few times you fight with an entire inventory full of precious loot at stake, it causes your heart to beat fast, hands to shake and stands out among other games for inducing raw emotion into the fight, primordial fear of loss and elevating joy of triumph. But eventually that too becomes routine, and all you end up with is just a game where instead of shooting at someone multiple times a minute like in any other FPS, here it's a couple times an hour, and where instead of just respawning you must also grind your time away to be ready for the next shootout. It turns what was once the buildup to a memorable fight into a few more hours of your life gone, spent performing tasks as repetitive as an accountant's livelihood, with occasional moments of short-lived fun.

As it stands this game is just not worth the time it demands of you."

10/10 would recommend"
23232,"This game was great. A little bit of everything. Vehicles, farming, grinding, pvp & pve. Guns and bows. Fireworks and everything in between. 

The game was incredibly rewarding from early to late game. First scrap pile to the waking up killed by a raider. Everything felt fantastic about this game, and even someone like me, whom is trash at pvp, found this game amazing!

Then it all changed when the recoil change attacked. The guns WERE great. Each rewarding when you finally learned the pattern of it. And were able to finally use them for once. Each being much different than the last. AK and LR were very different patterns, and even similar guns, such as Custom and Thompson were very different patterns.
Learning the patterns was part of the game. It was a challenge, a drive to learn them. So that you can be better and become that top tear player one day.
But now it's horrid. Someone whos never touched a single gun in this game can no very easily win against someone who has 8k+ hours. This is incredible. Theres no more challenge, nor reward for learning the pattern, none of this anymore. The rewarding nature that was once here before this update was gone in a flash. 

At the end of the day, this was a great rewarding game. Though to anyone whom may be reading this. I don't recommend this game anymore. Not until this new change is reverted. And if you do still buy this game, for gods sake turn your walls around."
23233,woke up played rust for 12 hours dont go sleep go to school tired and repeat
23234,"I just first want to start and say I have been playing rust since 2018 always have played for long periods and then came back. I have almost 4k hours and would consider myself a very good player with both game knowledge and being good at sprays. I fell in love with the game from how hard it was to grasp and how different it was from every other game needing countless hours to be better than someone else pure skill. I would say In the past two years there has been a lot more activity with updates than before with face punch almost throwing up content update after update the game was perfect for a very long period of time without any content updates with a beautiful community. Now don't get me wrong change is not bad it's nice to have new stuff now and then to keep interested and to grab people's attention but I feel like it started to get to the point where it was too much. the train update was cool and new and I was very excited about it but then they added underwater labs and just way too many ways to collect loot almost splitting everyone apart from having to fight for loot. It was to the point where I feel like I could hop in a server and complete a wipe in just around a couple of hours just giving that new player base an easy entry that we never had. It was still the old rust tho still hard in ways with game knowledge and sprays having to still have skill. With this recent update, tho I have had enough implementing an RNG-based spray for every gun with only 20% of bullets being part of the spray is absolutely trash RNG is in my opinion one of the worst things getting implemented into all these games and taking away from actually needing the skill to keep up. Yes, the spray patterns are easy now but RNG on top of them just completely ruins it. I have had enough with face punch and the direction they are taking the game they are money hungry and I can't even call this game rust anymore just does not feel the same..."
23235,"Good game
Get this game"
23236,"This game used to be an addicting cancer, but was still awesome because of the steep learning curve, and the in depth game play that mixed positioning and skill. Even if you weren't the best shot, you could still win a few gunfights, and there were LOADS of other ways to have fun and contribute. However, The new recoil updates are ASS. You get beamed faster than hackers in warzone (which Facepunch has still NOT FIXED. THERE IS STILL A MAJOR HACKING PROBLEM). With no damage reduction from how the game used to be, and a new craftable LMG that is so unbelievably cheap to craft (basically takes a fingernail, a water bottle, and a cardboard box), rust has evolved from a unique gameplay experience where game knowledge was key, and turned itself into a wannabe COD copy.

Edit: The gunplay is not as unbalanced as it once was, but my review above still stands. Too many hackers which facepunch will still not address, and the TTK is way to low."

23247,"Recently I have decided to quit Rust following their recent update. I have spent nearly 3,000 hours on Rust since late 2015-2016. The game changed to quickly and doesn't feel like the game I grew up playing. Everything was changed to cater newer players; which included changing in-game recoil to be insanely simple and to be more RNG based. People spent thousands of hours and years of their life playing this amazing game just to have the great Rust feel ripped out from underneath them in one push of a button.

Don't get me wrong I still recommend Rust because of its amazing community, its been awesome seeing it grow and all the things people have done to raise money for charities and to make people aware. I wish luck to any new players that want to enjoy Rust like I have the last few years. It will be easier for newer people to enjoy because the pvp aspect is so simple now. Rust is going to keep growing but mainly without its OG player base.

The devs care insanely about their game and the monthly updates for the last couple of years show that. Rust will continue to grow and maybe become one of the most played steam games these next few months.

I hope everyone can make some great memories like I have playing and I wish them luck to the intense rush inducing world of Rust.

The new recoil mechanic takes away from players that practiced so long to become masters with their weapons and turned the game into ZERG CoD. Numbers now guarantee your wins and shooting takes zero skill at all, the days of solos are over and I wont even begin to explain how hideous the new gun sounds are. I used to love this game but Facepunch, you have thoroughly ruined this game with one move. This is not a hardcore survival game this is knockoff Battlefield with extra steps.

It was a complete waste of time and im probably going to uninstall this game, i have also spent alot of money on the game for skins, i feel like like rust just ruined its own game the only way i would recommend this game to other people is if rust does something with there game to bring back the old recoil and old sounds.

On top of everything they added new recoil that has random sprays for some guns and the difference between someone with 5 hours and someone with 2000 is positioning. This game is turning into a game of sit and wait, then blast your opponents. I would never suggest this game to anyone, and if you can, refund the game as quick as possible. The devs are trying to make the game more mainstream by caring less about the community they have, and instead are trying to appeal to people that have never played the game before."
23312,rust is a waiting game and it takes alot of determination and not touching grrass
23313,Hell has never been more accessible
23314,"This game as an overall experience is great. The biggest downside i can think of is there is virtually no way to play on your own without creating your own server. They should implement some way to play solo in an offline world, though there's many modded servers to play without the worry of dying nonstop to either roof campers, or spawn campers, stuff you usually see in games like this, but some servers are modded to allow that annoyance to be ignored. some servers even have zombies (basically A.I. with some form of a constume on that chase you with a variety of melee weapons.) which could easily be used by facepunch for the solo servers."
23315,Honestly this game was so great but the changing of the recoil for ak and some of the other guns is honestly annoying and now all the guns sound almost the same don't get me wrong the games fun but i feel like the update made it go down hill a little
23316,philip is too much of a rust fiend
23317,"you know those fire bullets you can put in waterpipe shotguns that did minimal damage and slowed you down? Yeah, they blind you now because of the garbage combat update with the blood. Completely covers your screen."

23357,"The combat update ruined the game. There is now no skill in the game and I believe this game has no skill gap and what separates the good players from the bad is nothing. Bad players can use any gun now and its like a whole other game now. It reminds me of a cheap roblox knockoff of rust with the cheap sounding guns and the dinky guns, hitmarkers, and a crosshair."

23365,"Rust is in its 8th year and has now had over 300 content updates, with a guaranteed content patch every month. From regular balance fixes and improvements to AI and graphics updates to adding content like new maps, musical instruments, trains and drones, as well as regular seasons and events, there’s always something interesting or dangerous (or both) happening on the island. Updates to the game include:

Procedurally generated worlds with map editor support
Host your own servers and with server-side modding support
Vehicles: horses, modular cars, hot air balloons, helicopters, trains and more
Complex electrical systems
Farming
New enemies, wildlife and factions
New monuments and areas to explore
Gestures and contact system
Musical instruments
Large train network
Huge recent graphics overhaul
..and more
EXPLORE

You wake naked on a mysterious island armed only with a rock and a torch. You’ll need to brave natural dangers (from heat and cold to thirst and starvation), build a shelter, eat (or be eaten), scavenge materials. Explore the island, its abandoned settlements, mysterious monuments and the factions that occupy them. But, above all, watch out for other survivors...
BUILD

Design and build bases to defend your territory or control the resources of the island. Research the tech tree, grow farms, command electricity, commandeer vehicles from horses to cars to boats to helicopters. Whatever it takes to get ahead.
SURVIVE

There are no rules in Rust but the ones you make for yourself. Craft tools, armor and weapons to defend yourself. Cooperate with friends and allies and build a town together. Explore the island and what’s happening in it. Trade with other players. Or prey on them, raiding their bases and taking their hard-won goods.
MATURE CONTENT DESCRIPTION
The developers describe the content like this:

Contains violence and caveman themed nudity.

In-game nudity, blood, player-made signs, voice chat and text chat can be disabled from the in-game options menu."

23370,"This game went from challenging and fun to easy and boring. Recoil is now for baby ass bitches that can't play games right. The sounds of the guns sounds like a baby made them from banging their toys. The new HLMG looks and sounds fucking stupid. People spent hours and days trying to perfect the recoil and you guys just gave us a big ""fuck you"". Very disappointed with the new update, you guys have fucked your game. This is the down fall of Rust."
23371,"I have almost 7k hours, I have spent a lot of time improving my shooting, combats, aim trainings, for what?
why does a person who has 385 hours in the game come in and kill me with 3 heads without any difficulties?
Where is survival? where is hardcore?
who is this shooting for? where is the desire to learn to shoot and play more for the sake of it ...
What are you, you can not study already, bought the game, went in and kick everyone, there is no return.
My friends invited me to Dayz, I say goodbye to your game, I hope to see good times.

23444,"Recently I have decided to quit Rust following their recent update. I have spent nearly 12,000 hours on Rust since late 2015-2016. The game changed to quickly and doesn't feel like the game I grew up playing. Everything was changed to cater newer players; which included changing in-game recoil to be insanely simple and to be more RNG based. People spent thousands of hours and years of their life playing this amazing game just to have the great Rust feel ripped out from underneath them in one push of a button. 

Don't get me wrong I still recommend Rust because of its amazing community, its been awesome seeing it grow and all the things people have done to raise money for charities and to make people aware. I wish luck to any new players that want to enjoy Rust like I have the last few years. It will be easier for newer people to enjoy because the pvp aspect is so simple now. Rust is going to keep growing but mainly without its OG player base.

The devs care insanely about their game and the monthly updates for the last couple of years show that. Rust will continue to grow and maybe become one of the most played steam games these next few months.

I hope everyone can make some great memories like I have playing and I wish them luck to the intense rush inducing world of Rust. 

                                           -Ronnie Mcdonalds"
23445,"This game used to be great but as soon as the rust drops came out they have been catering to the streamers and new players that got rust because of said streamers. People say this game is like a full time job but that is just what it takes to get good at a game like this, if you don't have the time to play and get good then rust is not the game for you. I give it a couple of weeks and all these new players tired of rust and leave because controlling a weapon is not all the game is you got to have game sense. It is sad I wasted so much time in this game when I could have spent these hours on a game that could make me money if I got good enough. I don't know what the devs were thinking maybe they just need the money or they saw their game was dying and are trying to fix it by fucking over there OG players."
23446,"Honestly one of the best games I have ever played, overall just an amazing experience, I would pay double the price for it if it was that price"
23447,It's the best survival game ever
23448,this game makes me suicidal
23449,SHIT UPDATE
23450,"New update turns game into Call Of Duty Lite, you can't tell what's shooting at you and all the guns are laser accurate now. I've given the update a fair shot but it's REALLY sloppy and clearly wasn't thought through. I wouldn't get the game unless they revert or fix it.

This one update turned the game from 9/10 ""Amazing"" to 6/10 ""It's okay""

How it's possible to mess a once brilliant game up this much is beyond me."
23451,"As of 6/2/22 the worst update to be implemented in a video game with such a large fanbase went live. 2,000 hours for the only interesting and unique mechanic to be completely removed. Now its just a survival game with little to distinct the no life's from someone who went on Ukn for 10 minutes. I might get on for servers that somehow maintained the original spray but I'm done. I'm not insane with the AK or spent 4 hours a day on Ukn but i understand that it was a huge backbone for the game. Sad to see. They have yet to solve the Clan issue and seem to promote it. Soloing is impossible especially on official servers where clans can wipe even the best of players when everyone has the same spray control."

THIS IS WHY WE LOVED THIS GAME! Now its just big updates with little to no care and a more time spent on what will give them money ARTIC SUIT they added a monument so they could sell a skin in the fcking game that you had to buy. If you take a indef look at the last year of updates they are sloppy and just to grab players to play for a WEEK OR TWO not somthing that gives them Months to work with.

PLEAS READ."
23461,I like the reality of the game and it dose make me a little upset sometimes but it is one of the best games i ever played.
23462,ye
23463,"good game and great timne to get into it beccause of the new recoil update
"
23464,"I used to like Rust. 

The issue with Rust now is that most of the skill ceiling is gone. Imagine a world where the AK recoil is the easiest to control. Well we are living in that world. I used to love this game because I had to go onto training servers and get good with each of the guns recoil. Now the AK recoil is basically a straight line. The MP5 spray turned stupid and so did the LR spray.

I can't understand why they focused on a new major combat update and not performance update. I get around 90-120fps when I play Rust on my PC. I have a 3090 and an AMD Ryzen 9 5900x. I can run basically any game on 200+fps on the highest settings but on rust I can't. It has to be miserable for people with lower end specifications to play rust. 

I do understand why they did this update it's so the new players have it easier. But they didn't think of the older Rust players who have 100s if not 1000s of hours on this game who have countless hours on training servers to get their spray to be perfect. And I don't believe that Rust was a game that was meant for new players to be immediately good at. If you wanted to play Rust you would have to practice unlike other FPS games. That's why Rust had a large loyal player base. It's sad to see that they made this update because so many people have now lost their hours in this game so that new players can be good at it. Why couldn't they just and servers with this update so that the people who had 100s and 1000s of hours could continue to play the game they have always loved. 

I know I don't have that many hours many people have a lot more than me but I still have 600 hours in this game. This update only helps new players and is going to make the older players have to start over and learn most of the game again. And the sounds are so fucked. 

This update is going to stop scripting. NO IT ISN'T everyone who has made scripts for Rust probably have already updated them. So now the people who used to be able to fight scripters because they had skill with the different sprays they can't do that anymore. And a crosshair why add a fucking crosshair and hit registration to the game. If you want hit registration go on a 100x server and play not a fucking main server. And now when you get hit you are going to see where you are hit from.

23509,good game
23510,"If you were to ask me 2 years ago if i would recommend this game i would 1000x say yes. It was at a perfect state, we were a large community but still a niche community with different type of players and people. But no matter what you could always find PvP or raid, a server to control, offliners to get revenge on. 

Ive played over 8,000 hour on this game (different accounts), ive spent money time sleep health on this game since 2019, I have watched it make the same mistake every developer studio seems to make now adays. They cater more towards the streamers, redditers and stop listening to the people who made their game popular. the people who DO spend thousands of hours and money and time and sleep on their games. I feel like my side of the community has been pushed away with this new recoil crossing the line. I know i quit because of this and i know MANY of my 10k+ hour friends have as well. Its a sad day and a small part of me hopes that in months time when the game is dead, when the streamers move on. They will realize the mistake they made.

To better your opponents in fights and to really put yourself ahead of the curve. cause now with the brand spanking new update, take all of this information and throw it out the window. And pave way to the new streamer recoil to try help this game be more accessible for streamers and new players. imagine having the game for 7 years perfecting the recoil just for this hot garbage update.

This game takes no skill anymore and has lost everything that made it unique."
23534,fun game
23535,"Feels Like Cod Recoil ruins the ""rust"" in rust"
23536,Toxic Game
23537,Most toxic game ive ever played lots of fun and they listen to the community
23538,"THE NEW JUNE UPDATE FUCKED IT!
the games uniquenes is gone!
rust turned into cod!
well done facepunch!"
23539,STOP PLAYING WHILE ITS TOO LATE IM TRAPPED HELP
23540,dont its a trap
23541,If you want to have a peaceful life with no anger....... don't play rust or you'll want to bash your wife and children and stab your mum with anger.
23542,Great game
23543,"yes, 
edit 1: its still yes
edit 2: still si"
23544,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
23545,I LIKKE GAME I HIT MAN WITH EROCK
23546,"dont play
"
23547,Most of the servers in this game are toxic messes but I have to recommend it because if you find a non-toxic server it's one of the best survival games on steam.
23548,i have 3 hours on this dumb fuck game because i cant even load into the damn server without it crashing i have tried so many times this makes me wanna bomb a orphanage
23549,"only 70 hours in and my dad is having a go at me for walking around town in a hazzy and an AK in my hand
"
23550,swastikas and spraypatterns!! yay!!
23551,racist and toxic:)
23552,Game was good but the recoil changes had ruined the game. I doubt any of the people who have played the game before the update will want to play it. It has become open world cod.
23553,"Revert Recoil. 6k hours quitting.. 
"
23554,fun
23555,yes
23556,"Game has now evolved, recoil was so unbelivevably hard that it took 150+ hours just to perfect the spray on one weapon but now new players can use the AK without contracting RSI from their mousepad apart from that nice game"
23557,"Its a BRUTAL survival game, which makes it stand out from the rest, if your looking for some fun, or just some toxicity to laugh at, this is DEF the game for you"
23558,good game
23559,W game hate it sometimes but you always come back for more
23560,"I think i got my fair share of rust and the new update is like a slap in the face. The pvp before was godlike, now its literal trash. people roaming with crafted lmg and 100h players can beam mp5. i gave the new update a try and uninstalled right after. sad..."
23561,IT IS FUN OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
23562,"#KeepOldRecoil

23565,"Really good game thats come a long way since first release. Heaps of interesting things like electricity, water, vehicles even gyrocopters! But be prepared because this game is brutal. Everyone is mostly an asshole and expect the worst. Still fun though,"
23566,Revert update when?
23567,game is good game is great been very fun ive my wife left me
23568,when i try to play the game it says the page is unresponsive idk if this is just mine but i was looking foreword to playing the game and was kinda upset when ive tried everything to try to get the game to work but it cant
23569,I have 1000 hours on the game and this is the worst update they could do ... you don't need any skill at all .. just some luck..

23582,very gud
23583,"Since the latest Update with the Recoil change, players with 200 hours can beam 300 metres... there is no skill gap and there is now crosshairs in game taking away the adventure of the game. There is also disgustingly bad gun sounds which have been patched from previous.     I have played this game for 8-9 years and I no longer recommend it to anyone since the last update today."
23584,good
23585,the games alright but you need good wifi
23586,"Rust 
 the game is great with awsome graphics"
23587,fun
23588,New gun sounds are shit and they went way too far with making the new recoil extremely easy
23589,if you got a low end pc like me your def at a disadvantage but still fun weather you like to pvp farm or make friends good game overall def a game where frames matter though
23590,"good game
"
23591,this nis a
23592,Hard as fuck to run with an ordinary computer. NEEDS to be playable for those who wish to play the game without a fancy over-priced computer or some shit. FIX THE GAME!!!!1!!
23593,great and loads of fun to be had
23594,raff
23595,good soup
23596,dont buy this game now its fucking shot because they ruined a perfectly good game and reduced it to this dumb shit
23597,nice
23598,If u want to buy this game rethink ur life and just dont.
23599,great till they changed the recoil system and sounds
23600,Game was great... up until last update (02/06/22). Craftable LMG added and is so fucking broken. no recoil and loads of bullets. no fun. ill be surprised if i ever load this game up again.
23601,"I was having so much fun with this game and how hard it was. I played for a while and wound up really liking the building and gunplay, I have spent most of my hours on this game inside of pvp servers to practice my recoil and I got it down where I could spray over 125 meters with the ak and mp5, I also worked on other guns but I wanted to be really good with those two. I had so much fun but when I logged on today with the thought of the recoil changing I got sad but still thought it might be atleast some what good. I logged on and crashed twice, then proceed to load into ukn where I went straight to the aimbots, I looked around and it felt very weird at first but I thought ""whatever it just feels a little different"", Boy was I wrong, when I tried the spray, I felt very displeased in facepunch for doing such a thing. The recoil was the most competitive thing in this game and it seemed like it all went away in an instant, I am very sad that facepunch would do this. I will also sadly be uninstalling this game until it is fixed or it is staying uninstalled forever. Thank you for your time."

23603,"Rust is an impressive game, with impressive gameplay.
if your fine with a bit of fun and banter then its a game for you!
You cant go wrong if you ask me!"
23604,"good game if u wanna kill urself, still recommend tho 10/10"
23605,very good becuase its just like fortnite. Things that make it like FORTNITE is that they copy the guns from fortnite and they also copy building from fortnite as well. would recommend this game but FORTNITE STILL BETTER..
23606,"The best game ever even 5x is fun

"
23610,"game is filled with scripters, roof campers, and zergs who think they are good because they can 12v2 an online raid. the progression of the game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because of minicopters and oilrigs. you can literally fly to oil rig with a bow and get an ak or grenade launcher in 30 mins. progression no longer exists in rust and made the game 10x more boring."
23611,"why did they even update the recoil bro, like dude! the recoil was good just take an hour out of your day to learn and you will get better over time and if you do not have an hour to learn a few sprays, DONT PLAY THE GAME. simple as that"

23660,"Turned a high skill cap game with endless possibilities to do besides just pvp to a small skill cap COD type game with endless possibilities. dont see why i should play this over stardew valley now. rest in peace. People always said why not just go play csgo if you think that skill cap belongs in a game like this, well guess what im playing valorant now so yeah. if youre looking for that hardcore brutal no mercy on new players takes a lot to learn type of game rust once was known for, look away rust is no longer of the sort. maybe play escape from tarkov."

23671,good game
23672,What the fuck
23673,The recoil update really made me enjoy this game so much more.

23680,mhm
23681,They reiund the game with the new recoil. Here come the fortnite players.
23682,"I thought that I had a good enough computer to run Rust on, but apparently not. Can't join servers unless it is a creative server. Sadly, a waste of $40, but it is what it is."
23683,new combat update killed the game the recoil for weapons are worse and changed sounds that loses the feel of what has been different in a good way from other games. 850 hours now all down the drain.... at least I have more storage now on my PC this just like other games now in a bad way it just saddens me how it went down to a 0 skill gap now
23684,absolutely ruined the joy that is rust. like WTF are you thinking facepunch. Uninstalling. You ruined the point of rust being you needed a skill cap to be good. This is an ass COD remake for the recoil.
23685,"very good game excited for the Update!
"
23686,rock
23687,"Very fun game. Combines a lot of aspects from loads of games I enjoy and compiles them all into one, awesome game."
23688,"This new update was a real disappointment for me and many others. Loved the idea of trains and new game concepts, but changing the recoil and sound of guns was a real disappointment. Would have much rather had new guns introduced and new monuments."
23689,don't waste your life kiddos
23690," new recoil is shit, fuck the new players"
23691,amazing new update is ass though

10/10 game"
23695,Meh
23696,RIP Game. Ya'll suck
23697,"man oh man, why out of all things would you do this to the game? Like the only people who like this update have under 200 hours. Hell for my first 150 hours I didnt even touch a gun. But you have these no hours scrubs complaining about how the recoil is to hard. I still cant control Ak, Tommy, Hell most guns but that doesnt stop me from playing. Sure people who sweat to beam 200m with Ak are fatherless but they put in the time to be good. So its pretty upsetting to take that time away. I hate this update and its very sad to see me and many others leave. Maybe one day these changes will be reversed or a better system. Buuuuuttttt Ark is the next move. Love me some survival games.(not rust sadly)"

23699,Very pog game sweats be wilding same with cheaters and new recoil sucks ass

23702,makes me wanna kms but other than that its great
23703,its good
23704,You can draw penises on the wall for $10
23705,recoil update ruined the game. gun sounds are horrible. rip rust..
23706,New Recoil Sucks
23707,fun hehe
23708,I understand the recoil change but when anyone can use an 8x on the ak it makes everyone godly at the game. Zero skill gap which probably means all old players that poured thousands of hours into the game just to learn the recoil patters will abandon the game. If you want a bad experience be my guest.
23709,"people grind this game for years just to change it to garbage sprays for people that are terrible. what makes people play this game is that it was hard and now its for babys that cant grind. Terrible game now, uninstalling i want a refund
"
23710,e
23711,"After the combat update this game is dogshit, they say there was a problem with the old recoil system but thats not true. I put less than 3 hours into sprays for all the guns and could enjoy the game no matter who i was facing. Now that the game requires no skill all you see is people using the same gun, the new lmg. To anyone looking to buy this game do not, it is a waste of money and time. If the combat changes get removed then the game is good for anyone with a free weekend and time to spare. To facepunch go Fuck yourself you ruined a good game

23712,it is very exciting to build your own home just for someone to come take it from you. but it is just as exciting take someone else home from them

23716,"L sprays, L movement, L game.

2.2k for it to get taken away, gg rust"
23717,THIS NEW UPDATE IS SO BAD PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER TOUCHED A PC IN THEIR LIFE CAN NOW MAKE PLAYS BECAUSE THIS NEW UPDATE FIXES THE RECOIL SO IT TAKES NO SKILL TO USE ANY TYPE OF GUN THIS IS THE REASON THAT I'M QUITTING THIS GAME FOREVER UNTIL THEY FIX IT BACK TO WHERE IT TAKES ACTUAL SKILL TO USE WEAPONS.

Now this game makes CSGO feels like a Sunday church group...

The most pathetic UI I ever seen in survival game."
23730,this game can be the most fun game you ever play or the worst
23731,"yes
"
23732,new recoil is rterrible
23733,"After updating the recoil and sounds, you can safely delete the rast. The game has become garbage in which everyone knows how to shoot. Previously, you should have been in Rust not only learning how to extract resources and build houses, but also learning how to shoot. And now he is learning to shoot, there is almost no recoil, sounds like from a garbage dump and there is a sight.The game has become a casual dumpster. Thank you developers for killing my favorite game))))
"
23734,"The new combat update royally fucked the game. all of the effort put into learning the recoil patterns is wasted. That im fine with, its the changes to the gun sounds, the view, and the hud when in combat, its all been turned into a shitty arcade game."
23735,si senor
23736,ive played this game for close to 2000hrs and have been playing for years. However after the most recent update all die hard rust players hate it. Face punch is stabbing every body in the back that have brought the game to what it is today just to get more money from players that started a week ago.
23737,"this game might fell boring from the intro and stuff but, you get addicted once you get into the game"
23738,69 hours WWWOOOOOOOW
23739,"this game is a joke, i lost my friend, he's probably still non stop playing, basically a no life, and like men. so at this point just dont buy the game, please."
23740,"this game is full of racist narstistics


fffffff"
23741,this game went for the money not the players changing recoil on all the old players was for new players and money don't keep playing this game they will change on the player base
23742,the new fucking sprays are fucking ass fucking gay ass game designers r shit prob gonna fucking quit this is so fucking shit thats 5k hours to gone to waste
23743,fun
23744,"this game is very bad now, because they suck new members off and change the whole concept of the recoil so that it is very bad now therefor i do not recommend buying this game"
23745,The recoil update has changed the game in a way that makes it no longer enjoyable. When you can pick up any gun and spray at its maximum accurate distance with only 15 minutes of aim train there is an issue. The game simply isn't competitive anymore.
23746,"bro this new combat update just ruined the game, I feel like im playing cod mobile now. Im definitely done with this game now.

23805,nahh they ruined this game not worth it anymore just full of little kids
23806,n word
23807,"I've played this game nonstop for a long time, and can say that I won't be playing anymore! Since 2022 the updates have honestly just ruined what I call Rust! I won't be playing until they let servers choose there Patch/Update, I think that's the only way to fix all this dogshit!"
23808,This is a game that will make you cry but it'sfun.
23809,great
23810,game is ass
23811,"Rust is pretty fun with friends, and isn't too hard to get the gist of."

23813,poggers
23814,this game stresses me out
23815,"Removed recoil, shit game"
23816,Its fun.
23817,"Probably the best game I ever played, but I cannot recommend it after the 6/2/2021 update. Why? Because they fucked up the competitive PVP it had. I stopped playing because of how many scripters there were playing in any good pop server, and when I first learned that they were planning to change recoils I thought it was because of that. Problem is, it wasn't, the new recoils aren't random, they are just patterns, as the last ones were, but these patterns are EXTREMELY easier (crouched). So the scripters will be there anyway, but now the skill gap went down HARD, and to put things worse, the aimcone (bullets not going where you are aiming in burst/full-auto) is unbearable.

I was really excited to come back and play the game again without scripters, turns out everybody is a scripter now (because gunplay is easy as hell)"
23818,"FP loves to go against the majority of the player base with drastic updates to the core of the game only to cater towards streamers. 

This is not a skill based game anymore. Do not buy"
23819,"new update made me racist. 




















10/10 game"
23820,"This game is now way worse than it used to be in this Combat Update. Most of the new recoils in my opinion can stay like the M2 and SAR but the AK, LR, and MP5 need to go back to normal and the damn sounds of the guns are horrible."

23951,fun game
23952,"Facepunch took the skill aspect of the game and the enjoyment of getting better out with this new recoil that now lets anyone beam one another. They changed the gun sounds from what every liked to now you either like it or don't but thats not really what I want to express. One of the big parts of pvp in Rust was that every gun was viable and that you chose which ones you used, if you didn't like the ak recoil you could use the lr, mp5, or thommy even the sap, sar and custom each gone had its separate recoil that created variety and enjoyment. now each gun has a bland recoil that was created for ""new"" players who ""dropped"" the game due to the recoil. All I gotta say about that is if you drop a fps game bcs you don't enjoy putting time into it to learn at least one guns recoil then you shouldn't play fps games since that one of the major aspects to the genre. gonna be sad to watch Rusts pop dwindle until someone makes a mod for the modded servers creating a large seperation in the playerbase which can and will be the downfall of the game as a separation in the player base and the devs catering to those that complain on reddit killed all the games that have done that before.

Extra: gonna enable comments so I can act get a discorse going since ppl make complaints and never allow comments like little kids on 4chan."

New update is alright the guns sounds are a 50/50 tho some guns are sound good and some dont. 

I feel for the dedicated players but if youve spent 11k on the game maybe the update making you uninstall is good for your health :D"
23959,ive played this game for around 4-5 years it was such a good game it was my favourite game for years but they decided to do the worst update ive ever seen they fully changed all the gun sounds all the recoil added a super overpowered lmg and added bloom to the guns making rust no longer a skill based game

24035,Removed skill gap and ruined fun bcs some OTV kids were dog s h i t at the game
24036,I think the new recoil update and the gun sound changes made the game worse. The Rust development team should focus on combating cheaters instead of releasing content that was never necessary. If they bring back the old recoil system and gun sounds i might consider coming back to the game.
24037,It's fun in an annoying way.
24038,"L update, bad devs, 500 kilo"
24039,"Game so doodoo, no skill needed after combat update"
24040,this game stinks
24041,"its a good game. Huge open world map lots to do whether its solo, duo, trio, quads, regular servers, A variety of modded servers, mini games, bed wars. a variety of weapons from a bow and arrow with a mace to an ak with a rocket launcher, a variety of transportation from a horse to a helicopter. But the A.I chopper should get a nerf and the mini games are fun but most times seems to be run by cheaters and people playing music and moaning/farting/weird sounds Aside from that it is a great game"

24139,"i like the grind
"
24140," In Rust, there are endless possibilities. Every time you load into a new server, the player interactions will shape the story of the game. With one clear objective: Survival. However, what if survival is not enough. You will ask yourself, ""what is the meaning of life?""..""I didnt scrape and crawl my way up just to live in a 2x2!...""I want more!""... The insatiable hunger for a bigger, stronger base and better weapons will drive all to push their abilities to the limits. Whether it's pvp, clearing top tier pve monuments, raiding, or just sneaking around labs to stack loot, there are endless avenues to stardom. Don't just survive.... you must thrive. This is Rust."

24463,I love survival games and RUST is the ultimate in survival games.
24464,A game where you can carry more rockets than healing syringes??? Where mobs can shoot from places where you can't return fire??? Game play mechanics where you interact with objects can be VERY frustrating. For as long as this game has been in development is should have been polished well by now. Decided to give it another chance after the latest update to see if the patch improved any flaws.

24528,"If you wanna have a good time with your friends this is the game for you! I would recommend that you dont have alot of stuff going on in life because this game needs a lot of attention to play. the only issues ive had with this game is the horrible Rock/cliff hit-boxes (when climbing) and cheaters. this game has so many cheaters, i hope the game devs do something about that problem. I would recommend going on Official servers where there is less cheaters, and a higher % of active admins. Official will take ALOT longer to get to end game but it is very rewarding to good players.

NEW RECOIL UPDATE HAS RUINED THE GAME!!!!! PEOPLE WITH HIGH HOUR COUNTS GOT FUCKED OVER. ITS TOO EASY TO SPRAY AND THE AIM-CONE GOT NERFED SO MUCH ITS ALL ABOUT RNG NOW!"

24549,"If you're interested in games that will challenge you in all aspects of gaming Rust is the game for you. This game will test your  ability to be sneaky, smart, tactics, player vs player, base building and overall survival. Rust is not for the light hearted or easily triggered as you will have a lot of ups and downs. The learning curve is massive and will take a while before you are able to successfully navigate wipes. After close to 1500 hours played Rust has quickly become my favorite game to play. I would highly suggest this game to anyone who is looking for that intricate survival game. 5/5"

24800,"Rust by itself isn't a horrible game, don't get me wrong. However, if you're not playing with someone else or on a 2X or more server, it's one of those games that really just irritate the hell out of you. What really irritates me is the servers are wiped very frequently and yet it's nearly impossible for you to get your hands on anything. Weapons? Lol, good luck. Base building? Yeah, only until you get a satchel thrown on your door and what little loot you could accommodate taken away from you. Another thing that really just irritates me is the toxicity in the servers."

Only need to know about this game that may be make or break is the game is base off of wipes. Wipes is a time frame in which the map refreshes/changes so 1 week player would build, gather, and fight each other. Then at the end of the wipe each the map clears everything and restarts new. Maps do change just base on the sever itself. (also blueprints/ research tree for using better items) And its time frame is 1 week to 1 month. Tends to be better experince with others but still fun playing as a solo. Trust no one and have fun!"

24926,"Rust has been playable since 2013, it is one of the most popular games on Steam. 

What is rust? The game follows the very classic survival approach: You start naked on the beach of an island, armed only with a stone, and you should survive. You collect resources, craft armor and weapons and build a shelter.

In large camps, happily distributed on the map, you will find better and better equipment, explore different biomes and complexes or fight against other players who are sometimes the greatest danger. Rust is one of our best survival games for PC, Xbox and PlayStation because of its many possibilities and its active community.

However, Rust is considered a rough patch. You are little or not taken by the hand, you have to learn a lot yourself and most of it through pain. Almost all veterans say: if you want to play Rust, you have to be prepared to die.

I wish you all the best of luck :)"

25004,"They should have made another game instead of turning Rust into a game with the difficulty level of bloons TD.

I paid for the game way back in alpha stages. Great game. When it ""released"" i said fine, thats the game. But over the last 1.5 years, they have eliminated what makes their maps great for PVP and solo gameplay. 

For when the player is shot, They added ""being down"" when you should be dead, and you can crawl around when down, and close base doors. As an agressor in fights, this is rediculous to deal with. 3 headshots to kill someone naked, or if you dont hit the head, theyll go into a crawling state and crawl back into their base, politely closing the door behind them.

As of May 26 2022, They are completely removing gun recoil spray patterns, single handedly alienating their core player base who practice to have the skill to out-shoot an opponent. Now the games basically like valorant. No recoil, too much bullet bloom. 

You used to need skill to kill an opponent in the game 200 meters away by controlling your spray. 
But even if you shoot like you have scripts, the bullet bloom is so high, dont even waste your time pulling the trigger to shoot.

FACEPUNCH. YOURE CHANGING THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GAME WE ENJOY. GO MAKE A DIFFERENT GAME WITH ALL YOUR GREAT IDEAS.

I hope your datacenter servers burn down again, like they did last year and you didnt keep backups.

Oh and by the way, when you get killed in the game (at least before May 26 2022), it most likely wasnt a scripter. But ill be damned. 
If the development studio is taking this game into a new direction to cater to the more casual player, youre going to see an influx of cheaters enjoying the game with all these farm bot players running around. You know, the cheaters that use ESP, jump 2.5x normal jump height, etc. Ban them? nahhh.

new accounts with Rust cost around 2-5$, if players are legit cheating and determined, youre not going to have a good time. Play on community servers with active admins, thats the only way.
Hardware bans are circumvented with ease when cheaters use cheats that cost 80+$ a month. Sometimes they even spend 500$ a month for god tier cheats, and if theyre careful, theyll rarely get caught. 

I hate this cheating bullshit, but playing rust, you have to understand some people will, and now with these updates catering toward a more casual crowd who just farm, itll be a cheaters heaven. 
And now im gunna step back and get my popcorn.

25051,"The new update ruins the competitive aspect of the game for me. Not only punishes the people who actually got good at the game with the old system, but also the new recoil removes any skill gap whatsoever. You can spend hours with the new game to get better, yet you will stil lose to a far worse player just because he will crouch in a bush and spray&pray and you will miss your shots because of the random aspects of the new recoil patterns. The old sounds were also far better, more crisp and satisfying.
Totally unnessesary update which will most likely RIP the game. Who buys the skins afterall? Devoted players, or casuals who cannot even bare with the difficulty of the recoil? What a waste of a unique game. Now it joins a list of BF/CoD/Apex-like shooters.

Pro's 
- There are none
------Cons------
Actually playing the game
Takes too long to get stuff
Spawning as a Naked only to get L9'd across the map by a HQM base 3000 meters away 
- Carefully farming monuments only to get ass rushed by some autistic retard using a custom as he beams you and triples you. 
- killing 4/7 full-kits in a massive fight just to get crossied' by some grubby fucker 
- Again, playing the game
- Everyone who plays this game that isn't you does not touch grass, therefor you will get beamed by someone with #Beamer in their name with ""8072 hours played in the last 2 weeks"" on their steam account
- That one time you beam a clan member from 230 meters and triple him, be prepared for that "" UkN mEE BrooOO"" in chat. 

Final verdict  -
I recommend it

25102,"High risk PVP where you can lose hours or days of progress because you went to the bathroom at the wrong time.  To say that the game has an extremely steep learning curve and a toxic culture would be an understatement.  Getting past learning the basics, understanding that you build a pillow fort that can be wrecked by a toxic 13 year old in 5 minutes, you will be confronted with griefers, campers, and constant cheaters.  Wondering why there are so many cheaters and constantly planning how you will regain your loss through fair play makes the game unplayable and unenjoyable."

25228,okay i guess
25229,"Really good game so far from what I've played. The frames can drop at some points like when your in outpost/bandit. Considering that Facepunch is an indie development company, this game is much better than most AAA games which is impressive. With the new PVP update coming out soon, I think that the game will die and a lot of people will leave which I don't blame them. The skill gap for the new recoils will decrease so much that Rust will feel like it will be too easy for everyone and Bob the farmer can probably spray 100m with only a couple hours practice. The aimcone has been nerfed massively on staging to a point where you can't even spray over 125 meters which is insane. With that being said about the update, it is 'Subject to change' so they may not even roll out with the update. The sounds as they are right are perfect, each gun has a unique sound as so can be easily identified and the hit sounds like the crunch for a headshot is so satisfying that FP shouldn't change a thing. I know that they have to change the recoil in some way to freshen up the game so it doesn't die from all the scripters. However, they made the recoils on staging too easy and the aimcone is awful. In terms of cheaters, they did say that the upcoming update is not purposed to counter this which is understandable. Overall, I think FP should either keep the game as it is to keep everyone happy or come up with new recoils that are on par with the current ones so that the game is still fresh whilst also being good."

I can understand a game being bad; making games is a difficult task. but its simply malicious at this point. I've played better optimized games on Roblox.

I hate to break it to you but some people actually have other stuff to do than spend half their hard earned free time in an aim trainer. And about their point about Rust losing people after this update is complete BS they just gonna gain more regular players as the recoil will be easier to get used to and veterans will actually be straight up beaming. The only people complaining about this update are the ones using scripts because now the scripts they paid money for will barely do anything for them in fights.

25352,"the game is so ass now, anyone can now just kill you! pretty much whoever shoots first wins because recoil doesn't exist, the games going to beginner friendly, which rust is supposed to be a harsh survival game now all the people that have invested time into the game have just wasted all that time because they wanna appeal to newer audiences, the people who have been around forever have kept this game alive now they just fucking them over lol, the newer audience aren't gonna stick around, the og players are the reason this games still alive now they fuck them over. Rust has added so much cool shit, i thought they were the best developers, they listen to their community and all that, but now i kinda think they shitty all because of one update. This one update has just fucked their reputation! :)"
25353,"new update is a good step in the right direction away from really bad gunplay
this is the best update in a long time, next, let's hope they stop relying on aimcone for balance"

25388,"Update with new recoil and sounds is very terrible, it's will kill game and game from real survival turn to shit about warzone / warface. If update will be on at 2 June I think 40% active players leave game. Remain players with small hours in the game and players wich not go to donate in facepunch store."
25389,"Ruined the game with new update. No i don't have 6k hr and i am not an AK god. The problem is that the whole point of guns in rust is to be difficult so even when worse players have better loot, people who are better at the game could take them down. This update didn't make the game unplayable but it will greatly reduce the amount of skill you need to play this game and it my opinion that ruins the whole point of rust, where an ak kid could be taken down with a bow or a crossy. L DEVS"

25460,"Farming Simulator with guns and squeakers, nice"
25461,"This game was very interesting i spawned on a beach next to a really tall building some nice man said was called light house. Him and I went up the building and made it to the top of the tower. After that he taught m,e how to farm and get materials and what to do with them. Then he taught me how to make a base. It was amazing. Until he had downed me. he said ""your a fucking looser you Ni****."" I haven't felt the same since."
25462,"Yes. that is it, very good game"

25494,amazing ak spray now good
25495,"On May 26th 2022, Facepunch modified the recoil for every gun in favor of the noobs. The recoil is now somewhat random and you cannot strafe while shooting, you have to crouch and when you get shot, your aim goes flying. This greatly reduces the skill ceiling. I believe this is a money driven move to attract a new player base of casuals. I've put several hundred of hours practicing the recoil patterns and so much more for nothing. It started with a pay to win arctic suit and now this. Good bye Rust"
25496,"Not a bad number this, pretty toxic at times but once you get past the learning curve of starting, you’re good as gold"
25497,I think recoil update will increase how many players will play

I really dislike the new gun sounds, it removes the unique aspect the game once had. New spray patterns suck not hard and there is little for me to do anymore. I found it fun to improve. Aswell as it has become 1st person to see the enemy wins. Old spray definatly needed changes but making it completely unoriginal just made the game overall less fun to play. 
Before this new update come out I would have 100% recommend this game. But after June 2 2022 I under no circumstances will recommend this game."

If you want a more challenging, PvP experience play on a populated official, or high pop community/modded server. If you are just learning the ropes, then they have PvE servers that will help you learn how to craft, build, farm, and help with many more features of the game."

25661,Good game
25662,Don't waste your time this game they don't listen to the people that have been playing the game and if they do the devs only listen to people with big platforms and what their opinion is. for example frost bitched about the alt looking and showed how one player can be seen while another person could not be seen but frost is the same person to use it on you and i but then when he dies because of it he goes and bitches on twitter and gets noticed because he is frost and then a week later boom rip alt looking and now otv came back and rust thinks they are all going to stay and bring their audience. 1. every rust player knows when they first started there was not a single thing you knew how to do right that is why i love this game is cause there is such a big learning curve. before the recoil update hit staging branch there are many guides and servers that can help new players learn the game on. FACEPUNCH DID YOU FORGET THAT YOU MADE THE SOFTCORE SERVERS FOR THE LITTLE DISCORD KITTENS THAT JUST JOINED THE GAME SO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP TRYING TO PULL MORE NEW PEOPLE IN AND TRY TO REGAIN THE PEOPLE AND OGS THAT HAVE PUT SO MUCH TIME INTO YOUR GAME JUST FOR SOME STREAMERS TO COME AND RUIN IT. and for anyone who is actually reading this saying just relearn the sprays! 1. the way the guns move now is a lot faster so it is hard for me when i shoot the gun on the wall to see the pattern to even see where to move my mouse so now i am play guess where my 9mm ammo is going to go and they ruines strafe spraying. it is already hard to spray standing still while up right and now throw a strafe in there like wtf that was one of my go to moves when i get caught off guard. but this is my rant let me know if you guys agree i want to quit at this point but i don't really like any other games at the moment.
25663,"I have played this game for 4100 hrs by far and away the most time I have put on any game. Until now I would say its my favorite game of all time but I can no longer say this. There are many things I like about Facepunch but at heart I now truly believe they are cowards. They won't pick a script and stick with it. I play with a group of players who all have atleast 1500 hours in the game and we are very good and came up the hard way..putting in the time and effort to get good at this game. We learned to get good at the game by learning the guns and practicing them....Alot.... with the roll out of this coming patch and taking away the skill we've spent countless hours perfecting I can't help but feel this is about taking from those who saw the way to be top tier and then followed through and giving it to the masses. You robbed us Facepunch. So now I can say for sure that my group of friends who together have over 10k hours on rust will be moving to a new game Tarkov, or Scum, or Dayz. It bothers me that you basically sold out your dedicated player base Facepunch in the interest adding training wheels to the game. TLDR: Was a fun game if you put the time in but developers have become sell outs. PSPS: You aren't going to change anything best players still going to be the best players, just pissed of your most loyal fanbase/cause them to no longer play."
25664,"BEST GAME ON STEAM
"
25665,"GAME GOOD YES
apart from when u get rolled by a 20 man zerg that have never touched grass in their life, don't even bother playing on a facepunch server because that little naked u killed at the start of the game will fly over to u and aimlock u harder than you were when you seen gandhi

25678,FInally leaving a review for this game after playing since 2014. I am super happy they are finally listening to what a lot of us older players(pre pandemic) have been asking for with this recoil change. As someone who doesn't have 10 hours a day to sink into this game because I work and have a life outside of gaming I look forward to being able to compete with some of these kids who play this game non-stop.
25679,i like it cause its toxic
25680,very fun combat game and gets addicting fast
25681,this game is dope
25682,"Played for almost 1000 hours, am still Prim locked 10/10 Would repurchase"
25683,"Trying Rust for the first time is like trying Meth for the first time, once you start, you won't be able to stop. 
Don't buy this game if you plan on touching grass more than once every 4 months."
25684,It is fun
25685,Toxic community :|
25686,"Even though I only have six hours, Rust is a fun survival game to play. There are many opponents such as animals, NPCS, and other players. The only cons are toxic people, and you rage quiting (you get raided etc.)"
25687,FacePunch has trolled us and made the game playable for the 5 year old squeaker

25713,Its a fun game I made some friends on here last lasted years there is a learning curve but that will be changed with the new spray update but its a good game. I recommend buying it
25714,Please for the love of everything and anything holy don't get this game.
25715,"Game consistently improves with every monthly update, top of the line building, electrical systems, and risk vs. reward gameplay. I was reluctant to buy this game years ago, but I'm glad I did. The toxic community just makes raiding all the more rewarding."
25716,hiu
25717,decent game
25718,this game is the fuckin tits
25719,Its ok the sprays are hard
25720,Game is dog water because of the recoil changes. L game
25721,Can’t have fun unless you spend 5 hours after that you die lose everything and get called a racial slur by anime pfp
25722,recoil change is bad
25723,masochism moment (fun but agonizing)
25724,0 play 0 social skills 10 out of 10

25735,"Devs cater to new players and don't care about their existing player base. You can put the hours in this game but it wont matter because Facepunch will just slap you with something like the new recoil update. Great way to kill off your existing player base.

25743,"This game has just created the worst possible update, there is no longer a skill gap. The outcome of fights is decided by who gets seen first, and this games signature spray patters have been reduced to just pulling down."
25744,"Was a nice game, but after i saw the update and the new Recoil it's time to quit, most fun game ever but not anymore! THANK YOU RUST DEVELOPERS!"
25745,"I fucking hate this game. You should get it too
"
25746,"would recommend if you want a 9 to 5 am no paying job

25748,ok
25749,painful
25750,pls dont buy it its shit and depressing sum times
25751,"They ruined this game with the new update, not only they eliminated completely the recoil of these weapons, also they added terrible sounds, and they just changed the meta from AK to LMG. Played 1.7k hours to master the guns and everything, feels like i'm getting fucked in the ass by the game right now and also, the Ak sounds like my semi-automatic nerf gun lol. A large proportion of players who have put the time in to learn recoil will quit the game... i think that facepunch is hungry for players, but they need to find that balance. Hours and hours practicing AK recoil for nothing, thanks facepunch."

If you somehow make it past this stage you need to punch trees with your rock for 30 minutes at least to build a 2x2 base with a door. Overall a braindead game and you become braindead playing it. 5/5 would play again"

#OfflineRaids"
25783,"Stupid recoil change...
HERE IS A WORKING WAY TO CHANGE THAT (WORKING 5/27/2022)

Step > 1
- Click on the ""Library"" tab at the top of your steam client.

Step > 2
- Search for ""Rust"" on the left side of your steam library.
Step > 3
- Right click the game and hover over ""Manage"".
Step > 4
- An extra tab should show up to the side, now navigate to ""Uninstall"" and click it.
Step > 5
- Confirm your choice."
25784,"Game was fun at first. It was a game of skill, game sense, and all around a fun game to play with friends. In the past year or so, all this game has become is a game where you have to have 30 people in a team to make progress, and its roleplay galore anymore. With these upcoming updates with recoil and gun sound changes etc. They have ruined rust. The fun part about the game was the skill. The skill to have the best recoil control. The best aim, the best game sense, the best everything. They have decided to ruin all of that by making every gun in the game the same recoil. Easy as can be to control, ruining the skill gap. The one thing that made the game fun. Since the whole OTV streamer thing has came up. The game has done nothing but go down hill. I do no longer recommend this game to others. 6 months to 2 years ago. This would be the top game i would recommend anyone play. Not on more"
25785,Game is very fun with friends
25786,ThIS GAME IS SO ASS WITH THIS NEW UPDATE
25787,"They actually fixed the gun play with the new recoil changes. Any sudden negative reviews you see regarding this update are cheaters, angry that the scripts they pay for won't give them an advantage with the new randomized recoil and additional dispersion of bullet trajectory. They have fixed a core issue that has been plaguing the community for far too long. 

Additional information for review reading gamers: Do not let anyone convince you that scripts will still run rampant with the randomized recoil. In order to have the accuracy they previously had under the static pattern recoil, they will have to use aimbot hacks that are substantially easier to detect with anti-cheat, and are significantly easier to observe by admins moderating a server. Under the old static pattern recoil, it is almost impossible for admins to tell the difference between a skilled player and a script-using cheater."
25788,new update can lick my unwashed sack
25789,Rust recoil changes has to be the single worst idea anyone has ever introduced into this game.
25790,Awsome game
25791,Idiots on crack
25792,"Game is gonna be shit for people who actually practiced recoil control. All for twitch streamers, sad."
25793,def a adventure and a big thing in gaming
25794,Do not waste your money on rust. The recent updates are making this game horrible. RUST L
25795,will quit the game after upcoming update. absolutely ruining this beautiful game. removing the most obvious skillgap between new players and og's. gg facepunch...
25796,"i love it, and i hate it."
25797,"Horrid update 3k hours down the drain, no skill."
25798,"Good game until recoil change. Bad game now 
https://chng.it/42KzHcLh8w"
25799,"This is so sad tbh, all that time spent on Aimtrain for nothing. Years of trying to become better and better at the game being thrown in the Trashcan really isn’t the solution we should go for. This makes Rust just like any other Shooter there is and is nothing special any more. It’s been THE one of a kind game for many people, the only game where making a play or winning a 1v5 fight feels so good and is the reason why thousands of people played the game for so many hours. It was the last game where your Recoilcontrol is so important and made great plays possible. But this is over, it has become a casual game with less skill required to be really good at it. Beaming people on 150+ meters not possible anymore, Rust Fragmovies nothing special anymore. It feels like playing COD, Battlefield, Apex and all those other games. I really hope they will change their minds about this."
25800,Rust slaughtered there game gg #BeamerLivesMatter

25804,it good
25805,CUNT
25806,this game sucks butt ass no kizzy
25807,this game gives me headaches
25808,i hate people
25809,"Ahh Rust, A game that I love to play but hate to lose in. Rust is a game that is updated even to this day and has a multitude of ways to play it. I personally like playing in a small group, at least with one other person. For the sweatiest of people this game is a perfect home, but for the more mild manner I would steer clear. The game is definitely not for the faint of heart, one wrong move will have you lose maybe hours of work.
-----------

The Pros

- The variety of servers, procedural maps, and social interactions make this game infinitely playable
- If you are highly skilled, you can feel like a total bad ass in gunfights
- Teamwork is rewarded and you can make a variety of strange but helpful friends
- Personally, positional Voice Chat is fun as hell
- Tons of items and in game concepts to keep you busy
- Base building is very granular. Base concepts can be highly complex to maximize defense or material use. Or you can build a 1x1 wooden shack

-----------

The Middles: Stuff that maybe Pros or Cons for others. I will indicate what my preferences are)

- Zerg Clans. Personally a con for me, but for others can be a good way to socialize in abig group. Zerg Clans can dominate a server, and will make surviving a living hell. Or you can get some epic raids on Zerg vs Zerg wars.
- KOS (Kill on Sight) is common. Big Con for me, but people love to watch the world burn. People will often get enjoyment from sitting ontop of bases and sniping people from afar. Makes new players have a real hard time playing
- High Risk, High Rewards. I really like this. Nobody is invincible*, on day one you can take on a highly geared player and come out on top. Or you may get unlucky killing a boar and lose all your stuff. Work is highly impermanent
- Server wipes. The servers will wipe every so often to keep players from getting to powerful or to freshen things up. I like it, but probably not liked by all

-----------

The Cons

- Toxicity, you will find a lot of people who don't kiss their mothers
- Hacking, not a very often occurrence but is highly frustrating in this high risk/rewards setting
- High System Requirements make the game difficult to run well for a majority of people, check the recommenced specs before buying
- Gameplay can be grindy, it takes a lot of resources to make anything of permanence. As such the more people you have, the faster that grind may be
-Micro-transactions and lootboxes blow, and a few have ingame impact. Mostly cosmetic but have some quirks which can provide benefits mechanically on a number of them.

-----------

Conclusion:

While my hours (at time of writing) are 22 days worth of hours, I'm pretty shite at the game. The game is highly punishing, and I wouldn't recommend it to most people. But wait, why am I recommending it? The game itself is great, anybody who doesn't mind toxicity and have hours to burn will love the rush this game gives them. Raiding a group butt naked with a Eoka pistol is an experience I treasure deep in my heart. But for somebody who has things going on, and doesn't want to have slurs thrown at them, I wouldn't bother.

Also don't bother with the DLCs unless you want to support the Devs. They are cosmetic or gimmik items. Of course get them if you want to support the developers who work tirelessly on this game. The base game is all you need to get going

25911,"I have loved playing this game since 2016, but it appears they are ruining the competitive nature of Rust. This is a survival game, not against the environment, but other players. Have fun playing a pussified role-playing game."
25912,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THE NEW UPDATE IS RUINING THE ENTIRE GAME IF THEY DONT CHANGE IT SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT BUY IT THIS IS A WARNING TO EVERYONE MOST PEOPLE WILL QUIT AFTER THE UPDATE
25913,L update supposedly they were trying to fix scripts but by fixing it they gave the entire community scripts that’s how they decided to fix the problem. Take slugs out of the game!!!!!!

25990,"Worth $40 in it's current state.

Pros
Music : Instruments you can play with your keyboard, radios at some NPC shops, Voice chat.

Building : Auto roof corners, half block snap grid for Z level placements, frames for heat vents or vending machines not just doors and windows, 5 levels of durability upgrades, canvas for paintings, signs are paintings, paintings remain when you pick them up to move them. Turrets, traps, heaters, lights, sprinklers, rain collection, water storage, electric pumps, and grow beds, with some logic, and automation for your low maintenance pot farm. Lootable, steam marketable skins.

Combat : Getting the jump on someone makes a good tier of advantage, cover matters, aim matters, special loads like explosive and incendiary, scrap like a water pipe shotgun and modern weapons like the British L96 and the US M249. Also ""boom"" of improvised and professional grade. 

Gambling : Slots, a wheel thing, some tables. All around good time. 

Transport : You could ride a horse overland to a hot air balloon you take to a garage where you hid a car to drive to a train you can take to the beach where you have a boat you can use to get to your helicopter in an island safe house and finally land on your mansion in the mountains, tho maybe not in time for brunch.

Lore : Isn't rubber stamped by the devs and is mostly conjecture beyond some in game posters, radiated areas, and scattered ruins.

Fishing : Worms and grubs are bait, some fish are only good for bait, some good fish are still usable as bait. More complicated then just a timed click, gotta play the fish a bit, hear the pole stressing, stay lined up on it, tucker it out some. You can also fish up junk items, human remains, who knows what all.

Nudity : Clothing optional! Also modesty blur or RPG welded on underwear settings for the squeamish, asian, religious, and or etc.

Cons:
Music : Can't change the default tune for instruments, all out of tune the same amount, should be random in a range with some small chance of being in tune unless that amount is a really obscure lore thing I don't get. Radio is cool, needs expanded, would love to be able to do a radio show, jukeboxes, turntables, records, recording? I think I've heard two songs and that's all those radios play. 

Building:
Roof caps should maybe just be their own thing, not being able to modify structures after a set time is tedious, explosive damage against structures is not based on any reasonable logic I understand. Don't get me wrong I get the formula their applying to calculate damage I just think frags are nerfed into the ground, and explosive ammo is still ~20% better/cheaper then the next best thing for a scrap door, for example. 

Combat :

Gambling : Can always have more.

Transport : Motorcycles?

Lore : It has a lot of inspired elements and as a result of that it really needs a lot of its own footing to hold that up on. Maybe I'm old but it's like looking at a student of Lobachevskys first published work. Это воняет, давай купим права на фильм

Fishing : Size - Effort ratio may need tweaked 

Nudity : 

Really a lot less complaints then ""well it would be cool"" and the modding is at the point where nothing I want is outside the scope of whats being modded so I can and should do it myself if i want it.

Maybe most important for an ""online only game"" you can host your own server if you don't like people or whatever. Also means it shouldn't die to facepunch not hosing it. Very cool stuff."

26041,"step 1, wake up naked on a beach, step 2 gather resources, step 3 a fully geared up person goes up to you while holding a ak and says ""follow me, i have extra stuff at my base"" step 4, he traps u in a arena and you are forced to bludgen someone to death with a rock, you realise while looting the other person, he had a bow and arrow on him, while the kidnapper is taking you to your cage, you shoot him in the face, get his gear and go home and play rust

side note i hate this game 10/10"
26042,good game
26043,"This game should be called Raidbro Simulator because that's basically what it is, sadly.

It's got lots of interesting features like building, vehicles, flying vehicles, PvP, hunting, crafting. Unfortunately 90% of these features don't matter. Basically every game comes down to the biggest zerg of edgelords on the server no-lifing resources and then raiding everyone else off the server.

My favourite thing to do was run a shop. That's genuinely fun, because you have a building that supplies something useful to people, you can get quite wealthy trading items people really want and you also get a bit of action defending yourself from people trying to rob you.

However, even if you just sell small items, eventually some people who just play Rust 24/7 will C4 your store for 50 scrap and it just feels like you're wasting your time.

I've actually been on servers of 100 players where 50 or so were just in one clan raiding everyone else constantly. Such groups get gear so much better than the smaller groups/solos it just gets really boring. ""Oh wow, I get to fight the five guys with AKs and full metal armour with my bow again for the 50th time, so fun.""

On top of that, the game really encourages this mentality of addiction. In order to be ""competitive"" you have to play it a stupid amount. I've known people in their 30s and 40s who were playing for 18 hours a day, every single day, with no job or real life outside the game. It's quite sad, really.

All in all, not a bad game in theory. However the community is extremely toxic and the entire game is basically just dudebros in enormous squads blowing your base up over and over so they can steal your pickaxe that they don't even need. Gets tedious."
26044,"j,k"
26045,ITS THE MOST FUN AND CHALLENGING GAME I HAVE PLAYED
26046,good game. bad ppl (some of them)

26166,"Got an AK
Got rockets
Killed some naked men
Blew up a building
Got Rust
Did The Same Thing In Rust
Now Im Addicted With no end in site."
26167,"I have played this game for years and years, and it has changed quite a bit through development! I'm no expert, but I've put in +800 hours thus far, and can honestly say, I LOVE this game. Prospective buyers, listen, YES, there is a learning curve, YES, the community is pretty toxic on some servers, BUT, if you find a nice server, with the right people and resource multipliers (5x to 10x max), it gets pretty fun. Get some friends together, do some raids, build massive, hyper-complex bases with electricity, go nuts running wires EVERYWHERE, find and mod cars to your heart's content, drive trains underground by subway, or above-ground on the rails, fly helicopters, sail submarines and motorboats; You can even fly around in a hot air balloon! Beyond that, there used to be a significant dearth of PvE things to do-- this has been fixed! now there are a plethora of enemy NPC-filled monuments and areas, bunkers, rail stations, underwater bases, etc.
If PvE isn't your cup of tea, you can always raid other people's bases, break down their walls and doors, and take their loot for your own. That feeling when you finally bust down that final wall to your enemy's loot room and can take all their stuff is just so... Satisfying. Alternatively, logging in to seeing your base partially destroyed and your chests empty is equally disappointing, but you can learn from your failed base builds and build better next time!

8.95 out of 10.00: This game has improved so much since I started playing, my first scoring of this game was a low 2.55 so it has made an incredible journey to this point
Definitely recommend to all players who enjoy FPS/Survival games with base building!

great game not players if worst comes to worst turn voices off would recommend though"
26290,yes veri good game!
26291,"Best game I have ever played. However if you are new to the game and do not have at least 3+ friends to play with, I do not think you will enjoy the game. Rust back then was very good but now everyone scripts, plays ukn 247, offline raids, and groups are competing to get deeper (more people). Right now it feels like the game is slowly getting worse because of the way rust is being played now. Waking up to a base being offlined sucks and it happens almost all the time. Getting a start also sucks because the moment you get a 2x1 wooden shack, it will probably get door camped or raided. If you have guns, get ready to lose it to an 8 man or people who have 100x your hours. Like any other game that has been out for a long time, people are becoming a lot more sweaty and the hunger for loot that everyone has, is making the game a lot worse. Overall the game is very good but if you actually want to have fun it takes a lot of time and commitment and you need to play with people who know what there doing and are good at the game. And get ready to meet people who will literally sell their entire life savings and there house just to screw you over."

26315,JUST BETTER OTHER THAN WHEN I GET KILLED BY A AK WHEN I HAVE A BOW
26316,Its a fun game but kind of annoying sometimes because you can killed alot
26317,"This game.... is great. it lets a lot of different people do a lot of different things and have different playstyles. as it stands right now though, even on vanilla official servers cheating/hacking is somewhat rampant and a good amount of the player base is incredibly toxic and violent. All the in game systems are really in depth and cool. its just hard to enjoy when there are people who are always going to be a million times better or have a big group all working together. My biggest gripe is that defense vs offense in this game, even when taking into consideration of being online when your base might be raided, the ball is in the offense court. i have and my friends have built quite a few really big, very well designed bases. literally with the offensive capabilities of other players being considered. and you just log in the next day and your base and all your loot is gone. because a handful of people or even just 1 person has to farm just enough sulfur to make the explosives required to break into your base, steal the resources from your base marker(the tool cabinet), and within 8-12 hours your base is gone. when you log in the base might be there... you might even retake it back. but with all your stuff gone its impossible to replace the resources needed to maintain it. imagine building a system of ww2 style trenches and bunkers. then you wake up and all your guns and ammo is gone. do you think its as effective now that you only have bows and spears again? without power tools how are you going to replace all the concrete and timbers? so even though i will keep playing it. it has caused me more heartache than pleasure so far. and if i could go back to being ignorant and never playing it. i would."

"
26326,"Not really all that into the gameplay. I think it's fine but vanilla Rust is too time consuming for me to really get into. Also, the developers have been super lazy with regards to implementing EAC, and the game still doesn't load official servers properly on Linux or Steam Deck. Unless you're playing on a Windows PC I can't recommend this game at all (and even then it's kinda eh). Maybe it'd be more fun with friends but the solo experience is kinda messy."

however if you have no life, do it. its fun, just very demoralising and hard to get good at."

26378,"6/10.
the game is not perfect but is very interactive, fun & resourceful, UI is kinda broken and pass the feeling that the game doesn't have any development moderation for months, but it's acceptable.
What definitively ruins the game is the amount of unsupervised servers with several self entitled and somehow proud nazis neo-nazis and regular racists, spamming swastikas fireworks, and offensive language on chat, it turns the game into a safe space for hate dissemination, and people simply don't get banned for it, for over my almost 300hr in-game I've never seen someone geting punished for hate speech or like so.

but is a nice game, if u can ignore how abandoned the overall moderation is."

26406,"This game is single-handedly the most toxic game with an extremely immature and toxic community, but that's A big part of what makes the game so addicting. The rush you feel in destroying someone that's talked shit to you for so long is one of the best feelings a game can provide these days. The endless possibilities with electrical engineering in game makes it fun af to troll people trap base wise as well as in a farmer sort of way. The building system is easy to learn, and very addictive to learn to the fullest. The PvP is an extremely hard to get used to community, but once you've started, you never want to stop.

26486,game provides a challenge and a nice progress the more you play. with the table it allows you to work your way to guns allowing you to get guns if you have been unlucky what helps if you are late to a wipe. this game isnt for the timid you have to play aggressive and if there is something that gives you an advantage you take it no matter how much of a dick move it is. the community is toxic however this can be enjoyable at times.

26567,"If you want to play Rust, you have to play over 100+ hours to get a decent sense of everything the game has to offer. From the highs, lows, trolls, raids, death to animals when you're first starting out, door camps, and other fun stuff that will happen. Just stick through it with a buddy, and you'll be good at the game and understand whats's going on in about 1,000 hours!"

26599,"I love this game, But they don't respect nakeds. So don't stay nude for long!"
26600,fun
26601,Make sure you actually read things about this game and watch videos before buying.
26602,"If you got the ram space for it, and you're ok with online survival games, Rust is the game for you! Hell even if you don't want people to raid you when you're offline and take your stuff, you can always just play on PVE servers. Rust has a server that'll fit your needs, whatever it may be."
26603,good
26604,shit game
26605,"good game but you will find a lot of racism if you happen to spawn with an african Character, you will hear slurs insults and other verbal attacks on you for your skin colour.

Sometimes you get a nice server where nobody kills you based on your skin colour but mostly you get killed because you are poor.

The Game has a flawed design where you need to ""upkeep"" the base the bigger the base the more materials you need inside your base to keep it from degenerating and inevitably disintigrated.

The Decision of Facepunch not letting you choose or customize your character is bad, why doesn't facepunch studios make you spwan with a new character everytime then if they claim it's because of realism that you get spawned with an African Character who then gets targeted and killed systematically?

Not saying the Game is full of Racist but it sometimes feels like it.


But The Game itself is kind of ok, Textures and Models for the World are from 2008 compared to todays games with similiar content and gameplay, Conan Exiles is Beautiful in everything but lacks what Rust has to offer, the map Generation, a good game doesn't need a Story, Just look at Arc Survivial looks also so much better than Rust in everyway, even has Dinosaurs and customizible characters (you can make yourself really ugly in arc).

Rust would be a Good game if you could Choose your Character.

Facepunch Studios are a bunch of Hypocrites who claim you spawn with a survivor but when that survivor gets killed you spawn with the same survivor everytime, like in a simulation. Where is the realism here?

Just give us the reroll feature, every game offers that but rust."
26606,"its a good game when people arent toxic

26623,Awesome game love to annoy toxic people until they get ban
26624,shit game ewww bleeh eww makes me want to puke ewww
26625,"The pros of  this game are: 1. Fun People to talk to, 2. A lot of pvp, 3. The best survival experience.
But there are some cons as well, 1. Death by animals gets annoying, 2. Sometimes toxicity gets annoying, 3. you need a decent computer to run rust. I use an i5 for my processor which works btw, but you need atleast 16gb ram to experience smooth gameplay, along with a ssd to make the game run faster. 8 Gb ram works, but it gets choppy. ( very choppy )"
26626,This game truly ruined my life . . .
26627,w
26628,"Rust is a survival game that will give you an experience that you never lived before in any another game! Except there are games like Conan exiles and Ark now in the market sooo... I dunno. Still a valid comment tho! There are really crazy people in there go check it out!

Final Verdict: 7.5/10"

26654,"Too many scripters and hackers. For a full loot game things like this are more detrimental than normal. Having both recoil and bullet spread at the same time only adds to the ease of script advantage while also making the skill curve far less friendly for newer players. It's a game with a lot of potential but falls short when it comes to combat, gunplay, and anti cheat."

26735,"Have you ever wanted to play a survival game with base-building and pvp? 
Do you like getting your eardrums annihilated by someone else's war crime of a microphone? 
Do you, too, wish to relive the experience of Xbox parties circa 2009-2012? 
If you answered yes to 2/3 of these, then this is, probably, the game for you.

I always have fun playing this game because of the exploration and first-person experience aspects, it is amazing to just hang around. The multiplayer combat is incredibly fun, regardless of the level of social skills, or lack thereof, in people you ""meet"" under ""friendly circumstances."" It's a blast. The base-building and resource gathering is also highly enjoyable since there is a lot to do and learn. Learn how cook. Learn how to smelt. Forge meal. Forge a weapon. Forge a girlfrie--wait that last one is not on the list. 

Point is: you will love this game if you want the true Naked and Afraid Experience (TM) because, let's be honest, someone will kill you almost the moment they see you in many, many situations (especially if I am trying to steal their resources--you can not stop me random person I will never see again).

Anyways, thank you for reading my review if you have stuck around this long, if you could not already tell through my masterful levels of subtly, I like this game."

26738,fun but spray is hard
26739,Good game perhaps
26740,good
26741,"This is a fun game, but I wish that there were some true noob servers where those who have under a certain amount of hours can actually play and not be completely dominated by a clan that is full of complete try-hards. This will help new players learn the game and build some confidence in the game rather than quitting before really getting into the game. The servers should also monitor chats more as they are super toxic and childish. I suppose that is part of the community, but why? This game has mature content, why not keep the chat's standards somewhat mature, too? Finally, the game crashes waaaay too much. If there is a well-known cause for this, there should be an easy to go to troubleshoot page to help users figure out what the cause is so they can do something to help remedy this if it is a user issue, like a lack of power or something with the equipment they use. Other than those few things, I find it a fun and addicting game. I play it with my two teens all the time, though they do most of the pvp since I'm more of a chill roleplayer."

26853,"highly addictive, post apocalypse,first person, free roam, pvp/ pve battle type game. this game will make you determined and happy at first, but give it time when you've spent about 50 in game hours. you feel pretty untouchable and log off for the night. you get home from work on a friday ready to game all weekend. youre both tired and exhausted from work but you amass this extra pocket of energy and feel incredibly recharged. as youre screen slow comes through and you have full vision you notice your waking up alone and naked on the beach but you know you went to sleep in your base. you quickly unalive yourself in hopes of finding your sleeping at base. you quickly see that the only bags left are far from base but closer then where you are. you make it to the place your fortress of solitude is suppose to be. only a few fondations are left yet set to decay in minutes. over 50 hours of your life gone because you had to sleep... F!#%!!! now im addictide to the pain and you will be to...(p.s.a. my grammer sucks.)"

26926,"Where could I even start? Rust is made by the same company as Garry's Mod, which if you know anything about what hot garbage that game is you can already expect Rust. It's unresponsive, dated, the anticheat doesn't do anything. Ignoring all those fatal flaws, the core gameplay centers on building a base and stockpile of gear in order to even play. How this works is unless you play the hour a server resets (wipes) it is just you with middling melee vs dozens of guys with guns who will hunt you to the end of the earth even if you have nothing, because they enjoy the kill. It's a great game for unemployed sociopaths and streamers (same thing)."

I couldn't get passed making a stone hatchet and stone pick. I'd always end up running into someone with a machine gun who would just gun me down. All the servers I joined had just been wiped too, and claimed to be noob friendly, but you had guys running in 4-5 man groups with machine guns gunning down newbies who spawned in on the beach. Wish I could refund this absolutely abysmal game."

But the best part is, you can choose non-pvp servers too if you just want the minecraft feel without the fighting.  The music and ambient noise is both immersive and suspenseful at times which adds to the experience. Only downside to the game is that the servers reset periodically, which means you lose your progress, even on casual non-pvp servers."

27104,"great game, but super frustrating at times. Need to be able to deal with the highs and the lows, and not get discouraged when things don't go your way."
27105,too grindy
27106,"I often praised the developers, not many push monthly updates and content at the rate Facepunch do but since the ""OTV"" surge in players they have really feel out of touch with the veteran players and failed to listen to most feedback then June 2nd they butchered their game. Read into the history of H1Z1 and Daybreak games, I might be wrong but it I believe Facepunch have just done the same to their game.

The game has transitioned from a game with a high skill ceiling and a steep learning curve to a game with a very low skill ceiling with very little to learn other than the controls and basic map knowledge.

I'm not gatekeeping and was never against making the game more accessible. This update was rushed, testing lasted 1 Week , keep in mind this is the biggest update that has been released since Legacy Rust transitioned into the Rust we know today.

Recoil - The pattern could've been changed to lower the amount of time investment needed, could have stayed the same but reduced, certain attachments could have been buffed but the changes that have been made remove any type of skilful gun play make every gun trivial to use. The game has now turned into who sees who first, you will die in less than 1 second to everyone regardless of game knowledge. There is no time to react, wall, or attempt to get into any type of cover when somebody shoots at you, if they see you first you are dead.

CSGO is a perfect example of a good recoil system, there is patterns but the game is still very accessible however if you take the time to learn the recoil system you will take your game to another level, I think this would have been a better direction to go in.
Sounds - On the testing branch there was ""placeholder"" sounds, a little into the testing they added the new sounds, keep in mind testing lasted 1 week so they probably had 3-4 days at most to gather feedback on them. If you are sitting in your base and somebody shoots 4 grids away it will sound like they are in your compound, the directional sound is also very bad and sometimes you can not tell at all where shots are coming from.

Optimisation - It is great that the content flow is so high and new things are being added to the game however, since the HDRP graphics overhaul the game has simply looked worse and performed worse declining with each update, it is nice to see new monuments added, small touches like the ziplines and graffiti but when performance is so bad surely it should be improved before more assets are added to the game.

Game Filters - Whether it is reshade, nvidia game filter or some other method that you can use to change the game appearance is irrelevant. The game without sharpen, vibrance and other colour modifications is very grey dull and quite hard to see certain things especially since the HDRP update. On top of the aforementioned the developers force a PITCH BLACK night time in this game and there was a game filter that allowed you to see a lot greater than any other player leading to some people being disadvantaged.

Disallowing these programs and not addressing the reason they are being used in the first place is the problem not the filters themselves. Another huge issue is they still work for some people making the game even more unfair as now they only work for a very few and are not available for everyone."
27107,join newb friendly servers
27108,its challenging and theres soo much to do
27109,great game not gonna lie but need some few money on keyboard to be come stronger mokey
27110,it is so bad
27111,just a random life with rage and pain.
27112,pretty middle game there are positives as well as negatives. Positive: depends if you want to invest a lot of time into a game and then lose it within a week or a month depending on what server you are playing on the game is over all fun but i dont think it is worth the full price of 60$ if i was you i would wait for a sale. negative: there a lot of raisest people on this game and rude gamers that might make you unable to sleep tonight and other things such as the fear of getting of raided or some one who kills you and then has a laugh at you so these are the positives and negatives  these are the things you need to look out for while playing rust so i hope you got a good idea of this game and i hope this helped you make up your mind if you wanted to get the game or  not get the game.
27113,yes
27114,11/10 would fumble the bag multiple times just for the thought of owning a gun
27115,"Rust is a bit like having stockholm, this game kidnaps and forces you to play it constantly to avoid punishment and as you play it you realise ""hey this isnt that bad"". before the game turns around and brutalises you.
rinse and repeat."

27126,"PVP servers are fun but kind of a grind, but if you want an amazing experience PVE servers is more fun, if you are a new player start with PVE servers and then play PVP you will enjoy PVE better the community servers are amazing.

I recommend Rust if you just want to vibe and play PVE servers, if you want to be competitive hardcore player go PVP servers options are many..."

27129,"Does NOT recommend tons of bugs and weird situations you can get in due to the lack of bug fixing. Alot of cheaters aswell makes a servers morale for playing no where to be found, really expensive and if you're playing on a high populated server with no team limit you are at good chance of getting offlined by a bunch of 12 year olds. if you really wanna survive now its mostly about decent teamates and alot of them."

27158,"This game is quite unplayable unless you have more than 800 hours and then you're still just a noob you have to have at least 1200+ before people start acknowledging you as a normal person and this game blows 
"
27159,"At first the game seemed like it could be a fun time, It can be pleasant if you join a quieter server or something.  The larger public servers have vastly devolved into just people keeping themselves locked to primitive tech and killing newbies off of spawns, It's rather depressing. If you don't have a group, you're better of finding a solo/duo server, the public ones are just awful to play on. For how many bows there are, why can I not make a wooden or metal shield?

Many of the players in the chat are very homophobic, yet will constantly brag about how ""deep"" they went in on boys, the irony is palpable. The chat's on many servers are barely moderated and I can understand, If I read half of the stuff these idiots post on a daily basis, I'd want to die more than I do already.

The fishing is 10/10, it's chill if you do it in a safe zone, It's a great way to wind people up who want to kill you by refusing to leave and fishing for like an hour until they get bored."

27189,"running the game to shit; every update makes it worse and i honestly don't recommend buying it in the state it's in right now. They constantly make the game less pvp oriented and i sit on my phone for a good 2 hours every wipe because of how boring it gets. If you're more into pve then i'd say go for it, but ark is probably a better option in the survival/pve category. It also has some pay-to-win aspects like the winter hazmat suit (not much.) Vanilla servers take long, boring, job like days to get a satisfying experience and modded is full of corrupted admins that ban you for even showing the slightest amount of skill

currently logged 3,048 hours if it isn't listed at the top of the review"

27206,good game
27207,"While I enjoy the game I have several complaints. For one, most players aren't good at the game they either hack or abuse every aspect. The worst aspect is the constant trolling when it is clear you lose a PVP from connection issues or the administers not stopping the cheaters. The game itself is great when it works. It is other people though that ruin the experience. It also is difficult to acquire items early on like guns or explosives to compete. It takes way too much time to get used to the game."

27218,Rust is a very fun FPS/Survival game. I recommend it if you got lots of time to play. And make sure your PC can run it.
27219,This is a very fun game.  The most fun part about it is to see how much better you have gotten then before.  The only bad part is that you can get a little angry when people kill you when you have good stop on you.  Over all it is an amazing game.

27286,"Everything I've ever dreamed of, in one game."
27287,"where to start about this game. This game is amazing. its loud and enjoyable in a sense that you will never feel with any other game. I remember my first server on this game,  joined with a couple of friends, i remember going to bandit camp and stripping to a dude and he enjoyed it! i was talking to him in rust vc, i was sharing my moans during sex, things that i have never said to anyone before, i came out to him and he was the first person to ever know that im gay. That person was moaning as well until we both dispersed white stuff and then we added each other on discord. Me and him have been friends ever since and we love each other. I would have never thought that someone thatr important as him would have met each other in a rust server where it is most toxic. Me and him have been ""friends"" for over 2 years and i cannot tell u how he changed my life. He changed my life in the way that i wouldve never made it without him. He loved me,changed my perspective on life and made me truly believe in this life. we dont play this game anymore as we transitioned to valorant where our love continues. Anyway i dont think i would be here writing this comment if i never played this game. yes, my experience is unique but i encourage u to be nice to others in this game, dont kill a naked, make friends, ask them if theyre okay before rocketing them, make sure they are okay and then blow them up like people from my country. we have yet to meet in irl but if we do, i owe it to the safe zone, bandit camp and my friend theodore clements for forcing me to buy this game that i got bullied and tortured on for the reminder of my lfe."

27308,"The best way to explain my feelings on this game is through a story. So this monster cockroach had taken up residence in my bathroom for like the last year but whenever I tried to catch him he would always slip my grasp. About a week ago I finally corner the bastard in a cartoon box. I find a way to maneuver the roach into the toilet without wasting any time, and a sense of victory washes over me. But is this enough? Oh hell no I want this fucker to suffer. I decide I'm going to drop a load on him before I flush him, a dishonorable sendoff. So I get on the toilet and start going to work. It starts coming out and this is one solid log I had been holding on to for about half an hour I aim by looking through my legs, all is going well, the log is right on coarse. Eventually it makes contact, and this is when all hell breaks lose. The roach goes full rambo and climbs UP MY SHIT towards my butthole! I panic and start jumping around like a 50's housewife who just spotted a rat. Mind you my log hadn't been broken yet so I'm spreading that shit all over the bathroom in the process. Best part? The little bastard got away. Now I'm sitting on my computer procrastinating cleaning my bathroom covered in fecal matter.

27319,"   This game is fun to play. 
   There is great graphics and many different things to do in this game.
    I have had it for maybe a few years I just dont play to often. It is fun to play for the experience. No matter if you are the builder, the farmer, the pvper. It does not matter there is much to do in this game and it is always fun raiding the people that piss you off. I watch a few youtubers for this game but probably one of the funniest to watch is spoonkid. It is motivating to watch him because he could go from rock to m2 and back to rock and he would not give a single care in the world. Man has been through the toughest parts of this game. When I watch him it helps me realize that this game has a lot of risk value and teaches me how not to stay down but come back for more even if I lost a lot. Maybe this game can teach you some lessons you can take to the real world huh."

It's not a game, it's a front for numerous skin gambling websites for minors.
it's malware that runs crypto mining programs in the back ground.
It's an un-optimised mess with severe memory leaks.

Instead of adressing these ''issues'', Facepunch just keeps adding more useless transport options (Cars, ziplines, Trains) that become obsolete as soon as the novelty wears off.

No character creator. 
The game just hands you a randomised character. (in my case: a bad cgi bald asian lady)
Apparently, wanting to play a toon that resembles yourself irl makes you a racist according to Facepunch.
The main reason facepunch turned off ''family sharing'' is that they want you to keep buying the game on alt-Steam accounts until you get the character you like.

It's a scam and it shouldn't be allowed on Steam."

The community is as toxic as they come and has unfortunately become a home for some awful people including racists, neo nazis, and homophobes (as well as those who pretend to be in order to get a rise out of you).

All that said the building mechanics are some of the best in the survival crafting genre and crafting/researching new items is quite enjoyable. Also nothing beats the satisfaction of raiding the guy who door-camped you for four hours or off-lining the clan with swastikas on their walls.

11/10 would rage again"
27400,I really like it but it will make me mad sometimes because I will play so long and grind all night just for it all to get taken by another person. I wish when you left your base would disapeer or something.

27422,"I absolutely recommend playing this game if you're still deciding if you should or not. Is the game super toxic?  Yes. Are you going to get door camped? Yes. Will large teams roll you as a solo player without a second though? Absolutely. 

Rust is a love hate relationship, when you're having a good wipe it's amazing. When you're off to a bad start and can be a long up hill struggle. But play it anyway, it's worth it."

Respawned, woke up to two guys running up to me demanding I drop my rock, AKs pointed at me. Suddenly, ""You died to play, AK, headshot, 2m"".

Respawned again, smacked a tree, got my leg chewed off by a bear, died.

Fourth time's the charm, I thought.

27610,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

27659,"An open-world multiplayer game with one catch... complete and total anarchy.

In my opinion, this is Rust's greatest strength and it's greatest weakness. You start with nothing and progress by gathering resources, building a base, crafting weapons/armors, etc. However, your interaction with the other players is what makes Rust special, as it can keep the experience from getting boring and provides incentive to improve at the game.

Because players can do what they want, anything can happen and THIS is what the game is all about. The game is centered around player conflict, but alliances can be indirectly formed with other players.

Rust can be the most brutal, but also the most rewarding game if you invest the time into it. That being said, I do recommended the game to others, ***so long as you know what to expect going into it.***

What to expect:
- You will die A LOT. Because of the nature of the game, everyone assumes you are a threat before anything else and will kill on sight most of the time. Other players are just toxic... get used to it. This makes it tough to get started but it gets better with experience.
- Your default should be: DO NOT trust anyone. There are some genuinely kind players out there, but weeding out scumbags is a skill itself that can be developed.
- Your base can be destroyed by other players. You'll learn to recover quickly and get back up and running when this happens. With time and practice, you can be the one dishing out the carnage."

27704,"wake up on a nice, wide beach

walk for some time taking in the scenery

meet some guys dressed in what looks like trash, holding some sort of battle sccared AK-47s

""YOU THERE, NAKED""

I go towards them

They tell me to follow them

Get brought to a compound with crudely made ISIS flags on it

They want me to sing for them

I don't dare to say anything

They tell me I'm useless, threatening to shocking me with some supposedly new tesla contraption

Someone yells ""bring him inside the thunderdome instead""

waitwhat

I meet another prisoner whose also naked and he screams for help

his cell door opens and we are told to fight

I kill him after an intense battle with rocks

everyone chants in bad middle-eastern accents

they bring me outside for air they say

bring me out for air they did not

I get told to run and that I get a head start of 10 seconds

they fired their AKs but missed horribly when I ran back and fourth, zigzagging away into the distance

I escape through some thick bush and out into the desert

I later fled syria and picked up a copy of this game, experiencing the same thing."

27801,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
27802,"This is a very fun game with a ton of features including mobile detection, using your cellular device you can connect and control your base from your phone while offline. The PVP aspect of the game is alot of fun and updates come in fast."

27860,"Only game Ive ever played that actively punishes you for installing. and then continues to punish you with crashes that lead to losing loot. Making it more punishing as you whernt raided or camped or killed. no.
You crashed on the way to or from a raid with a bag full of loot. log back in asap.
""killed by scientist""
""you body cannot be found""
uninstall.
great game was one of my fav games until i realized your loot depawns after 2/3 mins so you better have a fast pc because when mine crashes i may aswell go for a walk because by the time i get logged in again the server will have reset...
Great music.
Great weapons and game play.
debatable community. {best of both}
graphics are really nice.
sound design is great.
honestly theres so much to like.
only cons really come with how you or others play around you and the frustration that comes with losing everything from 10hrs of grinding to a crash. not even a player thats its own issue but part of the game and if your into PVE there is servers for that."

27895,"Though I find Rust to be a fun game, there are certain qualities and prerequisites I cannot meet.

For one, I only have a couple friends on Steam and neither of them own rust and are very unlikely to play it anyway... of course, the biggest issue because having friends to play this with is better than playing alone.

Secondly, dedication. This game demands at least a bit for you to: Maintain your base, defend your base, fight off competition, etc.. If you don't have that time, the patience, or the desire to do any of that, then all the work you put into it is basically gone.

Thirdly, and finally, hardware. I have decent hardware, and yet my PC struggles to boot up Rust in less than 30 minutes. It takes the same amount of time to log into a server even if there's low ping, further adding to my frustration. And if that weren't enough, it's borderline impossible to see other players from a great distance despite my above-average monitor... and yet, they can see me and it always gets me killed.

I don't have the gamesense for Rust, nor do I have the patience to deal with my base I worked hard for getting destroyed."

28018,"Its like coccaine, once you get hooked, your addicted and waste all day every day just grinding endlessly just for you to be betrayed by a team mate or be raided by some toxic kids, causing you to cry yourself to sleep that night then delete the game in a fit of rage, only to play it more in a day or two. its a loop of wasting all your time getting a little dopimine, then loosing it all and wanting to die untill you take another hit. its literally a hard drug. its not bad but if you are debating getting this PLEASE DEAR GOD DONT, DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE, its a deep and painful rabbit hole thats hard to break free from. so all in all, 9/10 game

My one complaint is my account was hijacked for 24 hours even though I had 2FA and proceeded to hack on Rust. So I am now listed as a cheater even though I did all I could for security. Sucks but nothing I can do about it. Decent game none the less.

28156,A pretty fun and somewhat realistic survival game. PVP is very fun and takes time to master due to every guy having its own recoil pattern. There is also a ton of different things to do and see. My only gripe with rust is that if you dont have friends to play with it makes it very difficult to progress and you will most likely be locked to primitive gear on vanilla servers.

28201,"A complete survival game, with all features that can be expected from such a game. 

[i]This is a first impression review. I let a friend and my son play this, because I can't myself due to a handicap. [/i] 

[h2]Stranded naked[/h2]
You start the game waking up on a beach with nothing but a crude stone. You can smash the stone into trees or rocks to instantly receive the appropriate resources. With those you can craft tools, weapons and a base in order to survive. There are primary needs, such as hunger and thirst to overcome, but also other players and wild animals that have a grudge against you. Survival game 101, they pretty much all function this way. 

Whether or not this game is in particular the survival game to play, comes down to a few factors. 
- Friends. If played with friends, any game is infinitely more fun! 
- personal preference. 
- the game population. At moment of writing there are 88000 players playing. In Rust you need other players. 

My views of this game are very limited, as I haven't spent hundreds of hours in it. It looks good, but it seems a very basic survival game. The one remarkable thing I noticed was the unearthly long loading times! I haven't seen loading times of several minutes in well over a decade ago, and I think it's a huge problem of this game. 

70/100

28395,funny number
28396,"I took this game very seriously, and found it really fun, I killed everyone in sight, until my friend started making artwork in this game. I then decided to make a disco floor, and invite ppl into my base to praise my friends amazing artwork, and from that I made new friends to roam and raid with :) Great game if you avoid the racist ppl."

28413,"First of all. This review is based on my low playtime.
The idea of what rust can and could have been is good.
It's the current playerbase who turned this review the way it did.

--{Gameplay}---
Like I said. The game mechanics, idea and execution actually is super cool. However as a new player you don't get a good first impression. Let me explain:
So I loaded up the game with a friend of mine. I spawn on a beach and start running clueless around smashing trees and rocks. After a couple minutes I figured out how to build a tiny shit.. I mean shed. 
I go back outside to try to find my friend. At this point another player runs up to me. I say ""Hey I'm friendly, I'm new to the game"" he then replies ""Fuck you (Insert 3x racist words here)"" and proceeds to scream and play racist songs through his mic as he kills me. 
First I think that I was just unlucky to have met one bad person. I soon found out that ~80% of the players are like that.

Generally super toxic and unfriendly community. I left the game feeling annoyed more that happy(Which is what I'd like to feel after playing a game). Which resulted in me uninstalling the game and I've not touched it since. 
Now some people may reply to this saying that this is just how this type of game genre is.
But I can say it's not. I've played SCUM, Unturned, DayZ ETC. And yes they had toxic people as well. But it was a much nicer experience as a new player to play those games over Rust. 

COD has a nicer community. 
"
28414,shit community
28415,"its a fun game where you can meet tons of toxic or nice players, depending on what server you're on. i recommend anyone with lots of spare time to try this game out"
28416,this is the best game ive ever played
28417,bought 1k dollar skin so im trying to convince myself this is the best game to ever exist.
28418,cyka

28429,"Waste of four thousand hours of my life, but I don't regret it cuz it was fun :)"
28430,"Good game, I love getting called the n-word, and fagot!"
28431,toxic but fun
28432,"This game is a 10/10 but it will waste many many hours of your life, its very good game to play on the weekend or after a long day its very satisfying when you get something done,but I personally wouldn't recommend it to very new PC players"
28433,better with friends
28434,it ruins ur social life.
28435,Game is very hard.

28451,good
28452,"I recommend this game with caveats. At its core Rust is a very fun game. Base building, crafting, farming, the aesthetics, all of it make for a great game. The problem comes with the fact that it's nearly a full-time job in its vanilla state. Rust greatly rewards players who can sink many thousands of hours into the game because of the meta (raiding, spray patterns, PVP, etc). If you're someone who can play it like a full-time job, great! If not, I recommend looking in to modded servers that reduce base upkeep, increase resource yields, or even non-PVP servers."

28469,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

The game has a problem with fat losers that sit on a roof all day just to kill you when you first play, or you get door camped by them, but overall rust is mid if you have no-life."

Well after being told many many times by my friends to buy it, I did. Biggest mistake of my life. When I play it, it's usually in spurts of 8-10 hours nearly every time. It's too fun. There's so much to do on modded and unmodded servers all of the time. PVE servers are where I cut my teeth due to the nature of people online, however in those PVE servers there's nothing but kind people who just want to play the game.

Twitch drops, sick skins, good community, crafting, building, destroying, mods, everything. Never disappoints. 9/10."

Just such a fantastic game where the player base is just so friendly. But also, everybody treats all the players equally. Everyone is never racist. Its just amazing how spectacular this fan base can truly be. To be honest, I would even recommend this to a newborn. This game is a MUST BUY."
28549,"fuck this piece of shit game

10/10"
28550,"One of my favourite games of the past, the scene greatly improved over the years, there isn't much toxicity anymore but the game got incrisingly flustrating and not fun as a solo. Massive clan bases dominating the beaches of freshspawns and raiding every offline base in the area on a wipe day, roofcampers who never get off their roofs, massive zergs, Chinese man with 3 hours on record who beams you from across the map. However this game is special, it's being improved with active ever growing community, if you like survival games that put a little more on a PvP/raiding aspect it's a game for you. Oh yeah there's also really advanced electrics and farming so if you're interested in that you'll be in haven, also there is drawing, had some fun on that on :3"
28551,dog shit game

28598,if you like a tight butthole dont buy
28599,Well the game play is solid. its your typical survival game with added pvp. but the rust community as a whole is T.O.X.I.C!!!
28600,"I don't like toxic games, though maybe you will.

Quite a toxic game though can be very fun to play when you have a group of friends in a less than toxic server.

Recommended only if you don't mind toxic games, otherwise RUST is decent.

Plus RUST is overpriced, just play Garry's Mod."

Yes I know I have the game loaded on a hard drive, but the game is basically unplayable when it takes 5 minutes to launch the game with an additional 10 minutes to load into a server. I do not recommend this game to anyone without an ssd."

28638,/.
28639,i love seeing dozens of dead naked men in the wild
28640,"This game is nothing like I've ever played. I wake up for this 9-5 job that I've subjected myself to. it's terrible but I can't bring myself to let it go. (Like Elsa from frozen) I've been playing for over 20 hours and I haven't been able to walk around let alone collect resources for a base before some twink with a bow shows up behind me (like that teleports behind you meme) and adds an extra hole in my chrome dome for him to skull fuck me with. My God I cant stop playing this game for the rush of dopeamean that it gives me when I murder a naked for no reason while he unexpectedly gathers resources for his ""own"" base, soon to be my new crib because he was too focused collecting stone for me. (he just didn't know it was mine yet). I would play this game for another 40 hours before installing cheats or hiring some wack 40-year-old to do everything for me so i can collet my loot form you soon to be demolished base. 10/10 would buy again."

28643,"its ""really fun"" mud hut monkey"

28645,"Gameplay is fine, slow, but fine. the main issue with this game is the extreme level of toxicity, racism, and aggression of most players you will interact with on ANY server, official, modded, or otherwise. 
Even PvE servers, which is not very common, have toxic people in chat. I'd say if you play league of legends and are as toxic or can handle a worse experience than the community of league this game is for you. then otherwise don't spend you money on this game."
28646,IT FUCKING SUCKS
28647,"Rust isn't about building a pretty fort with your friends, logging out and then coming back tomorrow to pick up where you left. No, Rust is about psychology. I have watched a bunch of naked men with rocks rove the hillside in search of the ""clothed"" and kill mercilessly. I have watched people come together over d*ck paintings they created together. Sometimes you will join a server and there is a small group that take everything and leave nothing. You might even be taken prisoner or trapped and then taunted until eventually it is too much and you give up on life. Much like real life there are good people and bad people. If you take games too seriously, you won't enjoy this. This is survival of the numbers and occasionally survival of the most clever. Never give up, never give in, it all starts with a rock."
28648,to glitched one server ai is completely broken and on others i keep getting disconnected consistantly as well there is a massive amount of hacking until it properly fixed i would not recommend this

28660,mid game waste of money
28661,fun game
28662,"So far, I can say that this game is very immersive and gets you feeling like you are in it.

With this said, a lot of players take your actions personally and lots of toxicity floats around.

However, I found that like in real life, these players are mostly trying to just have fun. Some of them only have fun killing or being toxic towards you. So every players experience varies. With that, the actual Review.

The visuals are great if your computer can handle them.
Game design is simple and brilliant, the more complex you wish it to be, the more complex it can be.

Base building is fun.
Raiding other players is fun.
Counter Raiding successfully is hella fun.
Gathering Materials is relaxing with sudden spikes of terror provided by sudden auditory ques. Sometimes it's the music. Sometime it's the sound of nearby gunfire. Sometimes its a bear, wolf, boar or naked.

Highly recommended. You will find yourself spending thousands of hours in this game."
28663,"Hit a couple trees, place a TC, kill a zerg member that was naked and you are raided 1 hour into wipe, and your addicted. Racist and toxic asf, will make you depressed and ruin your sleep schedule. Have a relationship? Its over now. 10/10 would recommend."

28720,"Very intense and action packed, MUST have a high mental capacity, your sanity is constantly being
tested. Its a good game once you get the hang of things, though the whole process can be very time consuming.
I would rate the in game community a 6.5 out of 10, it is possible to find a a non toxic person but the ratio of 
that and encountering a toxic one heavily favors the toxic side. Game is a 8.3 out of 10 overall."

The only bad part is that you have to watch a lot of tutorial on the internet to know what to do in the game. I give Rust 8/10.

28857,"I haven't played this game in years so understand, the PVP was soul crushingly hard as a noobie solo, then they added PVE and it was even more soul crushingly hard. Lets be clear, no matter what they did or can ever do is make this a game you can ONLY play PVP w/ homies. Sure, I could do purely run a passworded server myself and do pure pve, but that as they say is neither here nor there. So. in final sumation, take my word as somebody who learned the hard-way playing solo for over 1000 hours, understand this is a game that at it's core gives every advantage to an aggressor and not a co-operative solo player. Its just human nature. You know it, I know it, and the developers know this, and so you can bet me a taco twelve pack if it aint true that this is a game that incentivises such."

28952,"Sup bbgs, the game is horseshit, i'd rather play minecraft and their graphics can be run on any fucking computer whereas on this game you have to have at least a 3060 ti and ryzen 9 cpu, overall the community is also quite shitty including the person sitting 2 seats away from me right now. Every wipe I played put me under constant stress as at any point while I am offline there will be one sad cunt waiting and ready to strike and raid me whilst I am offline actually having a life. All the people on this game are all sleep deprived and all need to go get lives as they are most likely foreign and will have a go at me after i kill them. I remember the last time I played the game, I was casually running around naked with a boombox listening to BBC Radio 1 (banger btw) and then out of no where a saddo by the name of Goose (i'm pretty sure) snipes me and then I start to get slightly annoyed as I have done nothing wrong and out of the blue this guy kills me with his Bolt Action Sniper Rifle and I see his unfunny profile picture, I start to cry inside as I see the most cringey and unfunny shit on my screen as I respawn I notice I spawned near where I died before so I travelled to my dead body, got my boombox, and went over to where he killed me from and started blasting BBC Radio 1 (banger btw) outside his base, then he told me to ""fack off"" quote on quote, I then respond with ""suck your mum"" then he comes outside his base and knocks me on the floor with his Pump Shotgun then he shouts some random stuff down the microphone as my ears cry blood. I wish anyone that plays this game the worse and I hope you get the help you desperately need, cleanse your sins my child."

Wasted time that could've been used on more productive things like exercising, getting work done, or simply playing a game that doesn't consume so much time and is more fun. 

Final score: Sleep deprivation & time wastin'/ 10

Conclusion: For the love of **** please don't buy this game, and if you already have I would recommend quitting the game and giving all of your loot to someone in a beginner 2x2"

28998,"This is the hardest and stressful survival game I’ve ever played. No matter how good you're doing, no matter what you have. This game will take away and push you back down to square one. Now despite that sounding awful it does have a lot of pros. Firstly the look is just jaw dropping, I know a lot of survival games go off that realistic look but I think Rust does it the best. Secondly the combat, if you’ve played games like Dayz it’ll go off that feel. Hectic fire fights between party’s over anything, even a can of beans. And lastly the music holy shit is the music good, I even got some of it on my phone like the main menu and warlord. Now even with this review being a positive I will say that Rust is not for the faint of heart. Despite losing all your stuff in a blink of an eye the community is very toxic. Plenty of racists, swastikas, and homophobes. I remember one time I was walking around a fresh spawn, and a guy shot me and said “sorry pal but you're black”. So if you're not strong willed or just don’t prefer that then don’t buy this game."

Now im hooked and its a very fun realistic pvp/pve survival game where you can have fun and chill with friends on the shoreline or can raid bases and take all their stuff.


However there are two thing that I do not like about this game.  One is that that game itself cost $40.00 USD     which is on the more expensive side for games.
The second thing I don't like but isn't terrible, is that if you want skins for you items you have to pay money. 
Usually the good skins are around $10-15 USD.     However they do occasionally give you free skins whether its from twitch drops or from playtime its always nice to get them!"

29089,"Bare-bones AI - Every bear, every scientist, every chicken have eyes covering every square inch of their heads. And those eyes have 100/100 vision, able to seeing through walls, in pitch black, through your base. Just play around with a scientist by peaking in and out of their LOS, then you'll see just how miserable PVE is in this game.

Toxic community - Bustling servers entail the loud and obnoxious, uncontrollable racism, full-time griefers, clans seeking record time in making new players leave, uninstall, and demand a refund. Sparse servers entail unfettered door campers, stalkers, ESP trolls and stash swipers/breakers.

Hackers - Hackers are EVERYWHERE. Some smart about not getting caught, some not so much. But they are EVERYWHERE, because Rust is apparently not as complicated of a game and crucial coding not so ssafeguarded. Who would've thought!

Strict but barbaric Anti-cheat system - How many fluke flyhack violations will it take to get to the tootsieroll center of a tootsie pop?

This game is nearing its 10 year anniversary and the amount of bugs and game flaws/exploits I come across is unprecedented. Mini helicopter suddenly go boom mid-flight. I'm standing on top of a tipped boat, then somehow mount it, sitting upside-down, underwater. 5 bears clipped inside a marsh shack, I get up close for a screenshot, then they all noclip out like a scene straight from the grudge. A stranded floatation despawning from right under my feet, literally LAUNCHING me 15ft deep in water because that obviously wasn't intended to happen. Safe Zones hurt you more than help you.

I received no email or sms message and after receiving my account back roughly 7 hours later, i see i have an alert that i have been permanently banned from rust. So i load in, and i see whoever hacked me went onto an official server and hacked, so i go to appeal for an unban request through easy anti cheat and maybe 4 hours later i get a response saying that i need to protect my account better and they cant unban me regradless of who was on the account at the time. Please tell me what the point of having an unban appeal if its not possible to become unbanned i'm debating on buying another copy or not. I only have 82 hours on the game and i already cannot play agin i like rust so i think im going to buy another copy but im very dissapointed with Easy Anti Cheat and Steam."

29167,"very nice game, just need a descent specs for this hoping that facepunch will fix this or enhance to make more playable (smooth gameplay) on medium to semi low end pc/laptop"
29168,"This game is great and executes it's factors well, however due to the inherent way this game is meant to be played I can not recommend this game to every type of player. Don't start playing this game as if it is a PvE. It's designed to be a hard and nasty fight against other players(as well as the environment from time to time) and really doesn't work(nearly) as great if played trying to be kind to other people like everyone there is your friendly neighbour."

29200,Its a very amazing game if your into at creative but pvp game should defernetly try this game out i very much love this game get it i dare you ehhehehehhHhHHh
29201,"mid, makin up it aight
"
29202,Half my wipe is spent at the roulette wheel in bandit camp. I have no regrets.
29203,The right kind of open world PvP survival i wanna smash my keyboard and never play this game again but im going to anyway type of game
29204,Good made me more racist tho
29205,good game if you dont get killed over and over and over again
29206,shit
29207,"Excellent survival game!  It can be frustrating and difficult sometimes, but when you do it right, it feels real good."
29208,very good game fun and action packed
29209,"Don't play it if you are not forced to

Revision:

29210,Hi binda!
29211,survival but youll die a lot to pvp
29212,its a hard game but really good it takes a while to get in but it is fun
29213,fun good dont die ak good
29214,"Don't make the same mistakes I did
"
29215,BC ITS A WASTE OF UR TIME
29216,goood game
29217,"I've had Rust since close to the beginning, I've seen it go through lots of changes. It is the best game to show you how humanity really works. You can't trust anyone, and if you play solo you'll learn alot about yourself. It's a unique challenge with lots to do besides just getting materials, and building a base. Overall a very fun game, and the best of the survival genre."
29218,"its very good
"
29219,this game is addicting
29220,I love being killed by naked people
29221,so good
29222,Play now and get killed by a clan!
29223,very cool

29233,good game
29234,good
29235," ,"
29236,"well this is a game for pretty much anyone its well rounded in survival and sociopaths. most toxic nut addicting game u can have. one min you damn near tear your pc apart with rage next your having time of ur life so for rust heres to wasting more of my life lol
"
29237,Make a Rust 2
29238,"Rust is an amazing and awesome game. Whether you have friends or no friends (loser) to play Rust with, it really doesn't matter. If you play right and focus on having fun you're going to have a great time playing this game.

10/10 Recommend"
29239,no
29240,"Awesome game, if your not into PVP look at the modded servers"
29241,"It's good, if you're good. Getting started with this game is very rough. Other players with tens of thousands of hours absolutely know the game in and out and will ruthlessly destroy you over and over again. I'm 285 hours in and honestly have barely improved. This is a skill based game with lots of thought required in order to get good. If you want a game that IS very very fun, with lots to do, lots to learn, and will keep you entertained for hours on end and fully immerse you, this is your game hands down. If you're a filthy casual such as myself. Pick another game."
29242,yes
29243,fun
29244,yes
29245,i hate how people are so toxic they camp your door all the time and yell in there mics every surver i play people with ak just roof camp and kill starters you cant even have a good time without a guy with a ak or a m249 running up on you and by the ways i have alot more hours then this
29246,i allways wanted to tell my crush that i like her but dont know how to
29247,do not play this game... you will get addicted and you will never be able to escape
29248,black skin
29249,oh hell nah
29250,one of the most unique games ever if nothing else
29251,"None of my friends want to play this with me, and I suck.  I get scared when I run into a cactus and take damage.  I die a lot and lose gear sets all the time.  BUT, when I do manage to make a play or get some good loot, feels great.  This game slaps, 10/10.  Make Christmas lights cheaper you bastards."
29252,love the game
29253,good game
29254,amazing game one of my favorites do not play

I get the feeling that they just want the positive feedback, but not put in the work...

29361,"Comprei o jogo pra testar com um amigo, e achei o jogo simplesmente lindo! O gráfico simplesmente lindo, o jogo é cinematográfico, dai, vem a jogabilidade ... nunca consegui me acostumar, me divirto com amigos, mas a jogabilidade com as armas não tem aquele ~tchan~, sabe? fora isso, jogo é lindo e muito completo!"
29362,Such a shitty community
29363,Server lag is ridiculous in the game. And it's all servers. My computer can handle the game better than the servers can. PVP is stale and the PVP servers are dominated by people who play incessantly. Casual players are relegated toPVE. There's a marked failure to provide any safe haven for new or casual players. The game has great potential and could be very engaging but it would require some thoughtful development. Like most games these days this one seems to be headed in the direction of appealing to addiction rather than strategy.
29364,i want to die cuz these 3.8 hours that i have i spent loading rust and i dint even playerd it....
29365,Awesome game
29366,i love it.

29375,"very amazing base buding but the pvp not so mutch

29400,Lacks mechanics. 10 year olds screaming at the mic and deceiving you to kill you and eat you. Log out and everything is gone the next day. What's the point? Don't you already live an already stressful life that you need to make it worse?
29401,"I already have nearly 50hrs on this game and love it already, i used to play the bummier version of it (console rust) but i just recently got a pc and it has been so much fun."

29413,Game is pretty fun if you know ak spray :)
29414,I was part of the 60v14 raid on a dif account :)
29415,"[h1] Countless hours of entertainment [/h1]

[b] I could spend days working on this review but I will keep it simple for everyone.
The competition makes most of rust up, you cant go one day without a challenge and not being able to advance is a challenge. Everything from raiding to shooting has been thought about, are you going to be
countered when raiding? You don't know... Is there anything decent inside the base? You don't know...
Its this lack of info that makes Rust unique and there are no other games like it.  [/b]

[h1] The stories [/h1]

[b] Ah so you read this far to go here? Well, Rust has many stories that you can always remember... I know this part is short, however I will upload many of my stories on Rust on a variety of servers, check it out at youtube (via my profile) [/b]

[h1] The End [/h1]"

29434,"I love spending an eternity getting nowhere and then losing the nothing I barely had on a daily basis. Hitting a tree wherever the red X randomly pops up is certainly the pinnacle of any gameplay experience. And how could I forget about the countless amount of racists that are slowly taking over the game to corrupt the minds of every masochistic twelve year old they can find. All in all, I rarely have the pleasure of playing a game that is so thoroughly unenjoyable from start to whenever you realize you might as well be naked, homeless, and continually on the brink of death in the realworld. This game is genius because you'll realize just what a massive waste your pitiful life truly has been and always will be. 11/10 - Would recommend to my worst enemy just to know they're going to invariably get ganked by a band of weebs that seek to reach the apex worst of unlikeable no-lives."

29496,"I spent the entirety of the time in a loading screen, leaving me to think over if it was truly the right choice to buy the game. Luckily, I refunded before I could go over the 2 hour mark. I am very thankful that the initial loading screen gives you time to escape. 10/10

Edit: I'm buying the game again out of curiosity, I know this will not end well."

29535,great game
29536,"i learned 6 new slurs 

10/10"
29537,"Ok, i think the game is one of the best survival games, so many good mechanics and content and you can't take that away from the game. OMG, the GUNPLAY and PVP it's ONE OF THE WORST I have ever seen in an FPS GAME!!!!!.
I don't know where to start, movement is super clunky feels like a robot, full INPUT LAG, DELAY, and animation takes ages!!.
Can't ADS while jumping, can't SHOOT while jumping if you try to swap weapon or item while the animation is playing ""EVEN IF IS THE LAST FRAME"" if you take the weapon back you need to do the ENTIRE ANIMATION AGAIN!!!!! even if you already put the new magazine in and load the chamber!.
And finally, after ages try to go in ADS, as soon you press the left mouse to shoot you gotta be ready for one of the worst gun recoil i have ever experienced in my 15 years of FPS games.
It's totally unplayable the gun swing left and right like it's shooting .50 cal, i don't want to spend 2000hours trying to learn a gun pattern this is not what an fps game is and the worst part is not this.
If i am controlling the recoil how i am supposed to be at 100% of my aim? i can't control recoil like this and pretend to have the same tracking flicking and mouse control i have on a normal game.
Anyway, i am uninstalling this game, and i will come back ONLY if the gunplay gets updated because atm feels like a game from 2005."

29579,good game ig
29580,"yeah why not... constantly dropping new updates, new skins, all sorts of cool stuff. The community can be toxic, but most of the time the interactions are funny, or at least amusing in some way. Building could be a little more satisfying. but still this is easily the best all rounder survival crafting PVP."

29593,"You will get screwed over, you will want to cause pain to yourself and other, you will wish you were never born, you will get tripled by an ak kid up on that cliff and you will want to uninstall the game. You will also encounter more toxicity than I have ever seen in my life. However I can confirm this is a 11/10 game and would recommend."

29610,/
29611,"Awesome and very interesting game. It requires a lot of your time. Graphics are fine and gameplay is fairly okay. This game could be harsh on new comers as it requires a fair amount of knowledge of survival games. The learning curve is pretty straight forward. One down side to this is it needs a lot of processing power along with graphics processing and a fast internet connection. Medium to slow internet connect would be a disaster. Bottom line, make sure you have atleast 16 GB of RAM, any Intel 6th gen processor/or equivalent  and a fast internet connection before buying this."
29612,good game

29831,"Fun temporary survival game. However, no real story line or rewards for big events. If you are looking for a PVP survival game with a finite time on the server before you are raided, go for it! Hop on a server and PVP and try to build up to a raid-able power but you will most likely get raided before that. Picture ARK (Dino survivor game ...) But with guns and modernized."

29864,"I like when big black people punching with a rock and shooting me with a AK-47(popularnija varijanta ""AKM"" ili ""Avtomat Kalašnjikova, modernizirani"" automatsko je jurišno oružje korišteno u većini država Istočnoga bloka tijekom hladnoga rata. Standardiziran 1947. godine, dizajnirao ga je Mihajl Kalašnjikov, a prvotni proizvođač bio je ruski IZH.[1] U usporedbi s većinom automatskih pušaka u II. svjetskom ratu, AK je kompaktan, gađa na pristojnu udaljenost, snažan je i sposoban za mijenjanje načina pucanja (automatski, poluautomatski, a postoji i opcija namještanja na način da je potrebno repetirati nakon svakoga metka). Jedan je od prvih pravih jurišnih pušaka, a u širokoj upotrebi je i danas, najpopularnija jurišna puška ikada. Proizvedeno je više modela AK-a od ijednog drugog borbenog oružja.[1] Brojne derivacije i obrasci pušaka u drugim zemljama se osnove na njoj, pogotovo popularno u siromašnijim zemljama gerilskih vojnika i gerilama Arapskih zemlja, bivšeg Sovjetskog bloka itd.)"

29905,"Amazing game, would recommend. Community can be a bit dodgy but I have had some really wholesome moments here. One tip: avoid anyone (in a combat scenario) who says that their (insert weapon name here) spray is good, that means that they can control their gun so that it has essentially no recoil. Good luck and go kick some ass!!"
