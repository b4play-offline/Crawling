17,Don't buy it
18,"R6 was the reason I wanted a PC originally. but now this game just doesn't feel good to me anymore. I played on Xbox from 1.0 all the way to the end of year 6, I originally bought the game because I thought it would be an actual tactical shooter, but I grew to love it, but through the years the game has fallen from what it once was. Its now just an arcade shooter to me. There's no more realism, team play has gone to dogshit, and Gadgets that belong in sci-fi movies. In my opinion the game has been in a steady decline since chimera, but im still recommending this game. Because I started playing when I was 14 and I'm now 20 and even with the game being bad in my opinion some one new might find this game fun. Also they should remove Clancy's name from this game. Because this is not Rainbow Six game in all its aspects, beside the name"

54,"Don't recommend the game. As I am writing this review, this is my most played game on steam. I have many issues with the game that still have yet to change. The game's fights are often really fun and the pace of the game has been really smooth and addicting. The issues are outside the game and its management:

-Other players/the community is often toxic towards each other. In every competitive ranked match I have had to deal with people purposefully throwing the game or killing their own teammates on purpose. Ive had several matches where players abused glitches and bugs in the system to get me and other teammates banned from matchmaking. Reporting players takes forever to get a result and either way I still have to pay a 30 minute matchmaking ban because of the player that abused the glitch.

-Paywalls... every season a new character releases and is only available to those who buy the battle pass for the first month or so of every season. And if you did end up waiting for your turn to get the character, you still have to play an outrageous amount of hours to just get enough in-game currency to buy the character.

-Constantly changing meta... every update to the game changes the meta in some big way. They are always changing recoil on guns and their fire rates so much so that its not easy to get used to anything. On top of the behind the scenes changes and the recoils, they change what attachments are available for specific guns so often that your loadout has to change.

-Bugs in the game take forever to get fixed and even then, they often fix a bug and another bug comes up. For a long time there could be just a simple issue that for some reason forces your gun to have a certain attachment when you are a specific character and just messes with your usual aiming practices.

-Unable to find a balance... The game is unable to find a balance and the balance is so often swayed completely by every season. I wish they could just at least postpone a season to focus on the balancing issues they have at hand.

-Ignoring player/community requests... A little story has to start with a character they added called Blackbeard. The character has the ability to attach a shield to his gun in order to shield his head from headshots. In this game, the headshots are what matters as they are all 1 shot kills and its how fights go. This character was a disruption to the meta for a LONG time and they never changed the character until they eventually made the shield only able to withstand about 1 or 2 bullets and therefor now is a pointless character they should have just removed or redid his ability."
55,I would say this Game is quite amazing fast pace first person shooter it makes you use critical thinking and strategy in order to gain the upper hand but you really don't need any of that XD as long as you pay attention check your corners and move together all is good but overall this is an amazing game I would recommend to all friends
56,
57,good game/ fun to play with friends
58,"look for yourself

59,"Dogshit company ruins their own game. I was on peak season and my friend was banned for ""toxic behavior"" and so they completely reset my MMR. I was 3 games out of diamond for the first time and I asked for help ""there's nothing we can do"""

78,"Best game ever. This game is an artwork that has implemented brain damage and soul-grabbing jinns into my head. I still remembered the day I purchased this which was the best decision of my life! It was like my full consciousness to be put to 100% of the left brain cells that I have. Depression raided my brain the day I played this cool cool game. Every nerf and every buff did not really affect me but affected the community. Developers had never really thought of listening to the people that actually played this game but only listened to higher-ups. It is truly crazy how racist this game is, not only it restricted some skins not to be given to certain races but just to be given some very epic helmets for the operators that I barely used. Not only just that it had affected how my life worked and relationships to only decline every offer of human connection in order to sacrifice my life to this epic game. This game is truly a drug for the people who are really attached and intrusive it felt like it was a white torture room and the only tunnel vision for living was to play this game. Escaping from the addiction of playing this game was one of the best decisions of my life and only just to transfer to an epic game called VALORANT. It really had me punishing myself in order to feel that light once more in my entire life, feeling the restrain of my brain due to this awesome game affected my long road to life. Now that I packed a black ice while writing this journal of the affect of Rainbow Six Siege on my life I truly apologize but never really deep-inside."

87,"The game is really slow at the start. You fight your best but here are just people who are better than you. Then a change happens. You fall in love with a character and only start using them. You start to win more often. You get 2nd or 3rd or maybe even 1st. This game is amazing so if you have the patience, skill and determination to sit through some losses, you can play this game no problem and you will enjoy it."

3. Game counts crash as abandoning match... gets banded for 24H after activating a booster?
4. F....... Ubisoft and that B.S.
Great competitive game though so thumbs up for that but absolute trash for not fixing whatever they did to this season!

In addition theres No sound on main menu, no Voice overs, no announcer for match start or end and you guys call this a game?"

  Funny way:

    Step 1. Die (Don't worry, it's not your fault)
    Step 2. Spectate Teammate that's using Drones
    Step 3. They spot an enemy and yellow mark location
    Step 4. They rush the enemy
    Step 5. They die anyway because Cav was waiting the entire time
    Step 6. Shit-talk them the entire game because they deserve it for Droning 
    Step 7. Repeat for the next round


  Funnier Way:

176,"Great franchise that was ahead of its time, a shining superb tactical shooter that had little competition. Now this part in particular is terrible in almost everything. Poor balance, ugly gun physics that are neither realistic nor fun, jonky controls and unmemorizable maps. A lack of truly interesting operators, instead this game shoves a """"new"""" overpowered transgender/minority guy (or gal whatever) into your face for a huge price every month. And they nerf it with time, as they do with basically everything, starting with operator abilities and gadgets to weapons and amount of ammo/grenades. Instead of giving us quality of life updates and bug/netcode fixes, they do cosmetic reworks that no one asked about. Jeez.

They cant learn to make a game to save their asses, their dumb new ""Ubisoft connect"" is known to max your CPU for literally no reason at all. Ubi continues to make the game worse and worse, listening only to professional players whining, adding absolutely ridiculous ideas to a ""realism"" game, and truly just ruining the Siege experiance, all pushing some ""competitive enviroment"" bs. One year ago i would have 100% recomended it, now i simply cannot. L Ubi."

The only real downside is that it is from ubisoft.
The invites dont work half the time and you need to wait like 20 secs before the ubisoft connect turns on

8.5/10 buy it when it is on sale, which is very often <3"
328,"Game randomly freezes in the middle of the match so I relaunch the game to try and reconnect, unfortunately it won't let me reconnect to the match due to error 4-0xfff0be25 even tho I shouldn't have any internet connection issues of any sort, and then I somehow get a 2 hour ban for it because I couldn't reconnect.

348,"After spending close to 3000 hours and been playing this game for more then 7 years(3000 hours on PC btw the rest I was on console), I have to say being in lower lobbies(Bellow gold 3) is quite fun/enjoyable to play the game. Once you've reached higher elo's, it's really fun how the the anti-cheat does not detect a person running at 100 mp/h and some how you get shot from above/under directly at you. Not only that, this game made my relationship with my family to deteriorate and many friends lost after trying to focus souly into this great game. Overall, I think this game is worth the buck."
349,"i bought this game before its cheap but now maybe more expensive. but its worth even if the game price expensive. here theres many operator, i recommend dont buy all of it with your pocket money just grind thats the point of game. idk what to say but this game is very cool especially aim mechanic theres no complicated game mechanic like valorant just reinforce then prepare to kill attacker. so here's my important thing to say ; for those who are new pls just go to newcomer match its no hard you will learn, dont go to casual"

399,Nice game
400,"Ubisoft is scum. They make you connect to their own platform to launch the game and all it does is add a layer of headaches and technical issues that I don't experience when playing all of my other online steam games. Sometimes it can take a good 20 minutes or more of restarts before my friends and I can actually get into the same party and play. in 2022, for a 7 year old game, this is absurd. Just today out of nowhere the game asked me to initiate a two step security authentication where ubisoft asked for my name, email, and cell phone number. Why do I need to give you this to play a video game i've already paid for and have been playing for years?

Overall, It's a fun game when you can get it working, and I can appreciate that ubisoft does continue to add to it, but as a company ubisoft is turning into EA and i don't like supporting their practices.

One more thing to mention, I haven't had too many issues with cheaters, but accidental and intentional team killing has happened, which begs the question; WHY ISN'T REVERSE FRIENDLY FIRE ON BY DEFAULT? I don't understand the logic in letting someone kill a teammate first and then they only get penalized if they do it a second time. If i'm the person who got killed, why should I pay for someone else's idiocy, especially if that person was intentionally being a jerk? Why shouldn't they be punished immediately?  Reverse friendly fire is a great mechanic, but it would make a hell of a lot more sense if it was always on."
401,just dont get it. for your own sake
402,A little dog shit sometimes but as long as you're good it is fun. StombieKing223 wrote a review saying this game is ass but that is because he is ass.

It will say they are all offline when they are not, OR They will be in a party trying to invite me, and I don't get any of them, it says they are out of time."
409,before you buy this game please note that sometimes the community is nice but other times they like to trash talk from the grave

437,good as hell
438,This game would be a amazing if it were not owned by Ubisoft. It was almost perfect in 2018 and every year after it has gotten worse with both political correctness and map builds/changes. If this game is ever owned by any other company I would buy it three times over.
439,"If you buy just the base game well then prepare to spend a LOT of time grinding for JUST ONE guy. I think the game plays fine and  looks good, but is monetized like a free to play. I think it would make every one happier if the devs just lowered the in game cost of an operator. I feel the game play gets borring after a while because you have so few options to choose for strategies when you star playing. When I started out playing the game I really felt this part this and almost quit, but the in game events and youtubers made me come back and give it a second chance. I have played the game for 75 hours and so far have unlocked about 5 of nonbasic operators which cost 10000 of the in game currency and basic operators cost  about 1000 in game currency, you will get about 100 - 400 in game currency for each 20  minute game.
and if you  want buy any event cosmetics you can't, you buy to buy a loot box and hope you get the item you want, do i even have to explain why this is wrong? I have never spent a signal penny in this game as of writing this quick review. 
Quick note: there is a bit hacker problem right now and i don't see getting fixed any time soon.
Conclusion: I wouldn't recommend this game but if your into slow past tactical shooters then give it a try during one of the free weekends so that you don't wast any of your hard earned cash that could have been used to buy Eldon Ring!"
440,i prefer the game to all of those people who wants to chill in a game that is competetice like cs but has the visuals of cod and it has need of iq of dota 2

458,"Dying. Learning what not to do. Repeat. Its such and addicting loop though that I start thinking of strategies while doing other things.

I was on the fence about Siege before buying. How fun could attacking and defending be over and over. It turns out its VERY fun. Each match plays out radically differently depending on operators chosen, map, and objective.  But honestly, even with the above variables remaining the same, no two matches are ever the same.  Its honestly one of my favorite multiplayer games, up there with Apex Legends and Overwatch.  The learning curve may be steep but its well worth it."
459,"The game is fun but can be frustrating.

The real problem is Ubisoft for following reasons:
- Problems playing with friends 
   - Example: 2 of my friends can send me invites but not to each other and i cant send any, because they just dont show up
     or expire instantly. This happens frequently and can take minutes or an hour of your time.
- Ubisoft makes dumb balancing deciscions 
  - Example: LMGs were overpowerd so they nerf every single weapon in the game by increasing the recoil
- Every second alpha or bravo pack (the skin lootboxes) is a terrible charm( keychains but for your gun) because there a 
  nearly 300 of them and at least 200 a unusable garbage

In conlusion: Game: good

542,Very detail oriented. Not very forgiving. High skill gap so it will take a while for you to get used to the game. Find a group of friends and either start the game together or join a group that already plays as it will be very difficult to have a good experience as a new player.

Slithering through hallways catching unaware attackers with puffs from a near silent Taurus Pistol and forcing them to sign their teammates' death warrants in their own blood. And broken guns and tools that were so broken, Ubisoft had to make them nearly unusable for people to stop picking the associated operator.

I think the game could honestly prepare anyone for these units in real life if they play for more than 10 hours. All the operators are great and easy to pick up. My personal favorites are Glaz and IQ. I think IQ is the best operator though because of her passive ability called ""I have a fat boonda"".

649,Multi-Billion dollar company can't make a functioning game. The lead dev team who made the conscious decision to ruin this shit should straight up start bagging groceries for the health of the game. would do everyone a massive favor. And whatever troglodyte signed a deal with battleye for like 10 years or whatever should do the same. Make a new fucking engine and port siege over to that. it'll solve most of the problems. yall are sitting on 100s of millions. You've beaten your magnum opus beyond recognition. You're an embarrassment to Game development teams around the world.

Why constantly change all the weapon condition & the scope?

I m really TIRED of all those changes that are not necessary, so that the game play by the way u guys want it (u thought its balance, but its not what player want), TIRED of training again & again in order to familiar with the game every time u guys changed it.

Game is means to be fun, but now its just exhausting.

Besides that, the game become more & more lag after recent updates. (e.g. suddenly lag for a few second during the game, its happen a lot of times).

I will stop playing this game if this situation persist."

687,"The game is full of bugs. Every new season new bugs come up. There are problems with the cloud servers , there are issues with the connectivity there is latency and it is not even your internet's fault it is literally ubisoft just not doing a good job. I don't know if their development team is that bad and just doesn't care about anything. I bet they don't even discuss those issues. Just like blizzard wait until they actually get angry and leave so you can get them back by saying hey we fixed everything and trying to do better(which is actually a lie especially when blizzard followed that tactic). Anyways the game is not good. You want to play it play it I am not saying you are not gonna have fun you will, but that won't last for long unless the game is actually working properly. I'll laugh off the bugs once or twice it's funny to actually stable upon them but when it happens regularly it's just shows how much the developers don't give a rats ass about the players who play this game."

Gone are the days were it was a simple breach and clear game where the better shot and the mechanics and gadgets were fresh and simple. They keep adding more and more gadgets hoping that perk 62 will counter and finally balance the meta when they just keep making it worse and worse. Fix spawn peeking, fix ridiculus pixel peaks that you have to know to actually stand a chance,  or any of the dozen other issues that the community at large want adressed?

764,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

784,"Right in the game's menu, I noticed that it doesn't recognize my mouse settings. Why? Simply a small query of the Windows mouse setting would fix this… uff, directly uninstalled again. The primary mouse button is not recognized and can't be changed within the game.

External programs that can set the mouse buttons don't help either. Although the change of keys is recognized, the game itself says that its internal settings are ALSO used. This results in the following action when the primary button is clicked: both the primary and secondary mouse buttons are registered when clicked. Why? It works for good games...

For anyone who's wondering, what's his problem? Try to put yourself in our situation. Change the primary key in the settings of your operating system (or your mouse driver). Operate your PC like this – that's how we feel when the program doesn't recognize the switch."

should i buy this game now ? Don't, but if u really want to buy it just wait for it to get a discount its not worth to pay the full price, or play CS:GO instead, a much better game"

it used to be a realistic game but it has shifted tides to make belief gadgets, so if your into historical realism its probably not the game for you, idk maybe just give it a go!!!"

890,"After returning to the game after several months, I was told that to play competitive I had to enter my phone number into the 2-factor authentication.  No big deal.
My phone number is apparently ""invalid"", and support basically said try another number or too bad.

So I guess it's now a coin flip if you can even play the ranked game mode or not.  Absolutely unreasonable."

895,"This Game is Demoralizing, Its just pure garbage. Now don't get me wrong, Its fun and addicting sometimes, but the other times it just makes you feel like your time and effort devoted to this game is worth nothing. On top of this the Rank system is mostly based off of if you win or loose your game, so that means that one person could ruin your hours of developing your rank by throwing. All in all this game is fun and addicting like I said but in the end your working toward something which is not purely based off skill. Also Ubisoft made the game so that tells you that much about it already. Not worth"
896,"Not the game I played for years on xbox anymore, a shadow of its former self even. Not only has ubisoft gone in and broken every aspect of the game that once made it great, they also can't even keep servers up properly. To top it all off, the operator packs work when they FEEL like it, and they decided not to work for me. Honestly if I was gonna waste $70 I'd rather go to the strip club"

976,"This game is, IMO, the best shooter available on the market. Balanced guns, nice operators, good gameplay experience. BUT, BUT, the game's infrastructure is TOTALLY SHIT. I hate UBI! Game loading bugs, sound fuck-ups, invite problems, skin stripping when you log in, basically no cloud save because UBI. All kinds of errors regarding the infrastructure. I will never play an Ubi game after this and this should tell you how cool the game is, because DESPITE the fact that I hate how they handle all the bugs regarding the experience, the game itself is top tier (and this is the only reason I still play it). It is worth!"

Actually no, calling the game dogshit is a disrespect to dogs and their shit. sorry dogs.

A new update came in, 36 fucking gigs of update? This game is bad, the developers are bad, the publisher is bad. If you want to be a normie drone playing the mainstream, sure go be a nobody.
If u got any sense in your head, go watch the grass grow outside, its better use of your time than playing this game."
1022,its ok
1023,fun
1024,"Ubisoft is making it less fun with every update. They nerf shit that doesn't need nerfing, and don't ever buff anything. Then there's also dumb reworks that nobody needs. 

I never played it, but old R6 looks infinitely more fun. Less dumb gadgets I have to keep in mind, realism (something the R6 series was known for, from what I've heard) and better looking graphics (I'm not kidding, look it up)

It's also unintuitive as fuck. New players will not have fun, at first. It helps a lot when you play with a friend who's good at it to help you learn it. If you don't have that, don't even think about bothering."

1035,THIS GAME HAS BEEN OUT FOR ALMOST 7 YEARS AND ITS STILL OPTIMIZED LIKE SHIT. IT USES ALL OF MY CPU AND THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR NOT JUST ME BUT OTHER PEOPLE. THE GAME STRUGGLES WITH ITS FRAMES UNLESS FOR SOME REASON YOU NEED A CHAD PC TO RUN IT. CONSTANTLY STUTTER LAGGING TO A POINT THAT THE GAME BECOMES UNPLAYABLE UNLESS YOU CAN SEE THROUGH TIME.

"
1050,"Don't let advertisements fool you. This game is a wack hodgepodge of styles and has no world grounding. The rules of the siege world keep changing and at this point I'm pretty sure they've got some stuff that's so advanced it doesn't even exist in Star Wars. Immersion is completely lost at this point, and any coherent theme this game had no longer exists.

I'm only recommending it for the gameplay because I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a good time. Semi-Destructive environments combined with planning and pretty solid shooting mechanics overall make for a fun experience that gets your attention."

1058,"I played a game with my bros and then the game decided to shit out and kick me, then it proceeds to give me no option to reconnect to the game, but the reason I'm not recommending it is because it gave me 60 FUCKING MINUTES FOR A PENALTY I DIDN'T COMMIT. Absolutely amazing design of a game, so incredible, spare yourself the oxygen of looking at this horseshit and dying of cringe from a wait time longer than your moms fat rolls and more autistic than Ricky Berwick if he had a kid with Chris Chan.

Otherwise... Pretty Neat Game."

1068,"Having played R6 on PS4 from launch all the way up into the one season with the riot cop lady with the shield, I can definitively say that old siege was much better. Siege peaked at operation breakout, afterwards there wasnt alot keeping me going. And Recruit, my sweetest Recruit... how Ubisoft has butchered you so. Gone are the days of versatile Recruit plays. My M870 rushes, My Shield Rollouts, My Fun: Gone ;(

TL;DR:
Old Siege was better, save your money."

When I load up this game, I am already covered in sweat. The amount of greasy children that break their necks to peek a corner is horrendous. As I write this my fingers slip across the keyboard due to the game play trailer showing the next 200 different gadgets added to the game.

1207,"Played this for quite some time. I must say one of the crisp PvP games out there but the more you will play the more you will question god and re-evaluate life choices, although it is too late...you can't probably think anything else than R6 now. The game itself is pretty free apart from the buying price but you probably will notice that keyboards/mice are now a monthly necessity. The playerbase will remind you how they love your mother every game....very wholesome and if you are lucky enough your teammates will show you why shampoo bottles needs instructions. If you have friends to play this game together then don't worry soon you won't have any because Monopoly is a close second to R6 when it comes to the reason for homicide. 
Doing cocaine gives brain damage like R6 Siege but doing cocaine also makes you feel like your life is a little better for a few moments.....unlike R6 Siege. But either way you will end up being an addict and return to the game even after vowing to never return 1 year ago.....sounds specific? because that's me. Anyway give it a go if you want, I'll go finish my clown makeup....need to hide the depression."

the game itself well it was good. was good. not anymore it goes more and more to appese the esports players. not normals or people that want to play for few hours a week. they removed everything that was good about tom clancys rainbow six and paint it bad. is game dont deserv the name of rainbow. if you want a real rainbow. go play ready or not and ground branch"

1239,"It is quite lit, like CSGO but with fun included."
1240,"I used to play this game a lot, and trust me it's fun to play, at least was. But I do feel that the game is unnecessarily complicated, which prevents new players from jumping in. Trying to be a competitive game is the dumbest decision Ubisoft has ever made with this game. I stopped playing this game after they removing all the bodies for ""clearer vision and being more competitive"", and I will not play again unless they bring back dead bodies."
1241,THIS IS FUCKUP IN FPS GAME ETC.
1242,"Too many bugs/glitches. Sounds are inaccurate, and sometimes non-existent. This game needs a lot of balancing and fixing. Every gun is 1 shot head shot. Maps are poorly designed and are not competitively balanced. Operators are slow, clunky and long animations to aim, or use any action, which makes it annoying to play for a game with such a high TTK. Issues are everywhere, and it will make anybody frustrated after playing for a while. Programmers at Ubi are too concerned about implementing woke SJW feminist propaganda than actually fixing the problems that many streamers have already voiced over the years. Wouldn't recommend, unless u like losing your sanity."

The unique skill set of operators and the level of destruction in the game makes it enjoyable and distinguished among the rest of the first person shooter games. It is realism and fiction combined to make an enjoyable game made for nerds. It is not too difficult like ARMA 3, so amateurs can too have fun. It is the balanced game we all need. It is indeed a masterpiece even after 7 years."

1296,Siege is just honestly such a perfect game with nothing wrong with it at all. The game is very well made with no bullets going through shields or bullets pulling 180s around corners. The community is really the highlight of Siege they are such a welcoming and friendly group that they always make sure every player is included in the voice comms. I had one guy say he was gonna plant my moms garden and that was just such a thoughtful thing for a guy I barely know to say :) I really recommend you get this game!

1353,"The core gameplay is obviously good, given my hours played. The simplest way to describe Siege's downsides would be a great core game with really poor execution in every adjacent social system.

Rampant:

- Team-killing
- Racism
- Cheating

Report someone for racism? Nothing usually comes of it. It happens a lot, surprise, some people are racist or want a reaction, usually both. You can check back a few weeks later, they won't be banned. You'll get in a match and people will start screaming the N word, you mute and report them, nothing happens. Then there are trolls. If you get stuck in a low rank, it's hard to climb out because every other game there's be the one guy team-killing you or others. Report them, check their account activity, nothing ever happens. 

You regularly encounter cheaters. This isn't theoretical, since you'll occasionally have your rank adjusted with a notification saying you faced a cheater who was later detected. That one thing, they sort of got right, but clearly they're not doing rigorous server-side validation to prevent cheating. I watched a video in the past week where a defender was able to go grab the defuser from an attack and plant it (something only attackers should be able to do) for defusing (win). This and many other ridiculous cheats you see (see: VarsityGaming on YouTube) regularly could very often obviously be detected and prevented proactively by simply doing good back-end validation of what should and shouldn't be possible.

Then there's the horrible social system you're forced to use for any group play: UPlay. Instead of just being able to invite a favorable teammate to a party through simple in-game means or tried & tested Steam, you need to press Shift+F2 to pull up this Ubisoft social system overlay menu, UPlay, and it is always bugged. 90% of the time I have added people, either one or both of us have needed to restart the game to see the friend request or party invite or whatever. Even log time friends can rarely invite / join each-other without a restart. For years, Ubisoft hasn't bothered to fix this sad broken system.

Alternatively there's the option to ""Stay team"", but even that system is broken and distrusted. ""Stay team?"" ""It never works, let's make a party"" (get ready to restart your game, usually)."

1517,"Sept 11, 2022 update
There are tons of hackers in casual play. I'm now finding at least 2 per match. Why would I play any game mode more competitive (like unranked / ranked) if these hackers are ruining quick play.

Posted before  Sept 6th 2022 update

I've always liked Siege. Started on console, got tired of the mouse-adapters everyone was using. Went to PC and in every lobby, there's 1 hacker team killing everyone then killing the entire enemy team alone (I'm guessing for clips). 
This is all in quick-play, by the way. I haven't even tried unranked / ranked in years.

Then there's team killers. Picked their op? Dead. Hopefully it's a solo queue, because if not, you're dying by each friend of theirs for every round. If you think about it, you're penalized for getting team killed. Since you can't play, and they receive no penalty, esp if their friends continue this tking each round.
Group-queued team killing strikes should be a thing. A group-queued together that gets 2 team kills should be kicked, end of story.

I'd advise to only play quick play, so that way you don't actually lose anything from hackers."

1549,"Single player missions were fun but there isn't enough to justify a purchase.  Multiplayer is meh.  

Ubisoft is a sleazy company.  I was offered Uplay (Upay) free for a month and then a discounted rate after the trial.  They did not apply the promised discount and charged my credit card full price.  Even after providing them screenshots of the promised discount, the refused to reimburse me.  They said the promised discount was a ""display error.""  

I'll never buy from Ubisoft again.  If I get one of their titles, it's from a 3rd party and heavily discounted.

1795,USE TO BE FUN. Now its people griefing and hacking lol. The abilities have turned it into a different game too. you might as well play valorant or something newer and more polished.

If you hate yourself"
1804,"This game is like a drug addiction. You hate yourself for playing it. You hate yourself for associating with it. But you love the way it makes you feel when it goes well. 


It feels like the developers have stopped caring about anyone that's not Pro League or Ranked and the game is rampant with cheaters and as much as they say they are doing something about it it never feels like anything changes. 

Well anyway time to go have to try hard in quick match."
1805,this is my final cry for help. please someone. anyone.

"
1825,Honestly one of the best first person shooters that is all-together well-rounded and fun to play. Its also important to note that it has a strategic element to it.
1826,"gud but not, cuz it makes me mad

1841,"This game is challenging & realistic, not easy to achieve a level of competency.  Although, I am very much a noob at this game, it's difficulty to stay alive & the gratification of getting a kill make it the most entertaining....easy is boring."

1844,H 1
1845,pp un kaki in pp kaka land
1846,boring
1847,Is a game i guess
1848,TO many cheaters and they mess up the game every season
1849,cs on steroids.
1850,good
1851,"The game was amazing, but with each update it feels like it loses more and more mecanics and essence of what siege was to me, it is a matter of opinion but more and more it turns from a tactical shooter to a game more and more like cs, and the pathfinders operators are more and more irrelevant, the last update introduces a gadjet that replaces Thatcher, it makes operators a jack of all trades and removes having team composition and comunication like it used to, it removes the feeling of playing a game where to counter certain situations loke the electricety, you had to bring a Thatcher along with Thermite or other hard breacehrs, it removes that feeling of cooperation to work to a objective, the hub is atrocouis, the operators literaly glow.
The game itself has alot of tecnical issues with regestration of shots, speacely with smg's, cheaters and bad net code are a constant, the disconecting due to bad servers.
I play and see macthes today and is a whole mess, it went from a game where reflexes and knolage where you could out smart you oponents to a game pure on reflexes and praying that teh game register the bullets,after years on this game is very sadly come to a point where to me this is no longer the game i bouth, and I hope ubi restores it, mean while there are other games"
1852,everything

1914,"Rainbow Six Siege can actually be said to be a tactical shooting game with many possibilities in customizing weapons, operators, etc.
We must keep in mind that this game has a very complicated and difficult gameplay and I think it is one of the most difficult multiplayer games in the shooting genre."

That was 4 YEARS ago. I moved countries, got another ISP. Got a new Rig, decided to try the game. Wait while we connect you to Rainbow Six Siege Servers. After 4 years, the problem still persists.

1988,"Dear Ubisoft. Instead of fixing how ash has a broken head hitbox you decided it would be better to take her acog and literally ignore the problem. Server connection is horrible and when Cod came out with those fancy scopes you did it with your poorly designed game and made the most stiff scopes I have ever seen while removing the normal acog. Ive let all this bs slide especially with these garbage operators and their abilities. OOooo look a grappling hook. Every season its a useless ability with the same gun and I get it you can't get any licenses then plz start making your own. Even that stupid thing with peakers advantage. Nah but I let it slide. Your number one play Pengu literally said this game is garbage and made a 1 hour rant but instead of using the funds for improvements the monkies that work there decided a new cutscene for a story nobody cares about. Nah but I let it all slide, Now I cant even load into the game -_-."

And don't get me started on the server issues,unnecessary buff/nerf,Maps rework that are worse than they were before,and hitboxes that they never even bother to fix.Ugh i used to like this game ages ago.

For those who is seeking for a real tactical shooter game,Seek ""Ready Or Not"".Far better game than this wannabe Hero Shooter Bullshit"

2073,Very nice game . Powerful anti cheat known as BattlEye ! Unique Operators elite skins and many other attractive things. Since you may be killed very easily and maliciously just from 2 or 3 bullets so choosing operators that cover each other's vulnerabilities and having a great team working and try not to make any audible footsteps is a key to victory.

2075,"The game stopped responding after trying to load match so I restarted it and constantly attempted to reconnect to the Unranked match but it would give the error every time ""Failed to connect because you were removed from the match"".

2124,"Edit: Game working again. Will I still recommend this game? Eh...

This game can be fun, but that depends on the game you're playing. Friends...is your...best friend when playing this game, why? For making your game rounds being more tolerable to play. 
There are a couple more issues: Season Pass weekly challenges not being able to be viewed while in game despite the existence of the Ubiconnect overlay. Sometimes you can't invite your friends to your squad and you can't joined them and vice versa. Exiting the game will lock your mouse to the top left corner of your screen. Cheaters...cheaters...

So yeah, be aware"

2133,Its ok
2134,"I was starting to enjoy the game, but then all of a sudden, Ubisoft and their horrible anti-cheat system decided to place a perma-ban on me for apparently ""cheating"" when I never did. I tried my best to cooperate with Ubisoft Support, but they denied every single appeal I gave them. After that, I took it to reddit to complain about Ubisoft Support, I even provided video evidence to prove I didn't cheat on the matches I played. And guess what happened to the post less than 24 hours later. 
It got removed by the mods of the subreddit. Doesn't surprise me though, the mods are Ubisoft employees. Can't believe I'm being silenced over there.

Currently waiting on BattlEye to respond since Ubisoft redirected me to them, but they probably will ignore me anyway. 

My final review of this game:
Don't buy this game, don't support the horrible and greedy company behind it. I would seriously place a lawsuit if I had time and money since Support treated me like garbage."

2146,"I have played this game on Linux when BattlEye announced support. It worked FLAWLESSLY. In fact, it works WAY better whan Windows. I don't remember the exact numbers but I made a video about it on Youtube. Anyone doubting me is free to launch the game and run the in-game benchmark on Linux (or their Steam Deck) and Windows.

The next day Ubisoft exlicitly decided to exclude Linux and Deck players from the fun.

So I explicitly are not giving them my money ever again."

2155,"Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends.

And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should.

And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.

My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms.

This ends for all of us.

End communication."

2250,"Constant game ruining bugs and frustrations not even related to gameplay itself. Even while typing up this reply I had an Ubisoft window pop up and interrupt me from writing. That applies to the in-game menu as well. You get backed out of the settings any time your squad leader queues for a match, the round starts, the prep phase ends, or the wind blows. The last month I have had to restart after every ranked match. If I don't restart, I will disconnect from the game servers and freeze for 9 seconds out of every 10. I'm not even going to list all of the gameplay related bugs like rubberbanding and clientside collision. When I am able to play a full match, a number of my lobbies have blatant cheaters in them. I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy. It should be banned under the Geneva Convention as a form of torture."

2417,"I can't recommend this game anymore, I was able to look past many instances of issues within the game because I enjoyed playing it, ever since the freezing started, which they haven't done jack all for it, has made the game a chore. I made it to level 300, but i'm not going to go for 400, its not worth it anymore until ubisoft gets their crap together."
2418,good
2419,bad
2420,:(
2421,IT IS REALISTIC
2422,toxic fun
2423,"One word. Ubisoft. When I purchased this game it was *fine*. But I had issues with even accessing it because Ubisoft will just take away access to your game, they don't have good servers, they rely on micro transactions at every corner as well. And that was when I got the game. It has gotten worse and the gameplay is no longer appealing or something anyone would probably wanna seek out in 2022. It is supposed to be a tactical team shooter but for some odd reason this game that used to be about precise shooting, checking cameras, making smart uses of your utility all went out the window for lazers, big explosions and traps that take no effort. The game is an unbalanced mess and characters are absolutely all over the place. They changed the user interface for the game and it is just atrocious to look at. It is gross, loud and large (loud referring to it being like in your face). The community is just racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic and toxic. Nothing to do with the community is worth talking about. Now I mentioned earlier how they don't let people keep access to their game and I will explain. I bought the game on the Epic Launcher and it never let me install it on there anyways so I played through Ubisoft Connect. The game just refunded itself after about 4 months but it never gave me money back and I had to rebuy the game for no reason. I hate this game now and I hate Ubisoft."
2424,They removed the fun part of the game and ban for toxicity now :(
2425,begus mek
2426,good
2427,"I played 24 hours in 4 days, so it must be good. Stopped for a day because my friend gave me the most shitty, inconsistent, border line retarded advice, I just don't play with him now."
2428,good game
2429,"the best game i ever played
"
2430,"I recommend this game if you've owned it on another console and are switching, or if you've never played it before and you and some friends want to purposefully drain your sanity. That part about friends is pretty crucial though. This game can be fucking tragic if you solo queue, so friendless bastards beware!

 All in all on Xbox, Playstation, pc, and my g dang nintendo switch i have over 2500 hours over the course of 5 years. With well deserved ranks from Bronze 3 to Plat 2...

so

I feel pretty comfortable saying that this game is always getting worse, and it will continue to get worse. Devs make bad decisions which make the game less fun and more stale feeling every year for returning players. Battle pass in Y7S2 is an all time low (i say after not playing this for the previous 4 seasons) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Now as for new players i do think there is fun to be had here if you have friends, like i said earlier. I finally came back after a 4 season away and the only reason i did was because I had friends to play with. So if you got some buddies and you dont mind the total fucking slog that is learning this god forsaken game before your brains turn to mush then hop on in.

Lastly I'll say that while my friends got me to play again, the thing that is keeping me around (at least for now) is that Siege is the only game that can give me that rush from clutching a round, or hitting a crazy flick, or one tapping some numb nuts. There really is literally no game that feels like siege does. Every time I try another comp shooter, I just can't stick with it for long, but I guess there is a reason that I have that many hours in this game. oh well

just buy it"
2431,It's a very good competitive game

2470,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

2734,"My father smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your children graduate, you have to stop immediately."". Tears welled up in his eyes when he realised exactly what was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your father put us through."". I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because this game gave me cancer anyway."

2738,"DISAPPOINTING:

I've played siege since it first game out, first on Xbox and now steam. My account was recently suspended for ""botting"" despite the fact that I have never used a botting software. I contacted Ubisoft to see if they can review this action as it was clear to me a mistake had been made. Ubisoft said they were unable to review it and couldn't give me any details on my ban as it would ""compromise the integrity of our internal systems"".

I was very disappointed that I couldn't even get a review from Ubisoft ""support"" into the matter after all I was a dedicated member of the community for a long time."
2739,I'd rather die than recommends this game to any other people
2740,Bad game
2741,ok
2742,"This game makes me want to shoot my self in both my left big toes, rip off my finger nails and shove it in my ass, and jump off a building.

Great game, would play again."
2743,There's a reason I have so many hours in this game but not more than 20+ hours spent over the last 3 years of its' lifetime. The devs at Ubisoft would rather rework and (IMO) destroy every classic map that this game had. They had a vision to eventually have 100+ operators but cut the quarterly Seasonal operator additions from 2 to 1 (also reusing old weapons instead of adding new ones as they had with all new ops at one point) in order to work on gameplay and map changes that mostly (again IMO) weren't needed at all. The devs pander to the pro community because that's where the money is and this ideology led them to completely change the game rules from casual and solid ranked (classic) Siege to a abominable mix of pro-rules (operator ban and map pick phases and 2 round defense/attack swaps) that really just muddled the whole game for me. If you didn't play this game the first 3 years (arguably 2 years) then you missed out on the best of what Siege had to offer and it is now a (pro-league centered) shell of its former glory.

I have hundreds of hours on PS4 back in the early days and honestly the game was great for the first 2 years or so. year 7 (2022) this game is still a hard pass. Way to many operators and gimmicks at this point. Unrealistic child like art style. Toxic griefing community in both ranked and unranked. Not much else to say really.

2880,"Fun game! I enjoy it as much as I enjoy smash bros. I love the idea of tactical warfare instead of just ""run and shoot anything that moves."" because you actually have to think about what your opponent is going to do. So many people go into this game thinking they can just easily win it by shooting things and then they end up blowing up to a Kapkan trap or they get crushed by a Frost Mat. Thank God you actually need more than an IQ of 2 to play this game effectively."
2881,"If you want a good relaxing tactical fps, then this may not be what your looking for. Siege is a game renowned for being tactical and brutal, and it definitely lives up to expectations. With every match being a test of skill, each round taking place in a different part of the map. You may be on offence waiting a solid minute to rush in and blow stuff up or you may a defenders, building the best defence you can in the short time given. These competitive matches can take a rather long time to end some ranging into 30+ minutes and others into 15min. 

The players like most fps are either a joy to play with or someone you would rather not spend your time listening to. Thanks to their being friendly fire or a mute option you can opt for peace and ignore, or shoot them in the face to escalate the problem starting a not not very uncommon miniature war. although the player you just erased from the round can push a button after being killed stopping you from shooting them while hurling insults.

As you start your first match in siege you will be thrown into a map with a bunch of new players, and most likely a Smurf account. The round starts and you run off only to get slaughtered by someone pixel peeking a hallway. This is the moment you realize siege is a rather slow game with long matches spanning minutes of slow and steady tactics and teamwork, with short matches barely reaching the depth nor the time of a skilled vet and his team. Although that probably wont be your first match. One of your first matches will most likely be a Smurf slaughtering your team, in a rather fast pace then proceeding to write EZ in the chat.

All in all siege is a game that requires a lot of time to get good at, a couple friends to make it fun, and a temper that is hopefully not short."

2973,This game has costed me about $600 in new keyboards! 10/10
2974,"It was a great game, but the balance team ruins it. Never have I ever played a game where I dread getting new patches and have to watch the game slowly get worse. The dev's make bad changes based off of their win delta chart alone without thinking about the in game context. The buffs and nerfs are are seemingly randomly selected just to boost or lower win rates, again without taking into consideration why the operator is over/underperforming."

2976,boo
2977,too many hackers
2978,Nah
2979,"The matches don't last long enough, casual play gives you so little time to prep as a defender and then regardless of which side you're on everyone will rush the objective. Why? Idk this isn't Call of Duty but then again this is more toxic. Yeah, go play S&D and if you accidentally kill a teammate bc an enemy was there you'll have words but we'll move on bc we are trying to get that W. But Siege? F#$% no, Accidentally shoot your Kapkan bc you thought he was the enemy Fuze and it's like you ATF'd his dog. They'll throw the game just to get revenge. GR: wildlands multi was better because there was time to think, prep, feel out the situation,go fast then slow then rush again, etc. Wish Ubi stuck with that in Siege at least. 

P.S. Ranked might be different but since it takes so long to unlock it who cares."
2980,good
2981,The game is perfectly fine as long as your teammates dont have actual black mold growing in their brains.
2982,"Fun, engaging, and tactical. This game feels unique compared to other games as it relies on team work more."

2986,"I played this game for a while now been on and off for a few years but I've been getting back into it.

there is a strong Community but I think the game is dying.

overall I'll say yes to buying this if you like something that's heavy on strategy and team play"
2987,"I read a review that said ""this game is all about map knowledge."" I agree. I have almost 200 hours and I still can't remember all of the hidey holes and angles in the f***ing maps. Still have fun every time I play :)"

3036,"As of right now, the game is moving in a way that makes it hard for new players with so many abilities and things to adapt to It's hard to get on the train that has derailed a lot but seemingly manages to get back on the track. (btw I came from ps4 with a lot of hours in the game 859). I hate this game with a burning passion, but there's something about it that once you're on, you can't get off. If you are a competitive person like me who lives to compete in every aspect of life, this is perfect for you. There's a lot to learn and crazy mechanics to learn, but if you are here as someone who wants to have a good time, don't play at the end of the day. This is a competitive game, so even in a quick match, there will be try hards and if you think that's stupid then don't play it won't be for you. But if you are reading this and you have played but took a break for a year and want to come back, please do although the game seems weird with the new ops, it's still a great game. There's nothing wrong with the changes. I came back after two years, and already I'm back into it, and I'm happy to say that even though there are some things in this game that are op or under the standard, they get fixed and changed bottysoft is doing a good job but not good enough to be called their real name so take that as you will. In the end, there is no other game on the market like this, and I love that with a burning passion."

3091,"Aight, ima just start this review by saying that in someways to some people, this game sucks. A lot. After I explain why though, I will give my reasons why I think Siege is great and worth time for new players.

1. Community is toxic af. Nobody can play this game casually without at least one person getting upset at them or complaining about ranks. If you get PTSD from thinking about old CoD BO 2 lobbies or whatever was most toxic back in the days, you may want to automute everyone in the server.

2. ""Siege is supposed to be realistic."" I understand that that's what people wanted from this, they wanted a tactical fps that encouraged teamwork to maximize the results of operators working together. Like a mix of Overwatch and Arma I suppose. Since it started though, Siege's universe has strayed away from that path by a longshot, with holograms and light barriers and laser barriers, etc. and etc.

3. Of course where there's a game with some kind of tactical choices, whether it be weapons, characters, or something simple as attachments, someone somewhere is going to be angy about you not using what is clearly the best option to use. Like, using the shotgun on Doc instead of the MP5. I don't know if this mentality is still around, but I feel with how the community is, there's only a few options players can choose to not get flamed by someone for just wanting to play their way.

Now, with what I find are negatives of the game out of the way, time for what I see are the positives of people trying the game as a new player.

1. More new players = more casual atmosphere. The more new players join, the more we have a chance at keeping this game alive and keeping it have a good casual atmosphere where it's fine to be casual. We don't need to TK each other just cause we didn't do something right or we picked your main operator. Yelling at the new players for being bad will make them leave, which ultimately means the game's health is the player's responsibility to keep the game nice and to keep new players wanting to play.

2. Personally, idgaf about realism. If it's fun, I'll play it. Whatever realism Ubisoft wants to keep in their game is their priority that we have no control over. I for one, dropped trying to make the game be realistic when we got the one with holograms 4 years ago. And with throwing realism out the window, it allows more opportunities for the game and more ways for Ubi to keep adding new stuff to the game.

3. If you don't run into any people who care a wee bit too much about what people do, there's a whole lot of choices in gameplay customization to fit whatever your playstyle may be. You wanna be a classic kick in the door ""FBI open up"" style kind of player, Ash is the girl for you. Wanna anchor down and keep the site secure while helping teammates stay alive, Rook is the best guy to start off with. With 64 operators in the game and many more on the way. hopefully, there's bound to be at least one operator that people will enjoy.

So yes, I'm not one of the blind Ubi lovers that ignore all the downsides of a game, but I do think there is hope for it. The community may be toxic, there may be cheaters here and there, there may be a giant lack of realism for some parts of the game, but when the bullets start flying and the team comms are open (especially when playing with the homies) this game is, in my personal and humble opinion, really something special.



(Also final message to Ubi if this review ever graces the dev's line of sight, can we please get a buff for Sens' AR? I'm still able to pop off with it, but please, it's 9mm, not .50 bmg, tone down the recoil a smidge at least.)"

3102,"this is the most honest review this game will ever get. i have played this game for a year or more on console like many months before house was reworked. this game is fun, but and thats a major but: it is very toxic most of the time finding a good team is one of the first things you should do weather its your irl friends or someone you met in game that is the first thing you should consider doing and with this team get them to give you tips or else it will take forever for you to get better at this game. playing ranked is hard and stressful but only if you take it that way. play this game as if the ranking you get isnt the most important thing and you will feel so much better in general and if someone ever says ""you are a silver you suck ass at the game blah balh"" its probably true but it shouldnt be taken as an insult it should be taken as a challenge to get better and learn about the game more. playing garage wars or other costom games with friends is what makes this game not completely toxic filled so you can have a break. theres more i would add but no one ever reads my reviews so here you guys go"
3103,"Trash company that will steal your money, never buy from Ubitrash. Fucks stole $30 for the Y7 Operator upgrade, then told me I couldn't have it because they couldn't confirm that the storefront sold it to me, despite confirmation/proof of purchase evidence attached to help request. And now, after 2 MONTHS, I'm being told there's nothing to be done. Hopefully Ubitrash will get bought out and shut down by Microsoft or the like."

3115,"this game was quite good when i first purchased it, and its a lot of fun when playing with friends, but since 2020 to now is when it really when backwards in quality, they have changed a lot about the game that didn't need reworks, the UI of the game changed to look more clean and simple but it looks annoying and corporate to me just so they can maybe sell the game more, and how they monitize the game now with some crossovers was cool at the beginning, it started to also lose its more down to earth feel of when the first few years were like. i do hope if they ever make a rainbow six siege 2.0 i do hope they bring back the old siege and grow apon it in a realistic way, but i do think having some wacky things can be okay though, just not as much as they have added since year 5 and later. this was one of the few ubisoft games that was different from the rest and again i do hope at some point we can have a better siege experience (as well bring the original dev team back like come on)

3143,"[h1] A paid game disguised as a f2p [/h1] 

Over the years I have been playing this game less and less due to unnecessary changes by the devs every 3 months. An Operator that has a high pick rate? Nerf. An Operator that has low pick rate, let's forget about it until years later. The game didn't receive any new maps after 3 years, they just ""redone"" old maps to be more in meta but became worse. Also for the longest time new Operators didn't come with new guns they just gave them less ""popular"" guns from existing Operators.

In ranked maps and Operator bans are worthless since you will be always playing the same maps and the time and money you spent to buy Operators will get banned for the match. It also adds unnecessary waiting for the game to start. But for some reason this game is trying so hard to be ""pro"" league. Keep in mind that the casual players it's what keeping your game alive.

The shop is mega expensive this is why I titled as a f2p game in disguise because no matter how many hours you play and how many renown you hoard you wont have enough to buy 5% of things in the shop (yeah that's me). There are charms that are so small that costs the same as a brand new Operator (25k) that's insane. It's almost impossible to afford to give your Operators a new look since everything is mega expensive. Keep in mind that I buy Operators with renown also.

There are other issues that I could write but don't have the energy to do so. If you are a new player wondering if you should buy the game or not keep in mind that this game is not new player friendly. It has a very hard learning curve.

3180,"You get this game thinking the mechanics and gunplay of this game are fun and look great, and the tactical aspect would think you'd find like-minded mature people. Except you go into a match full of kids raging to no tomorrow, and find that the community is incredibly toxic and that Tom Clancy didn't write novels for 15-year-old ragelords."
3181,"not good

3182,"i raged, this game sucks. i have put countless (83) hours into it and i have not yet been able to comprehend the fact that my favorite operator is so bad, smoke needs a buff. This is the only game I know I can play for hours without smiling once, I am tired of it. The game has become my life, I sleep and think of Tom Clancy. Tom Clancy is my Idol and I aspire to be like him one day. Yet he still can't make a good game. It is crazy to me how this guy went to war but came back just to not accomplish anything, eventually becoming the developer of a mediocre game with a community made of high school dropouts and middle schoolers attempting to post their highlights on TikTok for some internet relevancy. I think I am going to lose it if I lose 1 more ranked game. I have dropped from Copper to Cardboard at least 10 times this month, the skill gap is crazy. I thought I was playing VALORANT the way they were smurfing on me. I demand a refund from the CEO himself with an apology to my email, (IhateTomClancy@gmail.com) and if I don't get the refund I deserve I'll get Alex Neill in here and have him SUE you too for overpricing this shit game. It should be free, like Fortnite (A genuinely good game for example). I can't begin to comprehend the stupidity of pulse's who sit and camp walls all day. It's like I walk through a door and my head gets blown to smithereens, and I'm starting to get tired of it. I have fallen into crippling debt and crippling depression. I feel as if were in the Great Depression (1929 - 1939's) (10 year span), like my rank. I have been hardstuck (Online gamer term, some of you wouldn't understand.), my E-Girl left me for a Champions player. I am motivated to get out of my rank almost as much as I am to get this refund. 

- Sincerely yours, Sinq

3207,"I swear to the lord above, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege has blessed me and my family with good fortune. Ever since my teammate Nightspider253 had spoken in game chat and wished the worst upon me, I have pulled through my chemotherapy, my family had pulled through in their financial struggles, and I had finally gotten to touch some grass (even though I had been deathly allergic to the substance beforehand). A big shoutout to Nightspider253 and his colleagues in that ranked match I had played, Rainbow Six Siege has changed my life, and allowed me to see things I had never thought possible for myself. I am a new me, I hope the same happens for all the players who have stumbled across this elo messiah. In the name of Allah the most gracious the most merciful. All the praise and thanks is for Allah, the Lord of mankind, jinn and everything that exists, and may the prayers and peace of Allah be upon the most honorable of all the Messengers, Mohamed. To our beloved Sheikh and able emir Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, may Allah keep him safe. May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be with you. I pray to Allah that my letter will find you in the best of spirits, moving from one victory to the next. We have received the glad tidings of your victories in the Islamic Maghreb which came to us here in the East like a gentle breeze, reminding us of the victories of our forbearers, and it made us, along with other Muslims, very happy. We pray to Allah that you continue to be victorious. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"

3231,"I absolutely loved the part where six rainbows appeared and said ""It's siegeing time"" and started siegeing everybody. Splendid game."

3236,It made me fart whenever i win
3237,"I cant remember how many accounts and hours i already have, cause this account just has 5 and i have decided to end my journey with a review. 

This game had a ruff start but got better and better in the first 2-4 years i would say.. but eventually this game just got to absurd and bugs that were fixed come back every few seasons. Unfortunately i would say please play other FPS like insurgency sandstorm and skip this game. as it is just a waste of time and nerves.. 

The community is known for its toxicity so, you wont miss something out here. I still play it cause im a Day 1 Siege player and i just feel sad about it and play just 1 or 2 matches once in a while. It isnt fun at all anymore and doesnt make sense to grind it as it used to be."
3238,"Servers not working about 20% of the time,

3257,oi
3258,"cant jump, bad game"
3259,"I'll be straight forward with this. While I do not recommend this game, I will still be playing it. Why? I have too much time in it to switch and it is still fun. When I first started playing, it was this new tactical shooter that was semi-realistic, and that is what really set it aside from the rest of the FPS's out there. It has strayed so far away from its roots, and what type of game that it was supposed to be. There are so many crazy abilities and operators that I don't see it being the same game that it once was. The devs sacrifice quality gameplay and realism for fairness between attackers and defenders. It is just unfortunate how it turned out. Maybe I would not like the game had it continued down its original path, but I guess I will never know. 

TLDR: Still fun but no longer the game it was supposed to be."

I've had my Ubisoft account for over 10 years, it's annoying that I even have to deal with such a dumb problem. Made this review because I used to love the game."

It gets to a point where you get randomly disconnected from a ranked match and you cannot reconnect again, no matter what you do, no matter how many times you try, you're just locked out of the game until it's over and you get banned. 
Not only do you get banned, you lose your rank, and your account gets flagged for abandonment.

I will admit, the game has gotten better, save Operation Health, but it still has kinks to work out. Character balancing has been a deformed baby of power creep and hot fixes trying to keep everyone satisfied. There is a not-so-friendly player-base with a few jems hidden within. Most people stay quiet with the occasional text chat lighting up the corner of the screen. Keeping the game updated to see what comes of it, and the lore is easily my favorite part.

There is a bug in the game for YEARS now that ubisoft failed to even address let alone fix.

It will just randomly decide to kick a player out of unranked, not allow them to reconnect and issue penalities and suspensions when it was OBVIOUSLY a server side error.

I have gigabit ethernet and a PC with good enough specs not to cause this and after browsing for hours on the forums a general agreement is just ""It happened and we cant reverse it""

DO NOT BUY this game if you expect a consistent experience, you have a chance to get suspended for literally nothing.

(Before you ask, yes I rebooted the system, the router, the game, did clean installs flushed dns the whole process and this is not an issue with my PC at all.

3477,"HOW TO MAKE METHAMPHETAMINE

Diluted HCl - also called Muriatic acid - can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section. NaOH - also called lye Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says ""high ethyl ether content,"" such as Prestone Ephedrine. The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedophedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed. pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter. from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to workwith pfed from pills rather than ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will ♥♥♥♥ up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced ♥♥♥♥ or under-reduced ♥♥♥♥. Or contaminants will jell durring basifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating. you dont want pills with a lot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients. time released pillsa re usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to get up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself) if you are selling. I would just make ephedrine on your own because its really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right. List of equipment: A glass eyedropper, Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one). A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) A glass quart jar, Sharp scissors, CLean rubber gloves, Coffee filters, A Measuring cup, Measuring spoons. Ethyl Ether: WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much. Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5oz of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand. Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluable free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thing as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it halfway and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time we're getting rid of either-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl. If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway, this game is pretty fun with friends."

3593,"I wasted a thousand hours (if including the Test Server) on this game. Don't do the same mistake I did.
While the occasional Clutch, or Ace, or whatever thing that may happen, will give you the hit that you will probably crave and use as a justification for forcing yourself through the game. In reality, the majority of the gameplay can be anything from boring to rage-inducing. With one of the most toxic communities to date, one where, at the very least, every second match features someone shouting in Text or Voice Chat, don't expect to make any friends here besides the ones you already had.
Speaking of, yes, this game is more enjoyable with friends... But so is practically every multiplayer game. If you are gonna buy this game because ""playing with friends is cool"", please, consider other games before this one, especially because of how bad the servers are. They are rented Microsoft servers, and it shows, as playing with anyone outside your own country results in a massive ping advantage for those closer to the server. And no, there's no lag compensation. Someone could be peeking 0.2 seconds into the future and have killed you before you even know it.
And let's not forget cheaters. Despite this game using BattleEye, which is quite a penetrative Anti Cheat, there's still a lot of cheaters in Ranked. This makes practically every ""competitive"" gamemode unplayable.
Finally, the skill curve. Many games tend to have skill curves where you can tell a skilled player from a non-skilled player apart. I, and many friends, have noticed that nothing matters in R6S, you seemingly still get bodied with only a good match every so often. The K/D always stays under 1, and whether that is someone completely new to shooters, or someone with years of experience. It gets to the point where many have made the hypothesis that your success in R6S is dependant on your mood.

In short: Gameplay is unfun and only disguises itself as fun by giving you that ""big hit"" every few matches, people are toxic, there are better games to play with friends, ranked is busted due to cheaters, and there's a lack of a skill curve."

3606,Most of the balance has been eroded away with each new OP and anti recoil macros abound ruins nearly every single game.
3607,game is good

3612,IM GOING TO CRY
3613,"its really fun to play with  friends and alone i recommend it alot
"
3614,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
3615,fun

3624,There anti cheat system is garbage. I run into more cheaters than Apex. There Match Making Makes Apex look like they are clean as a whistle. Game needs serious work.
3625,"Yeah, it's alright"
3626,"Possibly one of the best games I've played. Although I was gifted, it's worth it to buy it (as long as the minimum specs are met)."
3627,really fun
3628,"my balls are sweaty knees week arms are heavy.

3643,"    Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is the best and most unique first person shooter I have ever played, and I recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing game to play. When I first started playing, I could never understand why I dropped so many hours in this game, but after some time, I think I understand now. Rainbow six siege is a mirror image of your commitment, character, and what makes you, you. 
    Rainbow Six Siege is good because its a simple objective for both sides. A team must defuse a bomb or defend the bomb from being defused. but its within that simplicity where Siege shines it brightest, because beyond that simplicity lies a very in-depth, complex game.
    Siege has a large roster of characters and they all have an assortment of special gadgets and weapons. By using these characters, you can do anything you want with them. These operators can interact with the map in creative ways because the majority of maps have destructible walls and floors that allow you to create unique angles, clever strategies, and allow players to push themselves as far as they want to go.  
    Siege enables you to grow as a player because it punishes you for every mistake you make and rewards you for succeeding. This is the only game in my library that I desire to be good at because of this. With every death you learn something new, and every kill you get teaches whoever is on the receiving end a lesson. but that's only because the game has brutal consequences due to its lack of respawning. 
    With that being said, there is a lot to learn and experience while playing the game. Almost all the learning you do will come from the playerbase. The community has endless videos online showing incredible angles and gadget placements to help you get an edge on the enemy and gain the upper hand in any match. This is all thanks to Sieges mechanics. But its not just the mechanics of the game that make it good, but its how well the use of those mechanics are put to use by the players.
     I would also like to mention how well Ubisoft keeps the game in check. The game is updated frequently and keeps me coming back with excitement seeing how operators and metas change each season, and seeing what new things are brought to the table. There used to be major problems with bugs and glitches but I personally have not experienced anything unjustifiable recently. 
     In conclusion, if you are on the fence for getting this game, I recommend you try it out."
3644,very cool

3654,Great game Ive had a very wholesome experience :)
3655,"after playing this game for 500H i'm gonna give it a solid 2/10, 
reasons:
it takes decades to find a match so the game is also kinda dead
the community of this game is beyond toxic 
you're not gonna have fun playing this you'll end up having a broken monitor or headset
the requirements of this game are much higher than the thing its displayed here, i have the a system which is beyond the recommended system of this game and my cpu usage goes to 100% and the game crashes.
overall buying this game is a waste money"

3666,"This game requires a lot of sacrifice, i had to cut every relationship i was in, including my own family. It requires you to play this game 24/7 non stop, WARNING PLAYING THIS GAME WILL CAUSE OBESITY, CANCER, LOSS OF BRAIN CELLS, GAIN OF APPETITE. ALSO TEAM MATES IN THIS GAME WILL CAUSE YOU TO QUESTION YOUR BELIEFS IN GOD. YOU QUESTION YOURSELF THINKING HOW THE HELL DID GOD CREATE THIS HUMAN WITH NO SENSE OF DIRECTION. CAUSES YOU TO GO RETARDED"

3700,"Its fun
"
3701,"First of all I really like this game, I like the concept, I like the operators, I like the skins and I like the handling of the game

but idk whats up with the dev team sometimes i mean it takes you way too mutch time to change anything (like the meta), its too many cheaters, too many toxic ppl., too many hitbox issues and bugs 

btw i have high hopes on season 3 year 7 because it seems like this time ur gonna fix alot of things the community wantet for ages 

so my advice 4 new ppl is: just ignore the toxic ppl (turn of the text-/voicechats) and look past the cheaters and you might as well have fun with this game (play with friends ^^)"

3776,This game has gone downhill ever since operation White Noise. I have almost 1000 hours and this game lost pretty much all of the features I loved. The balance adjustments and new operators are just not fun. And I swear the graphics quality of this game has downgraded over the years. Too many annoying operators and not enough attention given to the old ones. This game will die soon if it doesn't listen to community feedback. I miss the old siege.

3829,This game is good at challenging your skills and your self. This game has a addictive gameplay loop and a very good player base. You are abil to change your game to ranked to have a Challenge. or if you could take it down to unranked if you want to play normally. This game has So much characters to pick from. Attack to defense. This makes the game have A variety of stuff to use and play. Every character has a different ability than the rest.
3830,Good game.
3831,shit

-OVERALL SCORE-7.
-GAMEPLAY-8.
-GRAPHICS-8.
-STORY-3.
-REPLAY VALUE-6.
-PLAYABILITY/BUGS-9.
-PERFORMANCE-6.
-PRICE-7.
NOTES: This game is better then call of duty. You must use strategy to defend or attack. The game does not have a campaign or story mode but the multiplayer is very fun. The only pay-to-win is buying the game because you can't win if you don't have the game. And i find getting credits for operators and weapon skins easy because the game rewards players for playing not paying."
3834,"well most of this was from when i keep it on when i go to sleep but i have probably played this for about 50 hours and i will say if you like valorant or any games like that, this is the game you go too when your bored or the one you play for 3 months a year"

3838,its a great game you should play it
3839,"This game gets on my nerves, Especially when I play ranked. If my teammate abandon the match how can it be okay for me to lose MMR? This happens way too much and I can't even rank up because of this and the fact that I only gain ~40 MMR per win. Is there an explanation to why I get punished just because my teammates can't behave? I wrote this here because it's a hassle to look for the real support website. I'm dissapointed and frustrated, I can't be the only one with this problem?"

3856,Very bad for mental health
3857,yes.
3858,"Despite the fact that the game is original in its concept and, I would say, one of a kind, R6 Siege has too many problems which do not disappear over the years: bad anti-cheat, toxic community, bugs, more bugs, little content and its promotion - I don't remember when in recent years I was hyped about an update in siege.
There are too many problems to count and developers are reluctant to deal with them."

If you are looking for a solid reason to kill yourself, then by all means buy it and spend 100 hours in ranked. It will push you over the edge, it just did to me. Bye guys!"

"
3909,ye
3910,veri fun
3911,"No, please dont."
3912,edswrdfdfredb gb wb  es
3913,hehe
3914,"A very fun game except when you run into toxic players and hackers which use to only occur in ranked but now happens in quickmatch because this game breeds toxic players and Ubisoft made a somewhat smart change by banning phone numbers of banned players which is needed to play Ranked but this just means hackers are in quickmatch because they can just create a new account and hackers are still in Ranked because the anti-cheat sucks. 

But hey, if that hasn't turn you off the game, it's all good. You can play the game just fine, maybe find an operator you like that you can get a few kills with, just don't expect that operator to be good in 3 months when the new season comes out, their gun will have an absurd amount of recoil and their gadget will be completely different. That is unless their gun is an LMG and their gadget lets them heal all their teammates instantly and revive them self and have grenades as their secondary.

But look, there's still fun little things to do like going into a hiding spot and getting the drop on a completely oblivious person and having a laugh, that is if the map didn't secretly get patched and the spot was removed because it was so ""gamebreaking"". But look, maybe you get into a five stack with your friends and are just messing around in quickmatch and you occasionally shoot each other as a joke. You're not ruining the experience for anyone because you're all in the same party and having fun but then you finish your game and you have RFF for the rest of your life and so you have to learn to be a pacifist so you don't accidentally kill yourself because your teammate walked in front of you while you were shooting a camera.

Oh, I noticed you really enjoyed that map, there were some nice angles you could hold and some wacky run-outs annnnnnndddd it's gone. Completely different map, may as well have been set in a different country. Why? Well because of a small minority of players, known as pros, thought the map was too unbalanced and WAY too fun. I mean, who wants to have fun when playing a video game? Not those guys apparently. It's not like one of the very gamemodes this game offers is colloquially referred to as Casual or anything, who would ever call it Casual? This is a very serious fast-paced, team-based, tactical first person shooter with a separate gamemode called Ranked for players that want to get on leaderboards and play competitively."
3915,YES
3916,makes me cry
3917,"After playing this game for years, starting from xbox and now on pc with 4000 hours across platforms combined, I still enjoy it, I enjoy watching pro league, and one game I could never leave.

3930,"This game just manages to keep getting worse and worse. I miss when the game was still grounded and not in science fiction territory. All the new ops that come out are just better versions of old operators.

Ubisoft doesn't seem to give a fuck if people cheat, and the community is more toxic than ever at the time of writing this. 

I wish Ubisoft would take feedback more from average players instead of the pros and pro wannabes."

3944,"This game is made by ubisoft, it can be broken and very bad, most of the time anyway. But, behind that is a meh game! Casual has a lot of Smurf accounts, and I mean people that are normally Plat-Diamond. Unkranked, is more of a casual mode. It is competitive for people who want to play comp, but without the Elo/Rank worry. I find Unranked pretty fun all in all. Ranked, depending on your Elo/Rank of course, can BE VERY SWEATY. But, get the right team, the right friends - and play. You'll be fine, just don't worry about your KD otherwise you'll go insane.

Ever since my teammate Th3F0XF1nG3Rer had spoken in game chat and wished the worst upon me, I have pulled through my chemotherapy, my family had pulled through in their financial struggles, and I had finally gotten to touch some grass (even though I had been deathly allergic to the substance beforehand). A big shoutout to Th3F0XF1nG3Rer and his colleagues in that ranked match I had played, Rainbow Six Siege has changed my life, and allowed me to see things I had never thought possible for myself. I am a new me, I hope the same happens for all the players who have stumbled across this elo messiah. In the name of Allah the most gracious the most merciful. All the praise and thanks is for Allah, the Lord of mankind, jinn and everything that exists, and may the prayers and peace of Allah be upon the most honorable of all the Messengers, Mohamed. To our beloved Sheikh and able emir Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, may Allah keep him safe. May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be with you. I pray to Allah that my letter will find you in the best of spirits, moving from one victory to the next. We have received the glad tidings of your victories in the Islamic Maghreb which came to us here in the East like a gentle breeze, reminding us of the victories of our forbearers, and it made us, along with other Muslims, very happy. We pray to Allah that you continue to be victorious. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
3979,I think out of every game i've played this will be the game that i always come back to. It can be really hard at first but playing with friends and just messing around in casual is some of the most fun i've ever had
3980,"Ubisoft connect is a fucking stupid piece of trash which constantly makes the game crush and leave you with ban for some time. i don't recommend anyone ever buying this stupid game due to lack of proficient programmers in the company who could possibly fix fucking useless launcher and fix the game. i don't recommend anyone ever buying any ubisoft project until this company becomes bankrupt (they are nearly there due to their ""genius"" ceo who decided to buy his 15th villa in montecarlo just so that he wont need to invest in their games which are awful for the past half of a decade.) i really hope that a pearson who is responsible for optimising this launcher gets paid well and not enslaved or bulled like most of ubisoft developers due to lack of balls from higher ups. i don't want to see my favourite games being trashed by one certain asshole. i hope he will get fired and lose everything he stole from us, good luck having a skull and bones release a week before GOW Ragnarek, and doom this game to fail. 2/10 (not 0 because sometimes this game brings joy)"

More and more traps to look for, constant reworkings, its become less of a fun game and more suited for competitive play. Every time they add another gadget, suddenly every other operator needs to be reworks so it doesn't become op or redundant. There's a stupid wokeness now which is only added for pure capital gain and nothing to do with the communities.

 Should you have asked me if i recommended Siege in 2019, I would've said ""Absolutely! This game is amazing!"" but in 2022? 

No.

This is a full-priced game that focuses more on freemium aspects and ""packs"" to decorate your character than the core gameplay mechanics. Half the characters are teenaged japanese girls, and I'm unsure if im watching hentai or playing a first person shooter. 

There are no genuine singleplayer modes. Long wait times in between matches. Every single weapon is locked to a character behind a paywall. The menus are flashy, and extremely hard to understand and navigate. 

Ubisoft should be ashamed at publishing this garbage. I will never buy another Ubisoft IP."

Great game mixed community, Fun to mess around with friends or a great comp game. I would say don't spent money on the game just play a lot to get all operators and you can get twitch drops for cosmetics and normal packs, Honestly wouldn't play that often solo because could be boring unless you like grinding your rank. And expect to ruin your life with the hours you can get in this game!  (!!!This review is made when I had 250 hours!!!)"

With friends it's possible, but you'll arguably have more fun in another game."

4178,"Its a very good FPS game, Its very hard to get good with aim as you can lean your head and its very hard and some places you can break though walls which is why it makes like harder but as long as you've got good aim and stealth you can get many kills :)))"

4183,"I MISS WHEN THIS GAME WAS GOOD........ I've gotten hundreds of hours outta this game. More than most games promise you out the gate. How long can a game run and still promise the same quality? Even with R6 being... almost unrecognizable now, I still appreciate what it used to be. I know devs don't read these, but you guys did a really good job for a while. Thanks for the good times."

On top of that, I've had friends over playing when I was doing ohter stuff or playing Xbox and apparently they have been toxic for me and TK'd people.
Yes, i have wrote stupid stuff in rage because of other people being toxic, but now I have a permanent ban on me.
Perhaps Ubisoft should consider that people should only be able to report others AFTER they TK. Worst ban system I have ever seen. 

Also contacted Ubisoft about this to try to lift my ban, but they said something like ""Yeah, sorry, we understand you are angry"". My money on the other hand was something they would keep..."

4272,"FALLEN FROM GRACE: this game used to be good and I had lots of fun playing casually and competitively on console, but its not what we remember it and we need to let it die. Don't play this if you are new. It's not worth buying unless you have prior map knowledge and game sense. I came from console and did okay but the skill gap is extremely high and you will not get past gold/low plat I promise you. Even if you had the skill to get to diamond you will just play cheaters every other match or just every single match so It wouldn't even be Fun or rewarding. Please don't give Ubi any more money for this bloated, late to the hero shooter train, filler cosmetic cover up trash."

4322,"Was one of my favorite games on PC. Then they added more rounds for casual. The game has slowly died with every update, bring back the more casual round limit and leave the competitive the way it is. If people want to sweat let them sweat. Was the best FPS on PC for awhile but now sadly it has fallen way below average. I'd give this game 9/10 4 years ago now its about a 3/10. Sad Face...

4330,its a very good game and its worth the $20! the game is fun and can be played with a group of 5. and its just fun to play with freinds. its a 5v5 and very unique with its many diffrent charecters. each charecter has their own guns with their own abilitys. its much slower paced wich makes it unique. its not played like any other games.

4411,"As a player coming from console. PC experience is kinda new and fun specially with friends. but there is no doubt those good old days are gone like year 3 and year 4 but still R6 siege is entertaining (and still people are try harding in casuals).
If you are completely new to Siege and never played it before keep that in mind there is a lot to learn and almost all of it player are OG so good luck cause game isnt merciful but there are player that help you learn the game and are good sport players still. 
most of all play this game with friends. being solo queue player in this game isnt a wise choise.
good luck"

4429,"Imbalanced, unfun, unrealistic, samey, grindy unlocks, awful GUI, instantly boring, a garbage shooter.

Starting kits are grossly handicapped.
Levels are all ridiculous vertical mazes.
Attack Defense overwhelmingly favors the defenders.
Same maps every time.
Ridiculous terrible skins.
PVE bots spawn into cleared areas, including starting zones.

Agravating and unfair at every turn, not worth the time."

4459,"(sorry for the grammer) I have recently gotten into Rainbow 6 and haven't played much of ranked or unranked but I believe it's still a good fps game. The things that are good about this game is that tactical part of it. I love how you not only need good aim but good perception too! There many fps game that have the player use their senses but siege takes it a step forward and makes the player require to use their senses if they want to win by having the player be easy to kill whether or not its a stray pistol bullet or a 6'4 frenchie charging at you with a riot shield. This is still very hard for most people to do and requires a lot of practice but its so satisfying why you get a kill using your head. Perception is not only important in siege but your resources like your utility, the map, and importantly your team. Communicating with your team maybe the most important thing in siege and maybe makes the game unfun. Its hard to win when you solo queue and the community of siege is horrible, but when you play with friends its a lot of fun. The game can be played seriously or can be played like total dumb asses, committing the most stupid stuff with friends and having a blast. The balancing of this game is not the best and it may not be in it's best state but its has a special spot in my heart. I think more people should try this game out even with its flaws."

Even the cancerous CS:GO community pales in comparison to RB6S. The effort the devs put into seriously tackling these issues are laughable at best.

TLDR;  A technically great game, ruined by toxic morons."

(getting me killed all the time so i quit). 

So... Ubisoft = big bad.

4534,"This game simply was doomed for its longevity from the very beginning. Ubisoft as everyone knows is a very terrible company that loves to implement pitch perfect examples of anti consumer practices into their products and maybe establish an esports scene that will inevitably lead to its slow and agonizing end. I used to love this game and I confidently say that this game holds a special place in my heart. I first played the game in beta on my cousin's xbox all the way back when I was still just a preteen. I got the game myself in operation black ice and played consistently all the way up until operation grim dawn. On console I have roughly 2,500 hours on xbox, (my name on xbox is the same as steam ""TylerDoubleU"". Look at it if you want to fact check me.) 

Set up for failure
This game was launched in a terrible state. Although it has been out for over half a decade you would think that problems that have persisted since launch would be solved, but unfortunately a lot of the problems are literally impossible to solve. The game's engine is the same engine that was intended for the Prince of Persia game on a console, the anti-cheat has never gotten better, servers have gotten better but are still poor, in order to actually play the game at its highest potential you need to unlock most of the operators which take over 200 hours of game time unless if you pay money, the balancing team's solutions to every single meta is to nerf the meta to the ground, and the game has straight up completely lost its identity of being a gritty realistic tactical competitive first person shooter. Almost all of these issues have been a massive problem for literally as long as I remember. I would strongly encourage anyone to be invested in a better title that just so happens to not be a Ubisoft title

Competition
As for competitive shooters rainbow six just does not even compete. There are too many problems fundamentally with the game in order to fully flourish as an esport and a competitive shooter. Quite honestly there are just other games that do what siege tries to do in extremely better execution. Counterstrike is a solid choice that has many factors on siege such as: a reliable anti-cheat, little to no bugs, good servers, community participation such as aim training maps, consistent gunplay, entertaining esports, and better map design. There are other exceptionally  superior options as well like something a little closer to siege valorant. 

Problems with high elo
In siege no matter the platform you play on you will always run into loss conditions that is straight up out of your control. On console it is mouse and keyboard users when you finally climb to the very top, and of course on PC its littered with cheaters closeted or not in both high elo and highly populated ranks. You simply can not climb to a high elo fairly and by the small chance that you do you will never be #1 because it is always a cheater or someone who exploits the next not fun meta. 

Nostalgia 
Don't get me wrong when siege works how it is supposed to it is the most fun I will ever have in a game. I plated it way too much as a early teenager and as a kid and even when I play now I still have that feeling every once in a while of trying my absolute hardest at getting better and reaching that rank that I have set as a goal for myself for the past 2 years. Unfortunately though I can't commit to this game even if it is as stable as when I consistently played this game. The only way they can recover this IP and make use of an extremely unique and fun idea is to make a sequel with better servers and an even better engine."

Updated with content for the last 7 years and has been promised many more to come. E-Sports is always a good watch and through Twitch, packs are provided for in-game rewards. 

It's a shame it has changed the way it has over the years, and most of the maps are so different now that they're able to basically re-release them as new ones (looking at you Emerald Plains) - however they're only doing this by listening to what the very up-and-down community feedback on."

4611,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

4796,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

4804,"I have over 300 hours on this game and still feel like I know the bare minimum about it. This game is not easy to learn. The game basically IS learning. The most useful thing you can have is not a particular gun or operator, or even aim, it's an encyclopedic knowledge of every map. If that interests you, play it."
4805,"amazing game, one of the best shooting ones!! has its own mindset and full of strategies"

"
4918,fun
4919,"I appreciate:
• The main concept (a more “realistic” version of Overwatch, with gadgets replacing ultimates, and fast-paced rounds).
• The wide choice of operators, with enough different playstyles that the game cannot really get boring, since one can switch operators at every round.

I dislike:
• The wildly unrealistic handling of guns that makes no sense (shots are fired from the crosshair, recoil is always up regardless of the position of the gun, reloads can be interrupted any time).
• The randomness of maps (impossible to play one map for several dozens of rounds, to get to know it better).
• The lack of off-meta content (there is absolutely NO reason for anyone to use ironsights or semi-auto guns; only one playstyle works).

I hate:
• The microtransactions. Paying 60 EUR for this game isn’t enough, apparently."

I do believe that it does need to be worked on a little bit more, but all in all its pretty good. I'd recommend this if anyone is interested in a some-what casual and competitive shooter game that is unique (unique as in the different gadgets and guns) and different to other FPS games out there."

You will be the last one alive against a full team
You will be cold and alone inside the objective
You will suddenly be subjected to the defening cacophony of doors, windows, walls, ceilings and floors explode together and in rapid succesion
You will cower in the one corner where LoS hasn't been broken
You will pop your head up in hopes of one kill before death
You will, somehow, see that all the enemy team are looking the other way
You will know what you must do
You will, instead of what any sane, reasonable man would do, you gracefully toss your nitro cell right in the midst of them
You will detonate said nitro, and get a 6 player multikill (5+1 hostage)
You will loose the round, but it will be all worth it"
5056,DÜNYANIN EN İYİ FPS OYUNU
5057,Game was good and now it's a struggle to play one game of casual I wouldnt buy this in 2022. It was an easy choice in 2019 but not anymore.
5058,It's awful.
5059,"One of the best FPS games. But still can't be compared with Counter_Strike franchise and especially CS GO, and precisely as its competitive aspect. Because this game relies too much on Intel and gadgets use as more than each player gaming skills (flick aim - track aim - recoil - movement W or W/O accuracy). So before anyone attack me its still a good game overall but still, ... competitively speaking: its better to have a game that only holding the same angle all day and when u see something on your drone or camera u just shoot randomly and 1 bullet hits the head or u pre-fire or wall-bang your opponent to death, than a game like CS GO that is balanced in terms of flick aiming - tracking - recoil knowledge - movement - positioning - utility usage. 

       Thank you!"

Also if you disconnect in the last round of a match you WILL get banned from every game mode for days on end. Plus they constantly release terrible updates regarding maps and the structures of the maps, I mean if they actually played their game they would know that 99% of people that play ranked ban the same s**t maps. And in their official discord the mods and admins are super power hungry and will IP ban you for the slightest comment.  I do not recommend buying this game now a days, its slowly getting worse and the dev team keeps getting more and more non straight people recruited."

5133,"   The game is a complete mess and a shadow of its former self, bugs that go unfixed for ages, audio system that doenst work for 6 months every year, old unoptimized engine, god awful parasite anti cheat, meanwhile every week a new stupid outfit or collab comes out with the most out there characters and none of the issues are fixed. every new season they promise some new useless feature while im here coming out of a ranked game where i heard for 80% of the match a sound that can only be described as a 3 washing machines with bricks inside, making me unable to hear anything for the whole round. 
   For the people who are thinking about buying the game, cuz its in a sale piss cheap, listen the game is buggy and now days is just a 7 year old cash cow for ubisoft, they dont care about the game and the only updates they think are meaninful for the game are some stupid rick and morty collab, its not a tatical shooter like the old days of siege and it hasnt been one for a long time."

5193,"I used to love this game. It united my friends and me for over 500 hours of gameplay. As for gameplay, the game has lost much of its original charm as a SWAT simulator. Careful planning and tactics have been replaced by what are ultimately now superpowers. In its early beginnings, most of the abilities and operators were somewhat grounded in reality. Now many of the characters feel more like knock-off marvel cops, as they litteraly ""Kool-Aid man"" through walls and punch with robotic arms. 

Add to the loss of realism the unfortunate reality that the game has been taken captive by Ubisoft's woke messaging. The company has spent three years subtly reworking maps to eliminate the presence of suicide bombers, drugs, and sex trafficking so that the maps can be played in china and pass their censors. Add to that the increased pandering to diversity inclusion as they explore its operators' sexuality and gender identity. 

The game is now unrecognizable from when it launched so many years ago. It is an unfortunate loss. I recommend that players who are seeking a SWAT experience instead spend their time on ""Ready or Not."""

5277,"It's long overdue that I write a review for my most played game.

	Let me start by saying that Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is the most captivating game I have ever played. The foundation of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is outstanding. The depth of gameplay is endless, especially with the consistent update schedule. The unique destruction and the adaptive dynamic sound system are revolutionary. The intricate information game tied in with the versatility of operators keeps you interested and thinking. The drive of competition and the thrill of clutches is an emotional rollercoaster you can't help but continue to ride. All of it makes for a unique, unforgettable experience.

	But does that mean I recommend you play Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege? Sadly, It doesn't, for both returning and new players. I do not recommend this game. It hurts me to say this because I love this game. First off, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege emphasizes competition and team play. It's partially why this game is so great. So if you don't want to ""sweat"" or try your best all the time, this game is not for you. Unfortunately, Playing solo is horrific. Why is that? It falls on how people suck. This community is atrocious. I highly recommend you look elsewhere. When first writing this, I listed all the player types that were contributing to the deterioration of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. That list is extremely long. It also doesn't put the best taste in my mouth. The thing is that those people aren't going to change. They will always be awful. The main issue is a lack of teamwork and cohesion among players. It's needed for this game to work,  and the community doesn't want it. You will get insulted and mocked relentlessly instead of helped or guided. Having a simple disagreement will turn into a full-out brawl of racial slurs. It's impossible to discuss anything with anyone. I think that it's insane that people can't be rational or reasonable. Arguably that's a requirement needed for holding a job, Which happens to be nonexistent in players. If you still want to play this game against my recommendations. It's a requirement to have someone who is already playing. Especially since Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege won't teach you a single thing about multiplayer. Not only that, it's paramount to have an entire squad of friends. It makes for a way better experience. 

	I haven't mentioned the Developers because they received enough hate and ill-willed criticism because of the failure of the community to be individuals and use any amount of brain power. Not to say I don't have criticism or suggestions. I don't want to be associated with the notion of #SaveSiege. Or be used as ammo for Keyboard Warriors to continue harassing the passionate development team. I'd rather discuss and deliberate what I think needs to get changed with people that can think for themselves.

	I hope the reputation system will alleviate players' temperaments and allow collaboration and cooperation to return to the player base. Sadly, it's a far stretch I doubt will come true. If you want to talk about Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, I am always down for that. I'm addicted to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege and can't stop playing. Thanks for taking the time to read my review of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege."
5278,no
5279,good
5280,"I thought moving platforms would make my experience with this game a little bit more bearable but it only made it worse. Ubisoft cannot seem to figure out how to add a half decent anti cheat so the game is littered with cheaters. This game hasnt been fun for years and they only keep making the game worse. I advise anyone considering to buy it, even at this stage of the game where it will give you brain tumors and will want to make you do terrible things, to not buy it and save your money. Despite all i just said, I will still continue to play this game everyday of my life because i have a terrible addiction to this game and i hate myself."
5281,ugh says game good fun

5283,"Saul approves!

"
5287,"It's an okay game, but I suck at it."
5288,"I love this game. Don't buy it if you value your sanity, the community is shit"
5289,"I'd rather make love to a roll of sandpaper than play this game. Over the years this game has only gotten weirder and wackier.

I've violated every article of the Geneva Convention in every possible way. I've shot, stabbed, gassed, poisoned and bonked thousands. I am what every war criminal in the Balkans imagines before they close their eyes at night. I was the last image in Slobodan Praljak's head before he drank cyanide in the courtroom. The simple uttering of my name made Oskar Dirlewanger uncomfortable in his big boy officer breeches.

You do not 'play this game casually'. You do not 'play for the community'. There is no community. When you discover the first griefing Frenchman in your lobby, you will realise what an utter waste of time this endeavour was, and how foolish you were to believe that this game would be even tolerable to play.

Half your time will be spent explaining to your squadmates how 'it was a headshot', and the other half will be spent observing Ela's asscheeks on your drone as she reinforces the objective.

The narrative behind Rainbow Six Siege is completely contorted and incomprehensible. It just convinces me that Ubisoft have no idea what the hell to do with this game anymore; I was especially convinced of this after seeing Sens, the newest operator, who has a dead albino porcupine sitting on their head. Really summarises the game after 6 years of constant updates which have only succeeded in making the game feel bloated and turned away thousands of casual players.

Want to play casual? Have fun getting killed by smurfs unable to play at their own skill level.
Want to play unranked? Have fun getting instantly beaned by a cheater four rounds in a row because you can't leave or risk getting banned.
Want to play ranked? Have fun trying to find a non-toxic squad who have enough patience to stick out with you in higher ranked lobbies (which are filled with cheaters, by the way).


It's gotten really bad, and it's only going to get worse. The only reason I'm recommending this game is so you're convinced to share my suffering.
I hope you get a papercut the next time you lick an envelope."

5314,Bugged+Shitty servers. Wasted my money. Had to spent 10 hours fixing connectivity issues just to play the game.
5315,cool game
5316,"No. Este juego es una cagada.

El R6 es un buen concepto ejecutado por Ubisoft, que es basicamente la villa de empresas que hacen jueguitos. Es muy malo, es peor que malo, es una mierda, cualquier persona que quiera gastar tiempo jugando esta mierda encima tiene que bajarse todo el bloatware y malware de mierda de Ubisoft que 20 minutos despues de cerrar el juego te sigue rompiendo la pija. Funciona como el orto, los servidores dan asco y toda la mierda q te tenes q bajar para jugarlo te rompe toda la pc y te mata la paciencia.
Si queres pasarla mal y llenar tu PC de basura lo recomiendo 10/10. Juego de la remil reporonga Ubisoft del orto."

5358,"I've been playing this game for almost 3 years now. Community is the most racist, homophobic, annoying group of players I have seen in my entire life of playing games. Ubisoft has some of the worst reasoning for changing certain mechanics and operator gadgets and most of that is to appease their E-sports players. Still recommend the game but UBisoft really needs to start listening to their multi-million person player base about issues rather than cater to the professional players who dislike something that was implemented as a balance for normal players."

You'll have fun for a while, then get frustrated and drop it, then come back to it like that crazy ex-girlfriend you miss so much because it hurt so bad. It's like being addicted to drugs. You enjoy the high and then come crashing down. Then, of course, relapse, and the whole process starts all over again. You'll love it like frogs love moisture and hate it like a bug bite on your ballsack, gaurenteed. 10/10 game"

5416,.
5417,Balls in you jaws
5418,"Every time I spend money with this game I get disappointed. But that's actually because I do that when I'm usually more addicted to the game thus playing more and suffering more with its problems. 

The game itself is level & graphically well designed. Has a good community and almost does not suffer with cheaters compared to other games. This is a consequence of the game itself being paid, so before you start playing you have to spend some money in order to play.  That makes the game environment much more controlled which is a thing I find pleasant from this game.

The not so good thing is that double XP events are super uncommon and the grind in order to get a good amount of the operators from the game (even if you start with some) is tough. Seems like its this way so Ubi can make some extra profit out of it.

Also when you play the game a lot you're going to notice that there are some dumb stuff all around it, that could be easily fixed by ubi side but its just not fixed because of clear laziness. Stuff that use to work and stops working for obscure reasons etc. And stuff like the unability from Ubi employees to remove temporary sanctions (bans) from Unranked and Ranked matches due to abandon. Even when the abandon was caused by game/server's fault.

Besides that, I appreciate that ubi stills updates the game and add new content to it, but thats not something I wouldn't expect from a paid game."

5554,"At one point you could've called this a fun game, but the barrier for entry is now too great to really enjoy any aspect of it... No matter what Ubisoft tries, the skill floor will always ruin the fun of this game. Doesn't matter if you have 5 hours or [i]500[/i] hours, the other team is always better, or you get the bad site on a map (of which no good ones remain). It feels like the game is deliberately trying to ruin the day of everyone I play with, and we can all confidently say that we have not enjoyed any match of this game in a very long time.

The community itself is the problem, and there is no fix for that. The changes made in the past year or so to childproof the game (no more ranks shown, global chat off by default) conflict with their own goals of player safety, because you can still get in a match with a player you've blocked if someone else in your party [i]hasn't[/i].

I cannot recommend this game (or most games nowadays for the same reasons) to anyone outside of profession e-sports gamers, because that's all you'll find playing anymore. I play video games to have fun and enjoy my time away from more strenuous activities, not work even harder just to compete."

Unreasonable skins, unwanted map changes, meaningless brand new operators, and so on. The community became absolutely the same as the ""CS"" fandom and the toxicity&cheating been very common for the past three years.

The only real player base is tryhards and smurfs,
Freedom of speech is extremely limited,
They have run out of ideas for new content to add to the game, so they've started stealing themes and ideas from other games,
They haven't fixed certain bugs since 2017,
They break the game even more with every update,
The Community has had a steady decrease in numbers for the past 3 years.

I've been playing this game since year one, and the decrease in enjoyment has recently been so severe, it doesn't feel like a real game, just a Sad attempt at a cash grab.

If you look at/have played the game before, you can see the difference,  Rainbow Six Siege is gone, now it's just a trash pit of toxicity and metas, that the game devs have sold out on."
5614,"After 400+ hours on this game, I think I can say for sure that this game is worth every penny I spent. Truly a fun game to play solo or with friends. I should warn there is a chance you will run into toxic players which could mess up your vibe if you're just chillin' playing the game. Other than that, great game with a lot of skills to be learned and perfected."

5660,"An exceptional tactical shooter. The graphics are not groundbreaking however fitting to the intended competitiveness of the game. The gameplay is in its' basis simple, however with the different operator's loadouts, stats and abilities, it offers a highly diverse and dynamic gameplay. The maps besides their astonishing details compliment the very core aspect of this game that all actions must be thought through and will always have consequences in one way or the other. It makes it immediatly obvious that team-coordination and -cooperation is key to a successful. But even if you have those things, things can always go wrong, whether it be because of the map, the competition or the circumstances. The lore I personally do not care about. Though I am unsure about the of recently more ambitious gameplay additions, I have no doubt that this is one of the most high-quality tactical shooters out there."

5684,"I really want to recommend this game, but there are some pretty big issues that need to be resolved if Ubisoft wants there to be a lasting future for this game. 

Pros: Great strategy game with some of the best feeling mechanics. I played this game extensively before getting a PC. It's insanely fun. The operators are unique and each provides a refreshing style of gameplay for the player. 

Cons: The game is dying, steadily, not rapidly. The game fell off and part of that is Ubisoft's fault in terms of marketing. Current players have no news tab or get any advertisements for new operators, events, etc. Just recently an event went public and no one knew of it until the day before. It's hard to keep the community wanting more if there is no news to provide hype for the game. With the community as toxic as it is, why would players want to stick around to play if there was nothing to look forward to? Another thing to add on; Operators are SO EXPENSIVE. They DO NOT require micro-transactions to own and play, I want to make that clear. But, there are so many operators now (64 at the time of this review) that you have no hope of getting all of them unless 1. You play every day and grind or 2. You buy them with money. Just for reference, you can get most of the operators for $40. Each time you unlock one, that price drops a little bit. So there is an incentive, but I think it's a ridiculous price for the characters. And no, I have not spent any money to buy operators on PC. I may have bought a season pass or two when I played on console in the glory days. 

Overall, it is a brilliant game, and I do like it. If you are willing to put up with toxicity and do some research as to when events and new season releases will come out, then get it, you'll have a blast once you get used to everything."

Making headshot deal 1.5x or 2x damage would be awesome. I hope they revert the change to attack side, I miss 2018 Siege when playing attack is actually fun and not tedious."

5773,"this game is fun as hell, but the community sucks. I can't believe Ubisoft hasn't done anything to combat the toxicity in this game's 7 1/2 year life. it's insanity. other than that, it is fun.

pros:
-huge variety of operators, each one feels pretty unique
-can be played sleathily or not, but stealth is best option
-most maps are pretty good
-you can play co-op or solo against bots which have 3 different difficulties(normal, hard, realistic) which is what I recommend if you don't care about people being assholes
-surprisingly isn't too much of a buggy mess considering it's a Ubisoft game

cons:
-horrifically toxic community, probably the worst one in all videogames. seriously, its impossible to get into a match of people where slurs and other horrific things aren't said
-while stealth is optional, it isn't recommended, so it can take awhile to get used to it if you don't play many stealth based games already
-it's made by Ubisoft"

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

No other game offers the highs of getting your first ace.  And no other game offers the blinding rage of getting spawn-peeked on the final round of a ranked match.

It's not perfect, and sometimes it seems like Ubisoft is actively trying to make it worse, but Siege on its worst day is still better than any other competitive FPS I've tried.

The only problem that I personally have with the game is its community, for real, when I play ranked the only type of people I get in my team are fucking polish people that literally cant say a single word in English and that sucks. But other than that highly recommend to play with a group of friends you'll have a great time.

6084,"The Community Ruins this game. I've been playing since launch and always my biggest gripe with this game is how toxic and sweaty the community is. Yes, I'm a ""filthy casual"" but jesus the community really ruins this game. Between team killing, sweating, and smurfs MY GOD SMURFS; I just can't recommend this game to anyone. I'll continue to play it for the few good matches, but that's just my stockholm syndrome."

6141,"Lots of fun to be had. Few things to note. Significantly better with friends though its not too difficult to find people to play with online. Roll with the punches. Its a game where sometimes I do good others I do horrible and its difficult to get into it if you get bummed out every time you die. If you want to get decent faster play some training grounds on elimination. It'll help your aim and you can practice the maps. There are people that play to troll but hit 'em with the ol' ""Mad cause Bad"" and everything'll work itself out. If your switching from console to PC and your not sure whether to switch to mouse and keyboard, do it. I did and it's worth it, even though it takes a bit to get used to. If your not sure if you want to buy it on PC cause you have it on console buy it anyway. 
-Pro tip: Best way to get gud is to reduce enemy health while simultaneously keeping your health above zero.

6156,Absolute garbage game with a constantly changing UI and devs cater to sweats rather than the other 98% of the playerbase. This game will be the reason Tom Clancy himself rises from the dead for vengeance.

6323,r6 is a very good game but it might say it's only like $25 but that is completely wrong. it comes with a cost. a mental cost that will haunt you until the day you die. i frequently have nightmares about being sexually assaulted by every one in the game that has a shield. so if u wanna get this game just know you will want to kill yourself almost every day and you get addicted so the pain never. ever. stops...

6329,"I downloaded this game thinking it was going to be easy. I am currently fleeing the country because of rainbow six siege. I will tell you the story of how this game caused my downfall. It all started the first day of me downloading this game. I got into the game, joined my friend, and we queued into a quick match. A good word to describe that match would be chaotic. Explosions happening every second, bullets flying by my head every which way. It was stressful to say the least. Though this caused me to have the want to get better. Skip 100 hours and I'm in an Un-ranked game and some guy I tk'd on accident says hes going to D-dos me. Now I didn't believe him, which I regret. He booted me off my internet and fried my router. I was pissed off so I called the police to get him arrested for what he did. When I called 911 I completely blanked. I didn't know what to say. They asked, ""Sir... Are you okay"". I quickly said ""Yes, I was just prank calling, my bad"". Now you might be wondering why I said I was prank calling. Well, the reason I said this is because I forgot the guys username and turned my PC off. After I said I prank called her she was not that happy. She started to go off on me saying how immature I was being and how I should never prank call anyone, especially 911. Before she could continue I hung up. 10 minutes go by and I hear a hard knock on my door. I quickly get up from my chair to go open the door. When I open the door 2 police officers are standing on my porch. Now I'm freaking out. I thought this was about the prank call. I ask why they are here and they say that the station got a call saying I was planning on blowing up the orphanage about 25 miles away from where I lived. If I am going to be honest, I started laughing because it was so random that I couldn't hold it in. The cops didn't laugh, they just looked at me asking if it was true. I quickly told them no while trying to be serious. They asked if they could search my house just in case. I said yes but told them to not break anything, because I have a lot of expensive items. After about 1 hour of them snooping around, 5 more cop cars pulled up. I was a bit confused so I walked outside and they told me to get on the ground with my hands up. I complied because I didn't feel like resisting. Now there is going to be a massive time skip so let me shorten the time in between. I was sentenced to 8 years in prison after they somehow found evidence of the whole orphanage explosion thing on my computer. I escaped prison after 2 years while there was a massive fight going on between guards and prisoners. Now I've been out of prison for a week and finally found a car to flee the country. Also, I'm assuming that the stupid D-dos kid hacked my computer as well and put fake plans of the orphanage thing on my PC and then called the cops. I don't know if this is true I'm still trying to figure that part out. But right now I'm half of the way to Mexico from New York. So hopefully by the end of this month, I'll make it to Mexico and finally be out of this god awful place. Anyways I say Rainbow Six Siege is a great game. I would give it a solid 5/5, so good job Ubisoft."

6410,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
6411,"this game changed my life. before playing Tom Clancy's Rainbow SIx Siege, i was a nobody. I was a nerd who didnt get any girls.

I leave and try to search again. the same thing happens over and over and over again. 

The game used to be my favorite but bugs, glitches, exploits, hackers, and bad updates made this a disappointment of a game and I wouldn't recommend buying this game until the devs fix the issues and look at what the community wants instead of what their stat page says

the devs do this thing where they nerf and buff characters who are played the most and the least and how much people win with them. This seems fine until they nerf someone who isn't at all overpowered and now no one wants to play them."

6519,"I may have 1000 hours but 900 of them are startup times and trying to invite friends in a lobby that only seems to exist for some players. Oh and also restarting the game because you randomly got disconnected and then accidentally searching a new game without the friend that got disconnected in the lobby because even though they reconnected they still didn't end up in the original lobby so no one noticed they weren't in the lobby and you hit search while you went to cry in the bathroom and came back to your friend confused as to why you're asking who to ban when he's still in the menu. 

So you end up in a lobby with someone who teamkills you for no reason then just griefs the rest of the match knowing they won't ever get punished for it even if they get 9 reports but you're not allowed to leave/surrender in a reasonable amount of time because that would actually make sense.

Then after enduring this torture you go to invite your friend but for some reason ubisoft connect (not bolognese code btw) won't show them an invitation from anyone in your lobby so the lobby leader restarts the game but now his invites don't work for anyone so everyone else restarts and you have to do like a puzzle to figure out who can invite who and after 10-15 minutes you all lost your will to even play the game anymore but you're all now in a lobby so you might as well and the game launches you into a match where you have to pick between 3 maps but literally no one on the server likes Villa, Favela, nor Theme Park but that's all you get here's the next 30 or whatever minutes of your life before you get a chance hahah.

Also I'm glad that objectively badly designed operators are still in the game after years and years of data and feedback. It's almost like defenders not moving at all is a bad and unfun counterplay to not getting wallhacked jesus christ.

"
6594,"This game is like trying to do heart surgery using a pair of chopsticks with the lights switched off.

Its rewarding when you get kills but most of the time you die before seeing the enemy.
Friendly fire results in you having less than half health before the round begins and this game punishes new players heavily.
All in all if you're a masochist, this is the perfect game for you."

6606,"GREAT GAME
"
6607,"bad game, was amazing when they came out then the main ubisoft retards ruined it in every way possible, character bloat where every single new character has the same ability as an old character with a slight difference, like an old character who attaches batteries to metal things to make them shock enemies, a new one does that but instead of attaching a battery they just throw it. brainlets have no idea how to balance and do the opposite of what everyone wants always, added fortnite seasons, keep doing shitty redesigns of maps, focus pretty much shifted from a fun game to making it esports focused so they can appeal to the mentally ill twitch audience. dont bother playing this one its best days are way behind it"

6652,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower."

2. Too much downtime in between rounds with unnecessarily long transitions.
3. No cross-progression and skins are overpriced. 
4. Occasional if not frequent bugs (dead audio or endless gunfire, black screen, etc).

Recommendation:
Get the game if you like tactical shooters. Only play with friends (you might get pissed with them but it's better than dealing with randoms)."

6787,"I used to really like this game. However the devs at Ubisoft have been systematically ruining it. Over time, Rainbow has slowly turned into an arcade shooter. Probably because Ubi thinks it panders better to a younger audience, but the facts have consistently proven this wrong. Despite serious players and long time casual players constantly giving feedback on what we want and don't want, Ubisoft chooses to ignore them and do what they think will make it more popular. Not to mention, many of these changes have caused game breaking bugs, and they don't add anything worthwhile to the game. It's clear this game is dying. a few years ago, I would have suggested anyone who enjoys FPS games should buy Rainbow, but it's obvious the developers do not care what happens to this game anymore. Ubisoft is actively destroying it, because it makes them money. it's nothing more than a cash grab to them now.

6881,"This is probably my favorite competitive shooter but also the most frustrating and ridiculous shooter game I've ever played. It's a very versatile game, there's a lot to do in it for being a shooter. The one downside I'd say this game has is probably the community. It's full of cheaters and throwers who ruin ranked, unranked, and most definitely casual. You have to put a ton of hours into R6 in order to be mediocre since map knowledge is so important. It's a fun game to pick up, but it's definitely time consuming and very challenging of your skills."

6884,something funny about this game is shit but i play it alot
6885,"So down below was a update earlier, and guess what? They managed to get it even worse!
Sadly most games are infested with cheaters using a Meastro camera as if it's a nuclear bomb, sadly due to Ubisofts policy you're forced to play or you will get banned for quite a while eventhough you've played against the same cheater before, in the past you could block them but with the amazing new privacy option this is no longer a option, great addition Ubisoft!

The launcher also loves to hijack your mouse when leaving the game or not letting you invite your friends, the best suprise it had for me was randomly invert all sound (issue doesn't pop up when ubisoft is closed).

This terrible state of the game is reinforced by the huge amount of content creators leaving the game for greener grass (aka a developer who doesn't release 200 euro of new skins instead of actual fixes).

===========================================================================

Ubisoft managed to bring a game enjoyed by many to a game hated by most.
Rainbow Six Siege was en still has the potential to be an amazing game, however the issues regarding the UPlay Connect, Anti Cheat and the overall stability (glitches and bugs) is ridiculous for a game of this age.

Sadly the game in it's current state hasn't aged like fine wine like other games in the series, Ubisoft is extermely focused on the monetisation of the game after the initial sale with a huge variety of skins surrounding popular pop-cultures and the ESports scene while neglecting the gameplay itself by pushing out content in the form of new operators to make it as difficult as possible to get into the game with the gigantic amount of gadgets and abilities you have to watch out for.

If you're a new player I sadly have to recommend you to either have a very thick skin and get through the terrible community and endless hours of suffering to get a hang of the game or try a different game in the hero shooter genre.

Players that have played this in the past will get suprised by the 180 change of direction the game has made, but will be able to get into it very quickly by the lack of innovation.

Still its very unique close quarters combat and very focused on tactical gameplay. Its worth to buy when its on sale, but otherwise not.

6932,"This is an OLD GAME. The community is well established and the learning curve is frankly only getting more and more higher. Yes the community is toxic, yes the game sucks at times, yes it can be unfairly balanced sometimes, and no, the game isnt dying. The game has a VERY active Pro Scene, Very active Content Creator pool, and LOTs of players.

Hi, im Elegant and ive played since Velvet Shell in the first year (of SEVEN!) of siege. and the game has had a PLENTIFUL amount of Awful moments. Ive endeared it, raged, laughed, made jokes, been toxic myself and been in situations that make me think that they shouldve been banned, i have only 150ish hours on pc. but nearly god idk like 4k on Xbox between 2 accounts. I've put in the time and sweat. 

This game is hard. Dont let ppl tell you otherwise. The Community like i said is well established at certain strats and knowledge. You will die, a lot. You will hate the game, a lot. You will Love the game, sometimes when it works and you do something cool. The learning curve is so steep that Pros are always learning new angles and strats bc the nature of the game allows for full imagination to hold an Objective or to attack one, its one of the reasons ive always appreciated the loop of the game.

I recommend this game bc with it came literally my best friends that ive met irl and had the pleasure of knowing for 6 years now. The memories live with me, the rage lives with me. I understand its just pixels but with it comes a very unique experience that will shock you, piss you off, make your hands sweat and heart pump. 

the game is great, get it. its gonna kick your ass but you'll learn something everytime"

6971,This a very realistic game. Excellent graphics. Highly recommend.
6972,"One of the best games I've ever played, super balanced, very fair, accepting community, and very mindful of others ;)"
6973,"First, let me preface this: The majority of my time played is on PlayStation and Xbox, so that's where i put my time in.

 That being said, this game was once one of my most played games, always on my home screen, sitting there, waiting to be opened and played, but after Zero/Sam Fisher came out, the game became more and more try hard-y and less casual/fun, it became a game where, either you stomp on the THEM, or they stomp on YOU, which, i suppose is fine if you like really, and i mean, REALLY competitive play, but for the more casual gamer, you're going to get stomped into oblivion, and dare forbid you try anything other than meta, because you''ll get flamed by your teammates, and possibly be tk'ed, and the sad part is, i'm not even talking about the actual content yet.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The content in this game is...adequate at best, atrocious at worst. 

starting from:

-The Good:
the overall movement/gadget controls are simple, yet good.
Shooting is responsive, but i'll get more in-depth on this topic soon.
Diverse CHARACTERS, (you'll find out why i made this in caps in a bit.)

-The Meh:
The sound design,( again, more on this later.)
The maps are kind of a hit or miss, and you'll probably only get the ones that are bad more than good.

-The Bad:
The balancing in this game is pretty garbage, you'll only see people with two or three different guns, because the rest are either, too situational, or just plain bad, And some operators that are just plain broken, like mute, he can disable ANY electronics, and the really only 2 counters are, Thatcher and Twitch, Thatch being the hard counter, Twitch being the soft counter, as most GOOD mute players, will hide them where you can't really see them from drone holes, or they are too far for Twitch to do anything without getting in range of the mute jammer.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Operators are pretty diverse themselves, but, the GADGETS are whats the problem, they are so similar they might as well be the same thing, take Kaid and Bandit for example, they almost have the EXACT same gadget, the only real difference is Kaids' is able to position itself anywhere, and have a radius/AOE, see what i mean? it's all just copying another's gadget, but changing it a little bit, and then calling it a ""revolutionary new gadget"". Don't even get me started on the recoil either, you're either shooting people with minimal kick, or are up to the moon by the 2nd shot. I used to play Jager CONSTANTLY, he was by far my fav op. But not because of the gadget, But because the recoil was actually in a good state. It felt like i was actually Controlling the aim, But now his recoil is absolutely HORRENDOUS, for example: i was in a match recently where, there was a target about, 20-ish feet away, i shot at his chest ONCE, and my sight was up to forehead level, the funny thing is, I WAS ON PC, where most people are THE MOST ACCURATE WITH THEIR AIM.  I just couldn't fathom that every time i would shoot anything other than a little baby SMG, i couldn't get more than 4-ish shots in before i had to COMPLETELY recenter my cross-hair.

The sound design this game has is...ok i suppose, but one thing i can't understand is, WHY THE DEV'S THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE TEAMMATE'S FOOTSTEPS LOUDER THAN ENEMY'S. It's just plain annoying when all i hear next to me is ""THUNK THUNK THUNK"" from my teammates, while the enemies are like ""tink tink tink"".

All in all, the older version was WAY better than what it is now, which is the case for a lot of games nowadays, which is quite sad, but, old siege will always have a place in my heart. As one of the most fun games. It's sad to see it turn to this. One of my personal additions would be to add a game mode called, ""Throwback"". Old ops, Old maps before their rework, and basically reverting the changes back to early siege, before all this new shit.


TL:DR, Siege turned from goofy fun-having, to, a sweat swamp, horribly balanced, dust-collecting game."

After adding operators starting from gridlock this game looks like gay party. They took off all mechanics, kills realism and nerf everything. What does it give for community? Nothing. They do this shit listened low skill player and LGBT girls what actually don't know what is this game. So this game are dead. All characters are ugly and stolen from other games. Mechanic of matchmaking is like win 30 MMR and lose -45 MMR, is it ok? No! My friends playing on silver fighting with platinum gamers who doesn't sleep anymore. Trying to help them, I just surrender.

Also, Ubisoft is trying relentlessly every day to ban cheaters and rework the old maps so much that there are endless things to learn and grasp and just when you thought you were getting hang of the map, they switch it up to makes things that much more exciting for everyone!  The SBMM in the game is top-notch too, and you will rarely see and instance in where you will play the same opponents multiple times in a row! Thanks Ubisoft for a wonderful game!"

7199,"As somebody who has around 6k hours on this game across many different console and pc accounts I can honestly say that this game WAS a masterpiece. In my opinion the devs just simply got lazy and started freestyling around year 3, nonetheless this game is one of a kind. Insanely good gunplay mechanics, well thought out concept and recently even added a pretty good lore. But ofcourse there are also downsides, like for example the community, very toxic but you'll get used to it and will learn to love it. Also for me as an OG player all these new updates just dont seem like the good old Siege I used to know, but everyone got his own cup of tea."

I am very close to giving it a thumbs down because this game is going down hill. the devs are neglecting things that need to be addressed seriously bad. and yet they delay nearly all. this game has so much problem, as in PC as Console, its a shit show to behold. we have game breaking bugs, glitches in ui. audio glitches. glitches with operators. bugs here bugs there bug everywhere, you wont always notice them but they are there.
the reason i still gave this game a thumbs up, is because its still really fun, aside from the bugs and shit show and everything. ive been with this game since year 3, and i have liked it so much, still do.

7365,no rainbows 0/10
7366,"Look, it will probably take you about 20 matches to really get into it. For me, that was because it took that long for match-making to really align to my skill level so I felt like I could have good games. But I loved the concept. For others I know, it was more about getting to learn the huge amount of content (maps and operators and mechanics) comfortably enough that it ""clicked""

But, hey, I strongly encourage you to push through because everyone that makes it through those 20-odd matches ends up loving it."
7367,this game is just horrible tbh
7368,"Very fun to play especially with friends. Only problem is that it's a bit hard to get used to.
"
7369,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

7411,"This game is a huge hit or miss. I personally love this video game, I have played this game on the PlayStation for hundreds of hours but with the amount of unfair matchmaking this game creates for you, can make a very unbalanced and not a very fun experience. We can talk about Newcomer for a second, this mode is specifically for the players that are trying to get into the video game, and it's unfair to the players in there when a team full of smurfs come along and just ruin your fun. This game also have a very huge problem when it comes to skin prices. For example, if you wanted an elite skin for Thermite or Jaguar, have fun spending over $26 bucks for a singular skin, calling card, and victory emote. Not worth the spending of hard earned cash. The game is overall very fun and tactically balanced, but this game has a lot of issues."

7427,"Game itself is fine and good, the company Ubisoft itself though is shit. 7+ years and still haven't fix connection issues, not adding support for other platforms even though it's already there and most of the work done for them, known to have a toxic work culture, and has pulled other games (even single player ones) off of shelf's to the point they aren't playable as they DRM locked them with their own service.

Only playable with friends as the community is toxic as hell. Not sure about the balance of things as I don't play ranked but I'm sure someone out there has a meta list of what to use. 

Source for ubisoft being a toxic company. Note, this has been going on since late 2019, just this article is the newest on the info: https://www.svg.com/768721/ubisoft-employees-claim-things-arent-getting-better/

7552,good
7553,good
7554,"An excellent team shooter with a fast time to kill and much to learn, but there's a few things that spoil this experience and make it incredibly hard to get into as a new player:

* The defender ability to run outside of site nearly consequence free.
* The defender ability to peer outside from inside site nearly consequence free.
* Various forms if pixel peeking, which isn't too much of an issue in most games, yet in this one you can make your own pixel peeks, which makes most memorization impossible, which otherwise would be possible in other games such as CS:GO.
* Shields are STILL nonviable competitively and able to be shot through from the front, due to bugs in the character animations which causes them to clip parts of their body through the shield, which has been a bug in the game since launch in 2015. It's been 7 years.
* Egregiously fast leaning/unleaning times allows players to leanpeak a corner and pre-fire an angle while fully protected nearly consequence free. As a player on the receiving end of this tactic, there is very little you can do to protect against this other than remaining incredibly mobile, which as it turns out is the competitive meta in this game. There is no place in high-ELO for slow players or angle-holders.
* 80% of skins and worth-while cosmetics that are not retextures are locked behind time-locked battlepasses, events, or $15 pay walls. If part of your goal as a player is to unlock cool character/gun skins, look elsewhere. Hunt Showdown, a game based in the year 1895, has better looking gun and character skins that are more achievable than anything you'll see in Siege.

Play with friends, don't treat it seriously, and stop before you get mad. This is the only way to enjoy this game."
7555,Its a nice tactical shooter
7556,it is not as toxic as i was thinking and everything about this game is positive
7557,This game is very fun and it is a very good game to play with friends. You can just play casually or if you want you could play competitive and rank up.

Progression is really slow in my opinion and can lead to having operators you cannot effectively counteract because your cheap ass refuses to buy all the operators. With all that said it was fun and I wouldn't say its a bad game, just one you can't continuously play for fear of heart failure, I give it 7/10..."

7661,"R6 has became a very controversial topic.
If you're more of a veteran who played in the games prime, you'll know its slowly falling off grace more and more, many can agree it's not the same game as years prior when the competitive side of siege wasn't so forcefully integrated within the whole player base and people could choose how they want to play the game, as of right now it has been very heavily influenced by the E-Sports side and consequently many players left due to the harsh changes of many parts of the game.

Ubisoft is trying to somewhat revive the game but everything they do seems like a worse decision than before, straying it further from it's former self while also pushing more players away from the game by once again mentioned changes so heavily influenced by Pros. If Ubisoft want to make this game more enjoyable for everyone, they should not only step down from making such dramatic changes and/or get another smaller studio to have a fresh start for R6 for the companies and communities sake.

Overall the game was great and i would say revolutionary for FPS shooters, many hours spent with friends messing around and getting better, but at the current state of the game i don't think i would ever return as it would only hinder my opinion of Rainbow Six Siege even more."
7662,"Rule34 Zofia, thank me later ;)"

7668,"I love this game! It is always really fun when i get to be the imposter, i get to be a sneaky boy. I will pretend to do tasks so my ""fellow"" crewmates (hehe) dont suspect me. I love to sabotage the lights and kill someone, because no one will see hahaha. Even though being the imposter is the most fun, the crewmate role is also good! I am REALLY good at the swipe card task, not trying to brag or anything haha. It is always fun to watch the cams for anyone being a little too SUS. This game was really fun to play with relatives during grandmas funeral, because then we could pretend that SHE got killed by the imposter. My overall rating of this game is 9.83/10, thanks for reading fellow GAMERS and ill see you on the spaceship ;)

7678,"Horrible competitive experience. Ubisoft Connect must be one of the worst game launch apps out there right now. 
Even with immaculate internet quality, Ubisoft repeatedly decides to disconnect from the server for no apparent reason. In competitive this translates into a game penalty which has led me to have a total ban time of 2 days just because of that consistent disconnect with the Ubisoft platform. 
The battle pass is too expensive, however the operators can be obtained by progressing through the game by playing regularly. 
The community in the competitive aspect is varied; but most of the times it is usually toxic. I have early Parkinson's, therefore my ability to play competitive games is not always optimal, and despite this I have a superior performance in competitive games; this game is very demanding in every aspect and in the competitive community, if you don't meet those standards, it's often reflected in an excessive amount of toxicity, team killing, and a ton of other forms of grieffing.

In conclusion;
The game is recommended for users who want to enjoy the unique genre that is R6S, But at the cost of having tolerate with Infinite of hackers, cheaters, constant disconnects from the game And other types of verbal aggression by other users."

7706,"Wondering if you should buy? I'll help you out. The games anti-cheat is a joke, almost like the developers. Ubi as a whole is straight dog... I've recorded 15 hours of footage in under a week just in ranked alone. About 25-30 matches include blatant hacking. Not soft aim, i mean spin botting, tracking heads through walls and one tapping with mont without ads from across sight ( whole team dead), knifing defenders during drone phase, and get this ""drones that shoot lasers that one-shot defenders. So then what happens the other 40% of the games without hackers? You'll never know, but you best bet you'll  de-rank at least 5 times bf you get the rank u actually are(because you get de-ranked when you play in a lobby with a hacker...). Its not just high rank either, literally any rank you'll meet ubi's scum children. Ubisoft wont fix it, they'll change gun play and nurf ur favorite op pick and make garbage reworks instead of giving us new maps. 
Game=stale
Ubi- please sell the rights to a company who actually wants to make the game better
you- dont waste your money, bc you'll uninstall it in a week based on skill based matchmaking alone at no fault of a cheating meat bag.

The thrill of an extremely close game and the feelings of satisfaction or frustation that overwhelm you depending on whether you win or lose can be pretty addictive. Besides the occasional tiny bug or clipping issue it is also a pretty well polished game. The balancing could definitely use some work though."

7740,"I mean Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is good, but not quite as good as Cinnamon Pull Apart Bread!

What you'll need:

- A goofy ahh nonstick pan
- Non Stick Spray
- 2 Tubes of Biscuits (Pillsbury or Otherwise)
- A social security number
- 1 and 1/2 sticks of Salted Butter (Unsalted also works, just be sure to add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in step 3)
- 4 Teaspoons of Brown Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon of Honey
- 2 Tablespoons of Milk, Heavy Cream, or Buttermilk (Non-Dairy Milks work as well. See Step for more info) (More as Needed)
- 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar (more as needed)

Step 1. Preheat your oven to 350 and give your pan a light coat of non-stick spray

Step 2. POP THEM BISCUITS OPEN BABY!!

Once you get the biscuits out, grab a butterknife (or use your hands you filthy animal) and quarter them. Start laying em out in the pan. Spaces in-between the biscuits is A-okay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring. Likely, you'll run into the issue of ""too many biscuit pieces, not enough space"" so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece. Once you've got all the biscuits packed in there, we're on to step 3!

Step 3. BUTTERSUGAR TIME

Grab your 1 and 1/2 Sticks of butter and we're gon' melt that son of a gun. Personally, I like to melt butter in the microwave, but if you wanna get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it. Ain't nobody stopping you.

So for the rest of us common folk, put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or Pyrex measuring cup. I throw it in there for like 1min and just check on it closer to the minute mark, but we all got different microwaves. Basically, you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it. So however long it takes to do that. DON'T leave it in too long or it'll burn and then you gotta go get more butter.

NOW. You've got your melted butter. Add the Cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til' it's all nice and pretty. Once you've successfully crafted the buttersugar, pour it over the biscuits in the pan. My two main goals here are ""1. Make sure every biscuit gets some love"" and ""2. Fill in all the cracks"" So pour slow and steady.

Step 4. MAKE IT HOT

Okay. Let me level with you here. I am not a classically trained baking professional. I'm just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets. I have messed these up before and this is the step that made my dad leave. And why did he leave? I ran out of milk.

Double check the oven is on 350. Put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong. Leave them in there for about 10-13min. Be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process. What you're looking for is the tops to be golden brown. Like that real fresh baked brown, that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites. Once you see golden brown, open the oven and don't be afraid to get a little greedy. Grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look.

If it looks doughy Turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe 5 minutes. Again, note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out. You want them to look like done biscuits. I can't put pictures but I'll make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures.

If it doesn't look doughy Well then what the heck are you doing? Move on to the next step champ! We got biscuits to eat!

Step 5. Make the Glaze

In a good sized bowl, whisk together your Powdered sugar, honey, and milk. If you don't have a whisk, that's fine. Just go grab a utensil or something. Personal preference: Fork. They look meaner than the other utensils.

NON-DAIRY MILK USERS UNITE!
I really like an almond milk substitute here, but whatever works, works. Just know, with the amount of ingredients we're using here, your glaze may come out thin and runny. If it does, don't panic and cry. Just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments. Add, whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny. Once it's thick enough, go ahead on.

Take your goofy ahh mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits. And boom done."

7749,"It's one of the games i've played the most, and had the most fun with, but over the last few years it has steadily been losing its personality, losing its creative gameplay, and ultimately losing the fun as well.

While overpowered characters are cracked down on, quirky wildcards and hit-or-miss character abilities are scrapped and replaced for just another wall breaker or area denial.
The things that made the game immersive and unpredictable are being stripped away every other patch. One step forwards, two steps towards becoming a generic corridor shooter overly tuned to professionals only.

But hey, they have skins and lootboxes so it's fine right?"

7781,Game: o.k. Playerbase: Horrifyingly toxic. You name it they do it. Ubisoft Connect is also one of the worst pieces of software I have ever had the displeasure of having no choice but to use. Every time you open it something different is broken. Inviting friends is a nightmare. The in-game player-invite is broken 90% of the time and so is Ubisoft Connect by inviting them through that app.

Everyone in this community hates the game, we just continue to play it, why is a wonder most people seem to have. This game has horrible devs, they cant fix anything with the game. At this point I feel like the last good change was getting rid of client side debris and bodies. No changes/updates have been a help for the games slowly declining playerbase.

7814,"Although the community can be a little toxic, there are mostly nice and supportive players. The game it self is quite enjoyable, I just wish ubisoft or steam would allow you to transfer data from one device to another, considering I've spent like over 200$ on xbox and cant get it back on computer. Overall great game and would recommend to players looking for one of their first games."
7815,"I've played this game A LOT. 1,200 hours may not seem like a lot to some of y'all out there, but it's by far my most played game, and that's for a reason. It's simply, a lot of fun.

Rainbow Six Siege has an amazingly good blend of strategy, teamwork, and action to a level that I haven't seen in any other FPS game. Some others come close, but just don't quite hit the mark.

The game overall feels good. Controls are solid, shooting feels good, options are pretty good too. Graphics are pretty good, but honestly, the graphics aren't the focus in this game.

The strategy has evolved over the years with this game, the meta strategy is always different every time I pick it back up. But, the teamwork, is what will make or break an attack or defense strategy, and that makes this game very intense, and of course it can get heated sometimes. That's ok though, in my book.

The biggest con with this game, is definitely the cheaters. The cheaters have absolutely ruined Rainbow Six Siege after it became very popular. Now, it seems Ubisoft is making some attempt to put a stop to cheating, and Make Rainbow Great Again. I added up the totals they claim they've banned since Dec '21, and it was around 50,000 people.... yes, you read that right FIFTY THOUSAND CHEATERS. After starting to play it again, after not playing it for around 2 years, it's fun again, and I haven't had any cheating experiences so far. So now, I think I'll finally write a review for this game, and give it the credit it deserves.

I highly recommend Rainbow Six Siege."

7855,Don't buy this game because Ubisoft is absolute trash. Deleting your games that you paid $60 for after a set period of time is flat out unforgivable. Ubisoft deserves to go bankrupt if they think that their strategies are remotely good.

This shit is why I stopped playing this game for 2 years and now the first few days back I get bullshit like this."

8019,good game with solid gunplay the problem with this game is the ttk being very strange at times and the ranked community being pretty toxic
8020,"So, why do I not recommended this game?

Shortly, ""Ubisoft"".

If that doesn't explain it, buy this game and play it on a competitive level. After a few matches you will realise and come across people that are either smurfs (main account is on a platinum level or above) or cheaters.

So to elaborate on the ""Ubisoft"" bit. Even tho Ubisoft apparently filters and bans players, i don't think they do this effectively. You might report a cheater through their website by opening a ticket, providing images, videos, but all they can say is ""we cannot discuss with you the details of the investigation"". This is so unrealistic and just bs so they can ignore the reports as long as they want. The sad truth is, they don't care about player reports; anti-cheat system either bans players or not.

Also, I cant get over the fact that the server all of my mates and I played ranked on crashed for god knows what reason, and we got 1-2 weeks ban with a lovely -50% renown boost. Reported it, nothing happened :) Apparently they can not compensate players (lemme tell you a secret, my mate had an active booster while the game was undergoing some maintenance, he opened a ticket and got a new one because he couldn't use it all, so honesty means nothing).

On the other side, so i'm not just all negative about the game. The game mechanics are amazing and one of the best tactical fps game. So many operators, so many gadgets, so many unique abilities and updates. The weapon customisation can help with accuracy a lot, which means it worth spending some time on testing those out.

Overall rating, solid 6/10.
Would recommend playing with mates or playing quick matches, but not on a competitive level as it is ridiculous.

Share your ops on this review! :)"

8026,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single simp to Ela, who has a 140 pound ass now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

8050,"Initially the game was great but now Ubisoft is just trying to make the game easier for noobs. In the name of operator balance, they just nerf every operator which has a high pick rate. They ended up nerfing too many operators to the point where no operator is same from 3 years ago or so. This game keeps on changing and with new updates they keep on nerfing every operator. Moreover this game has a huge smurfing problem and a bunch of cheaters fill up ranked.
Overall this game had a lot of potential, Before Operation SteelWave was the peak of r6."
8051,"good
"
8052,Don't buy it unless you have the cash to buy all of the op operators (or a friend that has them can carry you).
8053,"Rainbow 6 Siege is a very nice game, the graphics are good, the gameplay is good. Mind you this does not feel like a first-class experience but still, it is a very good game. The only thing that ruin the experience of the game are the minority toxic af players, very skillful players being matched with newbies (like me) and the Pay2Win system that most of the community around this game try to defend by saying that it is not a P2W system."

I was on the top of the leader board and my teamates all had 0 kills whats even worse is that one person was fucking 12 years old had a open mic and was blasting NBA youngboy. And he called me ass after I died from a spawnpeek this angered me to the point where I wanted to scream racial slurs. After the match I sat on the toilet and shat my brains out. Once I finish, I wipe and look down and see fucking tape worms. Thank you Rainbow Six Seige"

8471,"Rainbow Six Siege. 
The game, that I wanted to play since it got released. But I had no PC. Now I am so happy to have one and it's compatible with this game! 
What do I like in this game?
1. The experience is very awesome
2. The GamePlay is hard for beginners like me, BUT that just gave me more motivation if I got a kill or won the game by myself. 
3. It's Realistic. (average things)
4. It's not Pay-To-Win (I mean the abilities aren't that important to win only with it)
5. It makes me fun. (The most games makes me bored after an hour or less)
6. Sometimes it's funny
7. The Anti Cheat system is very good. (Thumb up for BattleEye)

And yeah I think I have much more positive things to say but there's also negative aspects.

1. beginners have hardly a chance to play
2. Some things won't function smoothly
3. You dies too fast (it's not negative to me but beginners)
4. One Situation mission has a problem: The enemies won't spawn. Idk why, even after I run through the whole map.
(there's some more but idc them)

At least I have to say that THIS GAME is the BEST Ego-shooter Game I know. I hope it stays how it is. And the Updates wouldn't making me regret playing the game like some other games. Btw I love all the Tom Clancy Series, even that I can't play them."

Now its filled with tryharding, roaming, spawnpeeking, and dropshotting people who feel like they are trying to be esports players. The only fun i have with the game anymore is in custom matches where we do 5v5s or 2v2 tournaments. I no longer think this game is worth the price and i wouldn't buy this game if i were you. My final thoughts? Vigil mains suck, go play crab game. Oh yeah, i forgot to add that ubisoft is terrible just to add salt on the wound"
8520,"This game used to be fun before ubisoft stuck their dick up their own ass and decided to just fuck themself. The game is just a sweat fest full of people who don't know how to have fun. The game has broken mechanics, shield hit boxes don't work. People can shoot you from places where you can't even see them and still be able to headshot you with no problem. The new operators suck ass and in general are just not useable. If you want to just have a sweaty game and not have any fun try literally any gamemode newcomer is full of smurfs, casual is full of people who think they're playing ranked and unraked and ranked are just a nightmare. With 676 hours i can safely say this game is honestly just shitty and will not be fixed ever because ubisoft just doesnt give a fuck. Have a nice day and remember not to buy rainbow six siege play terraria or hearts of iron four at least you'll still want to play even if you want to kill yourself."

8533,"INGREDIENTS
2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)
1 medium yellow onion ($0.37)
3 cloves garlic ($0.24)
1/2 lb. carrots ($0.49)
1/2 bunch celery ($0.83)
2 split chicken breasts, bone-in ($6.64)
1 tsp dried basil ($0.10)
1 Tbsp dried parsley ($0.15)
1/2 tsp dried thyme ($0.05)
1 whole bay leaf ($0.15)
Freshly cracked pepper ($0.05)
2-3 tsp salt ($0.05)
6 oz. egg noodles ($1.00)
INSTRUCTIONS
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion, garlic, and olive oil to a large pot and sauté over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and transparent.
While the onion and garlic are sautéing, wash and slice the carrots and celery. Add them to the pot and continue to sauté for a few minutes more.
Pull the skin and any excess fat from the chicken breasts. Add the breasts to the pot along with the bay leaf, basil, parsley, thyme, some freshly cracked pepper, and eight cups of water. Cover the pot, bring it to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for one hour. Make sure the pot continues to simmer for the whole hour. If the heat is turned down too low and it is not bubbling away, the chicken will not shred easily.
After an hour of simmering, remove the chicken from the pot. Using two forks, pull the meat from the bone and shred it slightly. Season the broth with salt. Begin with one teaspoon and add more to your liking. I used 2-3 teaspoons. The flavor of the broth will really pop once the salt is added.
Add the noodles to the pot, turn the heat up to high, and boil the noodles until tender (about 7 minutes). Return the shredded chicken to the pot. Taste and season again with salt if needed (I didn’t need to). Serve hot!

8562,"In all honesty between this and Hunt: Showdown I would say hunt showdown is the better game. That aside if you tend to play with a group of 4 or 5 buddies you could not do so on hunt and this game would literally be the best shooter you can play as a group until veiled experts is released.

They just pump out skins and ops instead of actually fixing the issues.

8587,"There was once a time when me and my friends would play Siege for hours on end going over the nearly endless strats for each map and objective. Over the years the game has slowly lost it's originality also it's not the only good tactical shooter on the market anymore. Maybe I am just nostalgic and a bit biased towards the ""Good Old Days"" but as someone who has played this game for about 1500 hrs I don't find the urge to return and play more than 1-2 matches, cause I feel like it lacks the strategical depth it had earlier, careful planning and co-ordination has been sacrificed a bit in favour of raw aiming prowess and fragging out on your own. Also over the years the roster of playable operators has become more and more convoluted with each new operator and gadget becoming less and less original.

Having said that it is still a good game and is still a bit different that other run and gun shooters on the market, also though Ubisoft gets a lot of shit for their degrading graphics and monotonous quests they have continued to support the game and will probably continue doing so in the future, a no-brainer for people who like playing multiplayer fps games."
8588,the best game ever

8597,"Besides the fact that it is a fun game in the sense of it being challenging to get into and master with the game always changing with each new season for the last 7+ years. Would I recommend anyone looking at this game or wanting to play this with their friends? Hell NO. it is the most toxic shithole filled with people with the mental capacity of a fucking spoon on a good day. Sexist, toxic, rasist should have been a stain on their parents bedsheets, if you have any faith left in humanity do NOT play Siege. 

however, if you like a semi-tactical fast-paced shooter where you def need to have a microphone and give callouts and communicate with your team in order to Win a match. Hell yes. Just remember to actually use your Microphone, even if you're new to the game. give callouts. tell people you're new and wanna learn. find the most non-toxic people that will help you better the game and do your best to not be an asshat. if you do that, I'd say give siege a chance. if not and you're a toxic little cunt and possibly a cheater/hacker. stay the fuck out and go back to CS:GO or some other shite title not worth our time and money. 

Thank you for comming to my ted-talk. hope it helped you decide on siege or no siege ^^"

8601,"I do recommend this game. It is a bit overwhelming at first, and is not something for people just getting into first person shooters in my opinion, however the game is extremly fun when you're playing with friends and the matches can surprise you as well. rainbows characters are wide base, and i enjoy sitting down and reading through their bio's while im in wait for a game. Now if you don't have people to play with I wouldn't worry the game is still fun then, I started off solo, and got to meet people along the way. Few days into the game I've already learned a lot from understanding people. A gift from a family member to now enjoying a great game with friends. I highly recommend!"

8621,"I used to play this game around the time Lion and Finka dropped, but having bought it again recently I highly dislike not being able to play operators from the start and having to grind for all of them just because I had bought the standard version, I did not expect all of them being unlocked but having absolutely none is actually pathetic.
Overwatch had no problems with this but yet again, Ubisoft is being Ubisoft.
One way this could be fixed is by giving a free rotation, to which as far as I'm concerned is not a thing.

Other than that, the game is good, the tactical aspect is a very intriguing one, the game is not just a shooter, it's very strategic and requires planning for each and every round, would recommend it had it not been Ubisoft."

It runs terrible, hackers, you will get suspended if you get kicked from ranked, and no system improvement updates (only new characters that are lazily designed and new skins). not worth 20$. It also isn't just pc that has problems, xbox crashes a lot and you will get a monthly game breaking bug."

Quickly grew to fucking SCI-FI bullshit with no life children using ""drones"" and other bullshit gadgets to get cheap wallhacks and know where you are at all fucking times. No real skill and no real tactics involved, just whoever can shit out the most drones or info gadgets and then prefire wherever.
No need to check corners, no need to clear rooms, no way to fucking defend yourself against these cheap fucking noob tactics. It's a game for people with the least amount of skill in the world. It's a frankensteins monster of a MOBA and a so called ""tactical"" FPS. I wish nothing but the worst for this game and it's developers."

8805," Quandale dingle

Overview: Quandale Dingle is an African-American man aged 20-25, most well-known for various unlikely and even seemingly impossible appearances throughout the entire universe, including virtual spaces. Another important piece of controversy regarding him is his imprisonment and eventual escape with the help of his friend Juandale Pringle.

Unique Facial Features: Quandale has an abnormally shaped nose, having a large size and pointing forward. His face is slanted downwards at an extreme angle, this being accentuated by his large lower lip.

Crimes and Imprisonment: After his incarceration, for battering on a police officer, grand theft, declaring war on Italy, and public indecency he publicly stated that on March 28th he will be escaping prison and has plans to ""take over the world"". Shockingly, even after this statement, he was still able to escape on the specified date due to the prison staff's negligence.

Escape from Prison: On March 28 2018, Quandale Dingle escaped prison and went into hiding at his friend Juandale Pringle's house. While he was running from police, he fell and accidentally scraped some foreskin off from his genitalia. Armed forces were later sent to Juandale's house, who was arrested and later killed. Quandale esecaped and is now staying at Aden Dookie's crib with Quindavious Gooch.

Family: It is known that Quandale Dingle has an autistic son as well as a ""baby mama"" named Sheniqua Anderson. His son's name is currently unknown. Quandale has stated that he supposedly gave away his son to ""creepy old guys"" due to his refusal to pay child support, although it is unknown if this is true. He has also stated that he trapped his son's hand in an air fryer. His relationship with his father is described as abusive by Quandale, who says he was ""given a sucker punch full force"" and was ""smacked in the back of the head with a steering wheel"" Quanlingling Dingle is Quandale's asian brother. At one point he placed illegal substances in Quandale's meal as a supposed assassination attempt or a misguided prank, which almost killed Quandale. Quandale's cousin, Henry Bartholomew Dinglenut was also arrested, for planting 2.5 Kilograms of TNT in a daycare center. Also putting a camera in president Joe Biden’s bathroom to watch him take a poo. His relationship with his mother, Quandlisha Dingleberry, is not in a good state, with her being the original founder of the AQTF, an organization with the goal of combating his devious activities.

Appearances: - Union city, New Jersey - New Batman movie (as ""The Dingler"") - Los Angeles - The lost city of Atlantis - The White House - Plushtrap Room (Five Nights at Freddy's 4) - ""Prison Break"" Roblox game - Lil Minion's mansion - Robbery of Goofy Ahh Jersey bank - Fortnite - Tilted Towers - Hitler’s Grave - etc.

Criminal history: Quandale Dingle has committed many crimes including:                                                    - Murder - Theft - Assault - Selling illegal substances - Using chemical weapons - Using nuclear weapons - Killing a president - Arson - Kidnapping - Rape - Tax evasion - Reviving Hitler - Starting a war - Treason - Genocide - Terrorism - War crimes - Hate Crimes - Child labor - Declaring War on Italy - Battery On A Police Officer - Public Indecency

Trivia:                                                                                                                                                         
Quandale was bent over in the prison showers by someone named Garfield Jenson.             
Quandale almost drowned in his bathtub when he was 15 years old.                                       
Quandale put percs in Vladimir Putin's drink and ""he went to bed for a really long time""."

8834,cool game bro I beat up a kid
8835,"it is really fun and is really good when bored

"
8836,"Not the best R6 game at all because it focus on MP,

It's going to be a long story so just read me out.. but sure the MP is fun, got me hanging after the existence of Extraction... Then the game is a joke now to Tom Clancy's, seriously zombies? Ubisoft you need to stop taking acid and make a proper Tom Clancy's tactical shooting games again, and to me the last of the best R6 game was Raven Shield. Why? 

Because it's a Single Player, then you can build up your spec ops team from Alpha to Charlie team. After that you can make an infiltration plan on each team, you literally building your own gameplay style on the mission. The best thing about it is that, when you have casualty in your team, you can't bring them back and the spec ops will be lesser. That what makes me wanna redo the infiltration plan and make it better until each of them got out alive. 

The game is really unforgiving, you can die easily if you don't react quick before the enemies, even if you turned on the auto-aim. Now that's what i called a tactical shooting game, you really need to be smart, strategic, quick and, precision with the plan. But of course there's a flaw too, the AI can be really annoying and dumb sometimes, but there's an AI improved mod that you can download on the website which is A MUST HAVE before playing it. 

Then there's Vegas where the downfall start, everything is scripted focus on story, all of the sudden your teammate betrayed you in vegas 2 if i remember correctly kinda funny thou. Also no more team buildup, only you with your 1 team, no more infiltration plan, you can take much of the bullets and still be alive. 

i hope nothingless from ubisoft now, they've ruined Tom Clancy's this is for you Ubisoft

8851,"yes
"
8852,bad game
8853,"This game has stuck with me for a while. The game was at it's peak during 2017-2018 and It was Operation White Noise, and Operation Chimera. Those two Operation's blew the game up with the new map Tower, and especially with the ""Outbreak"" Event running from March 6, 2018 - April 3, 2018. Playing the game with friends then was extremely fun and even running solo was very fun at times. But if you were too play now the game feels boring without friends. The game rapidly decreased in player base around the end of Operation Neon Dawn and it was because multiple people in the community passed around that Ubisoft was running out of ideas and were making the game a little too much on the competitive side. Many people also complained about the recoil changes, the optic additions, the TOS additions, and the new UI. I do agree that most of the changes that were recently made to the game made it worse, but it is still Rainbow Six Siege and it is plenty of fun with a group of 4 friends on your side that don't focus on the game too much and are just there to have fun and blow each other up. But unfortunately Ubisoft is making a heavy change to team killing  as well so you can't blow up you're friends as much as you used too anymore. I'm glad I played during somewhat of a peak moment for Siege and I will still call this game a great 5v5 shooter any day."

8861,"Despite playing for thousands of hours over console and pc i cannot recommend this game. Whilst it has its good moments, overall it's terrible. The game's stability gets worse with every patch, the anti-cheat is about as useless as a politician, and ubisoft never deliver on their promises for the game's future. Year 7 and we are still experiencing bugs and glitches from day 1, and cheaters are getting worse and more common. The game just continues to get worse and worse. Do not buy this game, maybe if you get it cheap or for free but even then, not recommended."

8879,"Warning!

Ubisoft will not continue support for 15 of their games after September 1st, 2022.

This means, you will not be able to:

- link accounts for select games
- use multiplayer for select games
- get access to any DLC you have purchased for select games

That's right, you will be unable to download and install any DLC for select games, no matter if you bought it.

Ubisoft just gave everyone a reason to never buy their games ever again. In the words of their own marketing campaign for the upcoming Ubisoft game, Skull & Bones ""Long live piracy.""

Here is the current list of Games that Ubisoft won't continue to support:
https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/gameplay/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-september-2022/000102396 

It really pains me to leave this negative review for one of my favorite multiplayer games, but Ubisoft really doesn't deserve your money if they continue to shut down games. Siege is a great game, but please do not purchase it, don't support Ubisoft. Who knows, maybe they will shut down Siege one day, and all your money spent will have been for nothing."

8934,"The games graphic is good. Cheater got banned instantly altough some of them doesn't get banned but players can report. The concept of building a wooden wall, or reinforced wall  as a defense is so cool. Players can also use a drone to scout enemies. The game mode is decent like every other games. There are training grounds for aiming practicing, usual deathmatch, quickmatch to find match faster, search and destroy i think. I don't know what's the name of the mode where players defend either a bomb, or a hostage for 2 rounds and then it switch to attack where players have to extract the hostage or defuse the bomb. Laptop that has low spec can also play this game. My skill hasn't improved much but i will challenge myself to be a skilled player not a pro tho. I've played for a week i think and it's good for refreshing when your mind is puzzled. For the developers, can you lower the price of the elite skin? I think it's too expensive. If players do the easy way such as top up, they will achieve it easily. Also the game is not pay 2 win so basic rewards like battle pass, weapon skins, elite skins are not that important. They don't affect much to skill. It's just cosmetics for rich player. I currently grind the free battle pass and it's not that bad. Price for operators/elites varies. The cheapest is 1,000 renown to 10,000 renown, and the most expensive price of elites is 25,000 renown."
8935,l
8936,"***NEWBIES*** this game is at least 50%, if not more, all about map knowledge. 
So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat (community can be toxic at times). Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.

There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 55 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 80 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators.

More tips:
-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match.
-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them.
-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides.
-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map.
-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.
-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency."

Pizza elf valorant fortnite skins, bugs, and again, crappy network.

Developers just forgot that this was a game, now it's a community for toxic fortnite transgenders which don't care about the gameplay. If you don't make a 1v5 clutch, you will get killed in every next round, but no voice/chat offence allowed, you will be banned.
Hackers in every second game, smurfs in EVERY game literally...

9155,comical game
9156,"– 1 1/2 pints (3 cups) Real California vanilla ice cream
– 3 large eggs
– One 15-ounce can pumpkin
– 3/4 cup sugar
– 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
– 1/2 teaspoon salt
– 2 unbaked 9-inch pie shells (not deep dish), fitted into pie pans (if not already) and frozen

DIRECTIONS:
Prep time: 25 minutes

Cook time: 45 minutes

Preheat oven to 425°F.

Meanwhile, set ice cream aside at room temperature to soften.

In the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a hand mixer, lightly beat eggs. Add pumpkin, beating on medium-low speed until incorporated. Add sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. If ice cream is still hard, microwave for 30 seconds at a time until softened. Add ice cream to pumpkin mixture, mixing until smooth. Divide mixture between pie shells and bake 15 minutes.

Reduce oven to 350°F and continue baking until a tester inserted into the center of the pies comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Serve warm or room temperature.

Servings: Makes two 9-inch pies."

2. you check your and enemy teammates names
3. you see the enemy team has either some guy with this name IIIIIIIIIII or SCP and some random numbers
4. you try to report them and check their profile
5. you can't because they have streamer mode

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

9246,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

The amount of times that I get disconnected from a match that I am unable to rejoin so I get an abandon penalty as well as all my other friends crashing is unbelievable. The game is so orientated towards defence and the community is either overly sweaty or overly toxic. There is nothing enjoyable about this game anymore. Just a dream and a corpse of a used to be good game. And god dammit I cant stop playing regardless

9408,"There is a plethora of shooting games out in the world today. They come on virtually every platform from cell phones to Computers and Xbox’s. Many good games are overlooked for the more mainstream ones such as “Call of Duty” whose games are extremely popular but at best subpar. One of the best new shooters on the market today is “Rainbow six Siege”. One of many games in the Rainbow six saga, Siege is the newest addition to Tom Clancy’s brainchild tactical shooter series.  The game features realistic five on five tactical combat between two teams. One of the teams attacks, while the other defends. Rainbow six’s graphics are amazing for a console game and really has the power to immerse a casual gamer. Rainbow also has a perfect formula for mixing in futuristic gadgets with real counter terrorism style combat in small environments such as residential houses and large yachts. Every operator has there own special gadget to gain the edge in combat and trying to guess which operators the enemy team will use is crucial to survival. That being said, you do not make it very far in Rainbow six without some sort of team work and collaboration as opposed to shooters such as Call of Duty that have more of a “one vs. all” run and gun mentality. As the game is rated M for mature by the ESRB, You will need to be over eighteen to purchase it. The strong rating is due to blood, drug references, strong language and violence, which some parents may find okay for their children.

9409,Very Very good game

9427,to many not normal lgbtq opps
9428,"This game will do nothing but give you depression and anger issues.
The matchmaking for ranked doesn't work.
The Anti-Cheat doesn't work.
You spend countless hours waiting for a match just to lose to some loser sitting in a corner then continues to talk trash when they've never had female interaction.
Ubisoft cannot create a good online game.
Everything teased has no dates behind it so prepare for updates that you'll have to wait 2-6 seasons for.
This game is horrible."

9445,"tried the game for a few hours.

save your money. dying game and hackers. battle pass can use loads of work. lots of reused skins that came out a long time ago. 

only decent skins now are from esports team skins... 

events with barely any effort in it. just ""hostage"" with some slight changes. more reused skins from old events.

the only good event they made into a separate game so you have to buy it. 

game needs a lot of work to be revived again."
9446,this game is just chill and a vibe. Only problem is sometimes you wont be able to get in a game for 10-15 mins :(

9453,It's fun when you get used to it. Some people are toxic and some people aren't. Honestly if you have nothing to do r6 is really fun and you'll get hooked easily just like my first week of playing. I've had this game for 2 years + and its really good.

9485,cool
9486,turns out you can also kill people on the other team
9487,"Ive played this on PS4 previously, great game. I personally prefer a build your own character style, and a select your own gear style. However this game delivers in reward for win, the better and smarter you play, the more you obtain and faster. For me i'd love to see something similar to the old r6 swat game, but if these things dont deter you, you will enjoy the game, once you get good that is."
9488,this game used to be fun but sucks now due to too many hackers pubg has less hackers than this and its been out longer! and DayZ & Rust is also fun!

Causally breaking down doors/walls to get to their objective to DESTROY THEM. All in all, explosions and tactical game play. Load of fun and this is a passion project from the devs, just keeps getting better and better."

9558,"Great game, overall very enjoyable especially if you play with a couple of friends. I would recommend this game if you enjoy a strategy-based game that takes a bit of skill or if you're a competitive player. Some rounds could be toxic but for me personally that's not much of a problem. My rating on a scale of 1-10 of this game would be around 8/10 - 8.5/10."

9615,"i recommend this game on the basis that there's a unique cast of characters, plenty of loadout options for personalized play of any character, plenty of skins to help you stand out from everyone else, and genuinely enjoyable events and arcade modes.

(this was originally a paragraph about toxic people in the community being, in all honesty, the worst part of the game. tl;dr they probably haven't touched grass in years, and they probably think that letting water run between their ass cheeks is ""washing their ass."" 1) mute voice chat. 2) mute all chat. 3) profit.)

all of that nonsense aside, this game can be so much fun to play with your friends especially if you just want to play casually. jumping into quickmatch after quickmatch to level up your battle pass so you can pull 5 black ice's in a row from bravo packs to prove that you are the luckiest person on your team is personally my favorite chain of activities."
9616,"Ubisoft shafted this game harder then Communism did Venezuela. 
they did this game so dirty that some fetishist would get jealous. 

this game used to be the pinnacle of Champion 5v5 but then they kept adding stupid gadgets. unnecessary balances. removed the individuality of many of the operators. making them nearly as useless as a recruit. Then some gadgets are so indefensibly necessary because the meta is gadget focused and asset denial that if you don't choose them you could be crippling yourself more then trying to do an operate that might have some advantage. such as jager. he so necessary because grenades destroy gadgets. so ou have to stop them from destroying them. so you try and counter. but the ubisoft says 
""No you can play agaisnt the strategies."" and nerf jagers guns so you are punished for playing the field.
Then something completely unique. A special self revive from Zofia. who basically only has a grenade launcher. they gave her a secondary ability. which nearly never came up until one person complained about it who happened to be a pro. and then they removed it. Instead of trying to counter balance it or even try to give more people secondary. 
Ubisoft in general is trying to streamline abilities and make them dummy simple. and have ten counters. when you should be trying to think of smart counters and using the field to your advantage. 
Ubisoft is stupid and they are going the wrong direction. If they even started rolling back alot of the changes and just coming back to nearly year 2 year 5? they would get triple the players again. they would hit a golden age again. before 6 they were getting soo much more traffic. And today? nothing like that year 1 year 2 high."

I love the cooperative play, which does not always involve speaking to your teammates, but almost always requires you to look out for them, their position, their devices, etc. The abilities these characters possess is another aspect that made me stick to this game. There is so many unique choices, that twist the game play in some interesting, often unexpected and fun to discover ways. Maybe, at this point, there are too many abilities and devices, some of the characters are not properly fitting in the original story, but overall, it's not a big deal"

9703,Been already 3 days playing and god damn the amount of toxic players there is in the game. Every  game I enter I wait 10 mins for an afk player to reconnect as they couldn't get there operator. Friendly fire trolls who will gun you down because they've been crying as you have also taken there operators. When it comes to toxicity they know how to talk but when in team play no one would talk or at least say gg. One more thing to note is that the mode for new commers is just filled with smurfed veterans who have played the game before. Overall the game is amazing but these factors just ruin the fun of the game

9742,"I've played most Rainbow Six games, and have played online since Rainbow Six 3 on the original Xbox.  It's been a consistently enjoyable series!  I picked this one up on a lark, looking for a relatively lighthearted shooter that wasn't as anal-retentive as Counter-Strike, for example, and it fits the bill perfectly.

A lot of people online say it's too competitive and challenging for a newcomer, and I'd beg to differ - that being said, I've mostly played ""newcomer"" matchmaking.  However, it's a simple and fun shooter, and the MOBA-style classes to choose from make it interesting without necessarily making it more complicated, in my opinion.

Overall, very fun, and good for short rounds as well as long marathons."

9758,"it stands out from your standard twitch shooters (even though it is something you have to factor in and definetly need in game) because of the multiple factors you have to keep into account when playing. Map knowledge, operator abilities, speed, cursor placement, recoil control, verticality, sound and Intel though cameras and callouts makes it a difficult game to master but definetly a fun experience to learn. 

Casual and New players can also find their place in the game due to the more accesible TDM mode and shooting gallery which allows players to test out recoil control and damage input withou the preassure of being in a actual match.

Even if you play it alone or with friends it definetly scratches that itch for a shooter game. Definetly recommend it. Specially since devs are keeping it updated with community feedback. (with both professional and casual players input)"

I have always continued to like this game, it is fun to play and a good way to lose track of time.
The community is relatively nice but there is a handful of people that may make your game boring or hate the people you are playing with.
I think either way, the good in this game outweighs the bad and it will always continue to be a fun game, it is also easy to make friends inside this game that will help you learn anything or maybe even give you tips to improve your skill-level."

Riddled with hackers for years but have seen some improvement there. Game Balance is quite questionable. Character writing that went from Tom Clancy's exquisite military stories to Ubi's low tier writing filled degeneracy and dumb politics. We went from characters like Thatcher to whatever stupidity they're coming up with now.

There are a few issues that have bugged me, namely being the matchmaking. I have been paired up with people way above my skill level, which generally makes it not as fun, however this is rare, and as the game is constantly changing, I've noticed more and more of my gripes go away, and be solved by these updates, all in all, Ubi tends to listen to popular opinion, making the game more fun for experienced players and new players alike."

A shitty ranking system that was stolen from chess.com, and you don't need a new account to smurf. It's enough to play two times very bad at the beginning of the new season, and voila. It is not necessary to show the list of banned people every time, it would be better to reduce the number of cheaters, trolls, etc. Lots of bugs. I mean a lot. Every second of this shit is buggy.

9951,"This is the only game I think I'll write a review for. There is one thing that keeps Siege players coming back time and time again despite all of the wonkiness.

There is nothing else that gives the Siege experience.

This game is weird. It's frustrating at times, but at other times, incredibly gratifying. I don't know of many other games that have given me the same dopamine hit as randomly flicking and firing through a wall only to headshot someone at random. This game isn't for everybody. Matter of fact, I'd say it's one of the hardest games to get a hang of right away because of its uniqueness, but that is exactly what makes it enjoyable. The higher in rank one travels in Siege, the weirder the combat gets. It was definitely more fun when I was clueless, but Siege has such a charm that it keeps me coming back to play for another several hundred hours. Whenever I play, I just want to be better, and I keep striving to reach that ""better-ness"". If you can get past the weirdness of the game, and the fact that the characters have evolved away from ""operators"" and now look more like OC's, the game is incredibly fun. Does it have issues? Sure of course it does. I highly recommend it either way."
9952,"Yes, I like both Rainbow 6 Siege and CS:GO, how did you know?

First of all, the launcher it's so bad, I haven't played a game from Ubisoft since AC Black Flag and I can't believe how buggy and terrible the launcher has become. Full of bugs disconnects and hell I have to google how to let other people join my queue because by default it wouldnt let them even if i invite them.

The game itself it's not for new players unfortunately, I'm not sure how can I enjoy the game let alone get good at it if we get insta killed without firing a shot by some low life smurf who plays on newcomer queue. In 4/5 games this shit happened, horrible experience.

For example constant cheaters, bugs ,and unbalanced casual & ranked lobbies. It's not a bad game just not worth the bs. It also has a toxic player base similar to COD.  So in my opinion I wouldn't waste another minute in this game and if you haven't bought it maybe don't."

10266,"This is the first FPS game I've played. 

At first I felt only having 3 gamemodes made it a very limited game but I quickly realized there are a lot of strategies and fun to be had in 3 gamemodes. Furthermore, having only 3 (that are very similar) keeps the game simple. While it can still be confusing for newbies it is not AS overwhelming. It also helps a lot if you have a friend to show you the ropes. 

R6S has in-game training that has the potential to be extremely helpful- IF the bugs were fixed. I looked into reporting the bugs after experiencing 3 or 4 bugs and learned that Rainbow's bug reporting system is crap. One of the bugs someone had reported (that I had encountered) was closed because only 4 people said they could reproduce the bug and it closed it stating ""Not enough players stated they could reproduce the bug."" In other words, because not enough players actively test & report (singleplayer bugs at least)- they will never get fixed. 

But as long as you stick to multiplayer it is very fun."

10353,Got the game. Played a few matches. Don't really like it but im kinda addicted.
10354,"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege is a fusion of Dota 2 and CS:GO, only better.

For beginners, it will be interesting to discover new characters, 
study the physics of the game and think over offensive and defensive tactics.

A lot of cheaters - get used to it, you will burn.

With each update, the game is sliding to the bottom, unfortunately.

But the game fascinates with its graphics and dynamics.
You can have a lot of fun playing with your team.

10358,"It's a great game. I've gotten my money worth.
So far I've: trolled, mained recruit, became a sweaty tryheard, threw harder then my sister being thrown across the room, bullied guys, been down bad for women, called people daddy, aced, clutched, played while crying. At this point i've done everything.
Despite the ups and downs I've enjoyed this game.

However beware of the toxicity!"

10387,I downloaded thinking it will be fun but i get crapped on and cry thinking about all the wring ive done in my life 10/10
10388,Its fun if you're into Search and destroy type games. This one is very unique and only thru teamwork will you win most of the time. Like all games this one has toxic players but with the right group you'll enjoy moving up the different divisions on ranked as well as enjoy the learning curve. Its not fast paced like COD and there are no respawns until the rounds are over but even in death you can help your team by looking at cameras for intel as well as sound calls.

10401,The game is way more fluid on PC than it is on Xbox One highly recommend to anyone that is into tactical shooters. It does take time to get to the level of other players if you have never played on console and requires a lot of game sense but once you get up to par with everyone else it can be extremely fun.

10449,if you like being flamed buy this game
10450,"One of the only FPS games I play nowadays, just gets better with every update. Probably will play this game for the rest of my life. Also, i'm very pleased with the recent inclusion of LGBTQ+ operators, and the crackdown on team kills and toxic players. This has made the game far more enjoyable. Thank you Ubisoft!"
10451,"I have this game on Uplay, and have over 2,500 hours, and I am just about level 300. 

This is hands down the best FPS game out there. This game is different in many ways, the most important being the destructible maps which allow you to win by more than just gun play. There are also many traps and gadgets which enhance the gameplay experience. 

I should warn you though, this game has a very toxic community and very abundant cheater player base, which takes away from much of the fun the game once had (I had never encountered a cheater for the first 2 years I played this game). If a new anti-cheat is announced, I could see this game coming back full swing. Though you'll have no trouble getting into a game.

One-shot headshots. While this has been a hot topic as of late, it allows players the ability to easily win in any situation whether is 1v5, or perhaps better odds. Though be careful, as poor positioning can cause you to lose a 5v1. 

I love this game, and I know with time and commitment to learning the ins and outs of the craft which is a Rainbow Six: Siege player, you can too. 

Enjoy!"

~The Ubisoft invites and authenticator system is annoying and gets more annoying with each use
~the ubisoft invite and menu is really stupid they need to take a page out of Bethesda's book and submit to steam launcher fully
~The ranking system is complete garbage this game will not factor in your overall win/loss it only looks at how big of a streak you manage to go on after getting ranked, even if you win 70% of your games over 500 games going on a early loss streak will completely tank how many points you get for a win and nothing will fix that
~the sound system that once felt cutting age 8 years ago now feels out of date when compared to free games with binaural audio like  the Cycle Frontier lol
~they change maps based on what the ""pro league"" deems important pushing away all fans opinions and ideas what also lead to them removing Secure area and Hostage from ranked play. They could of just gave them separate ranks but they pulled them from ranked all together and this made alot of the still decent maps have pockets of unused areas.

THE GOOD
-decent anti cheat."

Its a hard game to get into nowadays with all the toxicity, and people not wanting to teach new players cause they only want to dog on them for being ""bad"" at the game for not knowing things immediately like the map. If your entirely new to the game i recommend playing with friends that will teach you or your gonna have to deal with assholes who think they know better just cause they have 1 more kill than you, yet die every round at the start. Try and learn the maps in deathmatch, quickplay, or training grounds. It will help out alot, and have you not get so many teammates being mad at you for not knowing them. Expect to have a hard time in the start to get kills and clutch. Its a hard game to learn and has alot of operators to learn. Once you learn all the operators, and their abilities you should know most anything that could affect the round. It takes awhile but its a very fun and satisfying game once you get past the learning curve. Its not a ""realistic"" game in the sense that how abilities work, but there are a FEW mechanics that ground the game in its realness. So expect to be caught off guard by how things work together. Its not a perfect game, but it has come along way from where it started, i can tell you that from experience. Its in its best state currently as a design and program standpoint. There are issues with hackers right now, but every game nowadays has that issue. You will see a couple here and there, but dont let it discourage you. They are currently working on everything involving cheaters for the future, and legitimacy of the game as every game is. Its far from a dead game, and can only grow from now."

10543,It is a very good game and i love how there are lots of characters and each one of them are different and uniqe in there own way
10544,"One of the best FPS shooters I've played, it mixes preparation and tactics with both fast and slow paced combat. It includes highly advanced competitive gameplay, i strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants a more advanced and fun non-battle royal shooter (because lets be honest, the battle royal space is stale and over saturated). 

8/10 would recommend"

10553,"Firstly just want to say a lot of my complaints aren't directly only at siege amd are toward the industry as a whole. That being said, my main complaints are: Lighting changes which removed the more realistic feel to the game

The map and map pool changes that change and remove maps under the claims they aren't competitive but then the replacements are just as bad if not worse.

The ""balancing"" which is just Ubi speak for ""We want to change shit so it looks like we are doing something even when we know this won't do shit to fix the complaints surrounding a given issue""

The lack of any kind of solution to cheaters amd griefers

The constant changes of art style, the ui changes, and all the other visuals that only exist to keep having something to show off during updates since they don't add nearly as much real content as the use to.

But the biggest thing that bothers me, the removal of features because either Ubi doesn't know how to fix an issue or because they claim not many use it. Examples being, throw back grenades, change firemode, the breach charges giving an indicator as to what is and how much it can be broken when placing. All the extra abilities they have removed that made operators special, yet they leave others with no consistency on why or when something is removed."

10555,hard game i died alot :)
10556,gg
10557,"This game is very toxic, but if you can get past that this game is pretty good. Getting operators can be a challenge and a little bit of a grind, but in my opinion that makes the game more interesting. I don't really enjoy the match making system, but it's not as bad as other first person shooters. Over all I'd give this game an 80/100 for enjoyability. I'd give the sounds and music 100/100. I would also give the movement and mechanics a 90/100. All and all this is a very well made and polished game, but fuck ubisoft."
10558,"it is good 
"
10559,I miss the old siege :(
10560,"Im trash as I just started, but even so it kept my ADHD brain captivated for 4 hours in one go. Player base is.... eh but the game is great. Lots of options and learning for a beginner to 1st person shooters, but it runs smoothly, has many things to focus on and keep you on your toes. Don't really have any complaints about the game itself!"

10567,"very good game i love it.
"
10568,"A lot of modern-day 'realistic' FPS games struggle with enemy readability, with most players applying some sort of filter to help with the issue. This is one of those games. It absolutely ruins the experience."
10569,"It's a good game. The PvE is limited and mainly used for warm-up or training. The PvP is where the real action is. The community can be extremely toxic, but I've met some who are very friendly and helpful actually.
There is an option to block text and voice chat, so if the toxicity gets too much, you can always do that; however, you won't be able to hear or receive positive messages or callouts either.

Overall, I would recommend the game, especially if you have some friends to play with."

10597,"overall game has been fun over the past few years I've played it but recently they started to fuck it up, a big example is a mode called golden gun coming out, in the past it was the typical 5v5 1st team to 3 wins wins the game except there you had a 1 shot deagle and it was 1 map, now they made it so you choose from a pre selected set of operators, you have none of the operators tactical abilities, you can respawn, and 1st team to 75 kills wins, which in my opinion, is far less fun."

10625,"Rainbow Six Siege is a very well-made game, but there are many issues, with the community, and glitches/bugs. Originally, Siege was a game-changing multiplayer, with a fresh community and players ready to better themselves. Over the years, Siege has caught less traction in media, thus yielding a declining player count; tangential to the decline of Siege's popularity, the community has also become more toxic, unfriendly, and even dangerous to play with. The sum of these detrimental addends has created a game that is no longer fun, nor enjoyable for most players alike. The main issues are now cheaters and toxicity. Ubisoft has done very little to combat these issues, mainly deviating from helping the community with an Anti-Cheat system, but constantly focusing on patches/fixing smaller bugs. Notwithstanding, the community is still alive, with many great people and awesome players, but I believe that Siege is nothing short of a husk, something left of the great game that was ONCE Siege. With all said, I believe that new players CAN grow into the community, and CAN overcome many foibles, like the skill gap, and mixed and mainly toxic community et cetera. With everything WRONG pertaining to Siege, I believe the game will NEVER become mainstream, and an as-popular game henceforth, so I do NOT recommend buying/playing Siege anymore, as disheartening as that is (for some.) But by all means, if you are curious about buying the game, or even considering, take many aspects of the game's current state, in lieu of buying it blindly and idiotically."

10730,"This game is like your first love... you see her standing in the distance beautiful and gorgeous and you fall in love with her where time just stops at a standstill. Your heart racing and beating out of your chest. The only crappy thing that no one tells you when after time stops is when time starts again it picks back but only faster to make up for the time lost. You are stuck in a limbo, the same place, while everyone else moves around you carrying out their own lives happily, eventually finding decent jobs, and settling down with marriage and children. You on the other hand are still stuck in limbo land eyes stuck on the day when you first saw her... even though shes long gone.*

*been playing for 7 years alpha beta. When the game first game out woowee it was so fun trying to figure out strats with random people and bonding over a successful mission or when jumping out of windows to get kills wasn't a thing nor was spawn peeking. I remember playing house with bandit shot gun leaping out of masterbed and cleaning up the other team outside in the first year of siege it was fantastic. Another great expereince was meeting random friends from NY and climbing up in rank 5 stack hitting diamond before there was even charms to prove it. It was an amazing experience. Sure Siege is still fun like it used to be but if you didn't play back in the OG times you'll never know what it was truly like before it became a sweat factory.

Anyway thanks for reading. I hope you're doing well and having a blessed life. I don't know who you are but I <3 u."

It is also fun to play with friends but it may become frustrating if you are bottom fragging every freaking game due to the unbalanced match-up. In addition, I would like to thank their anti-cheat and anti-toxicity system because it seems to be working quite well; and fuck Ubisoft Connect launcher."
10867,I lose 90% of matches but it's fun to play
10868,"Good shooter game, doesn't require any extra special components so anyone can play it! Great game!

Just need cheater reduce program or something, cause it's full of them!

P.S. in a past few days, reduction of cheaters has dramatically increased which is very positive and I hope it will stay that way!"

10882,cool beans no cap
10883,normal game for play with your friends
10884,"this is a very entertaining and interesting game, ive had a lot of fun and a lot of people would enjoy it."
10885,جاممده
10886,4/10
10887,its a good game in general but there is a lot of unbanned cheaters lurking here
10888,pretty shit after devs ruined everything
10889,"This is probably my most played shooter of all time, but even i can't be biased against the terrible stuff this game does.

First, you have to unlock all of the characters, unless you get one of those fancy editions. if you buy the base game then unlocking all of the characters without just giving up and buying them might as well be impossible, after the 600 hours i have in this game i still have only barely over half of the cast, and they only increase in price.

Second, they do not have their updating priorities straight, pretty much every single update of this game they change the UI drastically for like no reason at all, and they recently added new knife animations, when there are pretty glaring bugs especially with the friend system. i swear they add more bugs per update than fix bugs. trying to get in a party with your buds takes like 5 minutes because some weird bug where the invites don't work, or you show up as ""away"" or even offline, and each time this happens everyone has to restart the game to make absolute sure that it'll fix it, and a lot of the time it doesn't. it doesn't help you have to go through ubisoft's yucky ""ubisoft connect"" bs.

Third, some of the characters aren't fun to fight or are sometimes just unfair, (which sucks more because you have to buy them), and i just wish they weren't in the game. yeah this point a bit more personal, but i think we can all agree that no one exactly enjoys fighting a clash or jackal.

It's sad because if it weren't for these 3 things then i would probably call this my favorite shooter, but it's just killed my enjoyment of the game, and i just wish i could call this a polished experience. but for now i can only reccomend this game if you aren't bothered by these things, i mean if it looks like you'd like it you probably will.

(and ubisoft, can you pwetty pwease make a new rayman game, it's all you need to do for people to respect you again like cmon legends was soooo gooood)"

10960,"It was good then it got bad then it got better and is now ""OK."" Ubisoft needs to stop pairing me, a person who should honestly be in gold or silver, against people that should be in diamond 2. Further, this game honestly needs 120hz servers to work with how fast people can move, and vaulting and falling animations aren't synced across devices in any way."

10964,"pros : requires you to use your brain and have tactical approaches to different situations, and trains your reflexes, no spray and pray bs.
cons : servers packet loss, sometimes you shoot first and visualy confirms it through the blood mist, but you die first, also bs recoil/spread on some guns, the smallest mistakes can lead to your instant death.

overall : 8/10"

The game is a really well made Tactical-Shooter Experience:
Not only do you have to communicate with your teammates to be able to beat the opponent team, but you will also need Map-Knowledge, Operator-Knowledge and so on.

Coming into this game is probably the hardest part since there are many smurf accounts and you are a newcomer to this. So remember beeing confused and getting killed a lot in the beginning.
When you slowly start to get better, that will fade tho.

While having Shooter-Experience from CS:GO or other shooters such as Apex or TF2, you will have a advantage of the aim, but thats just a tiny bit of what you need to win.

Having good aim can definitely give you a huge advantage in Gun Fights, but if you dont know where you can get flanked from, you will be terminated too.

All in all, this game is not a game for total Shooter-Beginners.
It's great with it's continues updates beeing brought to the game and it's variety and difference to every other shooter out there. 

As someone said to Far Cry 3:""It feels like Skyrim with guns"", this game felt like Valorant without Abilities.

(This is only my opinion to the game)

Have a great Day/Week or whatever you prefer.

"
11096,"Rainbow Six Siege.

The game undoubtedly has a feel of competitiveness. The weapons have a great feel to it and the maps are well designed. The idea of being able to destroy pathways into the way you want makes you feel like you have more control. There are a multitude of players (operators) to chose from each with their unique ability ranging from bear traps to night vision scopes; all contributing to the success of the team bit by bit. Skill is a huge factor of the game. It will take hours and hours of dedication to master your operator. However it is a fun experience. Toxicity is a problem, through every lobby one player with a mic trash talking every opposing player. Overall would recommend for a more competitive and strategic FPS fast-paced bomb game."

11100,"Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion
But I don't need the comfort of any lies
For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending
Rise
Oh, back when I was younger, was told by other youngsters
That my end will be torture beneath the earth
'Cause I don't see what they see, when death is staring at me
I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all
If you could pull the lever to carry on forever
Would your life even matter anymore?
Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion
But it's not what you signed up for
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
But there's this momentary beam of light
You don't have to wait those salty decades
To get through the gate, it's all in front of your face
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
But there's this momentary beam of light
I could cross the ocean in a fit of devotion
For every shining second, this fragile body beckons
You think you're owed it better believing ancient letters
Sure it's a calming notion, but it's a lie

I play competitively, not like pro, I just take ranked seriously so i can say some people are very respectful and nice, others are toxic, say racist things or just grief on their own team and kill teammates (yes even in ranked).  Overall i can say the game is fun, cheaters are not a big problem but you come across them sometimes.  I can say I would recommend this game, but I would highly recommend watching videos on it before you buy.  This game isn't for everyone, especially if you cannot handle the toxicity or vulgar behavior for some.

FYI, DO NOT buy this game if you are overly sensitive or get offended easily."

11240,"[h1]Updated review of this game and Ubisoft Support.[/h1]


I bought this game with the Year 2 Season Pass shortly after its release (a long time ago).

Downloaded the game. Started playing what felt like tutorial missions from ""Situations"" and changed some controls to my liking.

Played a few matches from ""Terrorist Hunt"" mode. Then started a ""Casual"" multiplayer game. The community seemed nice and all the missions and matches had ended normally. I was able to close the game without any kind of warnings / errors / bans or kick-outs.

Not long after that, I received an email from Ubisoft saying that I have been permanently banned for violating the ""Code of Conduct"". There was no mention of which part of the conduct.

Then I opened the game and it displayed a ban message for ""multiple cheating offences"" and locked out almost all of the features the game has to offer.

Unfortunately I had spent more than 2 hours just by playing those single-player tutorial missions from ""Situations"", so Steam rejected my refund request.

I contacted Ubisoft's customer support to know the detailed reason and their response was:

""This message is to inform you that following a decision from ourselves, we are no longer able to provide support to you. Any future cases you send will be reviewed and then closed, unless we deem support necessary. This extends to all our support services, and the chat system will no longer process you into the queue for assistance.""

I have been playing so many games for the past 18 years and this is the first game I have been banned on.

This was my experience of this game, now it is up to you to decide whether to buy it or not.

[h1]I rate it Ubisoft out of Ubisoft.[/h1]



Anyways, I was determined to know the reason of the ban even though they had partially ""Support-Banned"" my account.
After nearly 1 year of fighting with Ubisoft Support, they have made some things clear:

1. They have admitted that I did not use any third-party programs or modified the game in any way.

2. They actually did say that they are not accusing me of cheating / being a cheater.
Because I did not cheat and they obviously can not or does not want to provide any proof of anything.

3. This part of the conduct got me permanently banned: ""The following list of forbidden conduct gives examples of unacceptable behaviour, but should not be considered exhaustive.""
Now to be clear, the line ""should not be considered exhaustive"" basically means that Ubisoft can ban you just for opening the game, if they want to.

4. When I asked them about the above loophole, their response was: ""The game team are not liable to inform players of every action that can lead to a ban, as this is left to the player to make a fair judgement on what is considered fair use of the game.""
I did say many times that I consider all of my actions in the game to be fair but they decided to just ignore it. I do not know which action of mine was considered an unfair use of the game by Ubisoft.

5. Most important of all, they said that my ban was a manual / enforced ban.
Not an automated ban by BattlEye or FairFight. Or any other anti-cheat system this game may have.
Which confirms again that I have not used any hacks / cheats in the game. According to them, automated false-positive bans can be lifted but ""enforced"" (manual) bans can not be appealed. Therefore, my first appeal was denied and their policy does not allow players to make a second appeal.

So, do I know the exact reason of the ban? I do not and probably never will. But that is all I could get out of Ubisoft Support and I believe these are more than enough to prove that I have not cheated in this game in any way.
Their excuse to not tell me the exact reason for the enforced / manual ban was:

""We do not discuss bans for Rainbow 6 Siege and are under no obligation to provide proof or investigation findings into your ban"".

That was everything I could get from Ubisoft before their UK Team Lead decided to issue a full ""Support-Ban"" to my account:

""After careful consideration of your recent actions and interactions with support, we have decided to withdraw support for you. As a result, we will no longer respond to your cases and they will be closed"".

That was followed by a threat of permanent deletion of my level 59 Uplay account that has 60+ games:

""If you continue to do this, one of the outcomes of our disciplinary policy is potentially an account termination"".

I had been a huge fan of Ubisoft since its Prince of Persia series and later, the Assassin's Creed franchise. I have tons of very expensive collectibles and some really permanent things related to Assassin's Creed. I think at the time of the ban, my Uplay account level was 57, this was long before they made their profile leveling system laughably easy. This did not change their minds however, to make an exception. Here is the message from their UK Team Lead regarding this:

""I understand that you are clearly a very avid gamer and a longtime fan of Ubisoft. I appreciate that you have a high level of dedication to your account that I have only seen a small handful of players surpass, and I do commend you for that. Whilst I appreciate your dedication, I cannot make exception to any situation that has led to a permanent ban, this is not based on your personal circumstances, more the actions taken on the account.""

Now I can no longer get help or support for any of my other Uplay / Ubisoft games and any issues related to my account. If you ask me if all this was worth it, I will say yes. I did my best to get to the very bottom of this issue but I am not fool enough to risk losing my account along with all my games which are mostly expensive editions of AAA titles. This was however, a very sad experience for me to say the least.

Anyways, as you can probably see, they have taken full advantage of their End User License Agreement (EULA) in my case.

They went full Ubisoft. Never go full Ubisoft.

11246,"Siege is an amazing game, and certainly one the best current multiplayer FPS game in existence. It has been one of the only modern FPS games that has gripped and sustained my attention for years, and I constantly recommend it to anyone who will listen. 

I would describe it as such:  It has great team based game play with a fairly high skill curve, and requires pretty intimate knowledge of maps, vantage points, and complex lines of sight, but it also works for people who simply have good game sense and strong shooting ability. Every match plays out differently, and you will always be caught of guard by the creative (and always sneaky) ways in which your enemies will get the jump on you.

There are a ton of unique operators to use and learn, all of which have their own unique weapon sets and gadgets, and every season one or more are added to the roster, which constantly shakes up the meta and allows for new and unique team compositions and strategies. No matter what changes occur, however, the core gameplay remains relatively unchanged and it is the solid foundation of the game that keeps people playing in such large numbers after so many years. There simply aren't any comparable experiences available, which makes Siege so valuable in a space taken up by battle royals and run-and-gun shooters like Call Of Duty. 

In fact, Siege still stands today- many, many years after its launch- as one of the most original, innovative, and creative FPS games of the last 20 years, and I have no doubt that people will continue to play it until something else comes along that can learn from its strengths and fix its few weaknesses. So far, nothing really has. I played Tarkov for a while, but I really don't like survival games, and starting over in an endless loop in a survival simulator has never been my idea of fun. There are some titles that seem promising in similar ways to Siege- Ready or Not, GTFO- but I have yet to play those titles, so I really can't say if they will or will not live up to the hype. And,  unfortunately, other team based shooters simply don't appeal to me from a game play perspective, and certainly not aesthetically, either (valorant, Overwatch, etc). 

As some background to see if perhaps you have similar tastes and would also like Siege: I grew up playing Unreal Tournament, Doom, Quake and CS 1.6, and since the glory days of FPS games, nothing ever really clicked for me like I wanted it to. For a while, Destiny 2 PvP was a favorite of mine, as it brought back that highly energetic, competitive arena-esque FPS feeling for me, but I didn't really care for the grind required to access weapons and gear/weapon slot items, so I eventually stopped playing it. There are also many ""overpowered"" skills/abilities and weapons in Destiny 2, which makes keeping up with the meta and adjusting playstyles something that you basically have to do with every change to the game. Siege has many changes, but the core gameplay is always the same, and it always requires you to have good game sense, know the maps, and check your corners. 

With all that being said, just play Siege. It's still a great game, it has a dedicated developer base and fan base behind it, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. You can que up into a casual match in about 10 seconds on PC, and no matter what the outcome of the match, or what crazy team you get thrown in with, its always exciting, its always a way to build your skills, and you will eventually meet people you can click with who you can form real squads with later on if you want to try your luck against other skilled squads. 

For me, it will always be a 10/10 game, and nothing really comes close when it comes to modern FPS games. Talk to anyone who plays the game, and they will generally have mostly positive things to say. Sure, there are always people who spend all their time on forums, lamenting any changes to the game, or who live purely in nostalgia for ""the early days"" and talk about developers like they are the scum of the earth, but I have seen nothing but dedication and competency from the Siege team over the years ( Especially when compared to other developers and franchises who abandon their player bases entirely, put out entirely broken patches and updates, or simply shut down servers entirely in favor of forcing people to buy full priced sequels that are functionally the same game anyway). 

Anyway, see you when you come running down the wrong hallway and trip over a claymore while getting shot through a penny sized hole 2 floors above you."

Gunplay is another good part of this game every shot counts so you better aim well and be quick or die. The con that i have found is that every friend of mine and me had a game crash or something like that. I think that game this old should at least have good developed application with no lugs or bugs. 
 For conclusion I really like this game, its fun and nice with friends, because team spirit and tactics are the defining factors for the match."

COD became a little too repetitive for me and I wanted a fresh new fps and R6 provided. There's a huge learning curve but that's what makes it fun. It's a whole lot more tactical and fun because of all the underlying factors that makes R6, R6. I'm 7 years late to the party, but I fell in love with R6 and I would definitely recommend this game despite the huge learning curve."

11492,"I still don't know what's worse in this game: The community, or the core mechanics. I've been a console scrub since year 2. Game has seen very little improvement since then and the community has only gotten worse. 
But yes- I'm going to continue to spend hundreds of dollars and my precious time on this game. 
:) So much fun!"
11493,"TLDR: Predatory advancement system and gameplay that has only gotten worse since the release.
I used to own this game for console back when it first came out. I really enjoyed playing it. However the game has become predatory with its pay walls. If you are new to the game you will have no operators to choose from. They will all be locked behind point buys or pay walls. All of them. It takes 10,000 in game points to unlock one, just one, operator unless you are willing to pay real money to unlock them early. Maybe you're thinking you can just grind points in terrorist hunt or solo play to unlock an operator? You can, but one match will get you approx 35 points. So you will need to play 286 games before you can unlock just one of the operators. This would be ridiculous even if this was a free to play game, but its not.
Gameplay has changed drastically in the last few years since I played it. Customizing recruits (the only option for people that have not paid for another operator or play 286 games) is impossible from what I can tell. You get 3 base line weapons and 15 seconds to choose which you want, even in solo play. Select fire is gone, so no more engaging at range with a gun that'll be decent at close range as well. All these fancy high tech gadgets for the most elite operators in the world and they don't even get a selector switch on their rifles?
My limited multiplayer gameplay was full of toxic people that spend most of the match slinging racial slurs and griefing me for only being able to use a recruit.

11698,VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS! But please buff Zofia's ak
11699,Very good game but palse is a baldy ass mf
11700,don't do this to  yourself
11701,I love the actual mechanics of the game and the gunfights are amazing. The only thing that seems bad about the game is definitely how much Ubisoft doesn't pay attention to bugs and also the toxic community that never gets bans
11702,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.

There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.

More tips:
-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match.
-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them.
-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides.
-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map.
-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style.
-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.
-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency."

11739,"This game is the definition of trash. This game wouldn't be a good buy even if it was free. 

The only players left are the hackers and the try-hards. Even in casual there are hackers everywhere. There is a reason that all of the content creators left this game, the hacking problem has been around since day 1 and Ubi and battleye have not done a whole lot to combat it. There are no new players coming into the game, probably because the onboarding changes that were supposed to make the game better for new players have taken over 2 years to create and consists solely of adding videos to the game menus, wow great work guys.

All content creators associated with this game dropped it like a bad habit, I suggest others do the same because this game is nothing more than a cesspool or hacking and toxicity anymore and ubisoft is never going to fix it, even 7 years later, just empty promises all around."

11859,"The game is fun if you get passed the learning curve, however, the community can sometimes be harsh on new players. Game-play is really fun and competitive and will test your skills. The only thing I do not like is that you don't start with any operators. You have to buy them with renown or rainbow 6 credit. You can buy them with renown, however, that would really take some time. I would just get it on Xbox Game Pass just because you would actually start the game with some operators or you could just buy it directly from ubisoft and get some sort of operator deal pact. If you are willing to put the time to learn and get some operators I would highly recommend this game. Every match plays differently and ubisoft is always updating the game."

You'll never really beat this game, know all there is to know, the longer you play it, the harder it gets.

Learning every way to manipulate a map, kind of like submissions manipulate the body.
Map control > advance position to gain more map control, cut of escapes, execute a plant (or kill everyone).

11949,"Remember when sledge had a 1700rpm submachine gun secondary weapon with an acog scope attached and the community hated it? Ubisoft never learned from that mistake and just about every operator added after 2017 either had a extremely high rate of fire primary or secondary turning the game from a tactical shooter into a flick fest devoid of all skill. It's not only the gunplay that they decided to lobotomize but the operators and their abilities too, long gone are the days of positioning and timing, welcome the new age of pressing a button at no cost to yourself to completely inconvenience everyone on the entire enemy team no matter their position or status! Thank you ubisoft for ruining a truly unique game (who's gap in the genre has yet to be replaced) so that you could cannibalize it into a hero shooter E-sport with low time to kill."

11984,"I have played this game for around 60 hours as of writing this review, I should have wrote a review sooner because I believe that this great game deserves recognition. R6 is my favorite FPS game out there ive play a decent bit of the halo games, ive played TF2 and ive played a couple of minutes of fortnite before deciding that it was a well full of despair and deduction doomed to fail one day and then i played rainbow six siege Two years ago i bought this game on my playstation and fell in love with it as soon as i got a pc this was liek the 3rd game i bought yes this game without any sale is 20$ i do think its worth that for the ammount of enjoyment ive got from playing this beautiful game It may be the bes use of 20$ ive ever spent. It is Worth your money and it is worth your Time.

11988,Great game made peepee hard
11989,"I am a 56 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 9 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
11990,fun

12027,"This game has the worst community of players of any game ive ever played. Everyone you will encounter while playing this game should be banned for toxic chat. Before every game you play, report all players, even teamates, get that out of the way then mute everyone, mute chat, and then uninstall the game."
12028,game is good. i am good
12029,its bad
12030,Dead. Puts you with deaf mute bots or people who communicate as much as. Seems to be run by aliens or something. Poorly designed. It's as if they want you to be miserable and uninstall. Can't even turn start scene back on if skipped it first time. And the matches seem to be designed for people with even less attention span than a ADHD MK Ultra victim. Other than that it's fun if you're looking for a multiplayer that plays like a single player.
12031,funny before not really funny anymore
12032,fun game at first you might rage a bit but once you get betterit tends to get a lot more fun and a fun thing to do with friends is to 1v1 them in a private deathmathc

The latest releases need to have more single player involvement to allow all players to immerse themselves in this amazing experience."
12039,ew
12040,"The game itself is amazing. Tons of cool operators you can easily unlock that each have cool gadets that help you win the round. The biggest killer to this game and its really just a stake through the heart is that the rounds are heavily unbalanced. Quickmatch you can easily be put against someone who has more than 10x your hours, and will proceed to dominiate over you time and time again, without giving a chance to get better at the game itself. New comer gamemode is no diffrent, you get constantly killed endlessly with your teamates either newbies themselves, and not helping protect the objective or trolls who find it amusing to kill you over and over again getting buddies to join in. This review was from a solo players perspective, but this game as of 6/24/22 is NOT worth the monney. Id recomend getting this game on xbox game pass before you purchase it here."

12053,This game is very difficult but rewarding for tenacious players with competitive spirit.
12054,Just a bad FPS. I have many times more hours on console than pc and I can say I never really enjoyed this game at any point. I feel like for a competitive FPS it just fails compared to others in terms of gameplay. I would put this game on the same wave as Call of Duty. Take that as you will.

12064,"Dumpster fire of a game if you even get out of matchmaking to play it. Enjoy being vote kicked even though you:

- Are charismatic and kind, with an anti-elitist attitude
- Have voice chat off if nobody is in voice chat
- Are platinum in ranked
- Have been playing since the closed alpha
- Amassed thousands of hours on multiple consoles
- Are frequently wiping the entire enemy team (5 players)

That last one is important because your team will vote kick you if you fail to do that (true for all platforms). Devs need to grow a spine among other things and learn not to take feedback from literal children. You read that right, enjoy listening to prepubescent kids shriek the n-word, their soundcloud meme rappers, and experience how incoherent/ineffective their trash talking is. Shrieking without the n-word, I guess? Vote-kicking isn't necessary if it's not even going to get you a replacement for the remaining length of the match, especially in ranked. Matchmaking easily takes 15 minutes from main menu to spawn.

This fossil of a game is 7 years old apparently, stop trying to live glory days that ceased to exist 6 years ago. I'm sick of greasy necked dark room dwellers earraping me ""THEYRE HACKING/LAGGING/CHEATING"" like I'm supposed to let out a guttural ""YEAH THEY WOULDNT WIN IF IT WASNT FOR HACKING/LAGGING/CHEATING"" in response. Move on and play the next hottest competitive shooter of the year, cuz this ain't it chief."

12226,Was the best FPS ever made but they added too many operators and made the learning curve way too steep. You could still consider it to currently be the best game ever but with rampant cheating its also once again one of the worst. Furthermore constant changing of the game may ruin what you liked about it in the first place which is the case for me.

12235,"if the game were to be released how it is today i think it would be a major success. however, after seeing how the game has progressed over the past 7 years, its hard to appreciate this version. seeing the dev team trying to relate to the playerbase has been utterly embarrassing. also not a fan of politics or real world debated issues in video games, and this dev team has started implementing that. literally nobody cares. thats not what this game is about. the new ui compared to the old is horrendous. cheating is still as prevalent as ever, possibly worse. it took over 3 years for a new map. since then theyve been releasing 1 operator every season as opposed to 2, and have some very questionable gadgets that look straight ripped from games like valorant. the game siege that was supposed to be realistic to real world technology has far left that in the past with operators like sens, azami, iana, and melusi. im also all for diversity in video games, but compare the first operators in this game to the current ones and you can see where the devs mind is at; it just adds the unrealisticness. 

i used to watch a lot of r6 content creators since this game came out, and all of them have quit except for a few because of how low the engagement is. every healthy game out there has a strong viewerbase to it. the only thing doing well is the esports section, and even that has fallen off. player counts are surprisingly high, but i wouldn't be surprised if half of them were secondary accounts for cheating. 

for the actual game itself. it requires a massive amount of time to be put into it in order for you to start getting value in games. map knowledge, operator knowledge, and practical mechanic sense is all just as important as actual aim. expect to be utter trash until after putting in like 25 hours. then you can ""enjoy"" the game.

conclusion: id recommend this game for only new players who want to suffer. sure it's different and unique, but just know it had much greater potential to it. gamebreaking bugs and poor dev decisions forced a large number of players to leave in the past, so dont be surprised when it happens again."

12247,"If you would'be bought this game back from release to around operation health, I would have 1000% recommended this game. But gubisoft has destroyed it and completely ignored its entire community for years. Fixing things that aren't broke, reworking every map in the game. Making changes to attackers/defenders that didn't need it, that nobody asked for.
My last straw is when they tricked me to change my profile picture. Requiring a ""multi-factor authentication"" to change it. Only to realize afterward, they've removed custom profile pictures. ""Safe and inclusive environment"" - the company that made a counter terrorist shooter that has a scene where a university is attacked, and you can play as the terrorists."

12269,"When I first bought Rainbow Six Siege: Starter Edition (back in October 22, 2017), this game was something phenomenal. It wasn't a ""tactical"" shooter, which was promised back in E3, but it was close to what was presented in the concept. The story of the White Masks was also interesting, and how the tutorials made us, new players, from recruits to experienced players.

The game itself brought together many people, whom turned into a long-lasting friend group. Amazing seasons came out with actual original content, characters and maps. New HUDs, which still somehow kept the same vibe of the old HUD. It was all going well, until the old team left and the new ""Team B"" arrived. We all had high hopes for something ""greater"", but it all turned into what we have today.

This is not a semi-tactical shooter anymore, this is just another shooter filled with LGBTQ+ characters, with a dramatic/tragic backstory for no reason whatsoever, to make them seem ""special"".

12323,"I love this game. I have over 2000 hours on Xbox, and a little over 50 on PC. The idea of the game is similar to Valorant or CSGO, with it being a 5 vs 5 FPS, without the prep faze buy mechanics that these games include. Rainbow is a lot of fun, but it does come with some bugs. IP leaking and D Dosing are real problems, and PC has some issues with Cheating and Hacking. However, this does not change my love for the game, and I really recommend it for someone looking for an FPS with these types of Mechanics. (PS, it requires a lot of game knowledge and time to get good). Hope you enjoy!"

in short: the game is team centered and very fun"
12329,"Ranked is so broken for solo queue. I have a stupid amount of hours on this game, and rank killed the vibe for me. I'll try hopping back in each season, only to have people grief, leave mid-game, or just not care about winning in ranked. 

Until thats resolved (how many years has the game been out?!), I don't recommend this game to any serious FPS players unless they have a 3+ squad to roll with."

also another thing is that the siege community is so toxic and racist which sucks! and on top of that the amount of hackers now a days just makes the game not fun anymore, id recomend to not buy this but then the possitives is that its probably the best tactical shooting game."

You can pick up and play. But the people that play this game PLAY this game. Even if I had an aim bot I'd still have trouble. Its a high skill ceiling game and some players can pull off some impressive stuff. So impressive I, without fail, report them for hacking. 

The main problem is the complete lack of teamwork in public lobbies. I've been playing on and off for years and have only experienced one match where people talked in game. And it was only because I already knew them.

Rainbow Six Siege should be something everyone plays. But its tough to get into cuz the major aspect, teamwork, just ain't there anymore.

It still gets updates and is supported years past its release. If I had even one friend to play this with it would be so much better."

12483,"when rainbow six came out i didnt have internet fast enough to multiplayer.
i built up this rage of unsatisfaction for the logest time.
Now, with faster internet, i have played tom clancy rainbows six for 1842 hours as of now.
I can say with 100 perdcent certainty, i did have a lot of fun with it until the updates started rollin around changing the ui, makin it look like a squarspace website, or a fortnite game, not a tactical shooter!
I am severly disapointed in Tom clancys Team. Once they removed the ability to be able to see other peoples ranks i lost a lot of intrest to play. Because it would always let me know what im up against. and then when you kill a high level player every now and then, you are feeling amazing. Now you can not see ranks in matches anymore. I am annoyed with the way the comunity has changeing.

12504,"My 10 steps to Siege
Step 1:
Buy Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege having no prior knowledge about the game.
Step 2: 
Start improving being able to win a few rounds.
Step 3:
Become addicted and having your ego increase while playing Unranked.
Step 4:
Reach level 50...
Step 5:
Play your first ranked game.
Step 6: 
Enter your first building on attack during your first ranked game.
Step 7:
Get headshot from 3 walls away from a guy that hasnt touched grass in 10 years.
Step 8: 
Realize how bad you are.
Step 9: 
Get absolutely skull fucked.
Step 10:
Never play ranked again."

Reoccurring bugs and glitches which requires restarts, content not being accessible despite having a stable connection and servers kept interfering with gameplay and constantly releasing content catering to the wrong audience like having operators with LGBT backstories. It's honestly insulting to Tom Clancy and his past works by going in the direction that the game is currently heading."
12514,"I want to love this game, but Ubisoft mainly fixates on the cosmetics which obviosly cost money and only money. The game has a HORRIBLE bug issue and hacker issue that is kinda rampant, the only people I see get banned are people getting banned for saying slurs and death threats. But overral the operators can still be bought with in game currency thankfully."

I have also had several games where a bug occurs and I get almost instantly kicked from a ranked and cannot rejoin for whatever reason and loose elo for it and cannot play for a period of time even though it isn't my fault. I have emailed Ubisoft about this several times and have gotten no response. Unless you play with a full squad when playing ranked, and are okay with losing elo to cheaters on other team, I highly do not recommend."

12655,"This is NOT a tactical shooter, it's some sort of superhero title riddled with Ubisoft's political messages that are designed to divide and cause arguments.   It also takes ages for any action to happen and then it's over within two minutes. There's also a high number of reported cheaters.

Their forum moderators ban and libel their customers with ""homophobia"" just for challenging a political movement, not any sexuality.  It's the equivalent of accusing somebody of racism for challenging political racialist movements.

This is what Ubisoft are about."
12656,"Very cool shooter, which allows you to have tons of fun, if you are up to the rather slow, tactical gameplay. 
It runs incredible, and even tho the game is slow, it can give you a wonderful kick at times.

12676,"Should I play Rainbow Six Siege if I like military simulators? 
For better or worse, the Tom Clancy vibe is mostly gone from Rainbow Six Siege. It’s less dark and gritty and more vibrant and colorful, mostly for gameplay purposes. Siege is a first-person shooter at heart, the tactics and gadgets augment the shooter mechanics. 

If you’re looking for a game like Squad or ARMA, Siege likely isn’t for you. It was always less of what you wanted in a game from the beginning and is rapidly becoming less of what you want over time. 

Should I play Rainbow Six Siege if I like military simulators and have played before?
Yes! At its core, Siege is a great game, even if it isn’t bang-on the Tom Clancy branding. If you’re a fan of military simulators, Siege is likely going to be a little fast-paced for your liking, but if you’ve played before you know what you’re getting into.

There are still tons of tactics and gadgets to immerse yourself in — even if the darkness and grittiness that was there from the original games wasn’t all the way there at launch, and is rapidly fading. 

Should I play Rainbow Six Siege if I like first-person shooters and am new to the game?

It’s hard to say yes here. Ultimately, Siege is a great experience but is not friendly to new or inconsistent players. There are massive maps, tons of gadgets, and dozens of unique interactions between the operators that aren’t explained well in supplementary content from Ubisoft. 

New players are going to have dozens of hours of headaches before they feel like they really understand what’s going on. The players that have been playing Siege have been playing for upwards of seven years. That’s a lot of experience and work to try and bypass. It is unforgiving, and you’re forced to learn quick or be very bored with the game. 

It’s impossible to recommend R6 to any new player that doesn’t have a lot of patience and a lot of spare time. If you’re a solo player it’s impossible. With friends it’s possible, but you’ll arguably have more fun in another game."

12813,i got good aim
12814,fun with friends to play it with
12815,"crap game with ignorant devs, don't play this game they wont fix any problems you have and just want your money."
12816,good
12817,"Ok I like this game but it get's crazy.  I was playing with my friend and I was just chilling waiting for people to walk into my trap and checking cameras, POW a huge hole got put in the wall in front of me but my friend killed one of them.  With one guy left I saw my teammate die in front of me, next thing you know my friend dies so I back up in the corner when my other to teammates died from out of nowhere suddenly bullets where going through the roof from above. this man was the ghost of Kyiv, he was like a spirit, a demon you can't see them then your dead.  A hole got put in the wall to the left of me and I peaked heard my trap go off meaning they where there and suddenly, in less than a blink of an eye, a fraction of a second, in one heart beat, he stabbed me in the back. I don't even know how he got there but I didn't hear him. There was no evidence that he even moved.  Overall 9.9/10"
12818,great game.
12819,this shit ass asf makes me wanna die even more than i already do

12839,"grast game + cancer ppl = fun
"
12840,"As of the moment I only have a couple of hours into the game but I already have a ton of problems with it.
Firstly the audio is just terrible, you can't tell how far someone is from you, if they're above or below, you'll be just around a wall from someone who was full sprinting and it'll sound the same as any other movement in the game, doesn't get louder.
Additionally there is a bug that continues to happen until the end of your game, ear rape would be putting it kindly, I couldn't hear anything other than the sound of a gun continuously firing, I'd prefer to have a 4 man shooting a negev in my head during warmup on CS:GO than whatever I was hearing. Edit: It only stops for while you're in that match, and will persist until you restart the game.
Second, the ADS time is terrible, we're supposed to be trained soldiers capable of defending or attacking a point of interest, yet it takes you a full second and a half to put the gun to your shoulder and eye? I don't expect snap straight to ADS but I expect it to be there within the second considering that you can tell distance in the game, camping becomes more apparent so having a quicker ADS would at least let you challenge the person. I've had to walk/crouch/sprint while adsing to just even bother to fight back.
Third, the Hip fire is just horrible, what's the point of a crosshair displaying the radius if it isn't correct? I've watched my bullets hit shit that was almost off screen while standing still, not to mention the moment I fired the bullet hadn't even hit the wall within that time frame, at 10 feet away there is no time delay for a bullet to hit a wall, it'd register faster than the eye could perceive.
Fourth, if you come into the game expecting to be able to enjoy the content you see on youtube where you attempt to attack/defend a point of interest, rappel down walls, etc, prepare to be sorely disappointed because the CASUAL/Unranked isn't until level 10... Yes the casual mode is locked until you've played enough deathmatch to hit level 10, honestly I find that to be the most stupid idea I've seen in a FPS game, it makes me feel like you got this idea from League of Legends where they force to you play bots until you hit a certain level.
Honestly I can't recommend this game just yet, I'll continue trying it to see if maybe once I hit 10 I'll at least enjoy the game a bit more, but for the current time I regret having hit the 2 hour mark and not being able to refund the game."

12862,this game is very cash money
12863,"This games, where do I start. I started playing this game years ago, starting off as just a wee young lad back when operation health was all the buzz! It looked like such a fun game, I remember the youtube videos I would watching before I even played the game. Staying up at night watching youtubers such as H20 Delirious and CaRtOoNz. Those videos were what really got me hooked, in fact, I can barely remember the one scene in one of their youtube videos that instantly made me get up from my bed and ask my parents for the game. All I can remember is someone was playing as Doc as the last man standing when they used the stim to give themselves extra health and rushed the enemy team in a last ditch effort, and it was successful. Seeing this astonished me and gave me the hope to do something even close to that. It gave me a goal, a purpose, a reason for everything that I waas about to do. That was just the beginning. That is what planted this seed, what laid this egg that was bound to hatch, and let me tell you.. That caterpillar blossomed into the most beautiful butterfly ever imagined. Throughout years of switching between consoles, friend groups, and even school years. One thing had stayed the same, my favorite game. Siege was always something I was willing to play, of course there were ups and downs and of course I wasnt the best at the game, I never even made it to diamond. But despite all the trials and tribulations, I would always go back to playing siege eventually. Although in recent years that's stopped. I'm playing new games, having different experiences as I grow a learn things. I am making new friendships, relationships, and meeting new people in general. I've changed a lot from the days when i would watch H20 Delirious play this game in its early stages and so has siege. As the game grows, so do I. This game has had its fair shares of troubles such as on console where there would be multiple games in a row where you are getting kicked off your own internet for just being good at the game, to losing streaks with friends just because you were bad at it. But it was always fun and it did keep me invested for many years. Although I am no longer as consistent with playing this game as I used to be, I think I still enjoy it just as much. Siege has been a big part of my growing years and I wouldnt have it any other way. I truly do enjoy this game and I hope the experience I had with this game is relatable to even one person who has played the game."
12864,"CANCER

12865,The best shooting game I have ever played
12866,"It feels unfortunate to leave my review for Siege as a negative. I have loved and played all of the R6 games in the series as a huge fan of SWAT based game play. R63 is like one of my favorite titles played in the series, and I was excited to pick it up Siege when they announced it would contain many features that were present in the series. The strategy behind the gameplay made it feel so different from your generic shooters. I do think at a base level the game and the concepts are amazing. The maps are fairly interesting and try very hard to keep wall destruction, grappling and tight entry points a main focus to stay true to Siege's unique gameplay. I love the idea behind it, why the thumbs down? Team Killing. It was far more common than I expected it to be. In a game that is dedicated to teamwork, you opponents can decide to kill you without any real punishment. Reporting does next to nothing, you still usually lose your current game and move to the next match hoping it doesn't happen again. You didn't get shot at spawn? Well now someone doesn't like your placement of a wall or device and they shoot you because ""you're griefing."" Maybe one of your teamates is an idiot and walks in front of your fire, now you're flagged for team killing and put your team at a disadvantage based on an accident. It is just such an unhealthy mechanic to have in a small group competitive multiplayer game. It's funny when you shoot your sibling in the face playing a coop game, it's not great when it wastes everyone's time and efforts. The only thing people recommend is to find players outside of the game to team up with... Also talking about reporting doing nothing; hacking is such a massive issue in the game. Its not crazy to die from random angles, but when someone tracks your movements through layers of walls during a kill cam you do not feel great playing against them for the rest of the match. I have encountered the hacking issue far less than the team killing. It's also very hard to recommend the game to new players. There is an extreme learning curve introduced in the game. The only tutorials you have will let you understand the basic concepts of the games, but learning a map in and out can take time. It can be very easy to get lost in a map if you're new, let alone learn about what walls to barricade and what operators to bring. You also likely have very few operators because Ubi does not sell operators by the year and not a lot of players will invest heavily for a full roster into a brand new game. I will change my stance if team killing gets addressed (it won't), but I cannot recommend a competitive game that can be ruined so easily."

12926,its seige what can u expect of course i wouldnt recommend it for other players
12927,"Unique competitive experience, with responsive and snappy controls, hitscan weapons, make for awesome gunplay. However, if you have ambition and want to compete in higher tiers of ranked, be comfortable knowing that there are hackers in every other match, and know that you can't trust you audio - it's far too buggy."
12928,"So I've been playing this game on and off since the release and boy let me tell  you it is a 1000% better then when it was released. Its one of the only games that I have been consistently able to come back to update after update.
That being said if you're new to the game don't let people discourage you from learning the maps and ops cause they're are a lot in both categories. Each op is pretty unique in their own way whether its a breaching op, trap op, intel op...etc
Then when it comes to maps the majority of them are great maps and fun to play on but there are also garbage maps as well.....looking at you Yacht....
Continuing off the map subject. This game is like 80% map knowledge and knowledge of what ops are capable of so do not get discouraged if your terrible when you start off. I have also 900hrs in this game and i still have my shit days.
Overall this is definitely one of my favorite games of all time and will continue to be that way.
Year 7 is a big year in terms of content and longevity. There are 3 new maps coming this year 2 of which are already out. 1 being made specifically for ranked/casual and the other being a TDM map. The last one will be coming during season 3 and will be another ranked/casual map which is huge cause siege hasn't seen a new map in around 3 years. Furthermore there is a complete ranked overhaul coming in Y7S3 as well as new ops every season, So you're definitely getting your moneys worth in content.
TBH Try drugs they're probably less addictive then this game is..."
12929," this game is so goooooooooooooood
"
12930,"I've played this game on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation. Its a great competitive FPS game if you are looking for that. It is nothing like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Feels more like a CSGO or Valorant without the buying in between rounds or having special powers. Community can be very toxic though so don't be surprised. Game has a lot to learn when you first start and they have lots of updates with changes."

Me: Kills him.

Me: Asks why they killed me?

But when I get higher than plat 1 anymore its just high level closet toxic cheaters or blatant spinning cheaters. Games good if they fix some cheater problems and notice more community problems and rerelease skins that were older would make this game grow a good amount for new players.

12960,"Rainbow Six Siege where to begin well - 

between console and PC i can say ive got about 2k-2.5k hours on siege because of this here is what i can tell you so far in 7 years of playing

Pros-
- updated regularly like maybe 2 weeks ish to fix bugs and other issues 
- every 3 months new season 1 new operator and new guns or maps depending 
- teamwork is perfect if your wanting to play a strategy game with your friends 
- there is 5 man que you can play solo, 2 players, 3 players, 4 players, 5 players all in 1 team 
- there is a training grounds with easy mode normal mode and veteran 
- there is a ranking system from copper- diamond then there champion level if you want to go really up there
- there is a unranked system if you want to relax and chill out although some will take it just as serious as ranked 
- theres a casual mode for anyone trying to relax and just vibe and learn the game or make new friends 
- can communicate with a mic if you want to callout and help the team 
- there is an all chat and a team chat if you want to talk to the enemies or your team through text 
- different gameplay/ style compared to other games you can lean and hipfire lean and even barricade breach charges and all 
- you have 3 different gamemodes secure area, defend bombs, capture a hostie, and death match, 
- if a tk happens you can give them a tringle and they wont be able to tk again without consequences 
- new gamemodes and events are added during holidays and other special occasions
- yes there are micro-transactions and skins along with alpha packs you get for free playing and a battle-pass and yes you can get most skins in the game for free elite skins are not included but i could be wrong 
- there is also a new shooting range to help better improve aim and ability to know damage with each weapon if your into this on a more detailed level 
-community challenges are also a thing to earn renown to unlock operators or alpha packs to get more skins


Cons- 
-cheaters can literally come up with crazy ideas when cheating so watch out and yes the anti cheat and ubi struggle with banning them 
- toxic teammates can be at random 
- you might get the same lobbies alot depending time of day 
- might have to deal with people not cooperating and helping the team
- might have to deal with audio issues and major bugs 
- might never get the bug you have fixed so be prepared to deal with it till you find a work around or a new season fixes it
- need ubisofts launcher however think this is good because you can level up on Ubisoft and gain cosmetics and other event items added from there other games to this one

12975,I guess its about time I review this game after almost 700 hours and several years playing it on and off. Siege overall really deserves a meh option but sadly steam does not allow that so this is the best I can do. I've played this game since I believe year 4 and have made many amazing memories with my friends playing this game. I've made many new friends as well that have come and gone as we all grew as players and people. This game has had its rough points though I had to take an almost 2 year break not to long before I picked it up here again recently. There still are all the usual issues that come with a Ubi game such as hackers and random bugs that take years to get fixed. Overall though with a good group of friends on a late summer night this game can be the most fun you have ever had.
12976,really fun game dont play it ever plesase.
12977,Salt reigns here. Kill or be Kill is the rule of the game and that includes team mates.

12985,"Was one of the best/worst competitive shooters out there. If you're still on the fence, it goes on sale quite often for a very good price, but be warned the community is not friendly to new players. You will be team killed in most cases when you don't know your operators meta. To combat the team killing, a new reputation system was implemented which has done more harm than good. The same toxic players that would kill you now instead stand in front of you waiting for you to shoot your weapon and intentionally walk into your bullets to intentionally hurt your reputation. All it takes is 3 toxic people to be in a group together to completely ruin a match and it has genuinely hurt this game in the last few months. I love this game and have put in over a 1000 hours on console along with my 300+ on PC, but in its current state it's hard to recommend this to new players because they will likely be punished for being new. Even if you are a returning player, I can't rightfully recommend it to you either. There has also been a ridiculous amount of cheaters in not only casual lobbies, but unranked/ranked lobbies are also infested with them. I'm afraid to say this game is potentially reaching it's end and the peak of it has most certainly been left behind us."
12986,"WOULD REKOMEND 

i just love the felling when i relise that i suck at the game and become suicidal because of my fiends the shout the n-word all tthe time. when i sya that they are right i conteplante the cosmos and what i have done to derserv this. Ps i will kill my self in an week"

13101,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.

There are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc.. And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets.

More tips:
-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match.
-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them.
-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides.
-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map.
-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style.
-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.
-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency.

Rainbow Six Siege
When we look at video games at times we tend see them with glitches, bugs, lags spikes, and droped frames. So, when we start to think about the designers who made this, we think they had did a bad job at it. Although what most people don’t know about designing video games is that they take forever to make; for example, the game Red Dead Redemption 2 is coming out in the next few weeks and that game has been in the making for the past 11 years and there are still hundreds of bugs in the game. So, when looking at redesigning video games and how they could improve; one will be the game Rainbow Six Siege. Where if I could redesign this game from the ground up it could easily become one of the top 5 games in the world if played right which would be fixing hit registration, reducing toxicity, stopping hackers, redesign operators from the ground up, and to add more Limited Times Modes (LTMS ) in the game.
First off what is Rainbow Six Siege? Rainbow six siege is a FPS video game where anything can be destroyed, there is only one life, and having communication is key to succeed in this game. It is a 5 on 5 player base where the first team to win 3 rounds wins the game. They’re two different aspects when playing this game which are attackers and defenders. Also, each operator brings something unique that the person can use.
So, when redesigning this game from the ground up, one of the most important redesigns I would do is to fix Hit Registration. Hit Registration is when in a game where you the person aims at a person and you shoot the person; and the person who got shot gets a disadvantage by losing health or dying. Also, a player body is the outline of where you can get shot. For example, shooting someone in the foot, hand, and back counts as hit registration. So, one of the problems that there is in this game currently that stops it being one of the top games in the market is the Hit Registration because, they are times were when playing the game it looks like you are shooting the person and blood is coming out but nothing happens and that person turns around and kills you. Another example would be that when you are in the game and you get knocked down to the floor, which is the stage before death “the down but not out stage” where you must be revived to comeback, and at times when getting shot you can see the blood come out but you don’t die or you shoot a down person but they don’t die. I had found multiple solutions to solve this which will be first off would be to add a weapon miss alignment system which is a system where you aim sight is what you shoot because in the current version of the game it doesn’t exist. Say this you are shooting this person directly in your vision but if die by him and see the kill cam it shows that you had missed all your shots. This will dramatically increase Hit Registration and frustration in this game. Another solution that I had was bumping up the frames per second in the game for console to 60-70 frames a second instead of 30-60 frames a second. Where you lag at times when interacting in the game and it freezes you and screws you over in the end. Also adding more servers in this game will play a key factor for hit registration because currently there in only one server in the game and it to many people playing it which at times freezes or lags the game messing up the hit registration.
Another redesign that I would do to this game to improve and succeed more is to reduce the amount of toxicity there is and to stop hackers. This is one of the biggest problems right now in Rainbow Six Siege because when playing this game on PC there is a lot of hackers that makes the game boring, and frustrating. Examples of this would be people teleporting throughout the map and killing everyone, having a shield equip and they turn on wall hacks (which is you know where everyone is at through walls) and they run around the map shooting everyone, and people can’t do nothing because they are invincible. Also, Toxicity is where people in the game who treat their teammates with disrespect like saying inappropriate and racist comments to them, killing their own team mates, shooting them, downing them and so on. For this to be fix is first off is when if a person wants to play the competitive mode of siege they will need to do two step verification system. Where that person had to put in the number or extra email to their account and if that person gets caught cheating he will get banned from his account. The thing is about this system is that after the person account go banned they cannot make another account with that email or number because the system will trace any associated things with the previous account and will ban it and those hackers cannot get anything back even if they bought items on the game. Also to stop hackers in the game once they get caught cheating I would make it for the first time that they could never play the competitive mode again and only casual with a 15 day ban from there account. Then if they get caught again they will become permanently ban from the game. If that person ever wants to the play the game again they will need to start from scratch. Also, to deal with toxicity I will want to make system where if a person team kills in the game everyone else on the team can forgive the teamkill and that person will not be reported for toxicity or if he teamkills again from the round he won’t get kick from the game. Believe me this happens a lot. Then for toxicity the will want to make a system where for the first offense the person is banned from the completive mode( Ranked) for the day, the second offense the person is banned for the day, third offense banned for a week, then a month, then if it happens again the person will be become banned for the next 4 months.
So, let’s talk about Attackers and Defenders and how they work. So when attacking it will be you and 4 other teammates trying to go into the building and neutralize a bomb and take down the enemy’s. For example, you bring a Ying on your team who can throw this grenade that flashes anybody who is in the room that the grenade is toss into. Once flashed people can go into the room plant the bomb and take down anyone who was in the room while they were blinded.
As for defenders it will be you and four other teammates having to battle out any opposing threat and the Defenders must protect the bomb at any cost. An example of this is you bring a Jager on your team who ability is to put down 3 Active Defense Systems where he can destroy any type of grenade. Such as if Ying or Buck try to throw a grenade it will immediately get destroyed helping the defenders.
So another way to make this game better in its future years will be balancing operators, redesigning operators, and adding more Limited Time Modes(LTMS).  But what Rainbow had done to balance her out was reducing damage to her gun, adding Signiant recoil, take away one of her gadgets, and remove her impact grenades. Now today when looking at her data she is in the middle of win rate and pick rate. Also to make this game more attractive to other people and for the game to be played a lot more will be adding more LTMS because it brings something different from the casual play. This will increase attraction because when looking at Fortnite or Call of Duty at least once a week a new LTM comes out or an item keeping the game fresh.

"
13295,"Some of the worst matchmaking in a game I've ever seen. I'm a usual high gold low plat player.... I am being put AGAINST high plat to diamond players on a consistent basis. This is usually while Solo queuing, and I also usually get put up against 3 or even 5 stacks, while my team is all solo with maybe 2 mic's. I wish ubisoft would implement a solo queue playlist. It would make games more sweaty... yes... but it would make them a hell of a lot more fair. Don't play this game in the state it is in rn. Other issues: peekers advantage, inconsistent sound, terrible hit registration (both lack of hits and too many hits if you know what I mean). Truly an unpolished game at this point, please fix it... don't let it die slowly."
13296,"Been apart of the game since Beta, Its a love hate relationship."
13297,"There was a true problem where my game would just crash, but this game has been one of the best to play since it first came out. The attackers and defenders do take some time to master, but thats great in a game"

13303,i like

13305,"good game, very sweat worthy"
13306,"Played a lot of siege but lost interest. The balancing isn't very good, a lot of the operators are behind paywalls, and the community was pretty toxic.

Had a lot of fun, but wouldn't recommend someone get into it now"
13307,"takes 40 - 100 hours to learn the game. Quick play is not very fun due to team kills and leavers. Go play some ranked and don't be a loser that cares about the game too much.

13334,"Rainbow 6 changed my life.

The Tom Clancy franchise has been one of my top favorites for years, and I have loved every game they have put out/. I was known among my friends as ""the R6 guy"". As the game grew with age, so did the developers lack of ingenuity  and lack of care to keep an amazing game credible. You will find die hard fans, pros and content creators who are holding on to a fantasy that this game will one day breath new life. I'd say to download the game when it's on Free to Play weekend however, its a breeding ground for cheaters.

This game actually got me so depressed that it turned me off from gaming in general and made me take a good look at my life, it made me realize that if a game can make me this devastated then I need to make some changes. So I've been doing other things, such as going for walks and hikes regularly, working on personal projects, and improving my life in general. So thank you UBISOFT, for turning a flawless game into  such a terrible game and destroying one of my favorite franchises off all time, it has really improved my life."

13342,"***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good."

Toxic community and horrid matchmaking. Just over it. Ive tried to get back into it but its just fallen too far from grace.  Please dont give ubisoft your money. They do not deserve it. Its like seeing a friend get hooked on drugs and watching them spiral into degeneracy and psychosis. I truly loved this game, but im done. I'll never forget the memories made whilst playing this game. RIP Tom Clancy, RIP r6 franchise. You will be missed. 07"
13396,rainbow six siege is the most game ever. it has the development team of all time. the operators are. I think that this is most likely a game that will sell copies.
13397,"I think its fun

13406,fun but u might end up hating urself
13407,aim good play good
13408,"I've played this game for over 200 hour and the amount of fun you could have is insane. Yeah it is very tactical with the gun gameplay / abilities / movement. 

Recently added an gun range where you can practice your aim / recoil patterns. Also has TDM now with a new map dedicated to it.

There are tons of maps on the game plus the price is pretty good and worth it seeing that the game still gets updated after 7 years worth of content.

There is casual gamemode 
unranked gamemode kind of like ranked but without the ranking system.
Ranked is competitive gamemode with ranking system.

Overall if your into fps games this will be for you."
13409,its fun when you dont die
13410,"Awesome game, very fun with good community."
13411,its fun
13412,shit is so ass that if you played for 5 seconds you would want to kill yourself from the toxic ass players. 0/10 don't play this stupid shit.
13413,"I hate it, would recommend"
13414,Great Game! I'm down to play with a squad or teach new players
13415,"If you hate yourself this is the game for you. This game makes me significantly more suicidal as more as I play and I love the feeling when you want to punch multiple holes into the wall as humanly possible, would recommend if your mentality can handle that."
13416,yes
13417,"Nothing really works, i may of played this on console for 4 years prior to pc and i gotta say, nowts improved since what? since when BH came out so like 4 years ago now, this game really sucks ass they ezzzzz paid for 10/10 reviews 

maybe ill play some more in abit"
13418,Dont buy this game

Even without playing with friends, it's a game I'm always having fun with despite my elo being quite low. The only problem I often experience is team-killing however they're often given bans when done so. The graphics and play style is amazing and I love R6 lots."

The hit new franchise created by Ubisoft where they disguise a puzzle game as an online tactical shooter where you have to exploit bugs, download cheats, and (with the help of friends) succeed. However, watch out for the ""Fatherless Children"" as they roam the halls of this new indie hit by Ubisoft.

""Originally I thought the bugs were, just that, bugs, but then after I realized that the devs weren't patching them, I finally realized the true story behind this amazing game. 10/10"" - Anon. Steam Reviewer

""Bought this to because friends told me it was a fun tactial shooter, turned out they hadn't even found the real purpose of this game. 9/10"" - Public IGN Reviewer

""No Among Us charms. 1/10"" - One of those fucking fatherless children (god--)

Releasing in Blockbusters and Walmarts in two months.... 7 years ago."
13515,i love game is very good
13516,good
13517,"Great game for friends and family, especially if you/they’re part of the KKK. Got called the n word on my second game :heart:"
13518,realistic shooter love it
13519,good game but uplay always has some issues
13520,"It's not just FPS game, it forces you to use your brain, you need to be quick in decision making."
13521,I just disliked that it is very intensive on the internet connection and could not be played if you have a slow internet.it will keep on lagging and not be able to join the others. wishing to beta test other computer games to stream it and wish to enjoy the game but sadly not really have a powerful device to stream and play Overall I have enjoyed the game if I am having a good internet connection.
13522,"dont, unless you have friends, then maybe"
13523,i think im just addicted somehow
13524,this game was actually fun and playable in 2020 and early 2021 but they ruined it so I'm with this game forever.
13525,I LOVE THE GAME  ITS GOOD FOR FREINDS TO PLAY AND VIBE AT 1 AM RUINING OPTHERS DAYS
13526,im black btw
13527,hahaha head go splaaattt
13528,"De los pocas sagas que Ubisoft supo mantener a flote, si bien no es un juego tan táctico como sus predecesores, mantiene el alma de los mismos. Los mapas están muy bien estructurados y cada rol tiene sus respectivos balanceos para que existe el fair-play entre cada partida, la destrucción de los escenarios esta muy bien implementada, en la mayoría de los mapas el escenario es destruible un 60%. Los gráficos se mantienen bien hoy en día, mi única queja, es sobre los operadores ya que para llegar a desbloquear un operador con habilidades ""destacables"" es necesario un grindeo muy grande, de ahí en fuera es el mejor shooter táctico en mi opinión."
13529,"this game's community is fucking shit, the players attitudes are shit, they will kill you for no reason. they will call you names, be racist, and throw games. you should definitely play it. its meme-y garbage lol"

13613,"So you wanna know about Siege?  I've been playing Siege for about 5 years at the time of posting this and whilst I've not got thousands of hours in the game, I'd say I have a pretty good grasp on the game.

R6 Siege is one of the best FPS games I've ever played to put it simply. The controls and mechanics are the best I have ever seen in any FPS. The fast paced action of the game where any gun can one shot headshot in a 5v5 on a small map makes for some very tense moments in the game. There are plenty of characters (operators) to pick from for both defenders and attackers all with different Primary and Secondary guns along with each having their unique gadget. All this means that you rarely find yourself in a similar match twice.

Now there are plenty of downsides to the game with matchmaking being absolutely scuffed in Ranked and thousands of smurfs running round, along with the mountain of bugs that still need to be patched. Still I'd recommend this game as you could easily get a 100 hours in solo before finding some friends to play with or going online to find a discord server or something."

13714,"If you have a friend group and you guys are looking for a competitive experience, I'd definitely suggest this game. I am not the biggest fan of FPS games, as I have always been notoriously bad at them. But the shooting in this game feels so good that I don't mind it. I also feel that with all of these operators available to play in this game, there is a character for everyone. Despite my past complaints concerning this game, I feel like the toxicity this community is known for has died down a lot. I have been solo queuing in this game for days and have not found a single person killing or harassing me. This could be circumstantial, but in my experience siege was good for at least one or two of these incidences daily. My experience these past few weeks have been generally positive. I've even had a lot of fun just chatting with people (Although all of this is subject to change)  Overall, I would recommend the game how it is now and look forward to playing it more with my friends."

That way, you can plan and execute effective strategies, rather than everyone doing their own thing! It's important to make use of cover, move slowly to not draw attention to yourself, and stick with your team-mates. The various gadgets the operators have mix up the game-play since you need to keep an eye out for various traps.

13770,"A Proclamation.

Whereas, on the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:

""That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.

""That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be, in good faith, represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such State shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against the United States.""

Now, therefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief, of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion, do, on this first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance with my purpose so to do publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred days, from the day first above mentioned, order and designate as the States and parts of States wherein the people thereof respectively, are this day in rebellion against the United States, the following, to wit:

Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, (except the Parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James Ascension, Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans, including the City of New Orleans) Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, (except the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Ann, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth[)], and which excepted parts, are for the present, left precisely as if this proclamation were not issued.

And by virtue of the power, and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States, and parts of States, are, and henceforward shall be free; and that the Executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.

And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.

And I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.

And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the City of Washington, this first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-seventh.

By the President: ABRAHAM LINCOLN
WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State."
13771,"  Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is very fun in my opinion. If I were to say the game at times can be very very sweaty with really good players as well, but with friends even the sweatiest of games could be fun.  Though it can be hard to play and want to continue playing the game It is still good and fun. 8/10"
13772,Fun game. Sometimes you might encounter cheaters but not as frequently as games like PUBG. The character designs are pretty good and the gunplay is really good. Some operators have overpowered abilities but that is not a HUGE issue in my opinion. The $20 price is a pretty good a for a game this good in my opinion.
13773,NICE BUT LAGGY OOP  cap lock
13774,"I found nothing enjoyable about this game. The gameplay is boring, the character movement is stupid, the graphics are bad, even by 2015 standards, and the player base is as toxic as they come. 

The one thing I just can't get past, is the ridiculous way your character tries to drag his ass around the map with his back on the ground and feet in front of him. Why would anyone do this? Anyone who has ever made it to the final round of a limbo competition knows this is a compromising situation that does not avail itself to combat.  

Setting aside my dismay (and the absolute asininity of said shoot-and-scoot-boogie), the combat just isn't fun, and the players just aren't fun to play with.

Pros:
The game installs and launches without any errors.

Cons:
Just about everything else

Score:
1.5/10

13834,"1 tablespoon good olive oil

3 cups chopped yellow onions (3 onions)

1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

1/3 cup canned chicken stock or broth

1 tablespoon tomato paste

2 1/2 pounds ground chuck (81 percent lean)

1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs (recommended: Progresso)

2 extra-large eggs, beaten

1/2 cup ketchup (recommended: Heinz) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan. Add the onions, thyme, salt, and pepper and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until the onions are translucent but not brown. Off the heat, add the Worcestershire sauce, chicken stock, and tomato paste. Allow to cool slightly.
In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck, onion mixture, bread crumbs, and eggs, and mix lightly with a fork. Don't mash or the meat loaf will be dense. Shape the mixture into a rectangular loaf on a sheet pan covered with parchment paper. Spread the ketchup evenly on top. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, until the internal temperature is 160 degrees F and the meat loaf is cooked through. (A pan of hot water in the oven, under the meat loaf, will keep the top from cracking.) Serve hot."

ubisoft genuinely does not heir competent staff or care about it's community members. Money first, nothing else second.

The coolest concept for a First Person Shooter, worst execution.

Best Anti-Cheat... lowest paid tier used.

Too bad no other competent game dev or company has copied this formula. Any Dev that copies this idea will eat this iteration alive."

To me there are four determinants that make this game different and distinguishable
-Every operator available in the game has different and their own effective special gadgets 
-Unlike CS:GO , Valorant and others... Rainbow Six Siege is a quite serious game compared to other Fps games
-Maps are great and detailed (Most of them)
-İf you play co-op you'll probably enjoy this game as a RPG game"
14185,"I love siege. It's maddening when you just start, but you can tell that a lot of thought went into making this tactical shooter. The maps and operators are intricate and the gun play is quite a rush. I highly recommend it."
14186,"Funny game after the toxic start and massive Info and operator ability learning.
U will have still toxic player and the worst teammates but if u like that kinda playstyle or the game itself?! U will have fun in most of the games"

14189,"If your looking for a game review you wont find it here but heres a good recipe
Scramble your eggs: Using a small pat of butter, scramble some eggs in a large sauté pan, breaking them into small pieces as you go. Then transfer the eggs to a separate plate, and set aside.
Sauté your veggies and garlic: Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the onions, carrots, peas and garlic until soft and cooked through.
Stir fry rice: Then turn the burner to high heat. Scooch the veggies over to one side of the pan, melt the remaining butter in the other half, and add the chilled rice, soy sauce, and oyster sauce (if using). Then stir to combine with the veggies and continue sautéing the rice, stirring every 15-20 seconds or so for 3 minutes, or until you notice the rice and veggies starting to brown slightly.
Remove pan from heat. And stir in your green onions, sesame oil, and scrambled eggs.
Taste and season. Give the rice a taste, and season with salt and pepper, plus any extra soy sauce or sesame oil if needed.
Serve! Then dish it up and serve nice and warm!"

14201,"I used to absolutely Love This game the unique way of strategy and combat was used so well. now this game gets somehow more and more destroyed before my eyes by a Disgusting, Money sucking, selfish Company called Ubisoft. They're the best company to break fans hearts by progressively destroying a game Franchise they love and this is what they have exactly done to this game by making it a shitty call of duty knockoff.

I wanna start with the way this game works now, Run out and Tryhard as much as possible and get as much kills as you can winning the games dosent matter anymore its about how good you are at Spawn peeking and rushing out like its some stupid ass call duty bullshit Absolutely no Teamwork required to win the game you just need one person who dose nothing else but play this game and ace every round its almost every time the game is now boring and there is just no point in trying anymore. the stupid overpowered new operators that can just easily wallbang you in seconds the game is so unbalanced with their certain level of fairness its all about the other team hitting a window and headshoting you when just spawning and then you can have so much fun waiting for the round to be over just for something else like that to happen to you again you spend more time dead than actually playing the game Ubisoft shitty updates made the game even worse its almost like the game is promoting players to just use some dumb overpowered strat because that is apparently called ""skill"". Let me get this straight really quick Tactical MY ASS spawn in get some bullshit gun and just tryhard as much as possible and get as much kills as you can to make you feel good about yourself and make you forget that your wasting your life on worthless piece of shit game 

Overall i said it before this game WAS amazing until Ubisoft decided to stoop to other game companies level its like the game isn't trying to be different anymore and in fact is just jumping in a early grave trying to blend in. Its sad how this game is turning out to be and Ubisoft is finally revealing the mask on what this game is becoming goodbye to the having fun side to this game."

14232,Great game
14233,This game is too toxic
14234,GOD Snd gamne
14235,better get good at headshots
14236,"Now, I'm addicted to this game like any other smuck who can't stop playing with toxic relationships (half the community for example), but the longer I play the worse a time I have. Casual used to be fun, now it's Quick Match and everyone actually takes it seriously -is that not what unranked and ranked are for? Hit registration is wonky (headshots don't count as headshots like 40-60% of the time, Kali 50/50 on downing someone when she's within range for it, shooting through hardwalls/cover, grenades hitting teammates through a solid floor or ceiling, etc.) 

I also do not agree with giving operators secondary gadgets that are several hard breaches or thatcher's emps. If they keep that up, no operator will be unique in the ways that makes them important for the gameplay, and they wouldn't need to be played and possibly change the meta or keep a train going to where everyone can do everything, ""we should play the same characters every time because we win."" 

Asking friends if they think the game is fun anymore, some answers are along the lines of: ""only if I'm drunk"", ""I just play the game to suck richards"", :no, it makes me realize life is just as bad as this game"", ""it hasn't been fun in 7 years they need to try harder"".

This review was just to say the game is getting worse over time, and definitely not fun within the last year from the posting of this review."

14267,I hate this game
14268,Don't take this to seriously you'll just end up mad and an easy target for toxic people
14269,"The state of this game is very, very different from when I first began playing in 2015, so I think it would be good for me to leave a review explaining the pros and cons of siege, and the differences between the old and new states of the game I love so dearly. 

[b][i] TL:DR; [/i][/b] [b]If you're looking for a strictly tactical video game, then this game is probably no longer your best bet. If you're looking for a more realistic team based hero shooter with fun and interesting utility, then this is the game for you![/b]

[h1] The Basics [/h1]

Siege used to be a strictly tactical game with (mostly) realistic tools to assist in gunfights, called gadgets,  and a focus on realism and team based coordination, which released a new map and two new ops each season. Now, Siege is a loosely tactical game with semi-futuristic gadgets with one new op each season and a new map intermittently, along with updates to old maps. 

[b] Pros: [/b]
-Very fun game overall
-Gameplay is interesting
-Diverse operator abilities allows for any playstyle
-Active development and anti-cheat

Cons:
-Toxic community, especially towards LGBTQ+ and Minority folks
-Hard to pick up and get into immediately
-Complicated maps and loadouts

[h1] My Personal Opinion [/h1]

I began playing siege when I was looking for a fun, interesting and realistic tactical team based shooter to partake in, and it fulfilled this role at that time. Now, I find myself unable to enjoy Siege for realism purposes, as it's jumped the shark into holograms, magical bullets, and invincible plexiglass. I would be remiss, however, if I did not mention how fun this truly is. If you stop taking the game seriously and just enjoy it for what it is, siege will never stop being fun for you, lord knows it hasn't for me."
14270,"This is game is amazing, just WOW.
I've never felt so free with the movement, but the only down side is that you can't jump when ever :/

And it's also sooooooo satifying when you get a heashot...

14444,10/10 tactical shooter Rage enducing and seratonin inspiring XD
14445,"This game is just such an experience, from the tactical gameplay and unique operators based on real life events and actual tactical units like 707th smb or the GIGN. they put time into minute details which is just astonishing. The first person teamwork based shooter, completely relying on skill, and teamwork, and audio cues too. its a breath of fresh air from the over saturated shooter market, where everyone is copying to big thing, siege does it different. its a beautiful experience to go through. There is a learning curve tho and has a amazing community and is available on all the major gaming platforms (PS4, XBOX,P.C.). For anyone as well using reviews to make a decision on buying this game, then id say its worth it. the ingame store is also amazing, unlike fortnite, call of duty or any other shooting game, you can almost buy every thing in the store with renown, which you get around 100-200 per game. But, for a shorter route you can buy the skins headgear or weapon skins for a couple of what is called r6 credits which are cheap, (to give you an idea with twenty bucks you can get 4 operators, which  is the equivalent of one fortnite skin."
14446,"the game is generally enjoyable solo and with friends, but once you decide to start playing competitively, people begin to get a bit toxic. I have played this game on console since 2015 and have not stopped having fun. the seasonal updated add new things to the game and new things to progress towards, which helps keep my interest. Remember that this is a game and is meant to be fun. The player decides when and if they are going to have fun by helping their teammates and working towards a common goal. Have fun."

(if you're new to the game, start with (newcomer) and learn the basics.) thank you.

the game can be toxic at time's but mostly welcoming, in my opinion at least.

if there is any spelling errors I am sorry, and if this was helpful you don't need to like."

Best features IMO: 
Wallbanging 
Team killing
Unique characters
--------‐----------------
There is one tiny problem though. 
Some of the characters are insanely unbalanced like the Defender ""Clash"" she has an unbreakable shield that has tasers on it and a good smg? How are opponents supposed to kill that with random teammates 🤔.

⚠️BEST PLAYED WITH PRE-MADE SQUAD⚠️"

This Game Is My Favorite Game By A Mile It Has All The Aspects Of A Perfect Game In My Eyes, I Definitely Recommend This Title Of Tom Clancy Its Just Too Good"

14498,"Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular — and complex — first-person shooters on the current games market. A blend of milsim games and round-based tactical shooters like Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six exists in a niche that no other game truly fits into. 

""Should you play Rainbow Six Siege?"" Well, that answer is complicated. Siege has had seven years and has many moving parts. Let’s divide it up into the varying types of players. 

For better or worse, the Tom Clancy vibe is mostly gone from Rainbow Six Siege. It’s less dark and gritty and more vibrant and colorful, mostly for gameplay purposes. Siege is a first-person shooter at heart, the tactics and gadgets augment the shooter mechanics. 

If you’re looking for a game like Squad or ARMA, Siege likely isn’t for you. It was always less of what you wanted in a game from the beginning and is rapidly becoming less of what you want over time. 

Yes! At its core, Siege is a great game, even if it isn’t bang-on the Tom Clancy branding. If you’re a fan of military simulators, Siege is likely going to be a little fast-paced for your liking, but if you’ve played before you know what you’re getting into.

There are still tons of tactics and gadgets to immerse yourself in — even if the darkness and grittiness that was there from the original games wasn’t all the way there at launch, and is rapidly fading. 

It’s hard to say yes here. Ultimately, Siege is a great experience but is not friendly to new or inconsistent players. There are massive maps, tons of gadgets, and dozens of unique interactions between the operators that aren’t explained well in supplementary content from Ubisoft. 

New players are going to have dozens of hours of headaches before they feel like they really understand what’s going on. The players that have been playing Siege have been playing for upwards of seven years. That’s a lot of experience and work to try and bypass. It is unforgiving, and you’re forced to learn quick or be very bored with the game. 

It’s impossible to recommend R6 to any new player that doesn’t have a lot of patience and a lot of spare time. If you’re a solo player it’s impossible. With friends it’s possible, but you’ll arguably have more fun in another game. 

Should I play Rainbow Six Siege if I played before but took a year off?
By all standards, Rainbow Six Siege is in one of the best states of its life cycle. Yes, if you have experience in the game, jump on in, the water’s fine."
14499,its toxic but fun as hell with friends
14500,hello are you there?
14501,"Definitely a giant learning curve to those who are first picking this game up, but as with all new games; I'd say that practice makes perfect."

14503,still playable
14504,its gooed
14505,"amazing game!
"
14506,The best tactical shooters out there. Highly recommend.
14507,"this game is overall great, a lot of bugs and random disconnections, head glitches, client sided angles, times where you get shot when you cant even see anyone, shot through hard walls that cant be shot through, a lot of hackers, d-dossers, and a very friendly (toxic) community, i recommend installing this game if you seek to waste time and money while actively lowering your sanity."
14508,"Good game, hurts real good"
14509,This game used to be good but the power creep and obsession with reworking old yet FUN maps is unbelievably annoying.
14510,They ruined it with all the map changes.
14511,"Besides the developers making all the characters either gay or trans and nerfing random characters, completely messing up the GUIs and deleting all the good or fun characters and making it completely unbalanced with a trash anti cheat the game can still be fun sometimes"

14667,"This used to be my favorite game, it used to be something I could sink hours into a day and not feel cheated. Used to be.

Then they started catering to the Esports gamers, instead of the actual fans. Combine that with an increasing ridiculous roster of operators and abilities... this game is a shadow of its former glory. Now the game is an unbalanced mess. 

Lets add an operator that can run around as a hologram that's not in any way broken, oh and it will also reveal you when you shoot it... good idea. But Blackbeard's ability is still to strong, lets nerf him again for the 3 millionth time."

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

14750,"The game has a unique audience, it is not the kind of game that everyone will like.
Opening multifunctional operators is a complete torture and there are too many tryhards in the game. If you are a new player, you need to improve yourself in the newcomer mode. Apart from that, the logic of the game is beautiful, the style is nice. I didn't like it very much, but it is an action/strategy game that most people can enjoy. I bought the game 2 times and returned it, I'm slowly starting to understand that it's not a game for me."

14758,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

14771,"The community is so ass and whiny but that's not the games fault. The game itself is fun and I love the guns. The characters are memorable and so easy to remember. But with so many characters it's not that easy for new players to join since there's a lot to unload onto them. The main gripe I have is the amount of Traps they will have to deal with going into the game. Not knowing how to look, find, or destroy them.
I love this game so much but I cannot say it's an easy game to play properly, but there is a lot of crutches you can abuse. The whole high RPM meta is a good example since it really relies on one head-shot from a huge volley of bullets going into a general direction. Any kind of head-shot will kill so it doesn't even need to be planned or predicted. With the whole one shot head-shot mechanic it really changes the game from a Tactical FPS to a TDM when in any rank with the wrong mindset.
When there are those moments where people actually play for the objective and stick to their roles it's so satisfying as well.
I am showing a lot of negatives with little positives and giving this a recommend rating but I am stuck to this game. I cannot give it up and I won't. Too much time, effort, and money dedicated to it. I only will say if you want to dedicate yourself to learn something I would say there is a lot to learn in this game."

14856,"I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD GIVE THIS GAME A THUMB UP OR A THUMB DOWN, SO YOU GUYS CAN JUST READ THE COMMENTS AND IGNORE THE RATING THAT I GAVE TO THIS GAME.

I started playing this game when Ace and Melusi came out, so basically I started playing this game pretty late, but the thing is, once you started knowing the tempo of the game and what you should do and the map and you have to have high IQ, the game could become a very good choice. My highest rank was Gold 2 and I am writing this review from my heart.

Ubisoft is making the game worse and worse, they are having less and less ideas of new operators so that there was only one new operator in a new season since Zero, and the game is becoming less and less realistic than what it should be, operators are having more and more fancy and unrealistic gadgets and abilities, operator skins for this game is getting more and more stupid, Imagine you are expected the game to be like real life but in fact you are fighting against a person wears Rick and Morty or Samurai outfit. Dead bodies are removed and a mark is left on the corpse to indicate the operator. How can you call this game real?

Seriously I don't really care about if the game is realistic or not because I like the destroying and reinforcing system in this game which will make each round different, but at least, let me know which operator it is hen I saw the skin. HOW THE F**K AM I SUPPOSE TO KNOW WHICH OPERATOR IT IS BEHIND A SAMURAI MASK!!!!!! KNOWING THE OPERATOR DURING THE GUN FIGHT IS A VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION BECAUSE YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO PREVENT THIS OPERATOR, but if buying a fancy skin can make your enemy not recognizing your character, I can tell this game is a pay to win game.

I guess the producer of this game is trying to make the game into a competitive game so that they can appeal more players. They added so many stuffs on the screen to that there are less conversation going on during the game, they are currently trying everything they can to appeal to new players since many players choose not to play this game because of the difficulty and unfriendliness for new player. But the core of this game is that people really need to put their works into it in order to become better. Every Siege player put so much works and efforts into this game such as memorizing the map, knowing different strategies, knowing different operators and learning different ways to get kills by getting killed. This is why we love this game because we grew from a person who doesn't know anything to someone who can eventually getting an ACE and cooperating with teammates. Seriously making these changes won't do s**t to new players, if they don't want to put efforts in, then they won't play the game anyway, if someone really wants to play well in this game or love this game, they will still putting efforts in no matter what. So it really DON'T DO SHIT!

I really want this game to be better and I really hope that Ubisoft can make some changes to this game and make it more realistic and friendly to our old players. We all want to see everyone play R6 Siege because we all know how good this game is when we play it. I have been suggesting this game to a lot of people I know but a lot of them gave up at the end due to the NEW PLAYER HELL. it is very sad to see this game getting less and less players and they just started selling fancy skins to players because I think the game lost its soul, it is not the Rainbow Six Siege the we all love because of all these dumb changes. I currently stopped playing this game because I am done compromising with this game. All these changes were touching my line and I endured most of them for a long time. The moment when I stopped playing this game is when the Samurai and Rick & Morty skin came out, I was literally showing the picture to one of my friend who always play rainbow six siege with me and asked him to recognize different operators and he can't .

At the End. Since I stopped playing this game, I am currently playing Apex Legends which is much more trending, even I don't play Siege anymore, I still don't want to uninstall it because from my heart, I still believe that siege could become better than this in the future even the hope is so tiny that even I can't really see it. But I will definitely play this game if the game becomes better in my opinion.

14873,"Rainbow six siege is a highly technical game. As a newplayer it is hard to grab the nuances of the different maps filled with countless different angles and utilities of different agents which has led to me wondering why the fk am i dead again. But all i got to say is , this game is pretty much one of the most unique fps game i have played, like dood u cannt even jump on the spot but why would u right? The game reflects the need to clear every angle properly like in CQB and the complex gameplay results in every match being refreshing and containing something new to learn about. However toxicity of the game do exists and is not really that new player friendly. Overall though cool game"

15013,there is no such thing as an ash main. there are only jager mains playing on attack.
15014,I been playing this for years on the PS4 and now I got it on PC. Bought it twice. Its not too real like ready or not but its also not run and gun. So lots of fun for something in between.

15027,"A non binary operator, really? Please take me back to when games were not influenced by the idiotic “lgbtq” movement. I’m glad you moved to not so epic games, Ubisoft. There you can share your future lgbt stuff with Tim Sweeny, he will most likely appreciate it. Oh and by the way, does anyone else remember when the game was semi realistic without the futuristic sci-fi crap?"
15028,i slave away at the game and I plan to continue doing so.

15044,"Laying down simulator, 

The only first-person shooter where camping in a corner, laying on the ground, is accepted as a respectable way of playing the game.

In order to properly play this game you have to study every inch of the map, every spot and every tactic. 

In it's core it's undeniably a good FPS. Deserved being one of the most praised FPS games, it's however not my cuppa tea.

15093,"As a new player, who started playing at the beginning of year 7 I'll say, this game is highly addictive, no two rounds are the same, great accessibility features and customization to filter what you wanna play. If you're looking for a good adrenaline rush with a game, look no further."
15094,"If you have strong nerves and lot of patience, then I can suggest.

Otherwise, avoid it."

15109,Describe Siege? No thanks. Just play the damn game lol If you stick around you won't be disappointed.
15110,"The main reason why you shouldn't play this game is Ubisoft. After some time, you notice that game is getting more casual than it was. It's not about being some operators OP or something, but about the game being fun. Newcomers would really love the game. However, new updates will make it worse. Due to changing the main concept of R6, from the realistic shooter about opposing military forces to Marvel-like shit."
