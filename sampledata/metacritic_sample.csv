2,Monster Hunter: World,Milenya,"Aug 11, 2018","Monster Hunter: World redefines the meaning of a low quality console to PC port. If you thought Dark Souls or Nier Automata were bad prepare yourself for a whole new dimension of poor performance and visual quality from 2010.

- Clunky/Stiff controls and movement

- Weird mouse simulation, no raw input

- The sound is so out of sync with whats going on on the screen it's almost hilarious, especially the lip sync

- Textures from a time before games had textures

- More performance demanding than literally any modern game with high end graphics yet it looks very outdated.

- Multiplayer is a mess, good luck trying to play with your friends. Why can every other game do this right, even Ubisoft games allow your friends to just jump in and out of your session at any time

- Relying on half-working Steam API

- Can't pause, open the main menu, or exit the game while on a mission. Seriously?

- Denuvo DRM. Ok, other games have that too, but still.

- DLC add ons that have been released on consoles forever are being withheld for the PC version

- Pricetag. This game is many months old and a lot of content that is already available wasn't included, see above.

Try harder, Capcom. If want to know how it's done look up to Square Enix. Final Fantasy XV is how you do a proper console to PC port. Collapse",0,15,29

5,Monster Hunter: World,FlukeLSX,"Aug 10, 2018","There is NOTHING about this game that is good enough to warrant a 9/10 rating. In the history of gaming, there's never been a port from console to PC that was any good. And sadly, I was right about this game as well.

What all the game play videos do NOT show people is the worst parts of the game.

So to keep it simple here's a list:

1. Camera system is terrible, you can tell it was a direct port from console and designed to work with gamepads and not PC mice.

2. The Combat system is slow and clunky at best.

3. Anyone using an pre-Haswell CPU is struggling with FPS stability (I do not have this problem i7-5930K) (Yes they are trying to figure out how to fix this issue)

4. The Game world is setup like SkyForge (Central Hub *by yourself* where you prepare to enter an instanced zone either by yourself or while having someone connect to your session or vice versa otherwise it's a single player game, with a poorly implemented coop/multiplayer mode: It felt like an afterthought at best))

5. Multiplayer is terrible at best, You would think after 8 months on Xbone, and PS4 they might have an idea of what network infrastructure would work? (Constant disconnects between player sessions) If I didn't know any better I'd say they were using Peer-Peer server hosting, because I can't believe a normal Network Infrastructure is this unstable and bad. Disconnects and error codes are common, and being forced into offline mode are expected. (No it's not my connection either, I have a 500Mb/sec / 50Mb/sec connection, and I ping 15-100ms or less everywhere in the U.S.

6. Character animations are poor at best, you cannot move while attacking at the same time. In other words for those of us who played a real Action Combat MMO: The character position is locked while attacking, so no you cannot circle strafe around a target.

7. If you were expecting this game to be an Action Combat System it's not. Not when you throw a game like Tera into the mix as a comparison.

Now there are only 2 things positive I can say about this game:

1. The Graphics

2. They do in fact have a mouse Y Axis invert option.

Beyond that, I can't say anything else good about it. The idea is sound, but the control mechanics, character animations, and clunky combat system makes it eye bleeding to deal with.

Worst $60 I spent so far on a game. (next to X-Universe that is but hey at least the camera system worked in that game.) Collapse",4,28,71

9,Monster Hunter: World,Xenofex,"Mar 22, 2020","New to the series. Picked the game up late (early 2020) so I haven't got any technical issues. 200+ hours of gameplay.

Decided not to buy Iceborne.

Before the 'end-game', the only thing an average player does is grinding with little skills. Why so little skills? Because this game is gear dependent. After the player get good enough defense, he/she can simply move to harder monsters.

Until some point, grinding becomes every difficult. For instance, to get a Research Commission Ticket, the player has to either complete every single optional quest of the game, or to reach hunter rank 100. Both of which are a long and tedious way. Before this moment the player are blocked from certain end game gear, which means he/she is much less efficient at hunting, in other words, underpowered. At this point, the game is harder than you expect than what we see the streamers do. The only thing the player can do is to improve the skills, or remember the monster patterns, so that eventually the player can be a master of the game.

I abandoned the game at roughly this situation and I just don't like it. I spent already 200 hours but just barely touched part of the game that encourage skills. What now? The game is not fresh anymore, more like a job for me. 200 hours is 5 working weeks, which is a lot. I don't see why the game force me to grind 200 hours to reach this point. Collapse",7,1,1
10,Monster Hunter: World,Captain_Chaos,"Jan 13, 2020","Monster Hunter: World is my first real foray into the franchise after poking at demos for the older 3DS games prior. I'm sure I'm not the only one with that background, but I can say that World on the whole feels like an attempt to get more people into the series.

MHW's premise is rather thin for a game of its scale. This is not in of itself a bad thing, but as a lore-hound I might have appreciated a little more fluff.

Mechanically speaking however the game is significantly more complex, with more keyboard binds, at least as far as I can remember, then any game I have played in the past 15 years, with the possible exception of Sins of a Solar Empire: a 4X space strategy game. That MHW is an action game with this many binds is impressive, if at times kind of annoying. I would also regard it as strangely akin to Axiom Verge in that having tried both mouse and keyboard versus controller, neither is 100% comfortable for me to use and I find myself wishing I had an extra hand, or at least a few more neurons.

You may wish the same when attempting to ascertain the breadth of content in MHW: There are fourteen different types of weapons to use, some melee, some ranged, some simple and others tactically complex, multiple environments to hunt in, a few dozen monster types with varying strengths and weaknesses and tables of dropped crafting materials, many, many items to pick up, craft, an arm-mounted ""slinger"" that can fire various types of found ammo and use and at least two different sets of armor and one of each weapon type to make for each monster, with the Iceborne expansion adding an entirely new ""grapple claw"" mechanic, more moves for the weapons and of course, a lot more monsters and gear to craft. In the vein of many Japanese games I have played in the past: The EDF series, Sengoku Basara, Navel Ops, and others: There is a staggering amount of stuff to do, find and make. MHW is, in a word, dense. If nothing else, you will get your money's worth in hours played by far, if the game is your bag. When hunting alone or with one other player, and I do recommend at least one other player, you have the option of being accompanied by a helpful cat-like creature called a Palico, who can use a selection of unique support items, gather materials, distract the monster for you, and generally be nice to have around. When playing with three or four players however, the Palicos stay behind to enforce the 4-player party size limit.

And now the meat of it: The combat in MHW is certainly more accessible then earlier iterations of the franchise, but gameplay overall is notably clunkier and rigid when compared to contemporary titles, especially western ones. It took some hours for me to adjust to the various oddities of the game's design and hurdles of progression, not the least of which is your extremely limited defense and damage at the game's outset- you will regularly die in early quests and any quest thereafter you are not properly geared for, as player skill will not save you from getting one shot by a powerful attack, thus wasting one of your team's precious limited respawns per assigned quest, costing you time, money and patience. Gear levels aside, as I mentioned earlier I've never been able to reach a real level of comfort with any control setup for MHW. Mouse and keyboard simply has too many separate binds to be usable within a reasonable frame of response time, not helped by a complete remap of the default binds accompanying the infamously delayed-for-pc Iceborne expansion, and locking character movement to eight cardinal directions versus the more nuanced directional control of an analog stick. Controller makes character movement and certain melee attacks and other inputs easier to perform, but hopelessly complicates aiming any projectile weapon or the grapple claw. And both control setups must contend with what I felt, at least initially, was a labyrinthine, archaic menu system and curiously unresponsive quick-use wheel. Aside from any of this, there is also the issue of the disparity in design quality between armors for the two available genders. Whatever your personal feelings on skimpy armor designs for female characters, there is simply a marked lack of quality and design creativity for the female armors.

All that being said, MHW is nonetheless fun, perhaps inexplicably so at times. It's loud and colorful, with easily understandable icons, recognizable outlines for monsters, weapons and armors, reasonable load times, and it's very easy for friends to link up and do hunts together. Combat can be satisfying when all factors line up sufficiently, especially the mounting mechanic and grapple claw techniques. The map and guidance system is fairly robust.

Above all, a bulk of my online friends have the game, and it is always in my experience better to play games of this nature with friends. Whatever its flaws, and there are many, MHW manages to be an entertaining and addicting experience. Collapse",7,1,1
11,Monster Hunter: World,pinapelz,"Mar 16, 2020","The game is just OK. I don't have any other connections to the Monster Hunter Series (this is my first Monster Hunter Game), so this should be a very objective view on the game.

Graphics: This game looks fantastic! The people designing it did a really nice job with making the world feel realistic. Everything in this game just looks so detailed and beautiful!

Gameplay: Gameplay wise the controls are just OK. I'm not sure if this is a recurring thing happening in the monster hunter series but the controls definetly felt clunky. It didn't feel very smooth. I also found that there wasn't any way to cancel a move after you made it. If you were using long sword and did an overhead slash infront of you there was no way to stop yourself from completing the action. Even worse if you press the button multiple times the character will proceed to do the action multiple times. However these were minor issues and could be easily overlooked.

What really killed it for me was the terrible Palico AI and the annoying effects monster can place on you (stunned, poison, sleep). Here is an example of what can happen: You get stunned by a monster and you are on half health. Naturally you are immobile for a certain period of time. However! The monster is able to also posion or burn you causing you to lose health while immobile, plus the monster can knock you around while you are stunned giving you no way to dodge or avoid the attacks leading to fainting, Cases like being pushed against the wall with no where to go and being killed has happened to me WAY TOO often for me to be able to overlook this as an one time occurance. Also the Palico (cats/helper in combat in the game) is never able to deliever a vigorwasp (health potion) to me properly. When I find myself in need of one it always says that its too busy or whatever when it clearly doing nothing.

Also monsters are way too overpowered! Tons of monsters out there are able to kill you in one or two hits. The beginner area should have easier to kill monsters, not an Anjanath that can one shot you using a flame thrower move.

I recognize the fact that it could be just me who is bad at this game and more experienced players would be able to get out of these situations, but you have to keep in mind that for many people this is their first entry into the monster hunter series. Being a begginer at a game shouldn't impact the enjoyment of it.

All of this combined with the fact that you can't actually remap controls on controller just made this game unenjoyable. However I won't be returning it as it still a decent game. It will probably become a game that I revisit like once every two weeks or so, definetly not one I would play everyday. Collapse",6,1,1
12,Monster Hunter: World,SLTYSPTOON,"Mar 29, 2020","Honestly this game isn't very fun because of the clunky combat system and boring encounters. The combat system is probably the worst experience I've ever had, it's so clunky and every single time you miss it takes like 5 seconds to hit the monster again (and this is with a semi-fast weapon). The monsters are so mobile and the character just seems like a sloth in comparison making for an irritating experience. Also every single monster is different but it doesn't feel like it. The attacks are almost all the same (except for one elemental thing that the monster barely uses) and the way the monsters react are the same: you hit it a ton, it runs away and rinse and repeat until it's dead (except for the rare boss monster encounters).

Also you know that fun weapon and gear grinding! Yeah, it's pretty much useless because the game gives you the most OP gear to begin with (except for the weapons which are still decent) and it will take forever to find gear/weapons that are better than the ones you start out with.

And possibly the worst thing of all is the fact that the game barely lets you explore the open world that the game has to offer and even if we were able to the linearity of the world and clunkines of the movement and combat in game makes it more like an annoying obstacle you want to get over with and just find the monster you need to fight (and do it all over again when you die). There's such a beautiful open world and the game doesn't take advantage of it. Why can't we just explore the world and find monsters and hunt them along the way instead of being so limited.

Luckily the graphics are gorgeous and the story is great so I will give it a 5/10 (which is still kind of bad). It was just not what I was expecting and after coming from breath of the wild on the switch with amazing fluid combat, a beautiful open world taken advantage of and amazing graphics. I don't think this game should be exactly like breath of the wild, I just wish it had fluid combat and an open world taken advantage of like breath of the wild. Just don't buy until they fix these issues. Collapse",5,1,1

15,Monster Hunter: World,MadclownJack,"Dec 9, 2018","It's a mixed experience for me. I've played most of the 3ds titles and one PS2 title. I have a combined 400 hours of gameplay, so it's safe to say that i'm sort of a fan. MHW on the other hand is a good game, probably the best game in the series. There are a lot of things i like in it, but there are a lot of things i outwardly hate in it. So First, the good.

It's more streamlined, more fair to new players and it doesn't get tedious fast. Tracking a monster is easier than ever, with tracks and tracker flies. The maps are one big area with seamless transitions between segments, meaning no loading screens. Bigger item pouch, divided into two types of crafting materials, meaning more room for items and less grinding. You always have a map and items are marked on it until you are under attack. No more pickaxes, nets and whetstones needed, meaning more space saved. The graphics are great, albeit demanding at times. I use the 360 controller and so far it has been superb. The monsters however familiar, can be surprisingly challenging even to returning players. Also you can turn off most helpful options for a more hardcore experience. All in all a good game as a whole. Not great, but OK.

The Bad, are mostly issues that plague AAA games of late.

Still, it's sort of baffling to me how a company like Capcom can allow itself to skim on servers and server quality leaving millions of paying customers out in the dirt coping with constant server issues.

Camera can be annoying as it doesn't always stay locked on target, and when it does it's mostly at a weird angle where you can't see how the monster is positioned leaving you vulnerable to attack. Constant lock-on, lock-off is sort of tiring. I thought they'd fix this by now.

I'll never understand the need for Denuvo DRM. Isn't there a way you can protect your IP from piracy that doesn't involve installing what is basically a backdoor/spyware to paying customers? Anything is better than this.
So far i've not seen a way to change style.

There is also a myriad of sub-menues and options that make the UI a bit difficult to deal with.

Worst offense though, at least for me is NO WAY TO PAUSE in offline mode. I mean what the hell Capcom? How basic is that feature? Not all of us are soulless robots just pining to play this 24/7, no matter what you've been led to believe.

Like i said before, it's a good game, not without faults. After a while for me, the experience became all too familiar and a tad boring. New players should be fine, but returning players will find very little new things in terms of core gameplay. So, same old grindfest, with a touch of flair here and there. Collapse",6,7,8
16,Monster Hunter: World,AlMcFly,"Sep 1, 2018","6 / 10

i think a lot of people are either Vets or bought into the hype a bit too much. This is a decently above average game. Once you get used to the purposely slow (human) control scheme and get your groove, it's a fun game. Despite it being monotonous, it's somehow a fun game. This however is a VERY ""content-poor"" game though being sold at premium full-game price. Let's look at the facts:

1. Two hub/quest kiosk zones where you are alone (no online players visible) and Five world combat zones. That's it. Each zone is probably 1/100th of the size of zones in games like Breath of the Wild, Witcher 3, or any Elder Scrolls game. Fans will say ""but this is a MH game, not Elder Scrolls!"" Who cares. Irrelevent. That's not a valid rebuttal when people are simply pointing out that the MHW zones are small, few, and confining by comparison. If any other multiplayer game released with only five maps, people would laugh their @sses off at the ridiculous notion.

2. The game needs load screens, even on PC, and it's not a technically demanding game. Granted they are fairly fast load screens if you have a decent PC, but I hear they are abysmal on consoles. Pretty sure the optimization could be better. Your PC might run Crysis at max settings without issue, but your fps is going to drop insanely when Teostra shoots his laser beam at you. Doesn't really make too much sense.

3. The monster hunting is fun. Very fun. However, the game has what, like 10 - 15 truly unique monsters? Half of the monsters are either reskins of another or using the exact same movesets and skeleton, with a few minor special move changes. Compare Rathian with Blue Rathian, Rathalos, Kushala Daora. Compare Odagoron with Tobi-Kadachi. Diablos is just Anjanath with burrowing capabilities minus the fire breathing. Take away fire and burrowing, and all you have is two monsters that just non-stop charge at you. That's it. It's so uncomplicated, it boggles my mind. Even the big boss fight at the end of the story is just a damage-sponge with very little worry of death. HR mode is basically saying ""Hey, you just fought all the monsters in the game. GJ! Now fight them all again but they are a little stronger. After that, you get to fight the same monsters again, but they are Tempered now. Ooooooooh uh-maaaaazing!"" Absurd.

4. Grind. Holy sh*t the grind. I have about 150 hours put into this game and I'd estimate that around 100 hours of that is grinding the same monsters over and over for materials just to progress passed a storyline HR gating mechanism.

5. RNG and No Endgame. By HR Level 50, I have already fought every monster in the game literally 30 - 50 times, and I had to FORCE myself to reach HR 50. I kind of wanted to walk away at HR 30. Now my Endgame option is...fight those same monsters another 100 times each for a .01% chance at getting a useful Decoration you can slot into armor. Why would I need that decoration you ask? OH! To make fighting those monsters you've already fought 150 times easier to fight of course. Wait, what? I'm only grinding these monsters in order to make fighting these monsters easier? WTF?!? This game literally has no end goal. It's a game about fighting things over and over.

6. They probably could have found a better solution than the crappy item wheel and tool belt. Half the time in battles I am hammering away at the monster, and the other half I'm running around trying not to get hit while I am scrolling to find my mantle, trap, tranquilizers, flash bomb, ect. Annoying.

7. This game costs $60 or $70 depending on which version you get, the same price at release as aforementioned games like Witcher 3 and Breath of the Wild. That's a value disparity. This is not an opinion-based observation. It's a strict value-comparison. At $70, any reasonable person would choose one of those other games and get far more value. That is fact. If you've never played Witcher 3, you can probably buy it now somewhere for $20-30 (likely cheaper) and you will lose your life in that game for half a year. In a world where Witcher 3 exists, MHW should be laughed at. Hell, I probably got 1000% more actual playtime variety out of games like Super Mario 64 and Zelda A Link to the Past. I probably got more playtime variety out of Super Metroid. I'm not even going to compare this game to the likes of the Dark Souls franchise. That comparison is laughable at best.

This game is a shiny toy with very little depth. The armor/stat system is one-dimensional. It's repetitive. It has gating mechanisms that force grind. It's got an RNG system with very little point to participating. Fighting monsters is extremely fun though...for a while. The ""promise"" of future content and nostalgia (that I don't even have) is not worth $70 that I spent. If you were intelligent, you'd wait for a severe price drop or a year's worth of content before buying. Collapse",6,7,8
17,Monster Hunter: World,nitorita,"Sep 3, 2018","I'm a casual gamer and this is the only game in the series I've ever played. I skimmed through the negative reviews and I agree with the problems that the game has, but I feel that the scores are unfair and don't put consideration into the gameplay itself. Therefore, read on if you want a genuine review on what the game feels like, and what you should be aware of before you try the game out.

First off, the game is best enjoyed solo or with the SOS Flare multiplayer feature. Multiplayer is similar to Vermintide 2 where you can have up to a four players on a single quest. Unfortunately, the matchmaking system is busted for reasons others have already elaborated on, so if you want co-op, either play with your friends or use the SOS Flare feature in game. Always start the game offline to begin with (i.e. create your own server), and then join others later via SOS or the filter servers option. If you attempt to use the matchmaker at the main menu, the game might get stuck for a long time.

MHW is an action RPG where you go around killing bosses. The weapons are balanced insanely well so that you'll never overpower any boss by farming and building up your character, and high level players won't be able to do the same either when they join your game. I liked the way this was designed. The SOS Flare system is absolute genius because it allows you to easily find bosses you're looking for to farm or to open up your game for people to join without any difficulty.

Overall, the game is somewhat easy because the boss AI isn't amazing (definitely not Dark Souls level) and you have several lives and a copious amount of time to complete each quest. Sadly, bosses have insane health pools which make it a chore to peashoot them to death. Each boss takes at least 15 minutes to kill solo, or half the time if you do co-op. The game becomes more entertaining once you unlock the High Rank quests, so I suggest that you don't spend too much time doing sides until you've unlocked them.

Aesthetically, the game looks pleasing (if you can look past the poor optimization and the need to lower the graphics), and story-wise the game has a pretty good one. The game definitely goes at your own pace and is catered for casuals. Ultimately, as long as you can look past the counter-intuitive multiplayer system, you'll find that the game is a nice way to burn a few hours whenever you're bored. If you find the keyboard and mouse controls janky, just use a controller. I give the game a 7 for ""not quite there yet because it has its feed of problems but not bad if you can look past them.""

Navigating multiplayer is a nightmare, you need to jump through so many hoops. Want a smooth co-op campaign experience with friends? Forget about it. You need to all individually watch the cut scenes for every mission before you're allowed to co-op the story.

I really want to love this game but Capcom are making it so hard. Not worth the full price tag, wait until its on sale. Hopefully they'll have fixed the never ending list of issues by then. Collapse",5,7,12
25,Monster Hunter: World,qwerty100,"Aug 28, 2018","Broken. If it can't find a server (which is about 50% of the time) then it will completely stonewall you and stop you from playing at all. Inexcusable that this hasn't been fixed yet. While some connection issues are inevitable when you're playing with strangers this is beyond the pale.

This is combined with the extortionate price they're charging for a game that is severely padded out with filler content and repetitive grinding (the thrill of fighting a new monster for the first time is quickly diluted when the game forces you to kill them 5 more times in order to progress). The maps as well, while pretty and well designed, are very small for a modern RPG and do not really encourage or reward exploration. Overall I definitely can not recommend buying this game until they fix the aforementioned online issues and drop the price to more fairly reflect the amount of content on offer. Collapse",2,8,14
26,Monster Hunter: World,burningman92,"Aug 11, 2018","I bought this game hoping it would be good because it has great reviews, co-op, and I've heard a lot of great things about it from my friends who play it on console.

Single player is great... with a controller. Don't plan on using the mouse and keyboard you are so accustomed to as a PC gamer. Whoever worked at CapCom on this console port never played the game with the mouse and keyboard. You can't turn off mouse acceleration, which makes the mouse pretty much act like a joystick, you can't change certain keybinds in the settings, and the menu interface is definitely designed for console. Also you can't turn motion blur or bloom off. The game is, also, wayyy too bright even with the gamma turned down and volumetric fog off.

Co-op is unplayable at the moment. You WILL get disconnected when you play with friends IF you are able to join them in the first place (unless you are super lucky). You cannot progress through the story with your friends, either. One member of your party has to have previously done it solo. (Really Capcom?)

The graphics are also very, very bad for a AAA title like this. It looks like a console game at max settings and is overwhelmingly underwhelming. Most AAA games made in the past 5 years look much better than this game, imo. I think, honestly, Hitman: Absolution or Far Cry 3 have the same if not better graphics. Don't get me started on the textures.

If you like the Monster Hunter franchise, you own a controller or gamepad, you don't care about multiplayer or co-op, you are fine with sub-optimal graphics and performance, go ahead buy the game, it's great. For me, I just think it would be better if I waited for them to fix most of the things, that I think, are wrong with the game or waited until it was heavily discounted to buy it. I think CapCom could've done a better job and I'm extremely disappointed with what bag of feces they lit on fire and threw onto Steam's doorstep, sharpie'd on it ""ported and polished"".

keyboard bindings are fixable, but the defaults (V to aim? no drag and drop in menus, using Q and E in menu) just solidifies the notion that they did a console port to PC without a single thought about PC at all. Whoever set these probably hadn't even tested it on PC.

Overall, mouse+kb control scheme for this game are 100% objectively and factually (not an opinion) absolutely abysmal. As a console game, it's probably nice. But this review is for PC.

36,Monster Hunter: World,wildstars,"Aug 11, 2018","If you want to play with a specific friend or group of friends, the multiplayer matchmaking aspects of this game are terrible. If you want to play with a bunch of random people, it's merely bad. I have no idea how the actual multiplayer gameplay is because I could never get the matchmaking to work. And since that is the big hook on this game, that really sucks.

Quests have two difficulty levels, 1 player or 4 player. This is set when you pick how many players you possibly want to join you on a quest. Not by how many players are actually participating. So if you want to play with another friends, and you set the quest limit to two players, you had better hope you can get matchmaking to work, and that y'all can play like you are 4 people. And that is assuming you can get matchmaking to work.

All the secret steps you have to take in order to get quests to work with multiplayer remind me of hiccup cures, in that they may or may not work for you. Even if they do, they are very unintuitive, and not documented anywhere in the game. Want to do a story quest with friends? That is like getting four people to simultaneously flush four marine toilets. It's absurdly complicated. And undocumented. Then there are expeditions, which have a different set of absurd conditions and steps. And god help you if there is a cutscene involved, then that is a different set of steps.

Finally, you have to go through this garbage process every single time you take a new mission or expedition.

If you were expecting a game like any other PC coop multiplayer game (Borderlands, Nazi Zombie Army, Left 4 Dead, The Division, Dying Light, Killing Floor, Dead Island, etc, etc) where you get your group together and go play - prepare yourself to be exceptionally disappointed.

I've enjoyed the singleplayer, but it isn't as good as any other dedicated singleplayer game. They story and plot elements are basic and threadbare. Basically a framework to justify going out with a group of folks and murder monsters. And that is what I got this game for. I got this game to play with friends & family.

56,Monster Hunter: World,riaprone,"Aug 17, 2018","There is NOTHING about this game that is good enough to warrant a 9/10 rating. In the history of gaming, there's never been a port from console to PC that was any good. And sadly, I was right about this game as well.

What all the game play videos do NOT show people is the worst parts of the game.

So to keep it simple here's a list:

1. Camera system is terrible, you can tell it was a direct port from console and designed to work with gamepads and not PC mice.

2. The Combat system is slow and clunky at best.

3. Anyone using an pre-Haswell CPU is struggling with FPS stability (I do not have this problem i7-5930K) (Yes they are trying to figure out how to fix this issue)

4. The Game world is setup like SkyForge (Central Hub *by yourself* where you prepare to enter an instanced zone either by yourself or while having someone connect to your session or vice versa otherwise it's a single player game, with a poorly implemented coop/multiplayer mode: It felt like an afterthought at best))

5. Multiplayer is terrible at best, You would think after 8 months on Xbone, and PS4 they might have an idea of what network infrastructure would work? (Constant disconnects between player sessions) If I didn't know any better I'd say they were using Peer-Peer server hosting, because I can't believe a normal Network Infrastructure is this unstable and bad. Disconnects and error codes are common, and being forced into offline mode are expected. (No it's not my connection either, I have a 500Mb/sec / 50Mb/sec connection, and I ping 15-100ms or less everywhere in the U.S.

6. Character animations are poor at best, you cannot move while attacking at the same time. In other words for those of us who played a real Action Combat MMO: The character position is locked while attacking, so no you cannot circle strafe around a target.

7. If you were expecting this game to be an Action Combat System it's not. Not when you throw a game like Tera into the mix as a comparison.

Now there are only 2 things positive I can say about this game:

1. The Graphics

2. They do in fact have a mouse Y Axis invert option.

Beyond that, I can't say anything else good about it. The idea is sound, but the control mechanics, character animations, and clunky combat system makes it eye bleeding to deal with. Collapse",0,7,15

so if you're considering buying this game PLEASE be aware that you're not buying a proper PC version or even a port for that matter, you're buying a console version that will be played on your PC, the frame rate and the resolution you're gonna play in will be the same as the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One S and will very rarely go in the 60 FPS range, the only way to get a steady 60 FPS at 1080p unfortunately is to have a high-end PC (GTX 1080 coupled with a fairly recent i7) so if you're like me and own a medium range machine (GTX 1060/970 with an fairly recent i5) simply don't expect a fluid and stable experience that PC versions are known for, this is not what is delivered here.

So... do I recommend this game despite its garbage port ?

- if you can deal with what I said above and/or do not own the console version ? YES absolutely, the game is simply one that everyone that love grindy games should play

- if you expect to play it at a constant 60 FPS at 1080p with your average medium range PC and expect a good PC port/version ? NO absolutely NOT, this is one of the worst version available right now, if you do own it on your PS4 or Xbox One just don't bother buying this one, you'll get the same experience out of it on your already owned console copy, unless you have friends that are only on PC i would not reccomend Collapse",4,4,9

Work with others at times to accomplish the goal. There are many MMO like features. Paths of progression. But above all, plenty of weapons that offer extremely different feels. This is part of the problem some people may have. They pick a weapon that they end up not enjoying with. And instead of trying a new one they persist. But here´s the thing. The game does have the right weapon for you. Although the goal is to kill big beasts over and over again, they are all unique. And the game keeps on trowing new layers of things you can do such as exploring, researching, hunting and so on. This is not a game I would recommend to play alone. Hallf the fun is going out on missions with friends or calling out for help and getting some random people to assist you in killing that major beast. Above all the game successfully makes you feel like a real monster hunter. Now this is a non serious game with the typical Anime style animations. I understand this game can be divisive.

72,Monster Hunter: World,joshbreviews,"Aug 31, 2019","Detailed review as of mid-September. I'm new to the MH series.

Summary:
- Overall score 8. (Great game, but has MASSIVE flaws)
- Gameplay: 8 (What keeps this from being a 9.5 is the sheer tediouness; more on this below).
- Graphics: 9 (Poorly optimized. More on this below)
- Audio: 9 (Good music, good sound effects)
- Story: 6. (Not a huge factor in the final score - it's a game, not a book)

Gameplay PROs:
As a whole, solid and fun gameplay loop - buy weapons and items at HQ, go to the wilds to explore and find your objective, kill it or capture it, go home then do it again.
Lots of weapons, lots of different styles of play.
Lots of ways to cross-utilize resources (basically there are ways to convert certain unused resources into resources you want/need).
Lots of different bosses. If you enjoy Dark Souls, Nioh, and Bloodborne, but are new to Monster Hunter, then there is a good chance you will like this game.

Gameplay CONS:
TEDIOUSNESS. UNMITIGATED TEDIOUSNESS. To help me explain, allow me to make up a term for it...let's call it MICRO-DISRUPTIONS. How do I define micro-disruptions? They are moments in gameplay where you cannot do anything for several seconds. Examples - stopping to heal, getting knocked down, getting stunned, etc. So, the examples above are normal in games. You get knocked down in Bloodborne, you have to stop to heal in Dark Souls, etc. In a way, micro-disruptions add depth to the game because you have to plan around prevention/minimization of said micro-disruptions. HOWEVER, in Monster Hunter World, micro-disruptions are EVERYWHERE and are EXTREMELY LOOONG. I promise you, you will NOT be able to go ONE MINUTE without being interrupted. To make things worse, this is a VERY SLOW game. If you thought Dark Souls was slow, this is MUCH, MUCH SLOWER. The micro-disruptions in Dark Souls are already long, usually 2-3 seconds (healing, getting knocked down then getting up, buffing your weapon, etc). In Monster Hunter World, micro-disruptions are far, far LONGER and more TEDIOUS, specially since one micro-disruption often leads to another. Let me give you a basic example from MHW - when you have to heal, you have to sheathe your weapon (~1.5 seconds), drink up the potion (~4 seconds), now you're ready to fight! So draw your weapon again (~1.5 seconds). That's 6 seconds of you not playing the game. Not good. Adding to our example, take into consideration that while you're healing, your chances of getting hit are greater (slow movement, weapon and shield tucked away). If you do get hit - and this will happen OFTEN specially when you're a beginner, the whole process of getting knocked down and getting up takes ~4 seconds. Don't forget that your healing was interrupted, so you have to attempt to heal AGAIN. Another ~4 seconds. Another source of extreme tedium is how fast monsters move and how often they run away. I understand that it makes sense for monsters to outpace you no matter what cause they're so much bigger; but while it makes sense, it results in tedious gameplay. If a monster does a dash or charge attack, you're guaranteed to have to run to it for ~2-8 seconds. This is assuming it doesn't charge in another direction while you're running toward it, which would mean you run more again. Then, eventually, no matter how little damage you've managed to do, the monster will fly or run away. You will now have to find it again. Even if your scoutflies (GPS, basically) know exactly where the monster is, you're guaranteed to run toward it for several minutes. Remember that these monsters have massively high health pools. The end result is battles last anywhere from ~15 minutes to ~40 minutes, only ~60% of which is actually spent in the battle.
These individual micro-disruptions are not so bad on paper, and they probably sounded good to the developers when they were making the game, but in practice, I can say with confidence it has a disastrous effect on enjoyment.
This slowness makes the game needlessly cruel to beginners and even for experienced players. At any point in a battle, there is a distinct chance that you will be micro-disrupted for anywhere from 5 seconds to 15 seconds. Remember that these disruptions often chain together. Bad game design.
Instead of making the game this slow they should have sped up the whole thing instead. Examples: sprinting should be much faster, item use should be much faster, knock-down-get-up should be much faster, etc etc etc. Of course monster should be faster to compensate. If Monster Hunter World were as fast as, say, Nioh, it would've been a 9.5 out of 10 for me. Easily. But it's not. D*mn shame.

Graphics:
Beautiful visuals, but on i5-4690, GTX1070, 24 GB RAM, I'm getting 30-60 FPS. The dips are intense. Hard to enjoy fully. CPU heavy! I'm not sure how they would go about fixing this, but it needs to be addressed. Everyone below my specs is having a worse time trying to run this game. Not good. Needs optimization!

76,Monster Hunter: World,2k19Rev,"Mar 21, 2019","This is my second game into the MH franchise, the first being 3 Ultimate.

Throughout playing the game, graphic wise it is completely revamped, it has a lot more texture and quality to the world design which gives it more aesthetics. Cut scenes are beautiful and appealing but are not skippable which in some cases makes gameplay longer for no reason. Setting it on max graphic does give you the best experiences but slows down actual gameplay and has surreal lags throughout. Other than that it is open and looks good 8/10.

Gameplay is pretty wonky, movement is delayed by a bit and sensitivity isn't too good which none can be changed. Slower weapons like the great sword or switch axe tend to have the most problems with timing as attack delay is more noticeable compared to the other weapons. Next thing is playing on keyboard just ins't recommended because the key bindings are set to weird keys and you can easily forget each placement without long hours of practicing. A controller on the hand just works better and gives you maximum control. Going into gameplay itself it feels just like the other series but slightly more boring. An experienced veteran player are able to run through things faster because the attacking patterns of each monster is practical almost the same. While as newer players spend longer time periods because the tutorial teaches you nothing. Over time some find it boring as the actual storyline is non-existence with only repetitive events and there is no character development throughout at all. The Pros to this are the SOS system is quite nice, it sets up a room and other people can join at any given time to play with you, but there are sometimes connection errors which after that playing solo is more viable than co-op. 6/10

Overall, the game does feel like a MH game but leans more towards veteran players who want to zip through and grind out materials, while for newer players allows them to explore a more open and casual hunt without any difficulty hurdles. It is a good game if you want to just have fun and play with friends but not really something you would spend most of your free time on since its just grinding and repetitive for the most part.

80,Monster Hunter: World,Medhead,"May 10, 2019","Having played Monster Hunter since the start, I can confirm Monster Hunter: World is a culmination of everything the franchise has been wanting to do since the start. If you don't think so, it's okay, everyone can have their own opinions. Except you, ♥♥♥♥ you elitist prick.

I will now point out all the reasons World is better than any other game in the franchise and in order to appeal to both veterans and newcomers into the franchise, I'll be comparing it to the older ones the newcomers haven't played yet:

◘ The maps aren't a cluster of small-segmented areas divided by an inconvenient loading screen of 10 - 30 seconds. They are all combined into one BIG map. And when I say big I don't mean: ""Hey Ron, you know that sausage you ate during our BBQ last weekend at my place. It was pretty big, huh."" I mean Notorious B I G levels of scale. The maps are all ample in both ground level and verticality; each area is connected in ways that even after dozens of hours of gameplay you'll still be finding new shortcuts to transverse the level. And that's without mentioning the ♥♥♥♥-ton of items, creatures and resources spread around everywhere.
◘ The combat staple in Monster Hunter has always been your commitment to the hits and your actions, be it to chug a potion as slowly as humanly possible, or to spend fifteen seconds loading a hit with your greatsword only to have the monster move his head at the last second leaving you to hit the floor in embarrassment as your other teammates look at you in disapproval of your life choices. In the same vein of the combat in DARK SOULS. Ok, with the required DARK SOULS mention in the review out of the way, let's move on to why World's combat kicks♥♥♥♥♥ They lowered your commitment to the attacks and items JUST enough so you wouldn't want to kill yourself everytime you accidentally use a whetstone in the middle of battle. ""NO Richard. Right now is not the time to sharpen your sword. Why? Oh I dunno. Maybe because there's a ♥♥♥♥ing dragon about to light your♥♥♥♥♥on fire! You know what, I'm done. We are done. I tried to put effort into this marriage but it's just not working out for me. I want you out of my parent's house by eight tomorrow. And no, you can't take our computer. Get a job."" Also, mounting attacks.
◘ The Handler.

If even after everything I just said you still think Monster Hunter 4, or Monster Hunter 1 for PS2(Hah!) is better.

The game had a bug that was fixed, but after an update, the game just became unplayable! No matter what graphics quality you are (ultra, high, medium or low), no matter that your windows and your graphics driver are fully updated, the game locks and locks the entire computer together, forcing you to restart it in order to use your machine.

84,Monster Hunter: World,ZePieMan,"Aug 13, 2018","So firstly I'd like to say this is my first Monster Hunter Game I've played and I would just like to say that I love it already! One thing i'd like to address asap that I noticed about low score reviews on here, is that they really, REALLY dislike the animations of your characters during fighting, and think of it as clunky. well, fun fact, that's because its SUPPOSED to be. unlike your typical multi-weapon based game, weapons in MH:W aren't made of paper and plastic and you can't just fling a sword thrice as big as you like it doesn't weigh anything. battles are HECTIC, with environmental traps and places to use a grappling hook for quick mobility, and at all times during a battle you'll be thinking on your feet. However, this game isn't a hack-and-slash where you can just button mash and expect things to die, you have to plan your strikes(and positioning if you're using a ranged weapon) before you make them or you'll be punished for attacking in the wrong way at the wrong time. Bows for example let you run around pretty well and let you stay agile, while a lance-and-shield will make you extremely sluggish but will allow you to take extremely minimal damage while blocking, and I LOVE this system, to many games I have played where you can just button mash and things die without even being in the Hack-And-Slash genre, its refreshing to play this.

The maps look beautiful and vibrant, and of course, so do the monsters! speaking of the monsters, I found the adaptive AI really awesome, especially during a few instances so far of 1 monster attacking another monster I'm currently fighting, which is something that is completely unscripted.

Now, I do have some gripes with the game, Which is why im not giving it a 10, which, I agree with low score reviews, the game is pretty poorly optimized. I have a 1070Ti (overclocked as high as I could take it safely I might add) with a Ryzen 2700x OC'd CPU, and this game still can not reliably hit 60 fps without me turning some settings down a little unless I'm in a very open area without a lot of density, or i'm in non-busy floors of the main hub area. during gameplay I'm looking at around 50-65 fps with lows as bad as 40, but, highs reaching the high 70's. Hopefully some patches get released that will get this game ""unchugged"".

I also don't enjoy the lack of depth to character creation, but I understand that certain aspects (such as size and body type) could cause some issues of game balance if they were to have immersive gameplay effects such as someone overweight moving slower than a fit body type, or a short character being much harder for the monsters to hit if their hitbox was also reduced to fit their height.

all in all, the game so far is very enjoyable for me, and as someone that's always been on the low end hardware side of life for the last 20 or so years, and only just now finally getting a beefy PC, turning down a few settings to get the game at a stable 60 frames isn't the end of the world for me. on a completely unrelated note, I did notice some people saying the Co-op is unstable. I've done a LOT of hunts so far, and with those, I did the majority single-player, I will admit to that. However every single multiplayer session i've done has had no issues whatsoever, but, I'm, speaking for myself, I'd say try the game out, try to rush through the tutorial as fast as you can with the default character model(you can have up to 3 character profiles at once and can just delete the profile after) so you can do the multiplayer as soon as possible to see if it gives you issues. if you enjoy the game when doing your first quest tutorial, and there are no problems with multiplayer, delete that profile or just begin a new game and take your time with that profile, and have fun :) Collapse",9,4,14

Gameplay: 9.5 (Many weapons with new features, no palico controled gameplay tho. Gathering is fun now, but feels clunky).

94,Monster Hunter: World,MarcusAgapus,"Sep 4, 2018","I have never played a Monster Hunter game before, but Monster Hunter World made me fall in love with it. It has a different kind of combat system than I am used to, but after you get the hang of it it's really fun. It has a fair amount of combos that you can use, but there are only a couple that you will always do. There's many different kind of trees for each weapon and armour, also monsters, but I still hope they will add some more which would make the gamers play it longer. Not saying you can get every armour/weapon quickly, you can play this game for hundreds of hours(especially with friends), also you can always switch to another weapon and master it, which would make the experience longer.
This game also has some faults:
Many people complain that this game is a bad PC port and let's face it the optimization is quite poor. The game uses a huge amount of CPU power. I have an I7 6700K + GTX 1070, running the game on 1080p with maxed settings(with 1-3 options turned down to medium/slow), and on a mission/quest I get around 67-80 FPS.
Also the audio bug is a bit annoying, but doesn't take away from the experience.
Haven't had any connection issues so I can't give you my opinion on that.
It's a bit sad that you can't play the campaign in team, I mean you can, but every member has to watch the cutscenes separately and after that you can group up. Collapse",9,2,8
95,Monster Hunter: World,Cyph3rPunk,"Aug 13, 2018","Gameplay is is very tight and fluid, but in its own way. I have 300+ hours on PS4, and mechanically it feels no different. Yes, it takes some time to get used to with the heavy weapons that punish you horribly for button mashing by animation locking you to your death, but once you get it down, its very rewarding. I can see how it can be precieved as being clunky for new comers (especially with the ""Great Sword is easy"" ranking it gives you, when its one of the hardest weapons to use properly).

After playing with KB/M for a bit, I ended up having to plug in my controller. The game just does not feel suited for KB/M and the inability to turn off mouse acceleration is extremely noticeable and got me killed several times.

As for framerates, I can hit stable 60 FPS @ 1440P with Volume Rendering Quality set to off and all other settings at max with a 6600k and a 1070... if I have everything closed in the background. CPU usage frequently hits 70%. With that, Discord, and Chrome running in the background, it can chug every now and then.

Overall, its the game I love on the PS4 and I personally havent been hit with all the bugs everyone else are reporting (like the Cutscene crash bug deleting your save). This would be a 9/10 if the port quality was better, so taking 2 points off for that, lack of 21:9 support (It says 3440x1440 in the menu but only displays 2560x1440) and the current issue that it seems to be a crapshoot to join in progress hunts with friends. We typically all have to back out load into the fight from the base camp rather than coming to help someone mid hunt.

As it stands, I pretty much only bought it to play with friends who dont have a PS4. I'll still be doing all my high level hunts on it (currently farming Arch Tempered Teostra) until things smooth out a little bit with the PC port. Collapse",7,1,4

The game went from disastrous release to a smooth sail in a couple of weeks. After a few tweaks and fix here and there from Capcom, Monster Hunter World is finally enjoyable on PC. The most annoying issues I had before was connectivity and mouse camera control that feel sluggish (even though I mainly use gamepad, but sometimes switch to mouse/keyboard). Now:
- No more server issues.
- Mouse camera controls are very fluid.

The graphic is certainly amazing. It is certainly a major improvement from previous installment in the series. Some people are complaining about low texture quality, but I don't feel bothered with it because when I'm on the hunt, don't usually pay much attention to it.

The gameplay is challenging as ever, with ridiculous hitboxes and the sluggish movement of your character even when using light weapon like dual blade or sword & shield. But all that hurdle will be rewarded with the iconic music at the end of the quest, but with the most awkward last hit. ""A little poke to the toe of that Nergigante, bam, quest finished. Okay I guess, let's carve it.""

I think things that lacking now are, the optimization of keyboard control (Rename loadout with escape? Oh come on. And don't forget to press F1-F4 first before using items in quest), and the lack of meaningful event. I get it, baby steps toward better future right? But those steps're better be like Xeno'jiva's one, or people will lose patiences with this already scarce roster of monsters.

It is true that it's much easier than the previous titles, but that is supposed to be the reason behind introducing the PC or the new players market to the Monster Hunter franchise. The reason for a score of 8/10 is as follows:

1. Rocky launch (the first 30-45 days), but it has been improving considerably!
2. A little repetitive (but it's a given for the franchise, and it's my own humble opinion)
3. A quite small roster of monsters than the previous titles
4. Crashes from time to time due to graphics card crash (although I have a 1060 and an i7 6th gen and playing on medium graphics settings), but rarely (almost never) now due to the performance updates
5. Connection problems if you tabbed out or doing something else on your computer

2,Monster Hunter: World,Trollripper,"Jan 10, 2020","I played this game around 19 Hours. I used Guides for Combat and also for hunting so i can get behind the idea real quick in 2020.

Positives :
- Graphics are still ok and has some enjoyable moments.
- The Idea behind the ""Hunt monsters and get stronger so you can beat more monster"" is neat but also frustrating sometimes.
- Almost every NPC in this game looks unique
- Beating huge Monsters
- a good amount of decorations and armor

Negatives :
- Combat system is disgustingly bad. If you like precise controls.. avoid this game. The Combat is clunky as hell and after 20 hours of trying.. i gave up. You are locked in combat stances and the character wont move unless you stop smashing the attack button or certain combos. Targeting does nothing except switching between targets so the camera can go ape **** and turn away from the selected target but even than your character refuses to relocate himself.

- Stoy and Characters are so bad.. even a 12 year old could write a better story/character arc.

- The handling of the controls are awful and the camera movements aren't good either. You have to manually change them until you found the perfect spot between ""slow camera rotation"" and ""OMFG what is happening.. ""

- This game looks dead. No one wants to help new players at all. You are stuck on certain points in the game after you unlock the option to craft better gear.
I tried the multiplayer 10 times on different time zones and only 2 out of those had up to 3 players.. ready to help me.

- I did not like the ""tutorials"" at all. They felt like rushed piece of crap. It was simple written down but it was more like ""You can do this and that but dont ask if you can unlock other things later or do other stuff on certain times or whatever. Please have no questions!

Sin más comentar que el juego base es del todo estupendo, la optimización del mismo está algo ajustada debido a esa explotación de la CPU la cual requiere tanto y que junto con Danuvo no ayuda demasiado, pero teniendo una buena base RAM y una 960 Nvidia de pasada generación, este título luce de manera notable.

The combat is incredibly varied, as not only do the 14 different weapon types have seperate animations, they have their own set of combos as well. This makes each type of weapon play in unqiue ways, which makes the system always feel fresh.

Finished the main story line and did some grinding afterwards. There were some network issues that needed sorting in the beginning but for the most part the game is stable now.
- Graphics are good - but you do need good hardware. I run Intel I-7, 16 GIG RAM and 1070 ti with everything max settings no issue. (No 4K monitor though...).
- All keys are customisable and i recommend you spend some time fixing some of the painful mapping that people frequently speak about. XBOX controller worked without any tweaking required. Plug it into the PC and it works.
- I can make some recommendations as well:
----- the top tier drops are out of reach for 99% of players with exceedingly low drop rates
----- annoying game design, its awesome in the beginning to traverse the levels in the home base and go back and forth to your room which quickly gets old. I wish i could just do everything from my storage chest. (Forging, changing cat gear, collecting harvests, tail-raiders etc.
----- There are a lot of features like how to manage your quick bar, which aren't immediately obvious. Spend some time on YouTube for the hints.
----- Move set combos missing from the hunters notes or tutorials. Again thanks to all the YouTube content creators out there.

18,Monster Hunter: World,pointdownguy,"Aug 20, 2018","From my experience, this game is an absolute delight on pc. But from what I've seen from all the negative reviews, there are 3 problems with the game. 1) some people think it runs like a turd. I have not had an issue with how the game runs. I'm not much of a graphics snob, I just want 60-50 fps and I'm fine, and MHW delivers on that. I have a middle of the road $900ish pc and with medium graphic settings and v sync turned off, I have no problems maintaining at least 50 fps during 99% of my time playing the game. The only issues I have with my frame rate is typically at the end of hunts when everyone puts bombs at the monsters head and they all blow up at once and it causes my game to freeze for a second, but nothing more. 2) Bad controller support. Once again, for me this was no issue. I played dauntless before this was released and I found that these games play and handle very well on mkb so thats what I chose to play mhw on. Especially since I am a bowgun main, where aim is a part of how good the weapon is, being able to use mkb is a blessing for me. And for anyone who is okay with playing on mkb, I promise after a couple hours you'll feel like a natural. The mkb controls are highly modifiable in every regard and you can swap any button you want to whatever feels comfortable. 3) The last issue is with matchmaking. I play probably about 65% of this game solo and it works just perfectly for that 65% of the time and then on the other 35% of the time I play with friends or with randoms, I have connectivity issues about 10%-15% of the time. so not much of my time is spent in matches where I get booted. I will say however that how this system is handled is incredibly poorly designed. Say you are in a hunt with 4 other people, the monster will scale its HP up to accommodate all 4 players, and when you DC, you don't get sent back to the home world, you continue through the hunt by yourself with the monster who's HP is still scaled up, so you basically have to abandon the quest because the monster in basically invincible. Also sometimes when you are trying to load into the game and you select matchmake to put you into a server, it will stall for a few minutes and give you an error message, again, this is easily remedied by filtering your search criteria and selecting a server manually, or just creating your own session, I have never in my already 60+ hours in this game been let down by doing either of those two things. Other than those 3 things, which are really just mild inconveniences to sensible people who aren't snobs like many in the pc gaming community are, this game is absolutely wonderful. I beat the main story on console but refrained from playing any past that point in waiting for the pc release and now that it is finally here, this game is as incredible as I hoped it would be and i couldn't possibly recommend any other game as much as I recommend this game.

36,Monster Hunter: World,Hecate2014,"Oct 5, 2019","Beautiful game. I always dream to play MH titles on PC, and my dream comes true. PC control is finely tuned so you will not experience any ""this is a crappy port"" moment. There are options to change control scheme, those complain about controls probably did not discover the option to switch to mouse. (Go over to setting, there are options that ask you what alternative you want to use, and will suggest an alternative for KB&M.)

Weapons. As the game is on PC, and animations are much more fluid than previous titles, so it becomes a bit easy as weapons are much more responsive now.

MH has its own combat system, and people tend to criticize it for being clunky or something. It is supposed to be clunky, so that every action is a risk-reward decision making. Back in 2G, Khezu was my teacher. It taught me when to strike, and when to roll away, and never be greedy. MHW lacks a monster like Khezu, so players might have a difficult time to learn how to play MH.

First MH game was released in 2004, and Demon Soul was released in 2009, so please do not consider MH a soul game, and do not expect to play like in soul game in MH. With an open mind, you will quickly learn how to play the game, including some delicate details like rolling backwards when facing forwards is slower than rolling backwards when facing backwards.

37,Monster Hunter: World,GrungeHamster,"Nov 10, 2019","While the initial launch of the PC version of the game was fairly rocky. Monster Hunter World has become a game well worth the time and money. The team have added a great deal of free content including quests, monsters, weapons, armor and more.

In Monster Hunter World you take on the role of a new hunter of great beasts ranging from reptiles the size of sedans, to wyverns and dragons as big as a house. You have a wide variety of weapons to choose from. Weapons you can fire from further away, swords for getting close and personal and even a horn for supporting allies and bashing monsters.

This game is one of the most rewarding franchises you can play. You can spend your time refining your skills with your weapon, tracking and following monsters, learning their weaknesses and hunting them down. Hunts are only as easy as you make and prepare for them. When you finally do take that monster down, you are rewarded with components you can use to upgrade your weapons and armor. Make heftier and stronger gear to hunt the next great beast.

Perhaps the weakest aspect of the game is that this title carries the smallest list of available monsters you hunt. While that is a shame considering the monsters themselves are the content. This has been fixed with the patches mentioned earlier as well as the recent DLC content 'Iceborne'.

If you're a fan of action games and like the idea of playing co-op online to take on massive monsters, this game is for you.

I have playerd MH4U(650h) and MHGU(350h), and then MHW on PS4 Pro (100h) when it launched, stopped for a long time, and started again from the start on PC (100h as of now). Playing on PC the game feels much more fluid than on PS4 Pro!! (I7-9750H + 1660Ti)

My first impression while playing it on PS4 was: the game is good. Loading times are terrible. Something is just not quite there yet.

There are some differences to make it easier for newcomers, and they were so well thought that the the essence of Monster Hunter is still very much there, without scaring away unexperienced players.

Mastering the game rewards the player as much as it did on previous games, and is just not for anyone. Still, there are loads of content and hours of fun without the need to master it, just by playing with online with randoms, playing with your friends, being a fashion hunter, trying to learn new weapons, playstyles and combos, and so much more.

What could be better? Weapon designs were a little uninspired at first, but Iceborne fixed that. Multiplayer is weird. Weird decisions, clunky menus.

Also, as someone who started playing when the ball was already rolling, there is just so much content, so many event quests, so many unlockables, I am having a hard time trying to catch up. But I guess that's a good thing, right? More bang for your buck.

48,Monster Hunter: World,zerobane,"Oct 31, 2021","Bought on steam sale to see what all the hype was about. Like most ports from PlayStation it was fairly terrible by PC standards and is geared heavily towards younger console crowd purposely.

Overall
The gameplay is what I would call ""epic loot drop grinder""; most of the gameplay and story seems to revolve around grinding loot with the same basic mission over and over again. Hunt a monster, use its parts to make gear, and then hunt a larger monster. Wash and repeat 400x times.

Has a bubbly almost anime feel to game; little too Saturday morning cartoon feeling at times.

Controls:
Holy clunky! Laggy and just awful feeling. Monsters are sllllooooowww and simple to dodge. Just not optimized at all. Pales in comparison to games like Witcher or destiny with the very connected feel you have to character movement and fast paced action. I see what the game is trying to push; you learn the simple patterns each monster has and then weapon set you are using. Maximize the damage output. This takes 5-10mins to master for most that are use to exploiting patterns (any DS players will laugh at the simplicity of it).

Missions:
Wash and repeat same mission with different baddies. Small adds for 10mins or so; then large ""epic"" for 15-20mins. By the end of combat I was mindlessly bored out of my mind.

Story:
Seems meh at best; something something new world, build a camp, hamorny with monsters, etc..

Crafting:
Rich and complex; if this is your thing; this is your game.

Conclusion:
Appeals greatly to anyone who loves ""complex loot and crafting, farming with fairly quick and regimented combat cycle"". Combat styles galore with a focus on anticipation and learning patterns.

54,Monster Hunter: World,Sholva,"Nov 1, 2021","A decent version of a really good game.

As a PC user that didn’t have a PS2 back in the days, I never played any of the console exclusive Monster Hunter titles, I knew them, saw them, even other people I knew back them, talking about them and playing them, but never did so myself.

So when it comes to actual first hand impressions, World was my first MH game, so no bias here of any sort, really. I think this game is really enjoyable, gameplay wise, it’s not just “button mashy” at all, combat is quite methodical, if you don’t want to get hit every time a monster attacks, and probably it is what I like about the combat, the most. I mean, I would probably enjoy it too if this had…Devil May Cry style combat, but that’s not the point, it just fits the game as it is.

I played this game when it was released, went through a few rough patches here and there (mostly a known driver issue on Nvidia GPUs, back in the day, resolved in a couple weeks), and here we are today.

To this day, still surprises me that this game uses the MT Framework engine, not because it is really old, but because how well holds up still to this day, and how good the game can look , especially in cutscenes (and more so in the Iceborne expansion), some scenes have really nice detail.

I have played this game on different PCs over the years: first on my old intel i5 4690K with a GTX 1070, it was fine at 1080p and a moderate amount of High settings mixed with some stuff tuned down a bit, CPU usage was a bit rough at launch though, but it improved a lot later on.

Currently, I play on a Ryzen 5 3600 and a RTX 3060 Ti, and of course it runs much better but, this game is still quite demanding both on the CPU and GPU. At Max Settings, this game barely does 40 FPS at 4K on this GPU, without DLSS. It is a shame though that it’s still DLSS 1.9 I believe, and not the newer and much better looking and performing DLSS 2.X, and I do hope one day Capcom make the switch to that one, to this day most games that initially supported the older DLSS have switched to the improved one. This would also allow DLSS to be used at 1080p or any other arbitrary resolutions, because at the moment, being the older DLSS tech, can only be enabled for 1440p and 4K.

When it comes to Controls and Keybinds, I think Capcom did a decent job overall for this port, there’s a small amount of keys that cannot be bound , like DEL for instance, but for the most part, I can bind most of my usual keys (I’m left handed, btw). I can play this game with no particular issues with Keyboard and Mouse and it is, in fact, my preferred control method for this game. The ability to use shortcuts for items with keys is quite useful and less cumbersome than using the stick on the gamepad on a radial menu, but that’s my personal preference really.

All in all, I think it’s no surprise this game has sold so many copies across all the systems it released, of course many “older fans” of the series may not have all they wanted from MH condensed in this single title, but for a wider audience it seems this game hit the right spots in many ways.

I can only imagine how much better (and performing) an RE Engine MH game with the budget of World would be in the future. MH Rise is coming in 2022 to PC, but that one is a “scaled down” game, technically, to accommodate for the Switch hardware, but my point is that Capcom took MT Framework (which they know pretty well, they’ve been using it since forever) and made this huge game here, so when they finally make the jump to RE Engine on the next mainline entry, it could be something interesting.

My only issues with the game though, is that it often loses the online connectivity when minimizing the game, it’s been a bug since the game launched, and still happens, probably doesn’t like to be “inactive” for a split second when it minimizes, or something.

Another issue is that the game’s lighting is quite often very “bloomy”, to exaggerated levels even, it looks nice at night but at day time…sometimes certain surfaces and the sky can look very over exposed and with too much bloom. I also heard the game had lots of issues with HDR, especially when it launched, not sure how that works nowadays, since I don’t use HDR myself.

Overall, this would be a game I would’ve spent like 5k hours already, if I didn’t play any other games, because there’s a lot to do, and different weapons to master, if you do enjoy following that route. Having “only” played a few hundreds of hours, I can still say they were well spent, and I don’t get tired of coming back to the game, now and then. Collapse",9,0,0

And a lot of them have been streamlined, such as crafting and some aspects of harvesting. That was always a tedious but essential aspect of the old ones, and while it's still present it's much easier and faster. I have friends trying this as their first MH game disappointed by the grindy nature of the game. They also misinterpreted the multiplayer aspect, thinking there was couch coop.

El juego no es perfecto, sobre todo en la versión de PC, no hay soporte de mods (aunque las texturas si se pueden cambiar), no está bien optimizado, hay opciones gráficas no modificables (DOF, Blur, Bloom, FOV, 21:9) lo que es una pena, y es un juego de CONSOLA porteado a PC, casi obligatorio el uso de mando para jugarlo en condiciones. Con todos los puntos negativos descritos, el juego merece la pena ser jugado, es divertido y reconfortante cuando vences. Además, periódicamente se añade contenido nuevo gratuito lo que mantiene a la comunidad activa.

I have been playing Monster Hunter since my childhood and the license continues to make me dream after all these years.
The monsters are beautiful and interesting to finally face in an open world which is also magnificent and alive.
The only downside is the customization of the weapons which is much less important than in the previous shutters or with each improvement the weapon changed visually to give a feeling of progressions and real improvement after a long work to collect all the resources. While now the weapons change very little visually, it's a shame, but the weapons available are really pretty.

Weapons have a deep learning curve and you will not be able to perry or dodge like crazy. The idea behind Monster Hunter is that as a hunter, you are very vulnerable and the enormous monster in front of you is way stronger than you in every way. So, you can't just press buttons randomly and hope for the best. Getting used to monster hunting takes fairly a long time and you will not master the combat in a couple of hours, that's for sure.

Portal has a great storyline which was a lot better and deeper than I'd expected - the added ""Achievements"" and Bonus levels (6 advanced levels and 3 disciplines (least steps, least portals, least time) as challenges in the 6 levels) give enough extra playtime to justify for the short story mode. I really hope Portal will have a successor; luckily, you can hear a few lines in the developer commentary mode talking about the Black Mesa versus Aperture relationship that will be explained more in-depth than in the first release of Portal.
Portal has already provided me with lots of fun (and nightmares from the creepy GLaDOS) - I still have some challenges to fulfil and some moves to master, so it's a 10 from me. Collapse",10,3,3

Granted, Episode 2, Bioshock and several others will still rank higher and hold more appeal and replay, Portal is still probably a greater game because of what it represented and what it does rather than itself alone. The gameplay mechanics were awesome, but it was short and left you really wanting to take this idea to the next level. At the moment, it feels like a super demo for the technology of the portal gun. The cool part about it is that it'll appeal to a larger crowd than the FPS players. Casual gamers will find it highly appealing, though perhaps not at the individual price it's being offered given that casual gamers will probably not be drawn to Team Fortress 2 or Half-Life 2 or its episodes.

I'd give away some of my favorite comments to make about this game, but they'd be spoilers. But I still have a few good things to add: The voice-acting, and yes apparently this is the voice acting of one certain Ellen McLain and not computer synth, was superbly done. Truly, at the risk of a pun, the icing on the cake. The storyline, although short, makes a wonderful dark little comedy within a science-fiction setting. The end titles, and what was done with it, had me howling with laughter. The gameplay is wonderfully original. As much as I enjoy my FPS-style games, this is a nice change of pace. Yes, there are bullets and rockets fired in the game, but you never get more than the portal gun yourself. You're forced to defend yourself purely with your wits and your agility.

The gameplay mainly consists of using a specialised handheld device to create 2 portals, one orange and one blue. Entering one of those instantly causes the player to exit out the other one, and this simple element alone is utilised in a variety of ways to solve a wide range of different puzzles, involving buttons and cubes, turrets, electricity balls and death traps. Additionally to the puzzle solving, the game has a somewhat of an interesting humourous feel to it, ending up with a wide variety of inside jokes that many people still use on the net repeatedly. So far the main drawback for me is that the game is very short, even though it's short and sweet.

The game doesn't have a very complex detailed plot, but the one and only speaking character in it (GLADOS) makes it one of the best video game stories of all time. Her dark humor is one of the best parts in the game. The puzzles in the game increasingly get difficult as the game progresses (don't worry, the first few puzzles are very easy) to the point where they are so maddening that you want to throw your keyboard at your computer screen, but the moment you have your ""aha-moment"" and then complete the puzzle and hear an insult from GLADOS, all of the anger you previously had disappears and you feel very accomplished. The graphics are suitable but a tad bit plain for me. Portal can get very buggy and takes a very long time to load, which is probably its biggest flaw. The sound is perfect, as lines from GLADOS are more than enough to keep you satisfied. Gameplay-wise, Portal is very unique, letting your take control of a gun which lets you shoot portals you can traverse through. This leads to very interesting puzzles.

The game is long enough to unfold some plot, and short enough to stay fresh all the way through. The humor from GLaDOS is spot-on, and darkly hilarious for truly anyone. It's mostly nonviolent. And, one of the best features of the game, the gaping, mysterious plot holes which leave no doubt that Portal and everything with it, such as Aperture Science, GLaDOS, and the player character, Chala, are part of the unfolding Half-Life universe. Even the song at the end (absolute genius lyrics and tune) makes massive suggestions towards the plot. The atmosphere is at the same time lit up and perfectly dark and twisted, and story speculation is the name of the game as you replay a few of the game's phenomenal maps with the difficulty ramped up.

Just when I thought games were starting to lack originality and interesting concepts, valve made something that shined brightly above the rest. The graphics.. now feel a little dull, but it was the source engine it was released on, and being the first thing released within the orange box, upon preordering and waiting.. it was a great game and although short, made it re playable. Also to others who think it is to short.. do the bonus levels.. some of them will keep you thinking longer then the actual game does.. and are a great challenge, personally i only could be bothered with six or seven, and about half of the other challenges.. GLaDOS, is a great villain, of which if you do not have sound on during this game.. you will miss out.. and as most of the community unfortuantely knows.. the cake is a lie, and on top of that.. poor companion cube.. forever lost within that flames.. after pointless attempts to exploit a way to save it.. (so many lying youtube videos..) If you have not played it... do so, and if you feel like something different, a group released a portal prequel, as such.. which is literally exactly the same pretty much. Except it is based before GLaDOS was booted up. Warning though, it does have quite a few sexist comments, in parts.. but that does not ruin it really.. since it brings forward a few new challenges, and an interesting different look at the game.

The game is how long you want it to be. If you choose just to solve the puzzles and not listen to all the things GLaDOS (the voice that talks to you throughout the game) says, it is true the game will be short. You must listen to the things GLaDOS says to you to enjoy the full experience of the game. This game will run on just about any PC; it has very low system requirements compared to most other games out there today. If you have a high end PC, expect to see over 120 frames per second (I know I do). Also, this game is so stable; I have yet to come across a bug in this game.

Granted, the first-person view added to the game, I just get super frustrated when I go to jump somewhere and... Oh, I jumped completely past it when I thought i was on it. Lovely.

Until a week ago. I got Portal Bundle on Steam about a year ago for as cheap as 10$ or so. And I wish I'd play this earlier.. This game is perfect!

18,Portal,Cosmozerk,"Jun 9, 2016","Portal is a brilliant game, a game that is pretty much 80% tutorial, but every hour of entertainment that this game gave me is really worth every single cent of its purchase.

STORY: Portal really doesn't have a story to tell, you pretty much have to figure it out yourself because if i tell the ""story"" of the game, it would sound like this: ""You are this girl and your traps with this robotic entity called Glados in some laboratory and you have to resolve the test that this robotic entity gives you"" and that would be it.

PRESENTATION: Portal has a very clean look, 70% of the environments have white in them and since the game is shooter from 2008, you are obviously not gonna see some incredible models or animations, but you only see that through the portals so they are pretty much non existent. Now this may sound like the presentation is horrible, but it really isn't, the game is more about the style than anything else and it reminds me a lot of Mirror's Edge with white all over the place, simple yet appealing environments and like i said the game looks very clean, which is easy on the eye and the framerate is smooth and even the most powerless PC's can run it. Now the music is pretty much non existent, aside from the theme there aren't any other tracks, but in a game like this it kinda fits, now i would definitely like hearing some tracks, but i feel like it's ok in this case.

GAMEPLAY: Portal is a first person shooter, you move with W, A, S, D, you move the camera with the mouse, you pick up things with the E and you shoot portals with the right and left...uummm...how do you call the right and left click things in the mouse?...uuumm...uuuh, well anyway you get it. Now this mechanic may sound very basic...and it is, however by using this simple mechanic the developers made some incredible puzzles around this system and their efforts really show, this are some of the most creative puzzles i have ever seen using the law of ""momentum"" and the possibilities that they have with the portals. I can't really describe it, but believe me, the portal mechanics are use very, VERY well, putting your mind to think and you feel like a badass when you finally figure that puzzle ,that was very hard, out.

But it's not just the portals, believe it or not the pick up mechanic is also used brilliantly, you use it block proyectiles, bounce proyectiles, destroy turrets, switch on mechanisms, etc and you use both the portals and the blocks that you pick up to resolve the puzzles.

And that's it...no really, that's portal, it's a very basic game, with very basic mechanics and because of that it's very accessible, fun, replayable and deep. The puzzles are great, the setting is great, the mechanics are great and overall the game is just a blast to play, it may not be a very long game, but (unlike the order) the game is 100% gameplay and the 3-4 hours that you will play will be unforgettable. I'll give Portal a 8/10.

However, it feels far too short after completion, and there isn't much replayability once you play through it once. Also, the first few levels are extremely easy, but then just past halfway the difficulty seems to ramp up suddenly, and the length of the puzzles suddenly increases as well, which does feel slightly jarring initially.

There is only one way to solve each puzzle, which really deters the phrase ""thinking with portals."" If you wanted, you could easily just press buttons until you ended the level without thinking. Obviously, this would make the game take longer to complete.

You then get to the escape route where it suddenly turns on you and you, of course, escape. The only challenge you really face are acid on the floor and some new-paint-job annoying Half-Life 2 turrets that say things in a cute voice to get sympathy votes. Like Half-Life 2, it's not a puzzle game. It's a game, where you do scripted things in a linear fashion to get the programmed result that takes little to no effort that only disguises itself as a puzzle game.

2,Portal,Delta_Assault,"Sep 28, 2011","Well, given that Portal 2 is a week away, I figured it'd be a fine time to go back and revisit the charming predecessor. The first Portal was a delightful pack-in for The Orange Box, Valve's compilation of Half-Life, the two subsequent Episodes, and Team Fortress 2. While all those games were highly regarded and well worth the money, Portal was singled out in particular for its innovative puzzle design which truly explored what the First Person Shooter genre was capable of when coupled with a spark of creativity and the freedom to go beyond mere convention.

Portal takes the puzzle mentality of games as old as Tetris and other 2D sidescrollers and transports it into the modern 3D space of first person shooters, though perhaps this is a bit of a misnomer as there isn't actually shooting in the traditional bloodthirsty connotation. Instead, you're given a marvelous Portal gun which greatly resembles the Gravity gun from Half-Life 2. Just as that ""gun"" was more of an experimental piece of equipment than an actual deadly firearm, here too the Portal gun functions in a unique manner to aid in your adventures. Rather than terminating foes, you create portals in solid matter to bypass obstacles in the environment and traverse in odd, sometimes paradoxical pathways. These dimensional holes cut into the walls and floors of the laboratory also afford Portal the unique distinction of being one of the only FPSs ever to allow you to witness your own body in front of you, without the aid of mirrors. The mind-bending nature of these portals is what gives the game such a playfully devious character and even jaded hardcore gamers who've long exhausted their stockpiles of FPS games will find it hard not to giggle at the intensely creative and ingenious environmental puzzles that Valve has conjured up in its technological cauldron.

While an imaginative and refreshing new twist on the FPS genre, Portal is let down by its short length. This is not a particularly grievous complaint as the game was meant to be a sort of free extra treat in The Orange Box, already a steal with its plethora of games, but one cannot help feeling somewhat disappointed when they've arrived at the end of this rather loopy and wholly captivating diversion of time. Truly, ""short and sweet"" is how the game can best be characterized, yet if only that sweetness could have been prolonged somehow!

Portal's humor has been singled out for a great deal of praise and been the source of countless memes since the dawn of its release, yet I'm not entirely convinced the game deserves such effusive love. Perhaps it's because of my own sense of humor that gets in the way, but I found the game's comic sensibilities rather tame and merely worthy of a chuckle here and there. GlaDOS, the malevolent AI in the story, delivers vaguely threatening monologues coached in corporate doublespeak but I never found these evoking an actual laugh out loud. And does ""the cake is a lie"" merit such a widespread meme? Is that statement really so powerfully mindblowing and clever that it deserves to be plastered all over the internet? I can't really justify it, unfortunately. The game's somewhat clever at times, but there's nothing about it that makes me suspect it's reaching the heights of comedy.

The problem with most puzzle games, and which Portal inevitably succumbs to, is the fact that they're only good for the first time. Replaying this game two years after I first completed it, there was a sensation of repetition and familiarity. Some of the harder and more intricate puzzles took me a mindful pause to remember what the solution was, but the overall playthrough was greatly reduced from my first time, as the answers were all still within my memories. There was no great epiphany, no moment of ""Eureka!"" that you had over and over again from the first playthrough. This is a problem that you find in all puzzle games, they just don't warrant repeat plays as the puzzle's already been solved. After that initial breakthough, you're just left with a sense of treading water. That ebullient feeling of discovery and the satisfaction of cracking the proverbial nut is lost forever, and that's a shame. It's just the nature of puzzles, and a few other genres as well. Trivia games are another example where you have this issue. The first time, you're stumped, but subsequent games are no brainers as you've learned the trivia and there's no challenge left.

But Portal's first time through is a truly marvelous and rather pure gaming experience which has few equals in the modern gaming landscape. It's one to treasure. Collapse",9,0,1

But it's just frustrating to not be able to finish what was so satisfying up to that point. I even looked up a walkthrough on that level 18 and watched somebody do what I was trying to do I just couldn't pull it off.

Charming and Challenging
Portal is easily one of the most charming games ive played period
As you make your way through the game solving increasingly difficult puzzles, your progress is being monitored by an unknown character that will effortlessly make you laugh, Playing portal just to hear the commentary is worth the journey through the game alone, but the good news is, the game is just as good.
Portal starts you off slow with one portal gun , you use this portal to hop gaps and move objects, youll eventually get to a point where youre given 2 portal guns which at first feels a bit easier as you feel more free, the only problem is by time this happens, you are already halfway through the game.
You use one portal to makes an exit, and the other for that exits entrance
The 2nd half of portal is where puzzles can get a bit tricky and no longer feel all too intuitive,
It may just be me not used to having to use my brain all too often to play games, but I found the difficulty spike to be just a tad bit too intense.
The complexity of the levels go too slow in the beginning and too fast at the end making the game feel kind of frustrating, I didn’t really feel clever when I got through levels, it was more guess work, I felt kind of lucky.
While you may lose some hair over figuring out the perfect way to drop boxes from the ceiling, avoiding lasers, and getting over obstacles, youll feel great going through the gate onto the next floor.
The feeling of guess work isn’t satisfying, but somehow portal still manages to pull you forward always wanting more., but while I say that I felt like portal gave me just enough.
Portal will only last you about 3-5 hours, and as a puzzle game of its kind I found this length to be pretty perfect.
The game kept pulling me forward with its charm, but I wont lie and say I wasn’t fully satisfied when this brain exercise was over.

Terrific game! It blends puzzles with storytelling in a way that other games aspire to and manages to balance comedy with a bit of scifi horror expertly.

You wake up in a laboratory and are immediately instructed to perform tasks that measure your ability and puzzle solving skills. There are some really clever story ideas that most people will have had spoiled like I did, but the less you know about the story, the better. I really envy the people that will be able to go into this blind.

The puzzles mostly involve using your trusty portal gun to move one thing somewhere else (either yourself, or a cube). You get pretty far in before they are challenging, but by the end you do have to use your brain quite a bit.

I believe that, though short, the game was the perfect length because anything longer than the three or four hours it will take you to finish it would begin to feel boring. My main complaint is with the ease of the puzzles it throws at you. I think that Valve spent a bit too much time getting you acquainted with the physics and dynamics of the game, to the point where by the time you get to some of the later, more difficult stages of the game, you've already solved lots of puzzles like them and need only apply the knowledge of those puzzles to pass by with ease.

After hearing this I had an entirely different idea for what the plot my be, including details and twists in the story. Then I played portal and it was completely different than what I had pictured. A gentle learning curve, sparingly using time-based puzzles, a beautifully designed new game mechanic (portal gun) combine with the clean, uncluttered design of the levels and the mysterious (yet uncomplicated) plot to make the atmosphere foreboding and simultaneously appealing in it's straightforward cleverness. The voice on the intercom provides what would otherwise go lacking: the steel-hearted humor that's provided by the advertisements, directions, hints, and other phrases that are delivered by the player's observer. One of the only faults I can find is with the challenge levels which I feel are completely off the deep end in terms of difficulty.

These challenges are so difficult they extend the amount of playtime for someone who enjoys the game but becomes bored of reliving the story over and over. Portal is a game I already cherish.

The voice acting is excellent and if you listen to what is said you will undoubtedly be laughing from start to finish, but you will still be aware that the game has an aire of seriousness. The game flows very well and keeps you enthralled for all of the 2-4 hours you will be playing this. As i said, 2-4 hours, this game is very very short compared to other valve games, and even compared to the vast majority of other games made, but this is a brilliant move by valve, because you can, in one sitting, whether you are a hardcore or casual gamer, finish this game, meaning everything about it is still clear in your mind and you remained immersed. Immersion is a thing that can make or break any game, but if the game keeps you thinking you are that person and in that situation, then chances are, its a hit. Portal does this brilliantly and the only thing that brings you back to your senses is the trademark valve loading screen. The 'point and shoot' element that is in it is a brilliant innovation, destroying things, manipulating the environment and destroying a boss (in one of the best and most unpredicted boss fights to fall in any game) with a very very clever but non-violent weapon. This makes the idea that you have to think a lot, and enforces that you have to think a lot to complete this, very much stronger. This is one of the simplest games every made, but as i have said many times in this review, requires you to think outside the box greatly. Although the game is very simple to play, hardcore gamers who want a challenge have it, as portal has achievements you must get (anyone who can keep the radio from start to finish deserves a medal and the money they paid for the game back, never mind an achievement). These vary from fairly simple things, such as complete a section of the game, to difficult ones such as complete an area in a set amount of time or with a maximum number of portals, to the downright insane, such as the radio one i said before and falling 500ft, and as there are no 500ft drops in the game, valve are, once again, making you think very hard about how to do this I wish i could give this masterpiece 100000 out of 10, but as that isn't aloud, I'll just have to live with only being able to sing it nowhere near enough praise.

3,Portal,Tribor,"Dec 2, 2009","Can't agree with you there Lee W., because the thing is many puzzle games have only one linear path. Most if not all puzzles only have one solution, but it is how you get there that matters. There were many subtle and inventive ways to solve the portal levels, which was pretty much the point of the extra challenges that come with the game. It tests out your skills and pushes you to think outside the box. As for the plot, although it can seem a bit cliché, the great voice acting makes up for it and will keep you entertained. GLaDOS really makes the game stand out. The Portal turrets, even if they are simple duplicates of the Half-Life 2 ones, become distinct when they turn out to be just as scary as Poison Head Crabs : it is the absolute worst thing ever when they pop out. Excellent game which has some great potential. The short game span only leaves you wanting more. Collapse",9,0,0
4,Portal,DanielP,"Dec 9, 2009","First of all, for you shoot-em-up people. THIS IS NOT A ACTION BASED GAME. Its purpose is to provide a good story line, new ways of thinking, less violence.

But if you have a good computer and you have good internals than this should be a worthwhile game to get. Besides you people that give this game zeros because it can't play it, you should invest on a better computer not a high graphics game. Collapse",10,0,0
5,Portal,AnonymousMC,"Apr 4, 2009","The negative comments actually amuse me. They say that it is too short, there's no plot, it's too easy, it's unoriginal. You need to remember that this was included as an extra for Orange Box, and that even if you buy it seperately it costs less than a cellphone top-up. Of course it's short. And if you find it easy, then KUDOS, but even once you understand it it can be frustratingly (but wonderfully) difficult to get through the later levels, and if you found it TOO easy there are enough challenges in the Advanced Maps and Challenge Maps to keep you amused, adding replay value. The change after Room 19 marks a change in the game, and this is absolutely brilliant because it's similar enough to the first half to keep you playing on and working through the puzzles with jolly curiosity, but is different enough that it doesn't let the game become repetitive. The plot is wonderful, developing slowly as it does, from the first awakening from stasis and being thrown into a challenge you appear to know nothing about, to the final few levels when your suspicions about the benignity of GLaDOS come to fruition. The fact that so much is left unanswered only adds to this, leaving you to draw your own conclusions. (Personally, I think GLaDOS secretly loves her test subjects, but is completely batshit insane and tests them to show they are worthy of it.) As for unoriginal... That's just a lie spouted by idiots who couldn't work out the momentum mechanic. Of course it's the same as every other game if you use a walkthrough for every game... ;p.
In conclusion; Portal is one of the best short games I have played, and if you have the patience and the mental skills it is well worth the money. But if you're the kind of person who doesn't like it unless you asplode a fays every 5 seconds, then don't bother; Portal doesn't need you. It will thrive despite your failures, and fans will always recruit their friends to it. It will survive your failure. Collapse",9,0,0

The puzzles are all very fun, and once I completed the first half of the game, I was about ready to class it as my favourite puzzle game, which I could come back to at any point. Then the story kicked in. I can tell you that in all honesty, it is a brilliant execution of a brilliant story. It may very well be th shortest game I've ever played, but for the hour or two I was inside it, I was living it, and I enjoy reliving it over and over.

As a long time HL fan (10 years now? Dear God!), I was seriously disappointed in Episode 2. Valve, however, apparently accomplished their mission to make it a hit for new players and console owners. But enough of that.

TF2 is beautifully rendered, in a NC-17 Pixar sort of way. Not a lot of new gameplay, but for what it is, it's fully realized.

Anyway, Portal isn't perfect. It could be longer. It could be more complex. It is, however, fun. Clever, capricious, and fun.
Did I mention fun? Portal gives clear signs of the new blood at the Valve offices.

92,Portal,QuinnW.,"Jan 28, 2009","Portal is an excellent game. It surely is a new type, a new era of both FPS games and puzzle games. Portal combines reliance of the player's logical thinking with a deep combustion of beauty, creativity, and a mysteriously uncomplete storyline, yet this is what makes one love the game, not to mention its impaction of dark, comical humour. This game merges several minor subjects, like the monotonous tone of a computer voice and the use of teleportation and physics, and converts them to a major abstraction of intelligents liking, which eventually becomes OUR liking, as gamers. Although a deep tribute of intelligence is required to get through the game quickly, there is an ominous glow to this game that makes the player feel like they're ""flying"", and comically, this feeling becomes literal throughout several points in the game. This game is great for a player's ""cooldown sequence"", and its great for becoming a trigger in making a player want to move around, strangely. I don't want to be offensive, but would say that usually those ratings that are less than 7 are said because the critic doesnt have enough intelligence to have fun with the game. What I'm basically saying is that you have to really, really think if you want to have fun with the game and if one doesn't like to think then one doesn't lke to do, and if one doesn't like to do anything then they are too lazy to play videogames because all the good videogames have a challenge and one must DO somehting in order to get through the game right. Yes, the game is a little hard for some of you, but that doesn't make the game bad. Other than that, the graphics are outstanding if your computer is outstanding, and of course, the two favorable things about the game. The companion cube, which definitely highlights the humour in the game, and the ending song, Still Alive which is in the credits, which players usually love and gives you a good pat on the back when you beat the game in three hours. Yes, three hours sounds very short, but think, if Valve made the game any longer, we'd get tired of chamber after chamber after chanber unless more was added to the story. But i think that the ending of the game made an overall good ending and doesnt need more to it unless its a sequel, which i hope will be coming to us at a reasonable time. Anyways this game overall is clever, fun, humourous, time consuming and just plain f**cking amazing. Collapse",10,0,0

The game is about from 3,5 - 4,5 hours long (The people who say they finished the game in 2 - 3 hours either didn't finish it or are over exaggerating , because not one puzzle got me stuck although 1 or 2 puzzles took a quite a bit of time to get right even though i knew what to do) the length didnt bother me because the game didnt need to be longer if there were alot more puzzles it would become tedious and becomes a bit boring, if they had to make it longer there would need to be much more variation in gameplay such as the ability to also shoot or more variation in puzzles. The story was kept very simple, there basically was no story but that wasnt a problem because I didnt see Portal as full game but more as a mini-game and as a incentive to the Orange Box. The visuals were as good as they needed to be and were quite good for 2007, the voice acting in my opinion was not very good and became a bit annoying at times. A lot of the ""Humorous"" parts of the game I just didnt find funny at all except the whole story about the ""cake"" . Overall all a very fun and well thought out game and I hope the Portal 2 will be even better. 8/10 for a full game and 10/10 for a mini-game. Collapse",8,0,0

38,Portal,jonnyohio,"Mar 1, 2011","Do most people on here only know how to give 10's and 0's? The game certainly doesn't deserve a perfect 10, but it does deserve high points. Portal is an innovative game because it brings a new concept to, um, FPS (it's not really a FPS, because there is no shooting). You start out in the testing environment where the concept and control are all explained to you in such detail you'd have to be stupid to not figure it out. Once you have completed stage 19, you break out of the testing area of the facility and begin to figure out your way (following clues) to the main computer's chamber where you have to figure out how to destroy with just the portal generator in your hands and the brain in your skull. To your surprise, when that happens, the game abruptly ends, and you will be saying, ""Wait, that's all!?"". But along the way you will get plenty of laughs (if you have a sense of humor), and the ending credits are just priceless. There are bonus maps and achievements to earn after you beat the game. That said, this game is very lacking. First of all, there is no multiplayer, and all the 'puzzles' can be solved with a narrow set of solutions. There are no multiple paths either. You simply go in the only direction available and when you get to a spot you can't go any further, you just figure out how to keep going using your portals. Overall, the game is fun, innovative, and humorous, but hours of entertainment it will not provide as the game is so short that you will be wondering why it even cost anything at all-- even with the bonus levels. If you can get it for a few dollars, I would recommend buying it., but one thing is for certain, this game does not deserve a perfect 10 as so many have given it-- it doesn't even deserve a 9. An 8, however, is just the right score. Collapse",8,0,0

I could basically run thru it, so there weren't any really challenging problems (they could have been a way to get bonuses or something). I think it was ok to be short, because it was based on a few, about 5-7 ideas, and didn't have a compilcated plot. What I hated about this, was the end part of the game, which was too long. The boss was ok to me.

While not everyone will like the game's humour, I did, and any motion sickness you may experience by travelling through the portals can be solved by limiting your game time to 2 hours or less.

Concept: 3D puzzle ... ... (but not a shooter)... you just get a portal gun which makes. Portals!
Everyone is getting off from the concept, but I really loved the ""story"", which seems to be taken somehow from 2001; space odyssey (HAL).

It is fairly short, finished the story in only two days. But, that said, the length felt just... ""right"". Just at around the time that the portal puzzles were getting old- it managed to keep pace and move the story to the last segment of the game.

Each level is fun and creative, each puzzle unique. Portal does a fantastic job with slowly easing you into the game play, instead of forcing you to jump off the deep end. In addition to the fun puzzles, Portal keeps you entertained with the humorous commentary by GLaDOS, one of the best villains in videogame history. Although the story is short, most likely will take from 3-5 hours, depending how fast you catch on, there are a few different modes to choose from. In addition to the Developers commentary, there are separate challenges (such as least portals and least steps) for each puzzle. Finally, you can always play your fellow Portal Player map creations.

Well, it's very lacking: I finished it about 4-5 hours in total (but for some reasons my timer is reseted, ARGH!), and yes there are timed challenges, but in my opinion that's just a plus because it's the same levels (I would have prefered specific time challenges with proper made maps, instead). The graphics are extremely simple but works and gives a strange impression of alienation, which fits the purpose of the plot. And yes, the plot is good, but very very slow to increase the pace: only the last part of the game gets really good and interesting, with a ""not bad"" final boss to beat, which is good.

No, games like Portal instead make a very interesting experience, one that will make a real impact on your mind, rather than try to eat up lots of your time. And that's not even mentioning the downloadable maps and stuff which I'm sure by now is numerous.

I downloaded it from Steam and gave it a shot. I was instantly intrigued by the game mechanics, for a variety of reasons. I highly recommend it. The puzzles aren't too difficult, I beat it in 6 hours and that's including the time I spent screwing around in infinite corridors for me to chase myself through, trying to save the companion cube and getting stuck for a few minutes here and there. Don't play it expecting something to kill time like it's an MMO or TV, just soak in the game mechanics because they are fascinating.

90,Portal,garyfisher,"Dec 16, 2011","Portal is a first person puzzle shooter with a nice array of challenges to complete. The main feature is the portal gun, which lets you make a blue and orange portal on the floor/wall. Walk through one portal and end up at the next. This feature take a second to get use to, but is a blast to mess around with. The major flaw though is that the levels do take a while to pick up, and re-playability is low for this game. You will get a fraction through the game before the levels become reasonably difficult. In the end though, all the levels are a blast to play. The story is a simple one with several jokes tied in that make the game a little more fun. The length of completing the game is something to comment on. It is kind of a let down when you realize you get to the end and its only been about 2 to 3 hours. There are advanced versions of some levels that extend the length of the game in a very unforced fashion. Furthermore there are challenges, such as beating the levels very fast or using a limited number of portals. This adds another few hours or so. Lastly, there are achievements actually worth doing that do change the way to approach the levels. Adding all these features together ran me about 12 hours of gameplay so far. I have a few more challenges and achievements to complete, so give or take 15 hours to do everything in the game. Right now you can get Portal for $10 which is a fine price for the game. You will get your moneys worth for that low of a price. The biggest problem is those few beginning levels difficulty. It's fine to have a 2 to 3 hour game, but when a good 15 minutes feel like tutorial, its a little annoying. Also the difficulty was fine, but harder levels would be nice, ones that really challenge the player. Collapse",9,0,0

The fact that Portal manages to contain just that, while being highly original and thought-provoking, demonstrates just what a work of genius it is. If any game can be held up as an example of art, this is it. Valve are the masters at creating compelling and immersive environments- and the setting of Aperture can easily feel real. GLaDOS is the perfect example of how fantastic writing and acting can create a beloved character.

This game can amuse you whether your on console or PC, but if you are on PC you'll get the chance to experience the community made maps adding several extra hours of fun. But there is a downfall to this fun including the puzzle as if you find it hard to complete puzzles then this is not the game for you, it's puzzle after puzzle after puzzle.

I can still so EASILY remember how unbelievably quick I was to become completely engrossed in this ""first-of-its-kind"" game-play. I even went so far as to try by best at brainwashing my own father into playing it. (And much to my surprise, he gave it a try after watching me play a bit on my PC, and of course, quickly came to love it every bit as much as I.) Add to that list my own younger brother, who was and is still a hardcore ""console"" player. Sure enough though, as soon as he found it available for purchase on the X-Box 360, he was up all night long playing it as well. In conclusion, I would very much like to also add-in the factor of this beautiful game's UNBELIEVABLE ""RE-PLAY"" value. I've not ever kept any official count or anything, but it I had to guess, I am quite comfortable in guessing that I've played back though the same game again, over and over, trying new and different techniques each and every time, no less that a few hundred times within the past few years. :) To some, that fact will no doubt just appear stupid, and easily a target for such words as ""has no life"", ""still living at home with Mom"", etc...

Valve, once again, delivered an excellent and original idea when coming up with the revolutionary 'portal gun.' This game wasn't necessarily meant to be stand-alone, so those people who are saying that it's too short, keep that in mind. Also remember that it's only $10 dollars at the most, and that's $10 dollars well spent! I bought it on sale and wish I would have payed more. It's a puzzle that makes you think and provides a little clever humor. So, of course, I give this a 10, because I feel that it was one of the most original ideas and revolutionary designs of it's time, and it set up for an interesting and intriguing sequel. And while most games are $50 upwards nowadays and some hang around $20 for up to 5-7 years after their release, Portal is $10 dollars and is affordable fun for those of us who have low-end PCs and don't want to spend too much money.

All this time, GLaDOS' hilarious narration drives the plot, never ever boring us (The puzzles are brilliant too). At the same time, you start wondering what the hell is going on, why am I here, where are all the people?

The part where GLaDOS tries to incinerates you not only changes the game entirely but it keeps getting better and better! I loved how in the second half GLaDOS first tries to convice Chell that she was only joking (More hilarious dialog follows which highlight how hard GLaDOS is trying to hide her true intentions but being an AI, she can't possibly do it perfectly!). Slowly she gets meaner and really rude, all the more when we strive to get the hell out of the facility!

I don't think I've ever played a game that felt so alive. Even when the dialog is one sided (Chell is silent but GLaDOS talks) you will completely immersed as it just feels so real. GLaDOS has the best voice work I've seen in video games, just hats off to her!!

Truly one of the most innovative video games ever and the final 5-6 minutes are the sweetest cherry on the cake!

48,Portal,PortalPaper,"Jan 26, 2013","This review contains spoilers. Portal is one of Valve's most popular games and for good reason! this is my review of Portal for the PC.

STORY: Aperture Science is a research facility that created the portal gun and the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System, A.K.A: GLaDOS. On the company's first bring your daughter to work day, GLaDOS floods the building with neurotoxin. Remaining survivors' minds are erased and put inside a hibernation bed, to wake up and preform tests created by GLaDOS. You are one of GLaDOS's experiments, Chell, and the objective is to escape using the portal gun. This story is very gloomy and intriguing, just the way I like it. Though, they could've added more characters to interact with than just GLaDOS. (9.5)

PRESENTATION: Portal has very realistic looking graphics (Coming from a Nintendo fanboy), and the puzzles are just AMAZING they're so well thought out and clever that I couldn't stop say to myself, ""This is just fantastic"". And then there's GLaDOS. GLaDOS is such a funny character, her quotes are legendary! All of that aside, the game is extremely short, but that's O.K because it was origanly a stocking stuffer in the Orange Box. (9)

GAMEPLAY: Your portal gun can shoot two kinds of portals: red and blue. Using these, solving puzzles is so much fun! You aren't able to take falling damage, so that's a plus when solving puzzles involving tall rooms. (10)

FINAL LEVEL (SPOILERS!): So you've reached Test Chamber 19. When you go through, it's pretty easy until GLaDOS tries to throw you into a pit of fire. From then on, you travel behind the scenes of Aperture Laboratories. Suddenly, the challenge level becomes very difficult, mostly because of the amount of traps and robots that GLaDOS puts in your way. But when it all blows over, it's time to fight GLaDOS. When you figure out how to defeat her, she's pretty easy for a final boss. When it's over, the game awkwardly ends. It's very abrupt, and I think Valve could've done better. (8)

COMPLETION BONUS: After beating the game, the title screen becomes an aperture office desk with a radio, and chocolate cake on it. The music is a bit nice, but it's still definitely not worth beating the game. (2)

Overall, Portal is an amazing time waster! Just don't expect to get months of enjoyment out of this...

53,Portal,RobbyBakes,"Mar 28, 2013","Portal, a game by Valve, is a part of the “Half Life” series, Portal was originally released within the Orange Box a collection of 5 games “Half Life 2”, “Half Life 2: Episode 1”, “Half Life 2: Episode 2”, “Team Fortress 2” and of course Portal.

In Portal you play as “Chell” a test subject at Aperture Science, a scientific research facility.
At the beginning of the game you awaken to hear the AI “GLaDOS” welcome you to the facility and inform you that you will be used to test a new device that Aperture Science has created, the “Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device” which allows the user to create portals from one place to another.
Over the course of the game you will see Chell overcome many challenging puzzles in “Test Chambers” using the portal device while GLaDOS gives a few words of advice and some lines of dialog to help enhance the experience.

What makes this game enjoyable though is the game play which at the time of Portals original release was quite a new concept, the ability to go from one part of a level to another using portals made by the user is quite an enjoyable experience especially with some of the tricks you can pull off to overcome a challenging part of a level.
The story on the other hand which although isn’t dull or anything, does seem a bit lacking in substance when compared to the rest of the Half Life series (this is hardly surprising though as Half Life as a whole has spread its self over 4 main games so far and there may be future Half Life games).
Even though the story might not be the most in-depth story in a game it still works rather well, as the only character that ever talks is GlaDOS (an artificial intelligence and rather suspiciously the only other character), The dialog from GLaDOS is both helpful and at many times humorous which helps develop the story rather nicely, nearer the end of the game at time it is more up to the player to interpret the look of the environment to help further the story.

But at the end of the day Portal is a puzzle game and wasn’t made to have an in-depth story that would grip the user, it was made to be a fun little game with challenges for the play to overcome that could be completed within a couple of hours and Portal does the and more, some people say a good game can be replayed multiple times and I assure you Portal can be played over and over again as the puzzles are very enjoyable and the story still keeps all it’s nice quirks through multiple replays.

I would recommend Portal to all fans of the Half Life series and any lovers of puzzle games.
Portal is suitable for all ages from 12 and up.
It is a great game and a great way to kill time, a must have for any decent games collection.

I would give Portal 8/10 although more could be added to it, it is still a lovely game all round. Collapse",8,0,0

56,Portal,MasteRR,"May 3, 2013","Portal is certainly one of the best games I've ever played.

Developed by Valve, is mainly based on solving puzzles.

The player takes the role of Chell, the main protagonist facing a psychotic robot named Glados puzzles, and her apparent subtle attempt to kill the player during the game.

The action is set in Half-Life universe, but in a different timeline, not related to the events from the other game, more exactly in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center.

At the beginning the player doesn't really have ideas about what's going on and why she's there, but is shortly revealed that she's a sort of a test subject.

Glados is the main antagonist who first apparently(at least for me) somehow helps the player though the levels, and make some Black-humorous jokes from time to time, but near game's completion, it becomes more aggressive, after the player figures out that the plan was to kill you.

The rest I won't reveal, as will spoil your experience when you play it.

As a game, I say it's revolutionary, like Half-Life 2 was with the Gravity Gun, this time we're going to think with portals.

The thing with the portal gun isn't really revolutional, certainly people imagined this kind of possibility in a game, but wasn't applied into a video game until now.

The level design isn't bad, however the levels aren't well balanced in my opinion, sometimes you get from easy to really hard from sudden, and another annoying fact is that some puzzles look really difficult, but in fact are very easy, however I think this makes a game more interesting, and gives a bit of humor.

The story honestly could've been more interesting, ,,Make your way out of the facility,, anyone?

The game play was designed for Sp, and can also draw some criticism, as it lacks of multiplayer, and a coop, which could've made the game absolutely great, but it isn't such a great mistake.

The visuals aren't shocking, as we've got used to Episode Two's one, but aren't bad at all, I think EP2's graphics really good even for this time, with the great shaders, HD models, HDR lightning, and awesome physics.

So overall it's a great game, but it could've been even better. However I find it great and again, is a must-own, it's had nice graphics, interesting story, good level design, original, and even if it's linear, the game really has a good replay value, and deserves to be played many times.

57,Portal,brockcheese,"Dec 17, 2015","Portal is one of the best games ever made with how simple the concept is and yet it has such great scope. The story, the characters, the humor and of course the puzzles make this a great game.",9,0,0
58,Portal,sft,"May 22, 2013","No cakewalk this one

This is one clever game. The concept is simple but brilliant: you’re trapped in the labs of Aperture Science and you have to get out. To assist you you’re given a portal gun. The gun opens doorways in almost any surface. Once you have full control of the gun you can create blue and amber portals. Step into the blue one and you emerge from the amber one, step into the amber one and you emerge from the blue one. By positioning the portals in certain ways you can step, jump, or fall huge distances. You can also use them to redirect lasers and bullets, which you must do in order to stay alive. All through your efforts to escape you’re teased and goaded by GLaDoS, the AI that runs the lab. As with all Valve games the writing is excellent, with GLaDoS delivering some perfectly-pitched lines (and a cute little song at the end). Each challenge is more difficult than the last but none is so frustrating as to annoy, and all are satisfying when solved. My only criticism is that the maps lack variety as you travel from one austere lab to another, or from one utility area to another (this appears to have been addressed in Portal 2, which offers a wider range of environments). All-in-all this is one of the most imaginative games I’ve ever encountered. Check out the Orange Box though, because this offers the excellent Half-Life 2 games and Portal as a bundle and is great value. Collapse",8,0,0

61,Portal,starlight12,"Jul 3, 2013","I have portal with the compilation of best Valve's games ""The Orange Box"".
I do one of the best game ever made for valve's fanboy (behind half life 2, this is obvious for them)

And I see the two parts of Portal.

The adventure (the first part) introduce the gameplay, with the portal gun and the robot-gun, with a boss at the end (excellent this idea to manipulate the gravity).
But I tell the true In the 19 rooms of the adventure, the 12-13 first rooms are tutorial for show the gameplay.
You can have a bit of challenge at the end but that's not very hard. And this is all.
I finish the adventure in 4 hours (but I don't scamp). The gamers in the web say ""between 3 and 5 hours"".
But this is pleasant to do this adventure, for the pleasure of the discovery. And you will smile with the answer of the computer GladOS (he is the promoter of the ""portal gun test"").

The second part is the advanced test room. I don't finish this advanced test at the time when I wrote this. They are very hard, it's the 6 last room (without room 19 but I don't want spoil the scenario), and you must do this rooms....with hard constraints (robot-gun in cage, the helper cube become a ball, metal ceiling....). And you will see, you will suffer....
And you wants more challenges You can do this 6 advanced room, normally, no contraints (like the adventure). But with limitations (the least time or the least number of steps or the least of portals). Therefore 18 making head (because you have a short error margin, you will cry with the difficulty for succeed ALL challenges).

And you have portal, 19 rooms only but the biggest playtime is to try the advanced rooms, There aren't unreleased if you did adventure but you will see, the challenge.

PROS: + GLADOS is actually really funny + Looks good, even after 6 years

CONS: - Really short and really easy - Neither revolutionary nor evolutionary

REVIEW: If we are being honest, Portal is not a puzzle game, despite many claims to the contrary. It is a ""puzzle-ish"" game for people who like shooters. I liked that it was difficult to die, since it made it easier to focus on finding solutions to the ""puzzles"", but even with easy deaths the hard part about this game isn't figuring out what to do, it is doing it with somewhat fiddly controls (played using an XBOX 360 controller). Still, if the game disappoints on puzzle satisfaction, it really delivers on dry humor. Your handler, GLADOS is very funny and when she sings the credits song you can't help but grin. The graphics are still shiny (some texture mapping looks bad, but doesn't detract too badly) even after 6 years, which is no small feat as games start to age. As others have said, the level of difficulty will probably see you finishing the base game in less than 3 hours, even if you get stuck-a disadvantage since it significantly boosts your $ cost per hour of entertainment. This also hurts a decision to buy because Portal introduced no really new elements to physics puzzlers nor did it do them especially better, it seems to owe its current popularity to previously high reviews (much like Angry Birds).

Still, one of the best measures of a game is whether you'll remember it after you're done, and I have to say I will remember Portal. Just don't spend more than $5 on it.

POST EDIT: I never expected to get a response to a review, but it seems some people don't agree that Portal may have been somewhat unoriginal in using a FPP on a puzzle game. Here's the thing: ""Real Myst"" (which implemented the developers original intention to allow a player to walk freely about the puzzle environments) was released in 2000 (i.e. much earlier than ""Portal""), so you can't claim freedom of movement as revolutionary in a puzzle game (even if you did, there are zillions of node-based games I still consider to have done FPP puzzle first). Does slapping a ""puzzle-gun"" in your hands justify a ""revolutionary"" epithet? I think not. Collapse",8,0,0

2,Portal,PublicNuisance,"Apr 4, 2022","I give Portal a lot of praise because it manages to take a genre I don’t normally like, puzzle games, and make it highly enjoyable for me. Part of that is it’s humour, which is fantastic, but it also take’s what is a very basic concept and makes it complex without being annoying. At it’s core you make up to two portals, but it’s up to you to figure out where to put them and how to use them to get to the end of a room. What I loved most was that for most of Portal it was very logical, it didn’t feel cheap or trying to be overly difficult for no reason. While a few times I felt stumped for a bit I always was able to figure things out because the game wasn’t being cheap in any way. The voice acting for Glados was some of the best I have seen and really made what would have been a great game into a classic. The end credits still make me smile to this day. The graphics were decent for it’s time, neither mind blowing or an eye sore. They have a very clean look to them for much of the time until near the end where you get into the bowels of the facility. The clean looking rooms were nice although the more dingy parts later showed the age of the engine more. The game does a great job of dropping hints about the lore as well as tying it into the Valve universe with Half-Life.

I played Portal on Linux. It never crashed and I didn’t notice any bugs. There are nine graphics settings; four AA settings; six AF settings; a v-sync toggle and an FOV slider that goes from 75-110. Alt-tab didn’t work. You can manually save whenever you want. Performance was fantastic which wasn’t shocking given the age of the game.

Portal is a game that many will enjoy and still holds up today. It was a lot of fun and combines great game play with voice acting and presentation. It also does a great job of not overdoing it and not overstaying it’s welcome. Anyone should at least try the demo to Portal. I finished it in two hours and thirty one minutes. I paid $49.99 CAD for it as part of the Orange Box years ago and it is easily worth it’s current price tag of $11.49 CAD.

After the game's got so much critical acclaim, seems like there's not much to add, only to ask myself how didn't I play it sooner.

I would start then with a very short list of the things that DID bother me,
First, well, the length of course. Nothing new here. I do believe it simply wasn't meant to be too long in the first place but more like a side content to The Orange Box back in the day, but still.
Also, soundtrack was a little disappointing in my opinion.
And, before completing the main game, I've seen that there are ""challenges"" and ""advanced maps"", and imagined that they would add more content to the game, but figured out later that these are merely a revisions of the original maps from the campaign.

So, just let me confess here, that Portal didn't completely live up to my expectations. (~Hiding myself from possibly thrown objects~)
As this game is so positively accepted I did expect something more.
Being so short and the lack of additional content in the base game didn't help much.
It was fun but ended too soon, and the story just felt... meeeh.
And the challenges started to feel too crazy for me as soon as they started depending on trial and error or some luck, facts which I don't like!

I did grow a lot fonder of Portal as I played through the developers commentary.
Hearing their thoughts and the game-making process made me appreciate everything much more, somehow.
I even liked better that ""Still Alive"" song which at first seemed bizarre and weird to me.

Anyway, I'm not going to fully review this game and describe all of it's good aspects, because you probably know them already, and if not (!?) then you should experience it yourself, even by trying the demo.
Just wanted to share my little story of falling in love with the game.

Portal is without a doubt a very extraordinary puzzle game, brilliantly original, and I doubt we'll ever see any other game of the kind. Many other games tried to follow Portal's lead and so far I didn't encounter much success among these attempts.

It goes constantly on sale, and it's actually worth the full price of 10$ as well.

17,Portal,gloriouspotato,"Oct 3, 2014","Portal is one of those games you should start and finish in one sitting, so you can experience it all without interruption. It's a short game for sure, but for a puzzle game like this, a shorter length somehow feels appropriate so that it doesn't overstay its welcome.

The puzzles were fairly standard during the earlier levels, and it wasn't until later where more complex thinking was required. But for me, it's not the puzzles that make Portal good, but rather the whole atmosphere and setting of the game. I found myself not really looking forward to the puzzles as I was looking forward to the next piece of voice acting that would showcase Portal's brilliant dark humour. But dig a little deeper and you notice that behind the humorous facade, is a rather disturbing and sad story. Finding the Ratman dens adds a layer of suspense and the ambient soundtrack emphasises the sense of loneliness and isolation. None of this is explicitly told either, rather you're guided to make these conclusions by more subtle hints.

I'm also impressed that the game successfully made me feel sorry for my Companion Cube, despite it being an inanimate object. Love the credits song too.

'Portal' may be short, but it's pretty damn cheap too.

This is a truly unique game, one that inspires the future industry and will give rise to even greater game-play mechanisms.

That clinical feeling, where everything is so white and bright like a hospital that it is suspicious of hiding its darkness and reddened of blood walls. Glados, who is hands down, one of the most memorable characters ever, acting like a mother so caring that she is suspicious of hiding her psychopathy.

51,Portal,Ishi123,"Mar 10, 2017","Portal is one of those rare games that comes along that manages to be both unique and incredibly successful. Released basically as a stocking stuffer and an apology for he long wait between Half-Life Episodes 1 and 2, Portal managed to become something entirely of its own caliber. It is an incredibly well-done experimental physics-based puzzle game that has become one of gaming's centerpiece masterworks.

The game does exactly what it advertises: you go through some well thought-out and intuitive portal-based puzzles through a very short, but memorable campaign. Added with some witty and dark humor, provided by your instructor, GLaDOS, the game is incredibly well done, with a tight focus and nothing wasted. GLaDOS herself has become one of gaming's icons due to her excellent dialogue that makes her so lovable despite the fact that she puts you through life-threatening situations constantly and then outright tries to kill you, with the credits theme becoming so well known that people who don't even play video games can recognize it.

In the game, you use your ""Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device"", or just the Portal Gun, to shoot portals onto surfaces that connect one point to another. The concept is used to its fullest, with just a handful of mechanics going a very long way with multiple iterations on the same concept that never feel stale. Through the use of portals you'll use momentum to launch yourself across chasms, redirect energy balls into receptacles on the other side of the room, drop cubes onto buttons from the far end of the area, drop cubes onto sentry turrets to knock them over, and a bunch of other things that will test your mind and your resourcefulness, the later levels especially requiring some thinking and a lot of times quick reflexes. The concept is so simple, yet is used in so many varying ways that it's just a blast to figure out all the puzzles that always incorporate iterations of things you've already learned. Though there is a somewhat harsh difficulty curve towards the later end of the game, it's certainly not insurmountable if you've got the wits and the perseverance for it (looking at you, Chamber 18).

The game is damn brilliant and there's nothing else like it... well, except for Portal 2, but even then, Portal itself stands as a very compelling and experimental little project that is fun and charming while also testing your mind and patience with some of the more difficult puzzles the game has to offer. Though a small game, and while some may lament this fact, I personally think the length is perfect for what it is. Portal is definitely one of those games that everyone should play at least once, because chances are nothing like it will come out ever again. Collapse",9,0,0

Yes, the game’s length is something that should be considered, even being completable in one or two sittings, taking only three hours. But its what it does in that time that really seals the deal. The portal gun is an incredibly well-designed and very interesting concept, and you’ll be hard-pressed to not muck around it at least once in the campaign. Throughout the game, new concepts such as turrets are added in to make more a challenge. The humour is great, with GLADoS’ dialogue being written nice, but the game also knows where to stop itself, a large reason why the game is so hilarious. The game looks pretty good for a 2007 game. It’s not bad looking by any stretch of the imagination, and you shouldn’t be playing this game for its visuals. To rap things up, Portal is a must-play due to its unique take on the first-person shooter genre, and while you might be scared of its short length, picking it up in the Orange Box is a brilliant idea.

Story

The story of portal is fairly simple with a lot of undertones and lore for the player to interpret. You start off in a test chamber and are filled with the duty to run the experiment. As it turns out, While the base story is very simple it serves the purpose to motivate the player enough to get to the end. However, if you look into the lore it provides a much deeper context to the game. Small tidbit, the portal universe actually takes place in the same universe as half-life and there's a rivalry going on between aperture labs and black mesa. Another point towards the story is the subtle storytelling through the game art and walls. Kinda like Metroid and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild.

-
Gameplay
The gameplay is where this game really shines through like a hidden gem. It makes use of the brilliantly made portal gun to solve puzzles on the next level. You can use it for various situations like using momentum to launch yourself higher or transport other objects like a companion cube. You really have to play it to know it but overall the gameplay serves its purpose well for this type of game.

Presentation
I'm not much of a graphics guy so i'll keep this segment short. The graphics in this game are well done. And by 2007 standards this game makes great use of the source engine. It's not Crysis but it does look good and runs really well.

Conclusion
While I feel this game is slightly over-hyped it really does a great job immersing you into the world of portal and has really great level design akin to a Nintendo game. I would highly recommend picking it up especially on a sale. Collapse",8,0,0
57,Portal,wpatri04,"Mar 12, 2017","This game preys on our feelings of uncertainty, unease, speculative and cynical curiosity. The driving force of the game is a computer named ""Glados"" who guides you through a series of test chambers to test your critical thinking using Portals. Is Glados a force of good, a force of evil, or a purely neutral force who relies on mystery and the unknown? The mood that her voice creates is more atmospheric than some atmospheric games try to achieve with music, visuals and story. Her monologue writing is top-notch. The game length is quite short, but very rewarding and packed with more mystery than a mystery novel or film. Be prepared to USE YOUR BRAIN, and to start ""thinking with Portals."" Collapse",9,0,0

HISTORY TIME!
OK. This has... waaaay too much for me to fit into one review, but I'll try.
This game was originally about a princess, which was you, who had a magic crown or something that was able to make portals on the spot. You found yourself in a cave. This cave had various obstacles through the way and was, to be honest, way too short. Valve decided that this idea wasn't going to work, as there was no way a cave could be super long. They decided that a lab could, however, so they changed the idea to that. They made the basic stuff that they had in the princess game, which I forgot the name of while making this review, and found out, ""What will we put for the Portal making thing?"" They thought, ""Well, we've made all these not shown guns for Half-Life, why don't we use one of them?"" They found one that was almost PERFECT for the Portal theme, and kept it. They designed almost forty labs in the making of the very FIRST LEVEL. THE FIRST ONE. Collapse",10,0,0

Es ist jedoch viel eleganter, wenn auch deutlich schwieriger, allein durch das Gameplay Geschichten erschaffen zu lassen. Wenn man sich jedoch nur mit der Handlung auseinandersetzt, setzt man den Wert dessen herab was ein Spiel erst zu einem Spiel macht.

(Ab hier sind Spoiler enthalten)

Wenn Portal ein Film der gleichen Ereignisse des Spiels gewesen wäre, wäre es längst nicht so bedeutsam. Die Art und Weise, wie GLaDOS auf deine Aktionen im Spiel reagiert, hätte nicht die gleiche Wirkung, wenn es von einem Charakter in einem Film ausgeführt würde. Wenn du im letzten Abschnitt Portals gegen die KI kämpfst und jedes Mal, wenn du verschiedene Teile von GLaDOS’ Gehirn in den Verbrennungsofen wirfst, reagiert GLaDOS und verändert ihre Verhaltensweise aufgrund deiner Aktionen. Wäre dies rein mit einer filmischen Zwischensequenz passiert und du hättest anschließend noch ein paar Feinde wie in Call of Duty oder Tomb Raider niedergeballtert, hätte Portal sicherlich nicht die Auswirkungen gehabt die es auf die Spielewelt tatsächlich hatte.
Aufgrund Portals Interaktivität und der Reaktion darauf wie du die Welt um dich herum beeinflusst, haben wir ein Spiel das für immer in Erinnerung behalten wird.

(/Spoiler)

Mit jedem Tastendruck, jeder Mausbewegung, jeder Aktion des Spielers wird die Geschichte auf eine Weise fortgesetzt, die in Büchern, Musik, Gemälden oder Filmen so nie erzählt werden könnte. Wenn man die Gameplayelemente entfernen würde, die die Geschichte gefördert haben, oder die gesamte Geschichte in sich sind, bleibt lediglich eine seichte Erzählung.

Объясню почему я так думаю.
Все знали, что ждать от Episode Two, за исключением мелочей, но вот Portal, была лично для меня, тёмной лошадкой.
Я её купил, установил и пропал на весь день. Да игра коротка. Но затягивает, аш до головной боли, ёлки палки.
Ничего подобного я не встречал до того. И как и было положено, Portal стала родоначальником целого направления игр, пространственных головоломок, с перемещением себя любимого, от первого лица, по различным лабиринтам. Её продолжателями можно назвать такие игры как: The Talos Principle, The Witness, Q.U.B.E., The Turing Test и многие другие.
У игры практически нет сюжета, но он ей особо и не нужен.
Через некоторое время вышел сиквел, с замысловатым и труднопроизносимым названием, Portal 2! И как ни странно, оказался великолепным! Появился сюжет, улучшились и расширились головоломки, увеличилось время прохождения, а так же похорошела графика.
К сожалению Valve зажрались и перестали делать хорошие, сюжетные игры, поделки Left 4 Dead 1 и 2, за полноценные игры, извините, принять не могу. А зачем напрягаться? Доить терпил, лучше ""Steam""ом и ""Dota 2"", слегка шевеля мизинцем левой ноги.
К сожалению в нашем мире бабло побеждает всё! По этому вряд ли мы в ближайшее время увидим Portal 3 и ту же Half-Life 3, если вообще увидим.

События Portal разворачиваются в лаборатории Aperture Science, главном конкуренте приснопамятной Black Mesa. Главная героиня - девушка с какими-то странными приборами на ногах, которые не дают ей разбиться при падении с большой высоты. На протяжении игры героиню сопровождает механический женский голос компьютера GLaDOS. Ее комментарии - верх остроумия и цинизма. GLaDOS играет в Portal главную роль, она звезда, она великолепна! Кроме компьютерной тетки, очень запомнились говорящие турели, жутко орущие, когда их роняют. Что тут скажешь - настоящие женщины...
Жаль, но single тут выступает скорее аперитивом, чем полноценным блюдом. Проводя предварительные тесты, разработчики заметили, что некоторые игроки с трудом учатся использовать порталы, - концепция дырок в пространстве просто не укладывается в голове. Потому решено было провести ликбез по полной программе, и в итоге процесс, конечно, затянулся. Зато когда кривая вывезет вас на самый верх, смело выбирайте бонусные карты в главном меню - там Valve припасла задачки поинтереснее: в разделе Challenges необходимо пройти уровень, используя минимальное количество шагов, порталов или просто как можно быстрее, в Advanced собраны головоломки высокой сложности.

Les points positifs :
+ Un gameplay efficace. Un concept simple : la possibilité de créer deux portails. Quand on entre dans l'un, on ressort de l'autre en conservant vitesse et objets. Simple à comprendre et idéal pour développer des énigmes sympathiques autour de cette idée.
+ Un level-design bien travaillé. Les énigmes tiennent en haleine pendant tout le jeu, depuis la découverte de ses mécaniques jusqu'à sa conclusion qui tranche avec le reste.
+ Portal est devenu culte grâce à son ambiance. Son espèce de laboratoire qui, bien que super aseptisé avec ses salles entièrement blanches, silencieuses et vides, propose des mécaniques qui se renouvellent constamment. Et Glados, unique personnage avec lequel on intéragit pendant tout le jeu est parfaitement écrit et doublé.

Les points faibles :
- Bien que proposant des mécaniques qui se renouvellent souvent, Portal laisse un arrière-goût de ""petite"" expérience une fois terminé. 3 heures à peine pour venir à bout de l'histoire du jeu et une dizaine d'heure pour essayer toutes les casse-têtes bonus, le tout dans des décors toujours très semblables. Heureusement, le deuxième opus viendra complètement effacer ce défaut.

En conclusion, Portal est l'un des puzzle games les plus cultes de tous les temps avec son atmosphère super sympa et son concept unique, que je vous recommande chaleureusement malgré sa durée de vie express.

во- вторых она не настолько разнообразна, плюс к этому конкретно русская озвучка гладос( она единственная кто полноценно озвучен в игре) раздражает потому что какие бы эмоции она не испытывала: злость,волнение ,стеб и т.д, она произносит с одной и той же интонацией, но самое раздражающее это обрывание фраз, в начале диалога, в середине, в конце или близко к нему. Из-за этого если вы в первые играете в игру вы можете многое упустить, и вам повет если вы в эти моменты успеете дочитать субтитры.

I am going to break this review up into two parts, story, and gameplay. I am too lazy to make a transition sentence soooooo...

Gameplay:
Portal is a mind-bending game with occasional dark and hilarious humor. The game begins with you slowly learning how the portal gun works in a brilliant yet lightly time-consuming way. Once you acquire the portal gun you begin with simple physics-related puzzles, but in order to keep the gameplay fresh Valve included many learning curves. Unfortunately, it would seem that they did not have enough ideas to keep the game going as long as I had hoped, yet I am very glad that they decided to quit while they were ahead instead of pulling a Ubisoft. My last complaint with the gameplay is that it has no replay value, but that's the case with all puzzle games so it will not affect my overall score.
Gameplay: 95/100

Story:
This game has the most incredible storytelling that I have ever experienced in any form of entertainment. The game begins with puzzles and an unknown character speaking to you over a microphone. All is well and kind of wholesome until you find it. A few chambers into the game you discover a hole in the wall. If you enter this hole you find the warnings of a previous test subject attempting to warn you of the dark fate that lies ahead. On the wall, it reads 'the cake is a lie' at this point in the game you have never heard of cake, this adds so much tension to the story. You want to trust the person speaking to you but you no longer know if you can. Your only choice is to obey their orders though. Throughout the game, you find more warnings and you begin to discover what happened to everyone. The game never tells you the story, you discover it on your own and it's brilliant. The final chamber was something that no one could have ever expected and kept me on the edge of my seat for the remaining hour, give or take a few minutes. This story ties in with the story perfect within your surroundings.

Embarrassing to say this but yes, this was my first time playing Portal. Pretty late to the party lol.
Yeah, I really loved it a lot. The gameplay is perfect, open for creativity for each individual run and stays timeless. I started to play games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. recently and realized that other games from that era don't hold nearly as much up as Portal. IT IS pretty much a perfect game. I wouldn't mind giving this a 10/10, but I feel like in it's simplicity, it ceases to be an ""INCREDIBLE"" experience. It is friggin' good, but...you know, it does a lot with a little but I feel like a 10/10 is doing a lot with a lot, if you get what I'm saying. Great, short game. Can't wait to get on Portal 2.

90,Portal,genesisdoes,"Oct 2, 2020","Portal is a game that gives you a glimpse into a really intriguing world without giving you too much information or overstaying its welcome. It's a fantastic puzzle game with all the great world building that Valve is known for and it also has some of the best writing in any video game to date.

I don't have a whole lot to say about Portal other than I've been a fan for over 10 years now and even though the game has gotten increasingly easier over the years, I still enjoy beating it every once in a while. Maybe its partially for nostalgia sake but I believe the game has decent replay value, given you don't remember how every puzzle is solved. My only complaint is that it's maybe a little too short but considering the price of the game, I'd say it's worth it. Also, like I said, the game probably would lose a lot of the charm if it overstayed its welcome. I haven't beaten Portal 2 in a very long time but one of the things I remember disliking is how long it was. The original doesn't have this problem.

Portal has shaped meme culture, influenced countless puzzle games that followed it and helped maintain Valve's popularity during it's second era of game development. It's a near perfect little slice of puzzle game cake.

*Keep in mind, the high rating is really only to show how good Portal is for what it is. This rating shouldn't be used to compare Portal to other games. Portal is near perfect for what it is but it wouldn't surpass a lot of the other games I've reviewed on this site when being directly compared with them. It's waaaaay too short to directly compare it to a full game experience.

99,Portal,tensioly,"Mar 13, 2022","Portal es un gran juego de puzzles que a día de hoy se sigue sintiendo original e innovador. Lo que más destaca en este juego son sin duda su cuidada y característica jugabilidad y sus sorprendentes físicas, siendo estas últimas de las mejores que he visto en un videojuego. Cada nivel ofrece cosas nuevas y todas las mecánicas que ofrece la Portal Gun están muy bien desarrolladas e integradas. En cuanto a los gráficos, el juego no ha envejecido nada mal y esa estética que tiene contribuye a una historia plagada de ironía pero con un terror subyacente que ha conseguido transmitirme una sensación única. Esta historia es muy breve y sin complejidad, pero con pocos conceptos consigue ser espeluznante. A esto ayuda uno de los mejores personajes que he visto en los videojuegos, GLaDOS, ya que con su humor y sus diálogos consigue que el jugador se sienta incómodo constantemente sabiendo que está siendo utilizado como sujeto de pruebas. Cabe destacar que a nivel sonoro no está mal, y la banda sonora se basa en una simple melodía que suena en ciertas ocasiones pero que en el final del juego resulta en una canción inolvidable y magistral. Es cierto que la pelea final resulta algo decepcionante, o que quizá no todos los puzzles son extremadamente entretenidos; pero en su conjunto da una obra realmente sólida muy recomendable para todo tipo de jugador y a los amantes de los juegos de puzzles. 8,8/10

Falei no 3D porque eu conheci o jogo, inicialmente, em uma versão 2D naqueles sites de jogos de browser online. Achei a ideia de criar portais para se tele transportar muito interessante, mas nunca terminei o jogo por lá. Tempo depois, fiquei sabendo que o título se tratava de uma adaptação de um outro jogo. Procurei, joguei e fiquei positivamente muito surpreso. A jogabilidade era incomparavelmente superior na versão original, sem contar com a trilha sonora e os comentários da GLaDOS.
Em suma, além de Portal ser um título que exige raciocínio para prosseguir jogando, ele traz consigo uma boa dose de humor, na maioria das vezes, vindo dos comentários da GLaDOS. Mas, sem dúvida, um dos pontos mais altos do jogo é o final,
Por outro lado, confesso que acho o jogo um tanto quanto perturbador, porque fico a pensar no que a protagonista está passando, confinada naquele lugar, servindo de experimentação e tentando que lutar por sua própria sobrevivência, sozinha

68,Portal,G4bri3lxD,"Mar 4, 2022","A good video game, it's not a masterpiece either, but... it accomplishes its goal of entertaining and offering an interesting story; in the playable aspect it is very good despite the fact that the whole game consists of solving puzzles and/or tests to advance, this is due to its short duration of 1 hour approx., which helps the game not to become repetitive and boring .

The story of the game is interesting, in this we are introduced to Chell, a test subject who wakes up in the Aperture Science facilities; an underground research laboratory. Where a robotic voice speaks to him and tells him that he will have to pass all the test chambers that will be placed on him. Later she tells us that by passing all the tests she will be rewarded with a cake and that we can also go with a team of psychologists, but, as she progresses, she will realize that all this was a farce. And she will be forced to escape from there no matter what, so that in the end, Chell in her attempt to escape ends up encountering the machine that was talking to her all the time, named GLaDOS, and finally Chell ""destroys"" her and "" escape"" from Aperture Science"".

1,Trove,GamerElite999,"Jan 20, 2017","Wow , what a joke of a game:
Cons:
-p2w (and super expensive . every item in the store is priced way too high)
-lots of double grind mechanics( grinding mats just to make items to go grind other mats )
-crazy amount of grind
-did i mention the friggin grind??
-lots of random disconnects when trying to go through portals
-rubberbanding all the time ( where the server stops getting info and it just puts you back where it last knew you were, also takes items from your inventory if you got them while the server stopped getting info)
-immature and hostile community- expect to be trolled in one way or another.
-poor customer service (2 week + for any ticket , and thats just for the canned response. easily can go past a month before resolution)
-building is pointless with the rubberbanding as your build will disappear right in front of your eyes
-lots of ""RNG"" trolling (everything is rng based and the results are almost always disappointing)
-gems system is more insane grind
-developer that truly doesnt care about making a fun game, just concerned with profit
-poor UI
-everything is becoming untradeable so no point in the auction house
-vague item descriptions
-no in game mail system

ultimately this game is barely playable with all the bugs and grind . They dont even bother to fix them. The rubberbanding issue and random disconnects have been a problem since beta and has NEVER been fixed. Gamers should really demand better than this. Collapse",2,1,1

The classes all have unique styles and outfits that can be purchased if you want to stand out a little more. You can customize your mask, hat and weapon with any of the styles that you find in the world, and there are a lot to find. Custom player-made items are all throughout the world and drop quite often. Right now my Neon Ninja has a robot face, a brain in a jar for his hat and a huge viking laser sword.

5,Trove,pythag0ras,"Jan 30, 2016","Recent and upcoming changes have cause me to reduce my score from a 7 to a 2. They are making changes to this game that will make it severely P2W and even MORE grind heavy.
Pros:
+Minecraft had a child with Guild Wars 2
+ Lots of classes (14) unfortunately can only be unlocked from the store with credits now.
+Lots of players
+Weekly updates with bug fixes and content
+Public Test Server (the best part about this game , accessible when you have any max lvl class on the live server, however this may change soon with their upcoming P2W revamp)
+More colors then minecraft
+Fast and fun PvE combat
+4 different houses (called cornerstones)you can design and use
+can make your own club and club world
+3 ""professions""
+No queue to play (if it says there's a queue its cause the server is getting an update. not sure what the other reviewers are talking about a queue)
+Lots of mounts
+Lots of stuff to collect
+Can switch classes anywhere
+Auction house that you can access anywhere

Cons:
- VERY MUCH P2W !! Classes are now cash purchase only and no longer able to be bought with in game currency. also the majority of the game store wares are credits only . An extreme amount of grinding required to do anything on the live server with all of it being able to be bypassed by paying real money( and expensive too ..10$ wont get you much ) also there's the mastery system ..see below
- Strange leveling system . Ends at lvl 20 and after that , you gain levels by upgrading your gear which requires more grinding somewhat boring content and mining(or of course paying real money )[EDIT: this is changing soon as they are reworking all the classes and leveling in general making it take longer to level]
- If not mentioned yet ..EXTREMELY GRIND HEAVY on the live server (non test server)..
-Mastery system , you gain mastery when you collect things , level your classes, level ""professions"" .. this is the worst and most blatant attempt to get players to spend money that i have ever seen .. In order to do end game content at all you need to be a very high level of mastery (if not maxed) and the ONLY way to get max mastery ..is by spending well over 50$ in the cash shop.
-No in game mail system
- Random crashes (game wide issue not on my end)

Overall they are taking a very P2W direction, and ignoring the existing player base which is in an uproar about it. Collapse",2,2,4
6,Trove,SuperkenGaming,"Mar 14, 2017","Trove
Afterschool grind fest
Trove is a free to play mmo crafter, loots, and building game...
You start the game choosing 1 of 14 classes, all of which can be unlocked by buying with real cash, or rare drops in game.. so choose carefully…
And you spend the rest of the game, just doing stuff…
There isn’t much too the game even though there is much to do…
the game starts teaching you how to claim land… you can do anything you want with this chunk… and the best part is it comes with you.. when you’re in a new world and you claim a plot, everything from your last plot comes with it, so you lose nothing…
there’s actually reason to put effort into building if you’d like…
Your character can go into 2 modes, combat and building mode..
In building mode you can break blocks, collect blocks, and stack bocks like Minecraft…
it’s a decent tool... not quite as fluent and responsive as Minecraft... in fact it’s fairly frustrating at times to get blocks to go where you want them too… but not too bad that it gets in the way of the gameplay
and in combat mode.. You do your combat thing... slay enemies... do your special moves with cool downs, collect loot…
raid dungeons, snatch the loot from the chest you get after defeating a boss…
do it with friends or alone…
gather materials so you can craft benches and forges to extract materials to upgrade your favorite weapons and work on increasing your power rank…
That’s the entire game..
increase your power rank which is done by leveling up and equipping better gear and upgrading it…
And going to random dungeons in the world for this better gear…
raising your rank gives you access to higher level portals which means better weapons.. all the way up to 10,000 power rank which is ridiculous considering getting to my first 250 took 3hrs itself…
Needless to say this free to play offers a great grind for those that have nothing better to do than run around with your friends and grind for better gear… I’ve been there before...
im not there now, but I can still appreciate this game for what it is…
that doesn’t mean its well designed though...
this is essentially a shallow version of minecraft with lazy feeling dungeons…
theres not much to see for anyone not after a grind beyond the games initial hour…
But its free…
You can buy as many items as youd like with real money…
But you dont have to.. You can collect currency from grinding and using the user marketplace
I never ran into a progression wall
just a wall of boredom…
But again... this isn’t really a game for those with not a lot of time..
It’s a hop online with your friends after school kind of game

Plus, you will never discover all the different community-created Head, Face, and Weapon skins you unlock as you pick up loot and drop it in your ""loot collector"". You have this ""cornerstone""(house) which you can build and bring to you by activating pre-set areas of land all over the world. Super-fun, Definitely recommend it. The only annoyance is there's only 3 pieces of equipment, and only 3 spells to use on each class. But you can customize the equipment and the spells usually work together so it's not too irksome, though I do hope somewhere down the line we see them expand one of these areas to give the game more complexity.
Keep in mind that this score is not taking into account the long wait times when it first came out. It's pretty much impossible for online games to have a good start as far as servers go, because developers don't want to expand servers just for the initial rush and then have all of this leftover server capacity when people lose interest over time.

It's a pity that a beautiful game was killed because of its makers.

But if we put these aside and evaluate the mechanics of the game, for the pros:
- Hundreds of collectible content ideal for those who like to collect
- Lots of class options (although characters that hit physical damage are not important)
- Seasonal events
For the cons:
- Extremely p2w
- The servers are too laggy, the game cannot even be played properly
- There is a lot of cheating and cannot be prevented (automatic fishing, automatic bomber royale playing, geode speed hack etc.)
- Most of the seasonal activities I mentioned in the pros have a quest line that only takes 1 hour and there is nothing left to do once you complete it.

1,World of Tanks Blitz,TheDmytrius,"Apr 5, 2020","Remember that Breaking Benjamin's song ""Milk it for all it's worth, make sure you'll get there first...""? This song describes the game perfectly! It's not a game how I remember it in 2014. It's business and only business.

Back in the release days, the game actually had the soul. It was meant to be an ideal World of Tanks where a major part of mistakes was fixed while being restricted with mobile platforms. There were no events, less tank trees and the premium tanks were something special rather than just an instrument to farm more silver coins. There were much less features than today, but everyone was satisfied with what they'd been given.

Now it's just an infinite conveyor of new imbalanced premium tanks, lootboxes, disgusting camos and pay-to-win events (sometimes, you must play 6+ hours a day if you don't wonna pay).

The user interface was remade to show you more donation offers as well. When you enter a tank tree section, the game scrolls the screen up to show you the available premium tanks first. If you want to open free regular lootboxes (that give you almost nothing), you must enter the premium shop first to be able to move to ""Containers"" section. When your battle is over, the game may offer you to buy a premium account to improve your income. Even when you enter the hangar, the game meets you with a screen to buy their new lootboxes. EVERYTHING in the game wants you to pay!!!

Some FPS games have problems with cheaters, but this game has an even worse problem: it's overflown with bots and players who do nothing to win a battle! And they still earn some experience and credits from each battle and will eventually buy the next tank to spoil games on a higher battle tier. Wargaming doesn't do anything with them because such players donate in the game and buy premium tanks to make more credits on doing nothing!! They also keep the online counters high enough, so the royal management is convinced that more players play their game!
Of course, we have a like/dislike system to mark such useless players, but guess what? It's doesn't ban anybody!! It's garbage!!

The game server is a giant lagging machine full of crutches! It is the most horrible client-server communication I have ever seen in online games. No matter how fast your internet is and how reliable your provider is, the game keeps lagging from time to time!! This problem is usually faced when the online is 60k+ players and the developers do absolutely nothing to fix it! They won't establish an additional server for us to spread the overall load.

So concerns the game's netcode. It's not hopeless, but it's definitely legacy and must be improved. What happens on the server isn't even close to what you see on the screen. You're like playing in the past while everything else is in a different time-lapse. Try Battlefield 5 or even CS 1.6 and you'll understand what I mean.

Let alone the server-side problems, there is bunch of problems for clients as well. The major one is... optimization! You might ask ""How the f**k a modern PC can't operate a mobile game??"" I don't know. I have Radeon RX 5500 XT, Intel Core i7 6700K and the game is installed on a SATA SSD. For some reason, when I first spot an enemy - the game lags for ~0.4 secs! What the hell? The game can't preload the tank textures!???

I mentioned imbalanced premium tanks already, and it's a major problem as well! The gameplay problem is global. Each tier has can be divided into 3 group: the once which s**k d**ks, the once that kick other as*es and an average group. The developers don't care what the players say. They watch the statistics only which barely represents the ""strength"" of tanks. Sometimes they ""up"" a tank which didn't require it and now it's even more powerful than its ""neighbors"". The common sense is completely out.

Wargaming doesn't really care about their players. The moderator state effectively deletes all the criticism and even minor discussion of what the developers do and ban the players for it. This totalitarianism has especially occupied the official forum and Discord channel. So, don't believe in their lies like they have heard our views! That's **** The best you can do is to point at a bug which is easy to fix. And they won't fix it until the next update (in ~1,5 month)!

All these problems concern mobile platforms as well since the game is cross-platformed and mobile owners can play with PC owners together.

Assets not loading, people getting stuck in the dying state without any way to die or respawn, not being able to connect sporadically, gigantic lag spikes, poor spawn logic, completely unbalanced weapons (this isn't ""minor tweaking"" broken), UI glitches that keep you from switching classes, UI glitches that keep you from shooting until you die and swap your loadout, not being able to pick you loadout and be given a random loadout, etc. The list goes on and on and on. At some point, these big studios need to lose a class action that creates a legal precedent of expected level of completeness. You can tell where their heads are at considering there's a Store tab that doesn't even have anything in it. They are just putting out a ""game"" for the money and profit boost while they work in ways to try to milk money out of their player base.

This game is not complete, not even close. They'll say ""Oh we just need more time to work out the kinks"". Great, do open betas and fix your bugs before you expect to get paid for it. Putting out a game like this is a lie. You're not putting out a game, you're QA testing for free by putting your loyal players through frustration. I hope the bad press causes investors to lose faith in the leadership at EA and boots people out. The people who pushed to have this unfinished work released don't deserve their jobs. Give it to someone who cares about the work and not the bottom line. Collapse",0,27,27

4,Battlefield 2042,MowkMeister,"Nov 19, 2021","This game is meant to sell, not play. They invested all of their efforts into things like pointless weather effects and completely unnecessary scale so they could use them as selling points instead of investing in gameplay. And because of that ridiculous scale, they decided to throw in as many vehicle as possible without thinking of balancing them, Again to use the spectacle as a selling point.

They swapped classes, a battlefield staple, for specialists because they would be easier to monetize. They got rid of so many great details and gameplay additions from old battlefields, so they could focus on making the game more sellable, not playable.

They practically got rid of all sense of community by getting rid of voip, scoreboards, clans, and all chat.

And not to mention how absolutely horrible the performance it. I am fortunate enough to have a pretty solid pc, (10900k, 3080) i get constant stutters ranging from 50 to 90 fps on settings meant for performance. I cant imagine how they expect people who have been getting screwed over by scalpers from getting components to play this game.

The ONLY redeemable thing about this game is portal. It offers a great nostalgia trip and has a lot of potential. Unfortunately since people went straight to abusing it which i have no clue how dice didn't see that coming, its basically impossible to level up with right now.

For 3 days in a row i boot it up just to crtl+alt+f4 when i can't even hold my gun scoped in during fights, even when i hold right click it goes in and out repeatedly.
But ultimately even so, IF performance was perfect, the maps are huge and 128 players is cool on paper but because of this design decision the maps are ALL completely empty, devoid of cover, there is practically NO destruction and there is no levelutions anymore.
There are barely any guns, operators are happy go lucky but the lore is dark and gritty, barely any skins or unlockables. This makes me think they intend on charging us for it all in the near future since they want this to be a live service game.
I don't expect DICE to fix these issues any time soon.
I cannot recommend this to anyone in it's current state. Maybe in a year IF they actually fix the game's lack of content.
And for good measure, here's a list of ALL missing features compared to previous Battlefield games. This is NOT a ""Love letter to fans"".

No single-player story (I could forgive if the base game actually had good content and lore but i see NO story or lore in the game)
No standard server browser
Fewer standardized game modes (Can't even play TDM or smaller scale modes without relying on community servers. Really?)
Fewer base game maps than any other title (even including portal the map count is only 13)
No persistent lobbies
Fewer in-game assignments (none outside of cosmetic unlocks)
No class system
Less character customization options (than BF5)
No profile progress/stats page in the menu
No battle log/stats tracker for other players
No global leader boards
No end of round assignment progress screen
No dog tags (they still sort of exist I guess?)
No custom emblems
Fewer achievements
No medals
A LOT Less destruction
No map altering levolution
No permanent community servers (would be useful for clans and events)
Fewer guns (even including all the portal guns, BF4 still had more at launch)
Fewer infantry gadgets
No manual leaning
No diving while swimming
No high wall vaulting
No crouch sprinting
No backwards prone
No explosion knockback
No rolling after falling from heights
No ammo or health pickup off teammates
No scope zeroing
No thermal optics
No indirect fire gadgets
Less anti-tank launchers
No lock-on launchers (The M5 works with the SOFLAM but that requires 2 people)
No AP mines/claymores
No static weapon emplacements
No fortification building
No resupply stations
No suppression mechanic (This one I don't mind but I'm including everything)
Fewer vehicle types (and separate vehicle progression per faction even though they are functionally identical... why???)
No squad wipe scoring
No player damage points
No vehicle damage points
No vehicle kill assist points No headshot bonus No long-range kill bonus No assist counts as kill bonus No squad objective play bonus Oversimplified teamplay scoring (i.e. healing a teammate always gives you +5xp rather than the amount of health you give) Collapse",0,18,18

the gunplay is one of the worst i have ever seen in a FPS game.
the hardware requiered for it to run in a normal framrate is a joke. i got a 3080 and a 3900x with 32gb ram 3600mhz on a m.2 980pro and it runs so bad on 1440p that you could think my hardware is old, like 10 years old or more. Around 60-80fps, its a joke.

bugs are everywhere, glitching thru the ground, airborne tanks, crabwalking soldiers, ground snifing soldiers running at super speed.
the sound is terrible, you dont hear from where someone is coming. you only hear footsteps but cant say the direction. its pathetic, feels like 2006....

1. No content: small list of weapons, 22 primaries, 3 sidearms, only 2 launchers. Both feel like abilities, not stand alone polished weapons
2. Pathetic customization: ~10 skins for every weapon, only 4 slots for attachments, some of them have similar stats, ~customization of vehicles is EQUAL to the 8 y.o. game and EVEN WORSE, for example, there is no TV rocket on assault heli.
3. Poor performance on high-end PCs: my rig is 5800x and 6900xt 16gb of b-die ram and I'm getting 70-110fps on medium with huge drops)
4. Specialists gadgets don't contribute to teamplay, just takes the slot, thats' why being an engineer means you can carry additionally only a torch or landmine or launcher. Also the design and voice lines of specialists are cringy.
5. Absolutely disgusting UI/UX (really counter-intuitive management of customization, weapon tuning etc althought overall visual style is practical and minimalistic), unusable commo-rose, which fire mode am I using? Why Sundance's grenade is shown like the incoming flak rocket, although it damages 70% less. Why do I cant make objective markers and other UI elements more transparent?
6. All the problems they had in bfV are repeated: tearing camera, collisions, disproportion inside buildings, insensibility of weapon impact, what's wrong with c4/c5/dynamite throwing in every bf game? Meanwhile they managed to lose all good things: smart UI, variety of vehicles, vehicles tuning, towing, classes, destruction, leaning. After every spawn your character inspects a weapon (in comparison in mw19 it inspects only at the begging of the match) that takes some time and if you spawned in front of enemy you dont have time to kill him due to this animation
7. Lack of competitiveness and balls: no scoreboard, no KD/SPM stat tracking, no chat, no insults, can't switсh team, can't switch squad, can't speak with squadmates even in Haha-zone, no spectator's mode. But you had a lot of time to work on and announce a non-binary character to placate some, huh?
8. Bloom aka bullet spread. I know DICE is not IW and nobody was waiting the best shooting experince but implementing mechanics from 8-10 y.o. games (that weren't the best idea even back in the days) is a complete misstep. Moreover this random spread is even worse than it was in beta and previous games
9. Season one is already delayed
10. Bugs and errors are the least important thing as Im sure they will be fixed someday but still: invisible teamtag (both sides share the same list of specialists, so you can't really distinguish a friendly player w/o it), omitting animations of nade throwing, infinite reinforcement points and impossibility to spawn, to die, to ADS, to revive a teammate that died near the wall, awful hitreg (seems like the bloom was increased form beta to hide this), bugged reload notification, octogonal sun glare on Caspian border, broken fov, broken zooming on snipers and many many more. And Im not talking about kernel things like BSODs, crashes, mouse input lag etc. There are also a lot of things you don't understand are they bugs or features, like this aforementioned bloom or inability to invite the fifth player to party. Accidentally I had noticed the review of this guy https://www.metacritic.com/user/rosstergut and he is surprised that there are no wall running. Well, there is actually a hovercar which is able to climb

I can clearly see how much work was done by concept designers who were resposible for overall visual style, music, the idea of proxy wars during global ecologic crysis, and I understand what this game could be, how ambitious it was initially, but everything went wrong.

Instead they are chasing recent trends in a desperate attempt to profit off microtransactions.
CoD and Siege are making billions from cosmetics why can't we get in on the action.
So they added Operators which completely destroy the class system we all love.
Now we have 100s of the same person running around and I can't tell who my teammates are.

Teamwork is gone since nobody has a role anymore. Snipers running around with rocket launchers. I've got no idea who is doing what anymore. Even have a hard time figuring out where I am on the map. It's just a confusing mess.

As a mostly infantry player there are way too many vehicles. Hovercrafts are everywhere just running me over and gunning me down. Meanwhile the maps are so open there is no cover for me anywhere. Some capture points are so poorly designed that they are impossible to capture. One was on a roof with only 4 little elevators to get on top. Waiting up there are 3 hovercrafts and dozens of infantry already firing as soon as the door opens. It's a damn death trap.

Back to the Operators I did not find the abilities very useful and did not use them most of the time.
The lame quips they make at the end of the round makes me hate them even more.
They have designations as assault, recon, ect. but that's meaningless since they can use everything.
I don't even like the way most of them look. Only use the ones who look like normal soldiers.
Feel like they are only a detriment to the game and a unnecessary addition.

39,Battlefield 2042,Daviaz12,"Nov 18, 2021","BF2042 base game is death on arrival only fanboys and fortnite/apex will like it.

Specialists destroy all sense of realism they are just the most soul-less generic action movie character possible, half of them are just garbage and the rest are OP, main game is just a Clone war.

Hazard Zone death on arrival boring and incentive to replay, you should just have copied Apex here and do BR 3, squads of 3 and a ring, here specialists make all the sense of the world.

Portal is the only good thing (that's why I'm giving a 3, 23% of Portal and 10% for the maps except Hourglass that is complete crap)

Portal is great we can at least have the option to remove freaking specialists, but it needs more content, more weapons, things to unlock. dedicated servers, the game is full of idiots farming XP (like that ever cared in a BF game) the few good servers are hard to get in cause the game just have a hard time letting you get inside a game.

Other aspects:

Sound is a sad disappointment, clear downgrade from previous titles.
Playing with friends is almost impossible.
Can't switch to an specific squad.
No scoreboard
No spectator mode
Full screen map is pretty much useless at this point is missing so many information
HUD in vehicle is useless missing missile projection ect
No general chat
Outros are just cringe stupid pure garbage
In Hourglass and possibly other maps crashing a JET to a building do absolutely nothing

We don't even have a server list, can't voice chat, don't have classes, no scoreboard. It feels like they changed what this game was trying to be 10 times during development and this is what we have. The game has so many issues on top of everything I've said, its insane.

If anyone play tested this for 5 minutes they would have definitely known there were MAJOR issues.... Dump an entire mag into someone from 10 feet away and not even getting a hit marker. I got revived and was invincible for the rest of the match. Clipping through the map NUMEROUS times while in a vehicle. I can go on and on and on.

52,Battlefield 2042,Kylejacob,"Nov 17, 2021","This review contains spoilers. I usually am very understanding of a new title hitting the scene (the tight timelines, devs under pressure, whole nine) so I’ve learned to never expect perfection when it comes to a new release. That being said, my experience has cycled between utter disappointment and borderline disgust at the quality and polish of this game. Let’s just start with the good. The graphics are phenomenal and photorealistic at times. The on-the-fly attachment swap is a welcome change and keep the battles interesting. Lastly the Portal is a neat idea that brings a few titles back to light and is a nice addition. With all that being said, here we go into the cons. Firstly, gunplay is questionable at best, criminal at its worst. It feels like 5 steps back after defining the standard for projectile shots. The “operators” as most of the community will call them only feels like a sad attempt at trying to combine siege and COD only to fail in both departments. In a genre full of superhero’s with crazy powers and gear, battlefield made it feel empowering to be a regular soldier, medic, sniper, and support. Last of all is the overwhelming feeling of it being incomplete upon early access (I weigh this the least but thought it should be mentioned). I was really hoping for more and felt only let down by this new addition. Cmon Battlefield, you’re better than this. Collapse",2,6,6

- crash after playing couple of hours
- sound.. oh boy sound is ruined. I can't count how many times I was killed by vechicle next to me, or when I heard footsteps 4 stories above me. I tested Razer Spatial and Dolby Surround. It makes no difference.
- no gamescore board
- no server browser, you press play and you are randomly dropped to server. Last night i was thrown to same map couple of times in a row
- terrible optimization (I remember discussion on chat where regardless of PC most players were hovering at 70 fps) with 3070, 32gb 3200mhz ram and 5600x at low/med settings on 1440 p I hover around 100 that drops below 50
- invisible wars all over the place
- getting stuck in textures
- you can paradrop vechicles. The problem is that you can have a tank on a roof. Like why nobody has thought it's a crap idea.
- complete lack of balance
- all maps are for vechicles, there is not enough spots to concentrate infantry without getting killed by vechicles. At times its a running simulator just to get killed by vecicle at the end.
- over half of servers run with one op weapon yet it's not locked (they locked in past some gadget's yet they won't lock pp). Generally it has almost no recoil, bullet spread, damage drop on range and high cap magazne. Noob tube like auto shotgun with frag ammo.
- generally weapons that you unlock further are just weapons with same statistics but with ammo that gives more dmg (which can be unlocked in first weapons too, they have just opposite orders of unlock)
- op hovercrafts. Need 3 RPGs almost same as tanks, canhave TOW missile/grenade launcher or minigun. Furthermore they can climb walls. Seen hovercrafts climbing skyscrapers..
- bolte tank. Low profile, fastest, need 3 RPGs to kill, bulletproof except small windows. Can have mines/rockets/repair with smoke for driver and 30 mm cannon for passenger that works with overhearing mechanics and completely decimate infantry. Sounds op? Not for Dice. On some maps there can be 9 per team. Unplayable.
- one side has a vtol air transport which can change engines and fly away like a plane on other team we have heavy chopper that does not have such ability. Like who designed this?
- as in cod, silencer wins. Otherwise with this number of players when you shoot you are a lighted beacon on map.
- specialists (like is it warzone). This was not needed and introdused another layer of balancing. Who would have thought that a guy with grapling hook will go where players should not be able to go generally? Or a specialist that has xray (like wallhack) or a specialist that gives armor completelty throwing weapon dmg stats out of the window
- roseta menu is a square and clunky
- ordering attacks or defend objectives is almost impossible without using rosetta. With those 2 issues combined almost nobody gives orders.
- choppers. Little bird can kill a tank with ease. Just circling and hammering with 30mm not even using anti tank missiles.
- little bird can eat even 3 67mm tank shells from wildcat tank and fly away/kill you.
- generally ppl rarely shoot choppers with aa missiles. They drop chaff and run away. Before you lock it's gone. Heal and come back. Pilot just need to be patient. So when on pilot side it looks like a nightmare, in reality pilots will live and hammer down infantry/tanks when players will be out AA ammo/killed.
- lock time on AA is so long that you propably will get killed before you lock.
- everyone run with Proximy nades and both teams always know where is enemy
- when you prone you move like with a seizure in some cases
- aiming from some vechicles is impossible as crosshair is shacking without a reason
- submachine guns are better than ar. Just hose with bulletsenemy preventing them from shooting (due to suppression bullets do not go where you aim)
- when you disable vechicle part you just see part disabled (which? Yo uwill not know it's like an arcade game)
- for some reason sometimes you loose your weapon loadout so you spawn without unlocks and have to reset it again
- graphical glitches like floating windows after destroing a building
- stll character models protrude walls as in every past installment. So you can shoot players leg sticking out of wal and kill him.

3,Battlefield 2042,Zyberius,"Nov 24, 2021","It's really a shame to see this beloved franchise fall so far and so fast, and in such a strange direction. I have never felt the need to make a meta critic review before, but this really pushed me to do so. I am only giving it a 3 due to the fact that Portal is a generally good idea, but it should of been the whole course. If Battlefield Portal would of been a standalone offering with all of the effort that was wasted on the soulless, painfully bad map design that is the BF2042 portion, this BF community would be incredibly excited.

Unfortunately, what we get is two VERY half baked offerings. You can't launch a huge new shooter sandbox with this little toys in it. It's an incredibly bad look to spend 2-3 years and only have 4 primaries at the most per category of weapon. It's near future, where various nations military supplies are just flung out into various eco-warfare zones, you should of went NUTS with what was offered to players to grind and use!

But honestly, what will truly damn this game is the map design. It is so regressive to what the series has felt like it was building on.

BF 1 and V built on the incredible detail that the Frostbite engine can bring, with stunning optimization that made other development houses incredibly envious. And they pushed the series forward in what felt like the logical next progression: Allowing us to tailor how our ""faceless"" soldiers looked to more of our liking. Done correctly in BF2042 or portal, it could of been a huge money maker for DICE.

Instead, on both of those faces we see a huge fork towards something no one really expected: Dedicated ""hero"" characters making out of place quips more suited for an Apex match then the literal break down of human society to all out warfare, on maps that are some of the more boring spaces designed by DICE in a very long time. Gone are the rich, nuanced spaces, and instead we just have this massive scale issue where DICE, hanging themselves with a rope of their own creation, have forced themselves to have to create every inch of map capable of possibly supporting 128 players all goofing about in it.

And if this isn't the straw that breaks the camels back of trusting obvious puff piece gaming review houses, I don't know what is.

It feels more like the weather effects were designed to cover up the blank, devoid maps then provide any sort of meaningful addition to the Battlefield equation Collapse",3,4,4

But atm its just not fun and too much is missing that should be in the game. I am glad i refunded the game in time because the bad performance + bugs + missing features + weird design decitions (Operators, map intro and ending scenes, weird music, Operators talk like they have fun on the battlefield/in a worldwide crisis - not fitting the story/lore of 2042 and the cinematic trailer they showed) 128 players, too big maps, weapons not functioning correct, bad menu design and the List goes on.

Bad maps, game comes with 6 new maps and none of them are enjoyable to play on. The Portal maps are good, but they use remastered maps from BF3, BC2 etc. so they're not new maps. None of the new ones are even average, all of them are complete garbage.

I was willing to give the specialists a chance, but now I have played the game, they system doesn't work well in a battlefield game. They remove the specific class roles from the game and now everyone is some kind of hybrid class that can do a bit of everything, reducing the need to work together as a team from previous games.

Netcode is awful, you're going to get shot around a corner at least once a game. The game has several annoying bugs which occur fairly often. Servers frequently have issues where you can't get into a game when you actually have time to play. On top of this the game is missing basic features you would expect from an online FPS like a scoreboard, and the game mixing up the teams between each round.

TLDR; bad maps, specialists bad, netcode bad, servers bad, don't buy. Don't make the mistake I did as a long-time Battlefield fan thinking this looks interesting, it will dissappoint you. Collapse",2,4,4

Overall very disappointed. The game added nothing new that is worth mentioning but we lost a million features. The game is trying to be Apex Legends, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six Siege, Overwatch and a bit of Battlefield - all at the same time. Jack of all trades - master of none.

Would not recommend. Save your money and revisit in 6++++ months, but even then, don't expect anything because the core of this game is rotten and they'll never commit to fixing that or admit that they should've delayed the game for 1 more year. Collapse",1,3,3

82,Battlefield 2042,AceArchangel,"Nov 17, 2021","2042 has 22 weapons less than half of 2011's BF3 at launch and the least of any main title in franchise since prior to 2005.

It lacks core features that have been rock solid for over a decade such as a Server Browser, Scoreboard, VOIP, Team Switching, Leaning, Persistent Lobbies, Spectator Mode, Naval Vehicles, Console Aim Assist, RDS customization... just to name a few.

It suffers from constant crashing, errors, game breaking bugs, rubber banding, major FPS drops due to poor optimization.

Maps are far too big and much too empty, few buildings, buildings are liminal spaces with next to no assets in them, just empty. Destruction has been toned way down, huge step back here, many buildings are either barely destructible or not at all.

The new gimmick of a ""tornado"" is mostly just an annoyance that hinders gameplay as well as being a FPS killer and is a major down grade compared to Levelution.

Only 2 gameplay modes with the Core 2042 game (Conquest and Breakthrough) is just not good enough from DICE and EA and get extremely stale given the excessive map sizes.

The addition of Specialists have effectively ruined the pacing of the game, and seem to have been added more to increase profits than actually improving gameplay. They are confirmed to be added as a part of the Batlepass (Battlepass holders getting early access to them) and will have premium skins, takedowns, emblems and weapon charms. The Specialists remove what was previously a second gadget slot for a mandatory character ability which means players now have to choose between an offensive gadget, a support crate or the repair tool and because of this most of the time players choose the gadget supporting a solo playstyle. Because the Specialists are shared between both factions enemy recognition is non existent and conversely you cannot tell who has ammo or health nor can you barely tell who can revive you when you are downed. Also the end of game voice quips that are reminiscent of APEX Legends is cringe, and does not suit with the lore.

Hazard Zone is a knock off Tarkov / Dark Zone (The Division) and has been marketed as a Warzone killer, but can't seem to decide what it wants to be and comes off as the worst of all of them. I do not suggest playing this mode it is just not worth it, nor is it ""fun"".

Portal has the most going for it among the 3 modes offered by 2042. But each part of Portal only offers 2 maps bar Core 2042, and have no unlocks within them. They also only offer a select few weapons from previous BF games and thus the mode only comes off as ""a taste of previous BF experiences"" rather than truly reliving them again. Progression for Core 2042 now is only given in the EA setup servers and is no longer given in the Player created servers (RIP Populated Player Created Servers) The mode is amazing on paper and is fun but the novelty quickly wears off and the monotony of the same 2 maps quickly kills the enthusiasm.

1. - There is no normal optimization - 1070, Ryzen 5 3600, FPS: low-medium settings on BF2042 maps (128 players) - 40-65 frames (sometimes there are drawdowns up to 40)
In Battlefield Portal, the fps situation is better: low-medium settings on BF3 maps (64 players) - 70-85 FPS
2. - Terrible shooting - this random scatter... You shoot at the enemy and observe such a picture: one bullet flies into a tree, another into the sky, but the tenth still wanted to hit the enemy, but in the end - you're lying dead... Bravo... dice ... (in bf5 and in bf4 I clamp perfectly, but bf2042 is not about that)
3. - Bug after bug - then the tank is firmly stuck in the texture, then you shoot at an invulnerable sniper who hid in the bushes, and apparently the registration of a hit in the new bf decided to rest and not count the damage on it... bottom line - you're in a coffin ...
4. - Servers are unstable, etc....
What the ***, DICE and EA?
I played this miracle for 32 hours, and since I can't get the money back, I will sometimes play only in BF Portal on the maps bf3, bc2 and 1942, the rest is slop from the developers who threw the players to eat... You can endlessly talk about the problem with this battle...
And so the conclusion is: do not buy BF2042 until it has been repaired, and if there is a discount, it is only then we can think about buying this ""masterpiece"" and the reason for Battlefield Portal (portal plays well, fans experience the nostalgia - might stop by, but not true :))

I have tried to persist with 2042 over the last few days, unsuccessfully. It's just not Battlefield: no real team play, OP Helicopters that can just stand off out of range and kill you (almost impossible for infantry to shoot down), you can't change squads or teams, no scoreboard, the ridiculous cheesy cut scenes at the end "" Yah, Angel does it again"" (really). I thought I would give it a chance over a couple of days as there is the 'Great Game Guarantee' . Well I was wrong (my fault should have read it more closely), it has to be within 24 hours of launching - so by trying to give it a fair chance and hoping that the lag issues, being stuck on the ground with the revive timer expired (and having to exit the game to reset) and the many issues others have reported and yet no patch release. I have wasted my money on a game that is definitely not what it was marketed to be = lesson learnt! I will never again pre-order a game made by Dice or published by EA.

4,Battlefield 2042,onlycrit,"Nov 21, 2021","This is not battlefield, this is some weird amalgamation of call of duty and whatever sliding simulator is popular at the moment. As a battlefield addict since i was a kid playing 1942, I have to say this is the first battlefield game I might be skipping (beside hardline, we don't talk about that). I can put up with the bugs, lack of optimization on pc, cartoonish graphics, horrible ui, lack of guns and customization, the worst hit registration i have ever seen in a modern shooter, boring map design with mostly empty space, call of duty vanguard levels of destruction and just a general lack of attention to detail Battlefield is known for.
However, these are the few things I cannot forgive:
No persistent servers/match making - what the actual **** dice
No scoreboard - easiest way to catch cheaters and of course to flex
No way to switch squads - because being stuck on a squad full of snipers sitting on a hill is where it's at *sarcasm
No classes - everyone is going to run ""meta"" specialists and team play has and will be non existent
Not even a place to check your stats ffs...
It's been clear Dice hasn't cared about its core fans for a while now but even BFV had a few things it did right. This just seems like a generic free to play game that wants to sell skins. As a proud battlefield fanboy, it's been a really sad day for me knowing that the franchise, as we know it, might be at an end.

I have been a fan of the Battlefield franchise since 3 and this is the worst launch and release of the franchise yet. I defended this franchise through thick and thin and I am done doing so. I played on the pc with a BEAST of a pc that has no problems running any game on the current market until I installed this game. Between the constant crashes and bugs and game breaking glitches like killing someone and I am the one that dies even though I never got shot. Every ""patch"" that comes out breaks the game even more and even makes your hardware on your pc stop functioning properly. Here is my breakdown of this game.

- Limited number of maps. There is only 6 or so maps on this title so playing multiplayer gets repetitive and boring.

- Game randomly crashes or freezes for no reason. I am half way through a match and the game will randomly crash or freeze.

-Limited operators. There are about 11 or so operators in the whole game and there is no difference between the US side and the RUS side on operators. Hell even COD has separation for their operators so you are not looking at 50 of the same people on the battlefield.

-The game refuses to launch at times. I didn't get the Steam version of the game but the Origin version of the game and my game would fail to launch time to time. I just wanted to play the damn game.

- Inconsistent recoil and feedback from shots. I love sniper class on Battlefield and at times I would hit someone with my scope set to proper distance. Then another person will stand in the EXACT spot and the same settings on my scope would miss the target with no change in weather pattern.

-No story campaign at all. Listen I am tired of the same ole military shooter COD story that you can predict the whole thing once you start the game, but this title is missing a campaign badly. If you make a multiplayer only game, you better bring the whole kitchen sink for content and entertainment. Modern gamers do not have the attention span to give them this limited amount of content.

-Graphics are weird and unrendered at times. I have a 3060 in my rig and a powerful processor in my rig and man do the graphics look terrible. It looks like Dice rushed this game totally in the 15 months they had to build this title.

-Modern gaming problems that I overall hate. Battle passes, monetization methods, Super duper deluxe edition that isn't worth $200, broken buggy releases with ""promises"" to fix in the future, etc. This title falls in line with most games out in the last 10 years or so and I am tired of seeing the same **** all the time. I am in my late 30's and have been playing games since the NES and I miss the days where a game came out in stores, ****ty or not, at least the game was complete.

Overall I would say skip on this title. This is a HUGE disappointment in the franchise and I would heavily recommend not playing this game. Do NOT give EA and Dice the time or day. Collapse",1,3,3

Now below is the translated from Korean Battlefield community.

What features that 2042 took a step back from previous Battlefields.

0. Very little to no destruction

1. No in-game voice chat
- Developer said they are working on it and will include the feature some time after the launch, which means they've launched the game unfinished IMO.

2. No Scoreboard
- No proper stacking score indicator.
- No squad play bonus score.
- No long range bonus score.
- No indicator for how much damage dealt.
- No repair bonus score.
- The game doesn't encourage you to PTFO.

3. No Leaning mechanism

4. 22 Guns
- 4 ARs? seriously? 4 ARs?

5. Sh*t UI
- Can't change minimap size
- Controls for chopper/jet smushed together
- Blurry crosshair for vehicles
- Bold In game 3D icon wherever the objective is
- Inconsistent spot system. (Random marker or a vehicle spot)
- Interrupting and useless commo rose
- Unorganized clusterf*ck respawn map
- Every tank shares same icon and every chopper shares same icon on the respawn map.
- No indicator for where the gunner is aiming at.
and the list goes on.

6. No chat for all

7. Server browser only supports Portal.

8. Can't rent a server

9. Kick back to lobby after one game.

10. Hard to identify friend or foe. (Set aside the bugs)

11. 20-42 FPS

12. Pointless cutscenes. (You can move your vehicle during cutscene and accidentally dead)

13. Pointless individual award screen after match.
14. No squad options. - No private options on lobby / in game. - No squad change option. - No team change option. 15. Levels that nothing to do with military ranks. 16. Even lesser infantry flow considered within the level design. 17. Bad sound mixing. (which has been downhill after BF3) - Pointless voice over in game. (They should have revisit their previous games for this) 18. Can't choose loadout or operator on some situations. 19. DLSS not working 21. No personal stat page 22. No commander mode (This is debatable) 23. No naval map. (Aircraft carrier only on loading screen haha) 24. No boat 25. No underwater swimming 26. Takedown motion is cheap. Every enemy stands up before they get killed even thought they are crouching. 27. No options for chat filter. 28. Deleted vehicle getting in and off motion I've skipped the bug and the gunplay part because it is pointless to name out the bugs since the core gameplay is not polished.

This game is so far from finished and doesnt feel like Battlefield in any way, It had saddened me that I have to write a bad review for one of my favorite series. The game is just not finished, the bugs are so common they break any immersion in the game that you might have and cause matches to become a comedic laughing stock from all the glitches happening, I can constantly hear my friends laughing on my discord because none of us can take matches seriously when people are riding up the side of buildings with hovercrafts. sure its funny as hell the first few times but how are we supposed to get immersed in this world when the stuff thats happening is stuff of science fiction and straight out of a naked gun movie FFS.

The vehicles in this game are literally broken. you have nearly all vehicles that can glide up buildings and some that can fly in the air if you run off the proper surface. its so broken I cant even fathom how this got released in this state, not only that but the guns seem to miss targets when shooting point blank at some enemies for no apparent reason.

Im not going to sit here and waste your time, But just for the love of god DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! They bastardized the series and shat on the Battlefield name. This is not even close to what us fans deserve, Also how the holy flying Fu** did this game get a 77 score from critics? did they even play the same version as we did? something is very fishy and its obvious alot of them were paid off.

4,Battlefield 2042,Krapclap,"Nov 17, 2021","A terrible breakaway from the core of Battlefield that violates parts of it's core player base.

The best part of battlefield was the realism aspect. It was a dirty gritty war game that was bound by the laws of physics. The arcade aspects and Simulation aspects were all balanced. This time they took that idea and threw it out the window making a lot of the game un immersive. It now feels cartoony and bland with the arcade aspects overwhelming the simulation aspects of the game.

Next they took stats and threw anything negative out the window. No more scoreboard. No more competition. You have no way to see how you performed compared to anyone else other than seeing how you rank among the squads. The current setup is unrewarding and XP is just a way to unlock the paltry selection of items for your loadouts.

Between these two problems they have fundamentally altered design of Battlefield moving it from a mature audience to a general audience.

The inclusion of Portal mode is lackluster and cheap with many assets and physics being recycled from 2042 and is a terrible apology for what they are doing.

In addition the game is launching with several severe game breaking bugs that will take time to fix. These bug are so terrible that the game cannot even be played as intended. Id just list some but there's sooooo many, it's even worse than the beta test.

The game is also overall extremely unbalanced, with guns and vehicles getting a ton of complaints (the main selling point btw). Maps are pretty sparse with wide open spaces and little to no cover making infantry play all but worthless. Daily XP limits are limiting the amount of time I even want to play. And many other strange and bizarre issues that I just don't understand.

As a lover of the entire battlefield series as bumpy as it's been this is by far the worst title ever created and I have to insist for the first time ever not to buy a Battlefield title.

SI've put nearly 50 hours in already trying to love this game, but trying has made me downright depressed with the franchise I loved.
Secondly and most importantly. The design decisions feel like some suits told a bunch of programmers to just include all the features of all the hot games right now.
The specialist system is terrible. The removal of the ubiquitous class system is a travesty and removes one of the core ingredients of every battlefield game ingredients of every battlefield game. Making it so that anyone can equip any combination of weapons and equipment devalues squad planning and gameplay and promotes individual action over team action. The eight giddy happy-go-lucky personality characters removes from the epic feeling of a living breathing battlefield and turns everything you do into a silly joke. ""I destroyed 16 vehicles that match? teehee dont be mad you just wish you were as good as me!""
I miss the voice lines that sounded like actual war cries from a war zone. They also removed almost every feature that made battlefield an easy to navigate fun game that supported all types of people. Sure it has portal which is the only cool decision they made. But that doesn't account for how they've killed the actual feel of the franchise.
This game has so many issues both in design and execution I could ramble on for hours.
Move the specialist to hazard zone where they belong and make perfect sense but give us back our standard soldiers with minimal customization and light to moderate personality give us back classes so there are pros and cons to your decisions and you have to try to work with your team.

Do not buy Battlefield 2042.

4 game studios has supposedly worked on this for 3 years, and yet it seems like they only started this year (Anthem 2.0?).
Even the versioning of the patch tells us all how far they are with the game.
v0.2.1, that's a long way to a v1.0 release.

EA and DICE decided not to listen to their Game Changers, who were trying to bring us the best battlefield yet, with all the features we wished for.
I mean, just go read this by a former EA Game Changer https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield2042/comments/qwfoof/a_battlefield_2042_steam_review/

EA and DICE decided to lie to us promising features that are not there.
You can really tell that most of the original DICE developers left this sinking ship after BFV.
The dev's left don't care about us, they made the game how they think it should be and did not listen to the community at all, like they said they did.

The open beta really did show us what state the game was is, actually it's way worse, at least in the beta you could still shoot people beyond 30 meters without your bullets going all over the place.

Portal is the only good thing here, but it's locked from XP and weapon progression, and the sad thing is that the weapons and vehicles are just reskins of the 2042 ones, except the 1942 ones (I think?)

The amount of removed or missing stuff is insane.
There is what, 22 weapons total? that's with portal, and you can only progress the 2042 weapons.

Just to name a few things.

- No scoreboard
- No Private squad
- No Switch squad (only to a random new one)
- No All chat
- No next gen destruction and levelution (destruction seemed better in 1942 xD)
- Revive/downed bug where you can't get up so you have to quit the current game
- The maps are boring and too open
- The worst audio ever
- Cringe end screens when the game is over
- SBMM kinda style where you get kicked out to the lobby after a game
- You can't join your friends if they are mid game.
- You can't rejoin your friends if you get dropped from the server
- Everything that has something to do with community is just gone.
- 4 man squads instead of 5
- Too few vehicles when match starts, so those who do not get into one has to run for 10 minutes on most maps, just to end up getting shot by a helicopter.

For a full list of everything go look at this reddit post, it's insane ****

I'm sad to see battlefield going this way.
But we can thank the money hungry EA for this and the DICE developer team who has no soul left.

Aside of optimization issues and so many bugs it has, battlefield lacks lots of content right now.
Maps, vehicles, weapons and game mods... All lacking.

DICE along with many other game developing companies should just drop this trend of releasing games before they are done to get some quick cash.

The game is just not finished yet both in terms of optimization, bugs, balance and content and i believe it wont be for at least 6 months or maybe even more, just like every other battlefield game was before it.

Seeing how the game industry is going nowadays, I will never ever preorder any game from now on.

They just sell you half-baked, unfinished content with bugs, optimization and gameplay balance issues for full price then make you wait for months to get it fixed by patches, and what is even more annoying is that it is just became a new normal in the industry, doing this should actually be a crime...

29,Battlefield 2042,Allawe27,"Dec 11, 2021","There is absolutely nothing appealing in this game. The amount of content that was stripped from the game is ridiculous. No scoreboard, no leaning, no server browser, no persistent lobbies, no player's state page, very very few game modes, horribly designed maps, the call-in system just ruined the flow of the game with everybody in hovercrafts, no diving underwater, no crouch sprinting, abysmal variety of guns, laughable UI design, horrible audio, etc... I can go on forever to list all missing features and content that EA and Dice like to call ""legacy features."" I can put all of the mentioned on one hand and the removal of the class system on another hand. The single defining feature of Battlefield is its class system. It doesn't make any sense. If the goal is to sell cosmetics, then that could've been achieved by selling different characters, similar to how Battlefield V did it. The abilities could've easily been incorporated within the class system. Hear me out on this one, if the idea is just to copy what is ""popular,"" then people who want to play Call of Duty will play Call of Duty. People who want to play Apex will go and play Apex. People who want to play Fortnite will go and play Fortnite. All of the mentioned games are free to play BTW. So, why would anyone spend $70 to play Apex or Warzone in Battlefield? They could just download these games for free. People who want to play Battlefield are just simply left out. The core identity of the game is just gone. It's a shame that whatever they just put out has the name Battlefield attached to it. Oh did I forget to mention how horrible the performance is? My RTX 3080 and 5900X rig is struggling to keep constant FPS. The game is filled with bugs, glitches, and hit reg issues. I'm very sad that this game is just dead. In fact, the franchise as a whole is dead. EA and Dice killed them. I was patiently waiting for this ""love letter to the fans"" that they promised. The letter seemed to tell us that this series is dead and don't look for the light at the end of the tunnel. I keep hearing people saying give the game some time to be ironed out, just like Battlefield 4. However, Battlefield 4 didn't suffer from design issues. The core of Battlefield 4 was solid. It only suffered performance issues, which were fixed at later patches. Battlefield 2042 suffers from performance AND major core design issues. The foundation of the game is just rotten and no matter how much they can improve performance, they can't hide the rot in their core. Redesigning the game is not going to happen. This game will keep losing players and until it's dead in a matter of a few months. Nothing will redeem this game and this entire franchise.

This game is half-baked, filled with bugs and missing features. Wait until they address these issues or the game goes 50-70% off - which like Battlefield 5 soon after release - it is likely to do. Among the many issues:

1. No scoreboard, no stats, no k/d, nothing - this alone is absolutely ridiculous to be left out. WHY?
2. No in-game voice chat. Sooo there's crossplay, but I can't talk with my console buddies in my squad? Limited in-game chat as well. This is extremely frustrating.
3. No server browser - matchmaking only in AOW - I don't want to rely on an engine to pick my servers. I want to pick the matches I want to join based on player count, ping, maps, etc. This is ripe for a SBMM algorithm which will ruin the experience. But hey, EA/DICE don't care about that anymore
4. Awfully inconsistent hit registration, weapon bloom, and other gameplay issues that really ruin the experience. I expect bugs, but this is more like a game that was released half-baked. Stop pre-ordering and gaming manufacturers will stop giving you such broken games.
5. Specialists - oh how I hate them - not so much the idea, but more how they're implemented. There's no difference between teams - they both look the exact same. This leads to friendly fire and not being able to quickly tell friend from foe. I hate relying solely on blue vs red marking and highlights based on when the game thinks I'm looking at someone. Make the specialists unique to each team
6. Specialists and classless customization eliminates team play and strategy. Everyone goes out as a lone wolf. You don't know who has ammo or who is a medic, nor does it really matter as nobody seems to play as a team/squad anymore. Completely contrary to Battlefield's identity.
7. Poor optimization and performance even on beefy rigs - unless you have thousands of dollars available to spend on a rig, you're going to struggle to get playable framerates in its current state. I have a 3080 and 10700 11th gen processor with 32GB of RAM and I'm lucky to get more than 70-80 FPS on 1440P with serious lags and rubber banding at times.
8. UI, while slightly improved vs the open beta, is still average.

I could go on and on. Summary, DO NOT BUY IN CURRENT STATE. And for the love of gaming, STOP PREORDERING.

If this is the direction EA/DICE wants to take with their new games, they probably should have created a new IP for it. I'm all for experimenting with gameplay elements, but if you slap the Battlefield name on the product, you should probably make sure the game plays like and builds off of previous titles in the series.

Playing this game is a test of your patience. It's difficult to forget all the positive gameplay additions and features from past games that have just been discarded in this entry.

Why does the movement feel floaty? DICE created amazing movement systems in both Battlefield 1 and Battlefield V.

Why can't you create/change squads mid match? This has been present in all recent entries up to this point. I doubt DICE ever got player feedback that having the freedom to pick their squads in a game was a negative feature.

Why remove the class system? Did players lament that having clear roles to promote teamwork was frustrating?

Why remove the server browser? Did players despise being able to pick the maps they wanted to play with servers that had decent connection speeds? I really don't think so.

It's just baffling how many beloved and popular gameplay systems and elements were removed in this title. It's even more confusing when EA/DICE promotes this game as a ""love-letter"" to fans.

A main selling point of this game was the fact that servers can now have up to 128 players. Now, this sounds cool in practice: more players means more Battlefield fun, right? The thing is, after coming from previous titles, I really don't see a difference here in the battles that play out. I remember playing on the Arctic map with a friend recently when I was asked the question ""Does this feel like there's 128 people playing with us right now?""

It didn't.

It felt the same as before. What WAS noticeable was the performance issues that were no doubt present due to the increased player count.

The reason for this game existing in this state is just really odd when you think about it. Battlefield fans are pretty vocal about what they like in a Battlefield game; it really shouldn't have been hard for EA/DICE to deliver a real fan-favorite game here. Instead, it seems like another case of trend-chasing lead by upper management.

- No Campaign and sold for $60 and $110 for the complete edition.
- The worst HUD and user interface to date in any multiplayer video game.
- Only 22 weapons in 2042.
- Portal mode is worst than the original games.
- Conquest is empty due to the huge maps.
- Downgraded destruction over it's predecessors.
- Frame rate dips below 50fps on an RTX 3080 and an i9 10850k even on low settings.
- The physics are non-existent.
- Everyone looks the same in conquest since they decided to put operators in a battlefield game.
- The graphics look worse than Battlefield 3 in most places.
- Hit registry is garbage.
- Hovercrafts are sh$t.
- SMGs can shoot from longer range than sniper rifles.
- Classes are meaningless.
- I've had over 20 glitches in my first match, some of them are game breaking, you can't revive your teammates when they're even close to a wall or an object.
- The two towers in breakthrough are a joke. People are camping near elevators and calling hovercrafts to barricade the entire tower.
- The scopes design is the worst I've seen in any game.
- No day 1 patch to fix any of the issues above...........................................

63,Battlefield 2042,RantHistorian,"Nov 17, 2021","This is teh most addicting game ever... let me explain.

Battlefield 2042 has tapped into the Variable Ratio reward system of your brain to create instant addiction. A Variable Ratio reward is one delivered after an unpredictable number of responses - ie: Gambling. How did this make its way into Battlefield 2042?

You will only connect to servers after an unknown amount of time to make it to the main menu. When you finally do DOPAMINE to your brain. Then when you are in the main menu it will take a random number of attempts to join a game type before one actually lets you in... DOPAMINE. Then when you are in game it will take a random amount of tries before you get passed a bugged pre-match menu that shows the map BUT when you finally do DOPAMINE. Then when you get into a match will your player load? Will your weapons work? Will you be able to shoot the enemy? Will your own team mates spawn looking like enemies? Who knows! It creates a giant chaotic three ring **** show with no scoreboard so you wouldn't know if you got close to doing anything good anyway. But when the game actually does work like its supposed to which i have calculated to be about 2 matches in every four hours of game time DOPAMINE. I mean why do you think they named their company DICE???? That sweet sweet gambling dopamine.

They even made it to where your bullets go in random directions so it doesn't matter where you aim.
When you pull the trigger will the enemy get shot? Jesus Christ, Himself doesn't know, only His Father knows.

1. Отвратительные карты, огромные, пустые, разрушаемость (она вообще есть?), особенно в контрасте со старыми картами, что представлены в Portal
2. Очень странная по своим механикам техника... чего стоят катера на воздушной подушке (они ползают по стенам???)
3. Система классов весьма сомнительна и ужасна по своей сути, мало того что в ней нет никакого смысла, так и скины - натуральное фрикшоу (я все понимаю, игроделам нынче стало сложно, уж очень много кому надо угодить, а обидеть так вообще опасно)
4. Возвращаясь к скинам... очень странно смотрятся одинаковые человечки с обеих сторон, весьма неоднозначное, как по мне решение для такого формата игры
5. Никого не хочу обидеть, но обилие женских голосов, воплей, стонов, абсолютно доминирующих в звуковом фоне игры немного странно
6. Откровенно примитивная (убогая) система подбора игр, да и внутриигровой интерфейс тоже, в том числе отсутствие возможности играть в режиме хардкор (только на частных серверах, за которые не начисляется прогресс)
7. Механики стрельбы из оружия, да и в целом оружие в игре оставляют желать лучшего
Баги и прочие технические моменты минусами не считаю, все таки игра пока не в релизе
В целом для игры такого потенциала (и такой ценовой категории) - все очень печально!!!
Лучше бы сделали полноценные ремастеры Bad Company 2 и 3 части)

I have been playing the Battlefield series since Bad Company 2 (as for me, this is the best part) and at the moment in 2042 I played 16 hours ... a very ambiguous impression, and frankly, despite a number of obvious positive aspects, the disadvantages of the game are very striking, for example:
1. Disgusting maps, huge, empty, destructible (is there anyway?), Especially in contrast to the old maps that are presented in Portal
2. A very strange technique in its mechanics ... what are the hovercraft (do they crawl on the walls ???)
3. The class system is very dubious and terrible in its essence, not only does it make no sense, but also skins are a natural freakshow (I understand everything, game developers have become difficult nowadays, there are a lot of people who need to please, and it’s generally dangerous to offend)
4. Returning to skins ... the same little people look very strange on both sides, very ambiguous, as for me the solution for this format of the game
5. I don't want to offend anyone, but the abundance of female voices, screams, groans, absolutely dominating the sound background of the game is a little strange
6. A frankly primitive (poor) matchmaking system, and the in-game interface too, including the lack of the ability to play in hardcore mode (only on private servers, for which progress is not credited)
7. Mechanics of firing weapons, and in general, weapons in the game leave much to be desired
Bugs and other technical issues are not minuses, all the same the game is not yet in release
In general, for a game of such potential (and such a price category) - everything is very sad !!!

94,Battlefield 2042,Lionstar,"Dec 9, 2021","The only reason this game get's a 1 of 10 is the Fact it has functioning vehicles and solid DEMO-like modes for Old game templates in ""Portal"".
In Portal, you can create a DEMO of the old games and the actual game. But in the old games, you only use a handful of weapons with no customizations. I played Demos in the 90' and early 2000 its the same but the developer is the player.

Best you do with BF 2042 ... play Demos of old games find the ones you like and buy them. then DEINSTALL BF 2042 again.

I don't know if I will reinstall BF 2042 after a year or when it's Dropped like BF V after Pacific and it final developed with fewer bugs and graphic hiccups.

Only 2 main game modes Conquest ( Running and dieing simulator with casual kills) and Conquest ... at least you see more than 2 players in these empty desert maps for 64 enemy players. This game is not a 128 Player game if the only ones you play against are 64 players.

In a Battleroyale where everyone plays against everyone ...that's a 128 Player vs game.
""This is not what I want"" of a Battlefield game.

IT is sad I only have to mention Bad things but the minimalistic destruction is not worth mentioning.
You can blow little holes with the rocket launcher and not blow a whole map away if you target specific places on some walls. That is nice but ... not what I feel good enough and will be forgotten in newBF Games to come like so much in this one.

98,Battlefield 2042,RyanHoar,"Nov 15, 2021","I was telling my buddy last night. They had the secret formula, and they willingly chose to go another direction. Between the random bullet pathing, the lack of destruction, the changes to squad formations, and the ABYSMAL specialist system; to call this a Battlefield game is a lie.

They could have just rehashed BC2 or BF4 with 2042 tech/vehicles/ui, and added new modes (akin to a Warzone, or Team tactical). At least go back to the Kits (Recon, Medic, etc) to make it more squad based than BF5 was, and stop trying to copy weaker games. They had the secret sauce, all they needed to do was improve on what the community loved and it would have been a masterpiece. Nobody asked for flashy weather effects that don't add a sense of danger or impact. The soundtrack is a train wreck. The final moments of a game, when the audio would intensify with the BF Theme? It's been replaced by a static garbled sounding cat in a washing machine sound. It's like we're being trolled.

The lack of destruction is staggering, and it especially stands out when you go back to the older games in Portal. It's just a sad state of game.

7,Battlefield 2042,Thasmal,"Nov 23, 2021","This might have ""battlefield"" in the title, but don't get tricked. This game is a sheer mess, and it continues to show that DICE simply don't understand what People want battlefield to be.

For one example of this, there's the balance of the ""rock, paper, scissor"" part of the games balancing. In bf 1 we saw a overcommitment to this idea, meaning most shootouts were decided before anyone fired a shot, simply based of the classes/weapons chosen and the given engagement range. Here in 2042, DICE have apparently decided that this type of balancing should instead just be entirely removed, as this is more or less the result since now any ""class"" can have any weapon (or more accurately, classes simply aren't a thing anymore) and more so, any weapon can now be modified on the fly to fit any range just when you need it. Sure this means no more ""predestined"" firefights, but it also completely removes the possibility for many thrilling situations. No longer will you be caught in the midst of the battle as a sniper, and feel the huge disadvantage that entails, making you sneakily try to get away while making every kill 10 more satisfying knowing they had the upper hand. No more will you be pined down by a sniper, while you carry a shotgun, and have to sneak from cover to cover while closing the distance before finally taking out the sniper. And I could go on. While being at an disadvantage can feel dispowering if the disadvantage is too great (how many felt in bf1) it can also be hugely impowering if done right. This balance might not be easy to hit, but bf4 did a very good job. Sure the assault rifles were overall hands down the best weapons, being too tier at both close to medium range. This however was pretty balanced out by the fact that medics had no single tool against vehicles, and would still lose in long range to importingly both snipers and DMRs. This meant that fx an engineer could deside whether he wanted to be able to challenge a medic at medium to long range (if he chose a DMR), or at close range (PDW, carbine or shotgun). Meaning that an engineer had to decide a what range he can effectively fight. Now while it was true that the medic had the advantage of being as effective as PDWs at close range, and until some point as effective at medium ranges as an DMR. The medic had to really worry about vehicles. So all in all they both had a comparably amount of situations where they were at the disadvantage. The important part here is recognizing where this balance lies. It's important that any build has the advantage in certain situations, and the disadvantage in others. However as the engineer class in bf4, you had the freedom to change which situations where which, without being able to make an all-rounder which could do it all. In 2042 you can not only have a DMR or assault rifle which can be fitted on the go to be perfectly capable at any given range (the second DMR even outclasses the sniper rifles at the longest ranges (-_-)) you can even combo this with an rocket launcher for vehicles no matter what weapon you pick. This is just an example of how DICE have completely screwed up the very fundamental ideas of how the games have been balanced out beautifully in past games, and this is of course in addition to all the more obvious ""hands on"" screw ups they have made this time. Conclusion? DICE don't know why Battlefield used to be great, probably making it very unlikely that they will turn this ship around. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Collapse",0,2,2
8,Battlefield 2042,QuiteQuixotic,"Nov 16, 2021","Not only is the game immensely broken right now but the game itself is just bad. After your 3rd try you’ll usually get into a match... but the servers are broken so be prepared to lag 80% of the match. Even if it were to work properly the way they designed this game is absolutely embarrassing. Every map is terrible. They are all insanely open with nothing on them. Want to run to another area to fight people? Run 10 minutes. The guns don’t do anything at a range either so what’s the point of the maps being so open? And chances are, your not going to make it to that next area, because vehicles are more op then they’ve ever been in battlefield. Right as you spawn, chances are there’s a helicopter above you and 2 hovercrafts and a tank around you. You’ll spawn in the open and just die. You have no chance as a foot soldier. Even if you do carry a rocket it takes 5 to take anything down, more than you have. And you’ll just die in one shot by any vehicle so your going to die several times trying to take one down. And if you do, congrats, there’s still 3 more around you that you have no chance against. The games also lacking so much content compared to every other battlefield ever. Not very many guns and you unlock all of them by just simply leveling up instead of leveling up the class or anything interesting. There’s also specialists that should never be in games but are especially badly made in this. There’s so much more to say is bad including the graphics if you care about that. Basically the game is incredibly bad. And they won’t let me get a refund! It’s a joke. Collapse",2,2,2

- Portal might be good some day.

- No classes
- Wide open maps with no cover
- Maps are too big and turns the game into a running simulator
- No scoreboard
- No changing squads
- No changing teams
- Awful hit registration
- Awful random bullet deviation
- Broken hover tank that can scale walls and harder to blow up than a tank.
- Bug that won't allow you to re-deploy when you die. You have to leave the game.
- Bug that will show your team mates as enemies and they can knife you to death
- Only 22 weapons, of which 2 are actually good.
- Attachments unlocked that are cosmetic only.
- Some attachments do the opposite of what the description gives.
- XP disabled in custom portal games
- Attachment progression disabled in AoW Solo / Squad matches.
- Crashes and disconnects
- Persistence data error that makes the game unplayable.
- Only two modes on 7 maps for AoW that feels like you are playing wide open fields.
- Control points in breakthrough mode on top of skyscrapers what can't be captured because there are 11 vehicles on top.
- Hit registration, or lack there of. You will dump an entire clip into an enemies back to have them turn around and kill you.
- You can get in a vehicle and shoot and kill yourself because the animation still has you outside of the vehicle.
- Crap FPS on the highest end systems. Changing the settings makes virtually no difference.
- No stats page
- No server browser
- Lobby disbands after every game, no carryover
- No distinctions between factions except the glow stick colors. Soldiers around the world wear glow sticks to make themselves unseen to the enemy. Sometimes you see the Betty White specialist kill the other Betty White specialist who is then revived by the Betty White specialist.
- When you spawn in you are forced into an animation of chambering a round that you can't avoid. If you spawn near an enemy, you are dead.
- Not nearly enough destruction.
- Can't change the scale of the UI, or the zoom of the mini-map.
- No all chat
- No bullet damage on hit, this goes for vehicle hits too.
- Finding yourself on the map or the mini-map can be... challenging.
- You can't dive under water but...
- You can fall through the map
- Portal
- No single player campaign that was left out to focus on the multiplayer.
- No spectator mode
- No community servers
- No test range
- No 3d spotting
- No contextual leaning
- No crouch sprinting - No scope zeroing - No tiered or paused reloads - No melee weapon choices - No thermal optics in the future - No Claymores - No first person takedowns which are different based on positioning. - No naval vehicles even though a loading scene depicts one - No gunner direction indicator - No TV missiles - No vehicle kill assists.

62,Battlefield 2042,pleasebekind,"Dec 17, 2021","If you were hoping for something similar to BF3 or BF4 then stay far far away. There is only one thing I wish for right now...I wish I could get a refund. This is the last time I ever buy an EA game and the last time I pre-order from any company. All these corporations are just out there lying to us in their promotional material and lying to us about how the game development is progressing. I'm such a fool! I have officially uninstalled the game. You win this round EA, you got my money, you thieves.

Here is a list of **some of the things** this game messed up:
-After 3 patches, for me anyways, it plays worse with constant hitching and rubber banding, even on the 64 player modes.
-The UI is convoluted and annoying to navigate. Even simply things like editing your ""classes"" takes way too many clicks. What was wrong with how BF4 did it?
-There are only 22 guns in the base game this is so boring, especially because there are only a few that are actually useful. Even worse, because there are only 22 guns progression is drawn out and slow. I know there are more guns in portal mode, but those are half baked implementations that have zero progress, barley any attachments and are only usable in portal mode which is not the reason people bought this game.
-Portal feels like something they slapped into the game to make it feel like there is more content then there actually is. The main game is pathetic compared to past games, there are no smaller game modes like TDM, Domination, Rush (outside of limited time modes), conquest small. There is only 128 player conquest and 128 player breakthrough. Why?
-The maps are universal in size. If you get stuck without a vehicle, which happens all the time because they FORCE you to spawn at the beginning of a match even if all the vehicles are full leaving you to walk a quarter mile over them hills to get to an objective. Yes there is a vehicle call in system but that is disabled at the beginning of the match, so do yourself a favor and redeploy to save time. There is just far too much down time between objectives, how this passed QA is beyond me. In my opinion, there isn't a single good map in this poop stain of a game they all feel way too large and have too little cover. So prepare for the ride of your life getting shot from ever direction imaginable and being struck down by helicopters, because its open season for foot soldiers.
-The specialist are super lame, they should have just stuck with classes like always. The specialist's voice lines are completely contrary to the tone set by the initial trailers and cinematics. They tell jokes and brag, its odd. At the very least they could have put certain specialists into specific classes so you know what type of class any given specialist is. I would have preferred classes like always and sells skins for those, easy. You don't need lame looking, lame sounding, sorry excuse for a COD character specialists. Open up them wallets for an exciting future of $20 ridiculous looking skins and extreme class confusion.
-The amount of missing features compared to past games is too long to list here, just look it up.
-The most annoying thing out of all of this is people bought the expensive versions of the game to play early but got an absolute garbage can of a game and now a month later the game is close to %50 off LOL...F me, right??? No apology and no guarantee there will be future content (look at BF5 for how their promises turn out). EA hates you.

I'm pretty confident in assuming there are no original developers left at Dice, they are either a failed studio or shackled by EA's corporate greed. This game makes a mockery of the franchise. I've had enough of this. Collapse",0,1,1

in every other industry, QA testers are paid to test a product and have the final result polished
in gaming industry, the customers pay $60 to do the job that someone failed miserably at.

This time around, DICE have skipped the campaign mode and dedicated an additional year to the development of BF 2042. Before any of the playtests, it seemed like DICE finally understood what makes a Battlefield game. They paid homage to the older titles, as well as legendary ""only in Battlefield"" moments, most notably rendezook, and at this point it looked like we're finally getting the one game that will dethrone BF4

Then the beta arrived, which was unfortunately a very accurate portrayal of the final release.
Personally, I hated the Orbital map, and at least had hopes the other maps won't be as empty.

Maps: The size and design of the maps remind me of BF3: Armored Kill DLC which, as veteran players might remember, are designed for vehicle combat. The maps were amazing back in BF3, because they were an option in the huge roster that the game had.
2042 however doesn't have any other style of maps, with the common theme being a lack of cover, which makes infantry combat absolutely boring.
Destruction-wise, this game seems to take a step over 10 years back, providing an absolutely underwhelming damage model with very few walls being destructible.

Class system: Replaced by a lackluster operator system. Out of the entire roster, the only operator which currently feels fun to play is Mackay, who has a zipline that can be used to traverse the massive maps quicker.

Gunplay: Absolutely awful, currently standing with 22 weapons, and 1 meta gun that everyone uses. Don't have it unlocked? tough luck.
If you're using an SMG, LMG or AR, your bullets fly absolutely everywhere except where you aim.

Matchmaking: Awful, with complete lack of basic features as - switching teams, joining squad with friends, server browser
Progression: Slow and boring
Soundtrack and sound design: Awful
UI: Awful

Verdict: If you're hoping that this game will be eventually saved by someone as was the case of BF4 back in the day.. don't get your hopes too high.
This is not a good game, which just has a few technical issues that need to be polished,
if this title ever wants to be successful it needs a complete ground-up overhaul. Collapse",0,1,1

All weapons have the same attachments, nothing feels unique

Many attachments do literally the same as the other ones

Only 22 weapons (BF3 had nearly 60 weapons to unlock)

Only 7 maps BF had 9 ( or with all DLC 25 maps)

UI feels clunky and not intuitive

No scoreboard (New anti-cheat lmao, if u can't see a 100 - 0, then there are no cheater)

Maps have a bad infantry flow structure

Why classes if everyone can be everything (Everyone can equip medikits, repair boxes, and stuff)

Operators are sometimes useless ( As example allow the doc to pick up people with the medic gun otherwise they have nothing special compared to someone with medikit)

""Destruction"" is not even really there or even ""at the BF5 level""

Scope bug where different item usages break your scope and you have to switch to iron sight to fix it

No ""Military Ranks"" just numbers which feels like a cheap replacement to save work

To many cutscenes before and after a match.

Server laggs and rubberbanding

No visible line between the operators. There should be operators for each site because atm its confusing

Hit reg is broken and often does not work at all

Bloom Random Recoil makes most assault rifles unplayable

Performance, in general, is trash

DLSS seems not to work

No option in-game to activate DX12 (you can activate it in the config file)

Hovercraft ... I don't even know how I should list all stuff that is broken with it

No voice or global chat

No server browser

Let us be in a lobby after a match without re matchmake us

Fix to join friends that are in around Planes not getting destroyed in most collisions because ""noob-friendly"" Mines disappear if you die Netcode seems worse than every other battlefield before Attachment unlock requirements follow no reason for stupid high kill counts No team swap No squad creation/management No commander No ""Medic is x meters away from you"" More normal bikes on the map for a bit of individual transport Allow ingame ui to be transparent in options ( it was possible in beta I think) No joystick support for piloting Only 2 game modes Only 5 XP for heal/revive WTF Dice? No XP for repair as a mechanic? WTF? Revive not possible if someone's head is just 1 cm near some object Breakthrough mode objectives on some maps are not balanced ( I saw never a game going behind specific areas) No damage dealt indicator for vehicles (it was there in alpha/beta) Audio / Footsteps feels really off Breakthrough games sometimes have no end because there is no new zone / the server does not check if the game is done Auto Deploy at start of round... Why? Remove it AA Misses seeming buggy at pathfinding Why do we have no mouse on Hazardzone Char selection? No private/rented servers Gunplay is not Battlefield but feels like f2p arcade shooter No hardcore No resizable minimap No separate Heli & Jet controls Obnoxious voice-overs, operators are incredibly vocal, every time you do an action they say a line. The spotting system is contextual and misses a lot of the time. For example, if you press Q over an enemy tank it doesn't always spot it but places a go-to marker on that area. The team/squad order menu (or whatever it's called) is a pile of garbage. It covers the entire screen, it requires using the mouse to select the options, but not clicking on them for some reason, you have to depress Q. This needs to be redesigned into a friendlier and smaller semi-transparent wheel. Plus, it's not contextual at all and it doesn't seem to have an impact to other players, I requested ammo constantly and nobody even saw my request. On the spawn screen tanks/helis use the same icon, you simply cannot tell if that's a transport or attack heli that you are spawning into. When in the tank, you don't have this little tank outline that tells you where the driver and gunner are looking at. No maps with water and thusly no boats.. despite there being a big ass boat on the loading screen. No squad points for issuing orders or following them No marksman headshot bonus for long-range snipes Cannot tell if there is room to enter a friendly vehicle without trying to get in it.

5,Battlefield 2042,chikhai,"Nov 17, 2021","In all the years I've spent gaming I've never felt compelled to write any kind of user review, but as a long time Battlefield fan I can't hold my tongue on this one.

Battlefield has always been plagued with bad launches. Battlefield 4 caused me to abandon the game for a month after its initial launch, but Battlefield 2042 has problems that are more fundamental than just kinks that can be ironed out with a few patches. There are issues that are obviously design choices, and very cynical ones at that.

Problems like bad optimisation, a lack of global chat, VOIP, bad server performance, lack of a scoreboard, or even the weapon balance issues (like there currently being only two viable weapon choices out of the entire roster) can be easily addressed. Though given Dice's track record, ""easily"" equates to several months.

The biggest problem is that Battlefield 2042 does not feel like a Battlefield game. Dice have always been keen to introduce new elements into the series, but the games have always had a strong core gameplay element which is absent from this game. Its difficult to pin down, but there is definitely something off about Battlefield 2042.

It could be the reliance on gadgets, the empty and sterile feeling to the maps, the poor sound design (extremely evident when you play the Bad Company 2 modes available on Portal), weak feel of the weapons, or abandoning the class system of previous games; something just doesn't sit right with the game as a whole.

The specialist system is nothing more than an attempt to grab new players more familiar with the likes of Warzone and a cynical way to monetize the game going forward. While there are specialists that have been teased so far that aren't in the base game that are allegedly locked behind the season passes; I honestly don't think it will end there. Knowing EA's desperation to milk as much money as it can from its customer base, I can foresee specialists and skins that give a distinct tactical advantage being paywalled behind the store. How long until we see the Battlefield 2042 equivalent of the Rose skin from Warzone, that gave players an advantage in dark environments for months until it was addressed? Or how about an specialist with an unbalanced ability like ammo regeneration or an extra gadget slot? This is all hypothetical, but moving away from the existing class system is entirely about monetisation and not about adding to the game from a gameplay perspective.

The specialist concept also removes the reliance on team play. There are glimmers of hope there where you can kind of see what they were aiming for, ie Rao hacking aerial vehicles so his team mates can lock onto them with impunity, but the reality is that most players will tailor the specialist to give them a solo advantage. There are too many specialists that have been created from the ground up for solo players too. Sundance and Angel are prime examples. What does Sundance bring to the party other than anti-armour grenades? A good Sundance player could use the wingsuit ability to put a spawn beacon in an area not easily accessible to the enemy, but will they when they can just throw anti-armour grenades at will? Angel could easily keep an entire squad alive and well stocked while they move from position to position, but why bother with that when you can just take him to the top of a building with your sniper rifle and medpack, and sit there for the entire round? And could someone please explain the point of Boris to me?

At the time of writing this, Dice have removed the proximity sensors from the game. This was done in the name of them causing server issues, but the reality is that people were using them for easy XP. Personally, I don't have an issue with them. People may be farming them for experience, but at least in doing so they were contributing to the team. It highlights a bigger problem though, most of the abilities or gadgets in the game revolve around revealing the enemy on the minimap. Obviously this is a valid tactical advantage and a much needed one, but there is no counter to it. And speaking of visibility, in a game that does its best to hamper you visually, whether thats ground clutter, smoke or ECM, would it hurt to have at least one thermal or NVG option?

Time to wrap this up as typing this is getting too depressing to talk about. If you're a Battlefield fan, avoid this until it goes on sale. Give it at the very least six months. Though I honestly I don't think the fundamental issues will have been addressed. I think these are core changes that are intentional in an attempt to try and bring in a new playerbase.

EA touted this game as a ""love letter to the fans"". The reality its more of a breakup letter. Written in crayon. And you had to pay for the postage. Collapse",1,1,1

This is a washed down, trendy, quirky off-spin of what used to be a respected semi-realistic, serious, large scale team based shooter. (say that 3 times fast)

The atmosphere of this game more or less represents a modern take on APEX including Specialists that no true Battlefield fan enjoys. Even IF all the bugs can be fixed (And there's a lot of bugs..) the game will simply be tolerated at best.

The real battlefield is represented through heart racing gunfights, while enemy tank shells level 2 story structures around you, enemy helicopter blades and gunfire whistle in your direction. While your teammates are screaming for ammo, a medic, and F*CK THERE'S A GRENADE! You are the unknown soldier on the front lines fighting for your life, doing your job to revive, provide ammo, cover fire, and recon the Battlefield.

BF4 is my favourite one, so playing the beta was like having your childhood favourite meal prepared by your grandmother. It was a beta, so I thought: ok, some things need to be polished off, a couple more maps and we are good to go... then the 12th was finally there, had some beers ready, all friends from BF4 on Discord, what could go wrong? Error messages, connection problems... ok things like that can happen. We had it in the past... potato servers, too many players? I don't know. And kind of I was prepared for that. Next day - finally we can play... and from that place, for me that game started to be a bigger and bigger disappointment day after day. First £20 for a digital artbook and a skin that you can only use on one character?! But ok, maybe I missed the fact it is for only one character, I would never look at the artbook anyway - that's on me. I wanted to support my favourite title, paid the £100 - let's move on... but the rest! No way the product they delivered is worth any of the money they want for any of the game editions... that game looks just 1/4 finished for me, it's a slap in the face from EA. Lags, you cant revive teammates sometimes, unbalanced, what kind of scoreboard is that? Maps are way too big if you don't want to use vehicles, so you spend minutes to get somewhere only to find out there is already a team of tanks waiting for you. And so much more.... and on top of that - cheaters from day one. I would be more happy to get a remastered BF4 than this :( Before you buy, try the 10h you get free in the pass, just to be sure you like it, I didn't... luckily I was able to get a refund today without any issues.

18,Battlefield 2042,Norrisn,"Nov 17, 2021","Terrible. That's all I can say, from map design, animation, movement, optimization, gun selection, audio, UI. No real highlights here.

It seems with every iteration of battlefield things that did well in the previous battlefields just gets forgotten about or replaced in an amateur and rudimentary way. When you look at how polished BF1 and compare it to 2042, it truly boggles the mind of how far DICE have fallen with their quality and standards.

BF1 felt atmospheric, the map design beautiful, intense and wonderful flow between objectives and yet we are left with open maps devoid of detail or character, and when you play most of these maps you really cant be bothered to move 500m to the closest objective.

The specialist system is counter to the essence of what made previous battlefields great, the idea I always believed was that we play as generic soldiers whose only stand out is our readiness in terms of equipment choice, map knowledge, team work and overall skill level. Teamwork is completely gone as you are left wondering what role to play or any role at all.

gunplay and movement feel like a cheap battlefield knockoff, which is far from the heights of BF4/1, it doesn't feel comfortable to play and often feels very jarring.

It is also terribly optimized, my system can do 120-210 fps on previous games with no rubber banding or hit register issues and here I have to take the graphics down to low to just get a stable-ish frame rate, in a world of GPU shortages - shouldn't DICE have optimized for many of us who cant get a new high end GPU? Also for essentially a game that feels, looks, behaves worse than previous gen titles, it leaves you wondering where is all this performance going? and what have the devs been doing for the entire dev cycle?

Most people are saying play portal But we came for BF2042 standard multiplayer, if we wanted to play the previous games - we would just go and play the previous games which btw are still pretty active!

No scoreboard, no chat, no classes, barely destruction, no teamwork, no style, no swapping squads, no real customization, no server browser. No fun.

- Fewer infantry gadgets - No manual leaning - No diving while swimming - No high wall vaulting - No crouch sprinting - No backwards prone - No explosion knockback - No rolling after falling from heights - No ammo or health pickup off teammates - No scope zeroing - No thermal optics - No indirect fire gadgets - Less anti-tank launchers (Come on man only one?) - No lock-on launchers (The M5 works with the SOFLAM but that requires 2 people) - No AP mines/claymores - No static weapon emplacements - No fortification building - No resupply stations - No suppression mechanic (This one I don't mind but I'm including everything) **Vehicles** - Fewer vehicle types (and separate vehicle progression per faction even though they are functionally identical... why???) - No naval vehicles (Except I guess the hovercraft technically) - No vehicle gunner direction indicator - No lock on direction indicator - No vehicle enter/exit animations - No tank turret decoupling (This was so great in BF4!) - Less vehicle driver/pilot customization options - No tank zoom customization options - No tank gunner customization options - No heli gunner secondary weapons - No separate heli/fixed-wing controls - No control input while looking behind/free looking in aircraft (BF1 and V pilots, this one is gonna absolutely suck for you guys) **Scoring System** - No squad wipe scoring - No player damage points - No vehicle damage points - No vehicle kill assist points - No headshot bonus - No long-range kill bonus - No assist counts as kill bonus - No squad objective play bonus - Oversimplified teamplay scoring (i.e. healing a teammate always gives you +5xp rather than the amount of health you give) **Squad and Teamwork** - No commander - No special squad call-in abilities - No squad field upgrades - No in-game VOIP - Fewer factions (with almost nothing to give the 2 factions any distinction) - No cross-team chat - No ""create new squad"" option - No ""promote to squad leader"" option - No clans - No view of squadmates while in the spawn screen - No ""Medic incoming"" indicator in downed state - No rank names/icons, just a number. **UI and Quality of Life** - Less control customization options - Less UI customization options - No HUD/icon opacity customization - No HUD scaling customization options - No gunsight reticle customization options - No network performance graph - No individual player scoreboard - Less detail in the 'who killed you' screen - No ultrawide monitor support - Very poor friend joining system - Controller aim assist is absolutely BROKEN.

-Portal (although game can feel clunky because it translate from the base game)
Cons
-Very poor performance on PC (at least for me)
-Overall gunplay, Slow TTK, Random Bullet Deviation, weapons animation feel clunky because it try to copy MW19 style, and bare minimum selection of weapons .
-Bad UI, very confusing and eye bleching.
-Missing features from previous games. They scrap all of it instead building upon the previous games.

In a nutshell, we're missing so much, and we're having a bad experience;

-lack of content in the base game,
-maps that are too big,
-weapon 'bloom' that makes weapons useless,
-poor hitmarker registration,
-OP vehicles,
-weird crashes,
-sparsely populated maps with no cover,
-lack of destroyable buildings,
-no proper scoreboard,
-terrible UI,
-terrible voice acting (I thought this was supposed to be a brutal and gritty take on the near future and climate crisis?)
-long, unskippable intro and outros to every game
-no server browser for 2042
-stupid specialist system (just give us classes!)
-no squad settings or ability to create new squads
-no team swapping
-terrible spawn points near locations that put you out in the open ready to be slammed by a hovercraft or some other OP vehicle

78,Battlefield 2042,zetahybrid,"Nov 19, 2021","Yikes, where to begin…

I have played all the Battlefields since BF2. It is my favorite franchise. Personally, I feel the series peaked with BF3/4. I have put many thousands of hours into those two. I enjoyed BF1 somewhat. I tried my hardest to enjoy BFV but I just found myself getting more and more frustrated the more I played it, much like I am now with BF2042. There are some things I do enjoy but there are some decisions that were made in the design of this game that are just baffling.

Scoreboard/All Chat: Trying to encourage teamwork by obfuscating certain things seems a little ham-fisted to me. You don’t encourage teamwork by hiding things from the player. If I want to see how I am doing in relation to other players on my team I should be able to do it. I would also love to complement enemy players if they did some crazy play or if we had a nice duel with sniper rifles in the middle of the desert. But we can’t do that now because of the chance of people being toxic to one another?

Specialists: In what was clearly a directive from corporate they decided to go down the hero soldier route in lieu of the traditional 4-class system in a blatant attempt to better sell the eventual onslaught of cosmetics. I was initially skeptical but willing to give them a chance. Each hero is given two unique traits that are exclusive to them. Some of these are great, like Mackay’s grapple hook and Rosier’s wing-suit. Others feel kind of lackluster in comparison, like Angel’s ability to revive someone with armor instead of health.

You are given a lot of leeway in how you can customize your soldiers in terms of weapons and equipment but this creates a problem. Everything now feels homogenized. Everyone is a sort of jack of all trades. You can’t call these specialists. Does a specialist run around with a med-kit, sniper rifle and an RPG? Being able to throw together whatever random load-out you want means there is no longer a rock/paper/scissor element to encounters. That might sound like a good thing but hear me out. If I am playing as the Assault class, I know I will excel in infantry combat and be able to heal and revive but if I come across a tank or helicopter? You can bet your ass I’m going to be running. If I am playing as an engineer with an RPG and a PDW, I know I can handle myself in close quarters and be a deterrent to enemy armor but I can;t heal or resupply myself. Playing as a Recon I know I can spot enemies from a distance and be a general nuisance from afar or make a suicide dash towards a tank with some C4. This was a dynamic that I loved in previous Battlefield games. BF2042 has none of that.

Squads: Removing the ability to create squads or leave a squad to join another has been removed. What? This basic feature has been in almost every battlefield game. Why remove it?

When I am in a squad I have no idea what they are bringing to the table. Did someone bring an ammo crate? Does someone have a way to deal with tanks? Is this person using a shotgun or sniper rifle? Can this person spawning on me repair my tank? I have no idea. I guess I can ask in squad chat or voice chat. (Oh wait, there is no voice chat!) Previous games had a simple yet brilliant user interface explanation of what load-out your squad was using. Some of you might say that because of the customization options we now have that it would be impossible to do that now. Another reason the 4-class system never should have left.

Weapons: BF2042 has a total of 22 weapons and ONE rocket launcher. ONE! BF4 has 84 weapons including the SMAW, SRAW, MBT-LAW, RPG and two anti air launchers. What the hell happened? I feel very limited in my options for dealing with armor and air in this game.

Maps: The maps are huge to better accommodate 128 people. I get it. However, what usually ends up happening are these pockets of chaos surrounded by vast nothingness. Usually when you are stranded in the middle of nowhere you can call in an air dropped vehicle but they are not always available. You’re almost better off suiciding and respawning than making the miles long trek to an objective.

The tornadoes are also becoming a major nuisance rather than something to be feared. The distortion effect that it creates makes me wish I had the ability to just shut off the UI entirely.

Bugs: The ragdolls on death are hilarious. The way your character rolls around on the ground like a turtle waiting for a revive looks silly. The end-game quips are cheesy and annoying. Persistence errors. Deathcam glitches out to show nothing. Rocket hits not registering. Revive bug where the only way out is to alt-f4. Aiming bug where cross-hair moves but your character doesn’t. The list goes on and on. This game was not ready for primetime.

I was so looking forward to this game but BFV should’ve served as a warning of what’s to come. Battlefield has succumbed to **** aura which inevitably destroys everything EA touches. Collapse",0,1,1

89,Battlefield 2042,nickfoles,"Nov 19, 2021","Anyone giving this game a rating for portal is being very disingenuous. Ratings for Portal belong on the games that 2042 copy and pasted from, not on 2042.

As for 2042, at this point, don't buy this game. There are 5 major reasons, in my opinion, why a fan of Battlefield should not buy this game:

1) Hero characters instead of classes.

Yes, Sundance's wingsuit is fun, and I'm glad it's in the game. But the classes were what made Battlefield its own game, and not CoD. You play CoD for the mindless zerg-strat shoot em up matches, but Battlefield was always supposed to be about rewarding the strategy. Players who focused on a support role in the past would be amply rewarded, even though they didn't necessarily engage in much gunplay. That type of gameplay is what Battlefield has always been - until 2042.

2) Gunplay issues.

There have been tweets from devs about gunplay being fixed in the future, but we have absolutely no specifics as to what they plan on changing, or when they plan to make the changes. Some guns have virtually no bloom and virtually no recoil, while other guns are shooting all over the place. Gun fights right now are mostly about just getting lucky. A reticle on an enemy is no guarantee, even on the first shot.

3) Maps are awkwardly large.

The maps are clearly sized for a battle royale, where you can land, maybe engage in some combat, but then have some downtime before engaging with enemies who landed in other areas. This is where Sundance shines with the wingsuit. It's lots of running and lots of downtime. You could run for 5+ minutes in all of these maps and not even be close to another character. Some may see that as a positive, but I see that as a negative. In my opinion, shooters - whether strategy based or not - are still about conflicts. Having maps that are too large takes the conflict out of a game about war.

4) Vehicles are way too heavily overturned.

The hovercrafts are hilarious to drive, and guaranteed death if you run into one in the wild. Rockets are terrible, so infantry just have to hope their teammates are able to win aerial combat, which is a real struggle if the pilot is on PC due to the controls. So if you are a PC player who wants to play this game, make sure you remap to something more comfortable.

5) Lack of transparency.

The Day 1 patch was what many people looked to for some fixes to the gunplay, vehicles, or other random, gamebreaking bugs. A few bugs were fixed, but the gunplay, vehicles, and virtually every other random, gamebreaking bug remained in the game. There is no word as to what will be fixed in the next patch, or if any fixes may come sooner than expected, and we don't know what Dice is focused on fixing. Without knowing that they're focusing on the major issues in this game, there's no reason to actually buy this game.

If you're going to remove dozens of features from your game franchise, and take out the single player to focus on multiplayer, you really have to hit a homerun. Falling back on the typical ""Battlefield launches are always buggy!"" doesn't work when a lot of the issues revolve around major game design decisions that cannot be patched out.

With all of the negative parts out of the way, I'll end this with two ways to have fun in this game:

1) Run with a full squad. The gunplay doesn't matter if it's 2v1, 3v1, or 4v1. You can overcome the horrible aiming systems, and terrible hit registration by multiplying the number of people shooting at the enemy.

2) Use Sundance, and use SMGs. SMGs are currently broken, and the wingsuit is really fun. I wish it were a perk to use on a normal battlefield class instead of a hero character, but if EA just wants to make another version of CoD, at least they got one single thing working well.

Negative:

- The killed the whole teamplay. I am not able to know who is medic, ammo guy etc. Squads are useless and only good as a spawn point.
- They killed all options we need for a good gaming experience: Squad switch/create/lock, Scoreboard
- Who the hell had the idea to NOT integrate a server browser? I dont want to play random maps. I want to join my favorite servers with my favorite map, friends and settings.
- No more ingame chat for the whole server? Who smoked too much pot before doing this decision? Its a multiplayer game, i want to laugh and talk with my enemy players about funny situations in the chat!
- Dice/EA decided to delete ALL strong features from the past, which we loved and hoped that they will enhance them instead of deleting them:
--- no proper damage to buildings / no falling of buildings and leave a mess and add a ""new area"" for playing
--- no commander mode (would be amazing especially the player increased to 128)
--- the levelution was great in the past, it created a new level inside the level. Dice decided to skip that and insert some Tornado which is just annoying after a while
--- Battlefield V had a great system to build sandbags, road blocks etc. It gave the game more depth and something to support ur team even you are not shooting. Guess what, its not there anymore....
--- Dice decided to delete what makes Battlefield special (the classes), instead we have specialists and everyone can pick all items. That some good decision? Not!
- Battlefield 2042 doesnt have a character. Its a mix of marketing ideas, stacked together and thrown at the gaming audience.
- Bots: we dont need bots in a multiplayer game. If people want to play against bots, they can play training mode or a singleplayer game.
- Hazard Zone: tried it once. Will never play it again.
- Battlefield Portal is a good idea but as i expected, it will not work out well: most servers are crap with settings you dont want to play. Then the second issue is, that if you find a good server, the chance is high that its not there anymore next time you want to play it. Cause the server are shutting down if nobody is playing on it. So you can not have a dedicaded server in ur favorite list where mostly the same people are playing together. Portal is for some fun modes for in-between. But nothing serious in the long run
- Did i say that they killed the whole team- and squadplay ? ....

-------

- Awesome big maps. Gives you a great oldschool Battlefield atmosphere.
- Graphics looks mostly amazing.
- Good battle atmosphere. Thats what we love when it comes to Battlefield. Collapse",1,1,1

This has to be the worst Battlefield game ever, I hate to say it but its worse than Hardline and that game was rubbish.

I went into the game with an open mind, I have been a fan since the days of BF2. Nice intro, then an explanation about conquest which said you win the battle by capturing points not wiping the enemy, and that my be correct on paper and in a small amount of games but most of the time the game is one by wiping out the enemy.

The other main issue other than paying £90 for game that doesn't have a story mode which I have enjoyed in the past, was the fact on lower end systems that meet the minimum specs it ran like hot garbage. I get more frames playing a heavily modded Arma 3 than this pile of trash.

The Multiplayer experience was about what I expected to be...rubbish. In the past the difference between BF and COD has been that BF is a team game, but jumped into multiplayer and was spawn killed straight out of the gate.

49,Battlefield 2042,Pupp3tCl0wn,"Nov 20, 2021","TL; DR:
Is the game good? - Main mode no, but Portal is fun.
Is it worth buying? - At full price, no, but at a discount, yes.
The biggest problems? - Poor optimization, chaotic (in a negative sense) battles, unbalanced vehicles, very, very weak starting weapons, which actually discourages you from making progress.

PROPER REVIEW:
As a Battlefield veteran, preorder 2042 was obvious to me. I didn't get discouraged by the negative feedback - I liked the beta quite a bit, and the BF5 was also heavily criticized and in the end I had a great time. But 2042 is different. For the first time in my ""career"", when I entered the new version of BF, I felt completely lost. The maps are huge, but at the same time there is so much going on on them that you are constantly running from point to point, there is no time to rest. Operators are unintuitive, it's hard to tell from the start what each of them can actually do - you have to try them all to find one that suits your style. The starting weapons are terrible and at first you only have the scope / holo from the add-ons. This gives players with unlocked add-ons a significant advantage over you and it really discourages you from continuing to play if this is someone's first experience. And vehicles - they deal massive damage and you can do almost nothing to them. The stock rocket launcher is too weak - the three shots you have in reserve take 1/4 of the health of the stock hovercraft.

On the other hand, Portal is very fun. Even excluding fully custom matches, you get something like ""Battlefield Classics Remastered"" in the package. The return to the classic maps and gameplay from BF1942 in the new graphics was great. I would even be inclined to say that if they released it as a separate game, it would have been more successful. And on smaller maps you can see a significant jump in performance - unfortunately, apparently the Frostbite engine cannot cope with SO large maps of the main mode.

To sum up - at this point I am better off playing multiplayer Halo Infinite, but BF 2042 has potential. I'll probably come back to the game in a month and a half - around the beginning of next year - once the game gets a bit patched and maybe they'll fix the things that put me off. Collapse",6,1,1

5. Destruction. the 'breathtaking' level of destruction promised just simply isn't there? Infact there is pretty much zero destruction.
6. Most dissapointing is the lack of any kind of acceptance from DICE of the failure. Pumping out patches that are removing things instead of fixing them doesn't count.

Overall the games poor, really poor.

The only redeaming part of 2042 was the portal system, but DICE have removed any kind of experience from the gamemode blocking all progression instead of fixing it, killing it in it's tracks.

I am dissapointed and my day is ruined. Collapse",2,1,1
51,Battlefield 2042,CaptainMjolniry,"Nov 20, 2021",The WORST BF game ever made. They didn’t even try. I’ve been a huge BF fan since the beginning. This is a steaming pile of broken garbage,0,1,1
52,Battlefield 2042,KosmaLunae,"Nov 20, 2021","On Steam's store page for BF2042, there are a few reviews by the following individuals that are concisely written and deserve recognition. I also mean to piggyback my review off of them because they speak the same thoughts and opinions as I.

- MR NOBODY
- InfiniteFaux
- MjeeD

It truly baffles me how far off the mark this game is from being what everyone expected.

I expected an experience reminiscent of BF4: being one among dozens of nameless soldiers, locked in dispassionate conflict taking place on a landscape that was indiscriminately chosen to be the victim of the ravages of war.

Feeling truly immersed in a world stricken by poverty, natural catastrophes, and high inter-governmental tensions.

Keeping with the integrity and foundation of BF4 - war adornments (ribbons & medals), extensive customization (tangible & cosmetic), distinct and iconic roles and playstyles (assault, engineer, medic, sniper).

The feeling of cooperative embrace, of being one team fighting for each other's survival.

What I got: a pitiful amalgamation of the most marketable and fast-paced, eSports-esque attributes of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six: Siege and CoD: Warzone.

Right away, playing the beta made me realize how much of a misrepresentation the official trailer was.

It's an ongoing, frantic frenzy of ants on a picnic blanket, running huge stretches by foot while all the vehicles are currently away partying on the top-floor penthouses of skyscrapers. It's basically a cross-country running simulator most of the time while the dysfunctional drivers and pilots steal a helicopter at the start of the round to go on a leisure tour the whole game. It shouldn't be that hard to manufacture or purchase dirtbikes or quads en mass in 2042.

Quirky, superfluous 'specialists' that crack cringy corn-ball quips at the end of the round like, ""That was fun,"" or, ""I'm just better than everyone else!"", completely dismissing the harsh atmosphere and aesthetic that the initial cutscene paints. That's the kind of flaunty animation sequence you'd see in... perhaps... a battle royale game? I wouldn't be surprised to start seeing first place do the [insert viral physical motion here] at the ends of rounds in the next couple of months. Am I playing Battlefield or Apex Legends?

I hate seeing a group of identical clones running around while I try desperately to cling onto the tiniest sense of realism or familiarity. This was an issue that others may feel indifferent about. To me, after being subject to this ""hero shooter"" direction for the past several years, it's the last thing this game needs.

It's a haphazard mess with several discrepancies and misplaced decisions, flat out lacking many emblematic facets of Battlefield (or ANY triple-A FPS title, for that matter) such as a scoreboard, squad switching, classes, and more.

What's with this whole No-Pat freedom fighter militia - mind you, with no actual basis or story (R.I.P. campaigns in games) - but then it's just the typical USA vs. Russia trope again?

Conquest (one of **** two available game modes) is an endless series of frustrating and hectic interactions with soldiers and vehicles, including but not limited to: missing hit registers, sporadic fire patterns, nondescript vehicle damage, inconsistent and poorly designed driving & piloting mechanics.

The number of bugs, coding mistakes, balancing issues and content voids will probably result in a patch timeline that competes with even those of No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk 2077 because clearly, EA's focus was on ""making a game meant to sell, not to play. (~Mr Nobody)""

I've seen people say they still have hopes for the game's potential.

The thing is, these aren't issues that can be solved with a 12 to 20-month service life like we thought would solve our complaints of BFV.

These are inherent creative decisions that go completely against what a Battlefield game is, and would require a literal re-design of most of the game itself.

There is an utter lack of variety and things to do in the game. I feel like I'm playing a $30 Kickstarter game that got popular on Twitch.

Battlefield 2042 is just so clearly the outcome of the executive imbeciles at EA believing battle royales are still the absolute formula for good game design, completely overruling any one person's desire to remain faithful to an authentic Battlefield experience.

There are so many things that they got wrong... the way helicopters behave, the limited gameplay variety, the questionable issues latent in the settings menu, the confusing and unfulfilling weapon & vehicle progression, the unbalanced nature of combat, and more.

I'm just really disappointed. Collapse",2,1,1

61,Battlefield 2042,DreamArez,"Nov 21, 2021","This game is a slap in the face to not only the Battlefield community but to FPS shooters as a whole. BF 2042 has a ridiculously little amount of content, with a small number of guns, maps, vehicles (yes I said vehicles), and specialists being spread out over 50ish levels in which leveling feels very boring. Gunplay has terrible bloom in which makes gunplay practically RNG, I don't care about bullet deviation in real life this is a game people play to relax and have fun and the god-awful hit detection adds further salt to the wound. Weapon balance is a joke, PP29 is the most used weapon by far, and have fun trying to compete with it unless you have a vehicle, those of which are seriously strong and prevent infantry gameplay from being truly viable. There are 2 main game modes outside of portal and Hazard Zone which are basically just useless at this point since most portal games are player XP farms and because Voice Chat isn't implemented yet, it makes game chat with randoms on Hazard Zone nigh impossible. This isn't even getting into the removed features from prior games and the little amount of destruction that is a series staple.

What makes this all worse is that supposedly the game was ahead of schedule, killed off two games that they already messed up and just fixed (Battlefront 2 and Battlefield V), and took multiple studios to come up with an offering that is significantly less than any series entry within recent memory. The icing on the cake is we are not supposed to get the first season until later next year, which is our only hope to get additional content to fill the barren wasteland here. Please, do not purchase this game and stay far away until they are able to remedy these issues. It is clear that EA/DICE do not have a single idea of what a reasonable product for release is and are so out of touch with their community that I think this was the last chance for them to make a decent launch entry since Battlefield 3.

3. Numerous bugs arising from being downed where you cant respawn and are stuck in a frustrating death loop.

An example from the technical part.
I reinstalled the operating system and was unable to start the BF2042. I was getting an error related to visual studio. Even after manually installing the x64 and x86 packages, the problem was not resolved. The problem was solved only after installing and running BFV.
Several times after launching, I was getting the death screen. And no, I have no system or hardware problems. I have a brand new i9 12900K, 32GB 5200Mhz DDR5, RTX 2080ti, Windows 10 x64.
In the middle of a match, the game crashed with a DirectX error. I reinstalled the video drivers, manually installed the latest DirectX package from the Microsoft site - it didn't help.

I am using the ""ADS Field of View"" setting and when I use the sniper scope, the zoom stops working, and to fix this I have to change the scope and back on the fly.
The animations of shooting, running, reloading BROKEN. At the moment of running, the animation breaks and the model simply slides over the surface.
Hitboxes work oddly. In fact, there are only two hitboxes: head and body, and they are poorly made: the hitboxes are larger than the model itself. The damage in the arm and stomach/chest is almost the same.
It often happens that these hitboxes do not work at all: you can shred your opponent with bullets, but the expected result will not be achieved.
Vehicles can ride on walls. When jets crash into buildings (for example, on the hourglass map), nothing happens.
Flight transport controls are broken. The controls are poorly configured, and if the behavior of ground vehicles is perceived as + - normal, then the behavior of the flight transport is simply disgusting.
And if we have already started talking about tanks: why, for example, the speed of a tank turret when turning from the first and third person is different (mouse control)? it looks terrible.
When I try to create my server in Portal, the ping is ~200. #TF?

Now for game design.
It seems to me that abandoning classes was a mistake. I think that the distribution of roles on the battlefield was (and is) one of the key elements of the Battlefield series, and it is also a hallmark of the Battlefield series. It was a deviation into tactics, and not into a senseless war of headless chickens, which BF2042 is now, unfortunately.
The developers were even too lazy to assign specialists specifically to Russians and Americans. Russians and Americans have the same specialists. This is perceived, to put it mildly, strange.
And in order to somehow navigate this madness, the developers were forced to attach red and green markers to the model. Imagine that the army of country N decided to attach markers to its soldiers to make it easier for the enemy to trace them on the battlefield. It's nonsense.
Now specialists.
These are not military specialists, they are clowns. They look awful and pretentious, talk and behave like 16-year-olds who have not known life, children!
For example, a ""Sundance"". Even the name of this ""military specialist"" is already causing mixed feelings. What is this nose piercing? what are these pretentious hairstyles? where have you seen such a military specialist? She also has a tattoo on her face. Oh, God!
She's a third-wave feminist! She is NOT a military specialist!

The balance is terrible and completely broken.
SMGs and marksman rifles are fully dominant. Vehicles, especially hovercraft, this is a legal cheat - very fast, very ""fat"", can ride on walls.

Level design.
All BF2042 maps are flat, empty fields, diluted in places with buildings. It's just horrible!
If you've bought this **** and you've never played the previous Battlefield, compare the BF2042 and BF3 / Bad Company / 1942 maps in Portal mode, where the latest level designers didn't give a f##k.
Sound design.
The sound from the shooting is mediocre. The sound from indoor and outdoor shooting is NO different, only a small echo is added.
The positioning of the sound is broken, it is difficult to understand exactly where the enemy is from the approaching steps. For example, if you are on the second floor and the enemy is on the floor below, you will hear him as if he is on your floor. The main soundtrack is disgusting! Just compare it to BF3/4 or others Battlefield games.

UI.
Acid, retinal-burning colors; no score table; You cannot scale the map to spawn correctly.

Summing up.
The EA looked at the success of Warzone and decided to make their own in order to bite off part of the audience from Kotick, thereby ### their own audience.
Apparently, the Battlefield developers do not understand (or pretend not to understand) that if a player wants to play the Warzone, he will go to play the Warzone, not the pathetic copy of it, which is BF2042 today.
Redo, DICE, or whatever is left of you.

Я, как фанат батлы со времен 3 части могу заявить с полной уверенностью, что это одна из худших частей батлы за все времена. И тут дело далеко не в механике стрельбы или лагахбагах (Хотя это тоже формирует мнение об игре), дайсы всегда в течение следующих 6 месяцев, с момента релиза, допиливали всё до играбильной кондиции.
Самая основная проблема - это геймдизайн, полное непонимание ""из-за чего фанаты любят батлу"", и манипуляция чувствами старичков, и ужимание интересов ""большинства"" в угоду ""меньшинства"". Я понимаю, тренды сейчас влияют на многое, и да, мы смирились с обилием женских персонажей в предыдущей части, но 2042 стала апогеем наплевательского отношения к истинным фанатам серии. И в том числе убивающая всё повестка навязывания терпимости к лгбт (я ничего против лгбт не имею, но пожалуйста, я не лезу к вам - вы не лезьте ко мне).
Структура и архитектура карт была построена под один режим хазард зон (который был введен в игру из-за тех же трендов), никакущее разнообразие оружия, отсутствие классовости, отсутствие адекватной сетки статистики игроков (Которая меня, рукожопа, мотивировала играть лучше).
По моему скромному мнению, эта игра получилась тяп-ляп. Строили её люди с полным непониманием основ ааа и без упора на опыт прошлых игр серии (никакой работы над ошибками). Ну и собственно вот что получается, когда в создании игры на первом месте стоит прибыль. Покупать? - пока рано, слишком много багов. Стерпится? - со временем да.

At launch, monster tier computers struggle to run this game due to how poorly optimized it is. The netcode is sketchy at best.

ОРУЖИЕ
Оружия в игре, считайте, практически нет. Пару автоматов, два пулемета, три дробовика, один пистолет, один револьвер. Все. Но, окей, я бы простил BF2042 этот малый арсенал на старте, если бы он компенсировался отличной проработкой оружия, уникальным ганплеем, как, к примеру в MW19. Но нет, забудьте, этого вообще нет. Ты не почувствуешь разницы между ПП и автоматом, все ощущается крайне пластиковым и не интересным. Баллистика просто треш. Я даже описать толком не могу, просто треш, на фоне которого оружие из фортнайта покажется более реалистичным.
КАРТЫ
Нет, они не показались мне настолько масштабными, что до замесов приходится бежать. Замесы обычно в шаговой доступности, но проблема лишь в одном. Battlefoeld лично для меня всегда была уникальным шутером, засчет разрушаемости, от которой я был в восторге в BF1. Она позволяла выкурить противников, создать им помехи. получить некое тактическое преимущество. Да и в целом это было приятно и, самое главное, ВЕСЕЛО. Если вы обожали эти фишки в прошлых частях, то лучше даже не запускайте эту самоделку. Зданий почти что нет, а те что есть ВОООБЩЕ НИКАК НЕ РАЗРУШАЮТСЯ. Видишь небольшой домик в пустыне и он не является стратегическим объектом? Он не разрушаем, как бы ты ни старался, хоть танком попробуй проехаться. И такого ту полно. Объекты, которые в теории могли бы подвергнуться разрушению, тут просто состоят из сплава титана, который ничем не взять. Ко всем проблемам стоит еще добавить, что карты попросту скучные. Да, они могут быть красивыми и минималистичными, но они попросту наискучнейшие. На наполнение мира разработчики забили настолько, что вообще все дома абсолютно пустые. Там нет ни-че-го. По этой простой причине перестрелки в здании ни зрелищные, ни интересные. Даже погодные условия, которые, к слову, ни на что не влияют, не делают ваш экспирианс запоминающимся, уникальным и интересным. Карты настолько приторно-однообразные, что ты не запомнишь ни названия, ни их отличительные черты.
ОПЕРАТИВНИКИ
Ваша баттлфилд теперь каллофдуди. При условии, что игроков теперь 128, а оперативников менее 10, которые к тому же не привязаны ни к одной из сторон конфликта, вы сами понимаете, какой это ТРЕШ. на карте воюют десятки одинаковых Борисов, с двух сторон конфликта, которые одинаково орут одни и те же реплики. Если в 2042 воюют клоны, то я может пойму этот феномен, но это просто абсурд.

Итог: игру может спасти только переработка оружия с нуля, новые карты и возвращение системы классов.

There's roadkill that has more life than the maps provide. Legend has it there's a frontline of action but I've yet to see it because the maps were designed around hero shooters. And of course the Power Rangers replacing the classes is just insanity, I went and booted up BF4 and grew a beard from the manliness of the military soldiers. With 2042 I accepted my gf having an OnlyFans.

If the whole damn world would hop off social media, these games would have 0 spotlight/hype and then the devs/EA would realize the game *must* be complete when it's physically/digitally shipped to sit on a shelf in Walmart (like the 2000's). God forbid the game might have to:
a) Be complete
b) Have a soul

The game is not enjoyable for me, as a die-hard Battlefield fan.

There are some fun concepts, for example Sundance with the wingsuit, Dozer with the shield, playing Falck (Medic) feels rewarding; healing works well.
Great gunfight physics: Shooting, hits, gun balance feels all smooth now.
I can excuse a certain number of bugs regarding vehicles, movement and some specific perks for the moment.

The problem is that each modes' gameplay-design is individually broken.
To many bad decisions have been made regarding setup, maps and vehicles.
A quick example is TDM, shamelessly spawning you backwards in front of the opponent's gun countless times.
Battlefield 2042 is blatantly skipping TDM basics, that have been tried and tested since decades and are essential for enjoying a match.

Then there are the poster game-modes Conquest and Breakthrough:
The maps fail to find the dimension that can satisfy both, infantry and fighterjets alike (of course...).
If your squad doesn't have ambitious pilots, who can quickly reserve one of the few choppers or airplanes, that you could jump into the battlefront from, you will often find yourself forced to walk the entire map.
These long, tedious walks lead players into using vehicles just to travel to the front, abandoning them after arrival.
Effort placed in levelling and adjusting vehicles to battle efficiency is for nothing, since in the time of need, there will be none available.

Of course there are these few specific tools, that can mitigate the problem to some degree.
But efficiently bringing advanced tactics into play with 3 randoms in the squad and no voice-comms available, is just a very unrealistic expectation.

What is really missing in Conquest & Breakthrough, are carefully designed maps of manageable size without vehicles.
For example indoors, in a ship, a building, a village,
anything except these vast open fields of emptiness, where only large vehicles and snipers can persist. Collapse",0,1,1

However, I forgot the main point...

EA, DICE and most companies, want to make money. There is a difference though from ""making money"" and being greedy. EA is the later.

My son plays a BattleRoyale game in his iPad. That game has around 30 characters, with 3 weapons that get several upgrades, and also some capabilities per character that get upgrades too.

Originally they give you 4-5 characters, but if you want more, obviously the more advanced, you need to unlock them (it could take 100s of hours of playing) or just buy them for $15 each. However, if you want to fully upgrade them, you can spend ~$200-300 for EACH character.

EA has seen that model in most mobile games, and they want their cut. Old type of gaming, where we were giving $40-50-60 to buy the game and $40-50-60 more for all the DLCs, along with some $$ for them from private servers rent isn't by any means nearly profitable as the mobile model.

So, they don't really care about the ""old"" community, their target group are children that are willing to spend $100s for unlocks, attachments, characters, animations, even emoticons! Along with them, they want to be inclusive, by adding transgender, gay, snowflakes, etc.

All the above result in the game we have in our hands, and how it will change in the future. The game is not built to please the ""soldiers"", but the fans of skins, stupid jokes, egocentric behavior, that just want to compare their achievements with their friends. And by ""achievements"" I don't mean kills, revives, resupplies, captures, PTFO, but things they bought and show off anytime, not just in the endgame.

On top of that, the game is a disaster, engine wise, as Reddit, Youtube and other popular places are full of ""only in BF"" moments, that are not funny, but bugs. The state of the game is not Beta, neither Alpha, is ""Under Development"". The Day-1 patch was more focused on skins and Specialists animations, than actual bugs, or balance. Maps are empty, there is minimal destruction (glass doors remain intact, while the wall next to it falls), graphics performance is bad (my 6900XT cannot get above 130fps with LOW settings). All the ""battle"" happens in certain points, and the rest of the maps are empty with almost no cover. If you do not have a vehicle, you are simply dead, cause there is a fraction of a chance to reach a flag, without dying in the process.

Most of the ""old community"" will buy the game based on nostalgia and hope, that we are going to feel the same as in BF1942, BF2, BC2 or BF3, but we are getting disappointed, every time since. Personally I bought it cause I am playing PUBG* for 4 years, and I need something else, and no other games are visible in the horizon.

Overall, DO NOT BUY this game. DO NOT make the same mistake as me (although I am refunding it). We need to show DICE, EA and others, that this model is not viable for PC/PS/XBOX gamers, and either they have to present proper products, or disappear.

The maps are way to big and bland. Vehicles are limited and yet critical due to the maps. The game isn't properly optimized for anyone.

Trying to bash someone with it is like putting a thread through a needle, terrible. Collision is horrible as often when I attack someone with the shield, the enemy player just goes through me and shoots me. The most slight angle and the shield do not protect you. The game does not even treat it like you have the shield equipped when running with it, often getting shot through it.

Vehicles, SMG, and Sniper/DMR's pretty much dominate the game. Constant rubberbanding, their netcode is bad. No bullet drop apparently. This game tries to be every other game and not Battlefield.

The maps look like a combination of a couple of mini maps and there is no integrity. It's like a GTA map but we are a soldier. In addition to that, there are only 20 weapons to unlock which is unacceptable for a 60$ multiplayer-only game. It was the first time that I had played cod MW 2019 a couple of years ago but I love its weapons customization and variation of guns that you can achieve by customization. I was hoping that BF must do that but even it's not close to that.

76,Battlefield 2042,codzy,"Nov 14, 2021","Performance is terrible on a high end PC with an RTX 3070.
The maps are too open and feel lifeless. There's no meaningful cover and this means that vehicles dominate everywhere on every map. Every map is just made of cubes with nothing inside them. No matter where you stand, you can guarantee that there's at least 10 vantage points that you can be seen from, so you just die repeatedly.
Vehicles heal themselves?? This makes it almost impossible to destroy vehicles unless multiple people are focussing on it at the same time. There's almost no risk for a player to hop into a vehicle solo and just start destroying people. Previous games would've required you take an engineer with you to repair the vehicle, which kept things balanced.
There's a poor selection of weapons and gadgets compared with older battlefield games.
Specialists have no place in a classic battlefield game mode. They completely break classes. Because of Specialists there's no way to know what your team mates are carrying, is Sundance carrying Ammo or an RPG? You'll never know because every character can equip every type of weapon. You truly cannot easily coordinate with your squad to make sure each requirement is covered. And even if you could you'd still never be able to take out a vehicle without either all of you carring an RPG or another couple of sqauds helping you.
Aiming on mouse is like jelly, it's entirely unresponsive, which means you can't react quickly to close quarters combat.
The guns that are present are unbalanced. The beginner SMG is more stable and useful at range than the standard Assault Rifle, which has insane recoil.
The User Interface is truly the worst I've ever seen in a full priced ""AAA"" game. It's like it was made for a mobile phone. The tooltips for that you're looking at are in the corners of the screen.... well everything is in the corners, the loudouts are huge squares for some reason so you have to scroll to see them all but the scrolling is painfully slow. The toggles in the main menu are just undecipherable, you can't tell if something is on or off.
The ping system is slow and laggy.
There are still a lot of user interface bugs, such as permanent on screen loading wheels, getting kicked out of the ""call-in"" screen randomly.
Oh and Hazard Zone is boring.
All of this on top of the many many missing features from previous games that everyone else has already spoken about e.g Scoreboards, cover leaning, video feed from squad mates whilst on the spawn screen to ensure you dont choose to spawn nnext to an enemy tank.
They really couldn't have released a worse battlefield game, there's so much more I could say but I've already ranted for too long. Do not buy this game, play BF4 it's better in every regard except for maybe graphical fidelity. Battlefield 2042 is not a fun game, it's a platform that has been built to take money from consumers. I do not believe that this game can be fixed in the way that previous games have redeemed themselves.

82,Battlefield 2042,crumpetsandtea,"Nov 16, 2021","2042 is overwhelming. It throws so much information at you that it becomes incredibly challenging to make critical gameplay decisions (or any decisions) based on the information you have. It's like a visual and auditory sensory overload that tries it's best to let you know what the other 127 people on the server are up to at that moment in time. From the cluttered UI and HUD, to the muffled audio and identity crisis, 2042 is confusing at best and downright overwhelming and frustrating at worst.

The audio is overwhelming. There is something fundamentally broken and flat with the audio mix. There is no balance between critical gameplay information and immersion. It all blends together with no dynamics as if all sounds are played at the same volume. I cannot discern the sounds of my 30 teammates stomping around from the sound of a squad of enemies approaching. It's like trying to listen out for footsteps while wearing ear defenders, everything sounds muffled and dull. Trying to isolate the gameplay information from the white noise is an exercise in insanity.

The HUD is overwhelming. With everything being this futuristic shade of neon teal, combined with tiny font, I feel as though I need to squint my eyes and scan read to figure out what information is being relayed to me. Why do I need to see an icon for every gadget I have equipped all the time? Wouldn't it be better suited to have a context overlay appear as I swap gadgets/weapons and use the space available to only show critical information like ammo, health and armour. Objective markers are so obtuse that I can't actually see the players hidden behind them. A1, A2, B1, B2 flood my screen and make no effort to reduce in transparency even if you are looking through gun optics.

The maps are over overwhelming. The majority of the maps seem to have been designed without cover. I guess cover is not a thing in the future... I cannot possibly identify or count the angles I am open to being shot from and so I feel paralysed when trying to strategically push an objective. You are either completely swarmed by a death ball of enemies trying to find the action in an otherwise barren landscape or you are wishing you could call in a quad bike as you run a half marathon from your spawn point. There's no feeling of accomplishment as your team successfully pushes or defends a critical flag. It's just a red zerg and blue zerg moving around the map like a tornado made out of players.

The minimap is overwhelming. There is so much information being crammed into such a tiny minimap that I don't know where to begin. With more players and more vehicles than ever before, the icons blend and merge into themselves. Every game prior has had the option to scale the minimap up and out of all the games that need this feature the most... this option is mysteriously absent. Pressing 'M' to bring up the overview map, can you quickly identify where you are and the direction you are facing using this feature? Or do you have to sift and scan through to find your tiny player triangle amongst a sea of other triangles and icons.

The gunplay is overwhelming. Jesus christ I think this one makes me question my sanity the most. It feels like since the beta, everything has been given enough recoil and spread that hitting the broad side of a barn outside of 20m is just a pipe dream. Every fight is left up to unstable net code and random bullet deviation and I'm lucky if I can kill one person with a full magazine. As much as I don't like the implementation of spread, if it has to be in the game, look at how well it was done in BF1, you can still be incredibly accurate tap firing targets at longer distances. Across the BF titles, I am a 2.0 + k/d player. On this title, I am struggling just to go positive.

The level of level of polish and fidelity makes this feel like it's a pre-alpha build with another year to go before release. Everything feels like it's placeholder, but they ran out of time and had to ship whatever was there. I cannot believe the game has launched in the state that it is in currently. Collapse",0,9,10

in between the game crashes, server errors, and gameplay bugs and glitches, i managed to get a few rounds in to get a feel for it.

I don't know. to me, it doesn't feel like a battlefield should AT ALL. Nothing about it feels right.

First off (and this is a major pet peeve) there's no campaign.

You bring IRISH back, a major character in the series, as a ""specialist"" and that's it? lame.

BF has CLASSES, not specialists....This isn't COD.

Where's all the shouting and talking amongst the players characters when they're getting shot or spotting an enemy?

Where is the voice chat? i wanna talk to my squad!

Why can't I chat to the enemy team?

WHY IS THERE NO SCOREBOARD? if you're so worried about feelings being hurt, offer some commendation system at the end of each round.

Don't even get me started on the customisation menu. like what is even that?

my weapons don't even unlock 9 times out of 10 I have to physically exit the game and sign back in for them to appear... and even then.. there is so few weapons to choose from. I've kinda just stuck with one kit the whole time because none of the unlocks jump out at me as being worth it.

There's nothing in your store, shouldn't that have been made ready prior to launch?

The list goes on and on........

DICE you should have looked at bf4, gone off everything that game has and just beefed it up and you would have had your self a perfect love child. what ever you think 2042 is.... it is not. All the promises you made and have fallen through with, your director should have run for president.

In summary: All I can say is, I'm grateful for EA play PRO at this point. I spent $20 and 30+ hours of game time to give it a red hot go, but It saved me wasting $150 on an ultimate edition that would have given me instant buyers remorse and ULTIMATELY refunded :(

I refunded mine today, and it will probably be the last game I ever preordered.

The problem is that it is currently untapped and unusable.

Specialists too strong compared to others.

Too many areas where we are uncovered
No vocals ... But are they serious?
An FPS game without vocals? What's wrong with you DICE / EA?

The project for me will deserve testing for another 6 months.

And read worse in all that, they are the lags, the backrolls, the most deplorable optimization with passages of FPS from 70-80 to 10-15 fps when there are too many people in the zone, that is to say in the phases most interesting and crucial (GTX 1650 Super ASUS Strix).

This game is a mockery of the Battlefield franchise. An usurper, a corpse-puppet controlled by developpers trying to revive its glory days while simultaniously having NO IDEA what made the franchise that great in the first place. You can tell this is the result of a piss poor new management at Dice/EA, arrival of new Devs that have absolutely no clue what they're getting into and want to rebrand the franchise into some half assed garbage that no one asked for. I feel sorry for the 2000s Dice devs that are witnessing this.

A TON of great features that have been part of this series for so long: gone.
Terrible design for all of the new original 2042 maps, unnecessarely large, flat, no cover and empty battles. They look nothing like an actual battlefield, there's zero warfare/conflict look to them. it's all designed to be some kind of ultra realistic Valorant/Overwatch with some hints of Cyberpunk 2077 instead of god damn Battlefield, add to that the MAPS are absolute garbage even on their own and yeah. Complete failure. There's no destruction, you know, the one thing that Battlefield has been know to be excelling at for more than a decade at this point?
The performances are absolutely horrible despite my computer being a monster, Portal is limited, lacks content, and overhaul very disappointing, animations are clunky and feel unfinished. The whole ""boots on the ground"" feel has disappeared, say hello to cringy quirky specialists instead of the class system that has forged Battlefield since its creation. Say goodbye to teamwork, good sound design, decent variety of weapons (22 at launch, really?) The UI design is the worst I've ever seen in a post 2010 game, THERE IS NO S C O R E B O A R D, NO STATS PAGES, NO SERVER BROWSER, NO CLASS SYSTEM, NO FACTION, YOU CAN'T KNOW HOW WELL YOU ARE DOING COMPARED TO OTHERS AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE SQUAD? HELLO?! What kind of sick joke this is? Keep in mind that this is only a SMALL FRACTION of what's missing in this abortion. The end of round screen is a complete joke, filled with ""comical voicelines"" and animations that make you want to rip your ears off and pierce your eyes from awkwardness. It's insane how infuriatingly bad this game is, especially after Battlefield V which despite not being a great game is absolutely better than this one, which says a lot. What has Dice gone into? What sort of quality degratation abyss have they fallen in? Have they signed some sort of contract to make the most anger induincg """"""battlefield"""""""" experience possible? This entire mess of a game looks and feels like it was released a year too early. A 3 years wait, endless talk about a bunch of studio working their asses off, about being supposedly ""ahead of schedule"", only for this joke of a result? The game is a buggy disaster, the hit registration is an absolute shore and I have counted dozens of situations where my bullets did not hit a thing. Even if the game had a proper developpement time, its foundation is already broken by their stupid ""creative choices"" such as their so called ""specialist"" that were obviously only created to appeal to Call Of Duty/BR fans, to try to ""modernise"" the franchise into something completely deplorable and cringy. I wouldn't even be surprised if this game was originally meant to be a BR judging by how coincidentally similar some design choices are here to these type of games. It also seems like Portal was specifically made for people not fan of BR.
Speaking of Portal, apparently it took only a year to make?? Yeah I can f*****g tell with how janky it is, and how inferior the sound design of each recycled weapons of this gamemode is compared to masterpieces like BATTLEFIELD 3 or Bad Company 2. How the hell did a concept such as Portal take a year to make in a 3 YEARS of developpement game, when THIS gamemode is what has most of the content. Something tells me this was a last ditch effort to appeal to ""oldschool fans"" because you were too scared of people not liking the garbage new ideas you had for All Out War or other boring crap like Hazard Zone that everyone casted aside on Day 1, which you were right about. Well that effort did not pay off in the end since even Portal becomes quickly boring thanks to the limitation you implemented to the rules editor and feel like a downgrade to the games it's referencing. Even in an unverse where Portal is good, it's FAR from the content of a full game.
Nothing is cohesive, the games feels weak and unprepared, nothing feels polished, I've never felt bored this quickly by a Battlefield game, it was hollow and lifeless.
Thank you EA, and thank you Dice for proving how plugged your ears are concering what the community enjoys and wants. You miserably failed on the one game that was supposed to bring back Battlefield into the spotlight.

37,Battlefield 2042,keksivaras,"Nov 14, 2021","Honestly, I feel a little bit bad for all the negative feedback. But you can't blame the fan base for it. Game is missing so much, even simple things like global/voice chat, scoreboard, promised next gen destruction and so on. Portal is a huge plus, because you let the fans to make new gamemodes and fix things like too much armor/too little damage or too fast/slow movement.
The AI was also good addition to the game. But the hit registration is bad, the bullet spread is hilarious and the action is always at one area. Either on top of a hill, ship or a building.
I have always like BF series, because of it's 'realism' and large scale fight compared to other titles, but it's slowly turning into COD. Everything else is in place, just the stupid skins missing. BF1 and BFV surprised me and I have enjoyed playing BFV for years now, Firestorm being one of my main gamemode and I even bought the V on all platforms, but was let down after cutting support short for this mess. Collapse",4,7,8
38,Battlefield 2042,SwiftyDigitz,"Nov 14, 2021","First off let me preface this review with I'm a HUGE BF fan and have been playing them pretty steadily since BC2. TLDR This game is a disappointment in its current state and is extremely lackluster and you should NOT purchase it until DICE/EA follow through with their promise. More in-depth with what I didn't like below. Bottom line DO NOT BUY UNLESS THERE'S A SALE OR SOMETHING it's a $40 game at best in its current state

Overall- Overall the game is buggy and severely lacking in the content department (I think there's something like 22 guns total in the game!?) on top of that there's barely any unlocks for vehicle upgrades weapon attachments that sort of thing and you already know it's just so they can sell it to you in some battle pass or something because I mean come on its EA. On top of the extremely lackluster amount of content is also the issue of the bugs revive bugs and other performance issues plague the game and while its pretty typical for a battlefield game to have these issues at launch the game is significantly better performance-wise at launch than BF3 or BF4 was, that being said this game also got delayed a month so they could ""deliver us a finished product"" only for the month delay in release to pass just for them to give us this steaming pile of garbage.

Multiplayer- in addition to what I mentioned above about the lack of weapons/ content and the performance issues the removal of the class systems (which is a core part of BF) the game feels really wonky and just not right or fun, that being said I do like the specialist and I don't think they need to be removed but they definitely need to tie the specialist and the respective weapon types to their classes like in old battlefield because it just makes sense for both balancing purposes and streamlining the game. The lack of the class system feels even worse as well due to the lack of content but long gone are the days of grinding for cool things like the mortar emplacement for the support class like in BF3 which honestly feels really bad because it was something to look forward to and also something that really gave that class an identity. The bottom line is no classes feel really bad and there's an easy fix DICE/EA just needs to listen to fans for a change.

Hazard Zone- Oh boy where to start with this one. Okay, so first glances and first playthroughs it's really fun but at the end of the day, it plays it way too safe and doesn't really have any replayability. You basically spawn in and extract drives for dark market currency to then better loadout for the next round? it's a fun game mode for sure but at the end of the day, it doesn't have anything to keep people returning. They really need to add some like really bad-ass Hazard Zone exclusive cosmetics or something that can be purchased with dark market currency to keep people playing it because as of right now Hazard Zone inst going to make it past the release and it's going to die out pretty quickly (along with the rest of the game if they don't pull it together).

Battlefield Portal - This is probably the only saving grace of this game because you can essentially go in with the tools they've given you and make the game not suck.

Final Thoughts- Overall I'm really disappointed with the game and genuinely shocked by how bad this game is and how a AAA studio could put out a product like this but then again it is EA and they put out games like Anthem and Battlefront 2 so, as a hardcore BF3 and BF4 guy I really thought this was our chance at something great, and not to my surprise DICE/EA fail to deliver once again. ive requested a refund because I'm tired of paying $60+ for half-finished AAA titles.

43,Battlefield 2042,chepscheps,"Nov 15, 2021","What's wrong with Battlefield 2042?
Why are people who have followed this game for 15+ years (Battlefield 2) so disappointed?

Everything that gave BF it's niche in the 'Online FPS Gaming Arena', starting nearly 2 decades ago by a Swedish development studio named DICE, has been neutered and/or completely removed from the game:

1) Squad Creation and Squad Interaction neutered
- Starting in BF2, you would be able to create/join/leave/lock/rename and voice-comm with your in-game squad.
> This was revolutionary as you only needed a mic and some gamers to coordinate what you wanted to do on the gigantic BF maps
> BF2042 removed the ability to create/leave/lock/join/voice-comm with your own private squads. How have we regressed 15 years later?

2)Skill expression from air vehicles (Jets/Choppers) by way of a complex Air Physics system
> The Air Physics in BF2042 have been dumbed down -- speed control, precision aim, tactical maneuvers...all removed in favor of a hand-guided/rail system which raises the skill floor and drops the skill ceiling
> Think of it like this: whose line is it anyway's greatest quote, ""where everything's made up (air physics) and the points (speed control, precision, skill expression) doesnt matter

3) No scoreboards in BF2042
- Cmon? Really? Do I even need to say anything?

4) Map/Lobby disbands in the 'AOW' (default, All out warfare/conquest) game mode
- Again, self explanatory. Really? We have to go back to the title screen upon map change?

5) No allchat on PC? You can't even OPT IN (defaulted OPT OUT, for example)??
- Really? When an amazing 'ONLY IN BATTLEFIELD' moment happens (I.E. sniping a player driving a transport vehicle, who then runs over the sniper after he dies) can't even be talked about across teams anymore?
> Who made this decision?

6) VEHICLE Customization COMPLETELY neutered
- How do we go from
> deep customization trees, like in BF5 (google it),
> 'relatively-robust' customization options in BF4
>> (I.E. BF4 Jet weapon loadout customizations: Heatseekers, Passive/Active Radar missiles, Hydra rocket pods, Laser Guided Missiles, TV Guided Missiles,JDAMs)
> BF2042 LITERALLY handful of choices
>> (I.E. BF2042 Jet weapon loadout customizations: Heat Seekers, Air to Air. and Air to ground?)

7) Commander mode removed
- In BF2 you could work together with your squad in order to help takeover the Battlefield. Your commander could generate UAVs, Artillery Strikes, and send Supply crates/Vehicle drops for the ace squadrons
> In BF2042, commander mode is REMOVED, and you can 'drop your own' vehicles. Nice. Really feels like a team here

8)Server browsers removed from AoW (default, All out Warfare) mode
- Again, Really? We regressed to online matchmaking?

9) Destruction in the next gen feels like xbox 360 levels of basic
- Enough said

I could go on, but it really makes one wonder how a company, who has literally 15 years worth of successful titles, was able to put a game in the oven for ~4 years of development and fail this hard to maintain the formula.

The worst part about this entire process was the ~6ish months of marketing after the reveal at 'EA Play' in the summer of 2021: 'This is a BATTLEFIELD FOR THE FANS' they said

Imagine.

A 'Battlefield for the fans', that strays so far from Battlefield, that without the name slapped across the title, you wouldn't even know it was created by a game studio with the prestige of DICE.

Honestly, a disgrace. And no, the consumer is not responsible for the feelings of the people who produced the game. This is not how it works at restaurants when you are served bad food, nor how it works when Game of Thrones' final season is an abomination, nor how it works in any facet of life.

54,Battlefield 2042,LPKirby,"Nov 16, 2021","This is sad. Look at the discrepancy between the ""critics"" and the actual player base. Its like they critics are paid to give a decent review or they are scared to be honest because the devs will cut them from future business partnerships.

This review has absolutely nothing to do with the plethora of bugs and server issues this game has. Bugs are easily fixed. Gameplay can be balanced. These things can be fixed over time. I don't even mind the bugs its whatever. The lack of content ok but it can be added. Scoreboard easy fix. Although disappointing all of these problems can be fixed. What can't be fixed is the game itself.

This is what really pisses me off. It feels like corporate tried to push a game like apex or warzone or some other popular game. it has the feel of this other game that slips my mind but I'm sure lots of other feel the same way. The vibe is completely disconnected from previous battlefield titles.

This game has completely lost all of its grit the one thing in my opinion that made battlefield so awesome. Without this grit its not exciting at all the other games it tries to mimic are just better.

Audio - I have no idea what is going on with the audio, all of it. The music does not give you a sense of urgency like near the ends of the matches in BF1.

Specialists - Again nobody asked for or wanted this junk. They all look like snowflakes. Not somebody you'd find in a warzone you can't sell that. The quips that these specialist say made me turn that audio off it kills the vibe. The most cringe I've ever heard. Its like some progressive liberal genz's got hired by EA and were in charge of character design.

Graphics / textures - This is the last nail in the coffin for me. Absolutely horrendous. Complete lack of detail. The game feels like a shell. In fact I think this is what gives the game a vibe that's not battlefield it looks nothing like the other games intricate level of details. The feel is completely off. Yes maybe previous titles look more dated but they had textures years ahead of this game. Battlefield 1 and 5 look so cinematic and I played those on my PS4 not a $4000 dollar gaming computer on 2k monitors. Inexcusable. Something else that felt off was the sizing of the guns or something. I don't know how to describe it. It looks almost comical the bullets hanging off my LMG are huge. Plus the weapon design is awful they look like planetside guns. Finally, again with the character design the look like cartoon players I don't get it. The uniforms the intricate details realism thrown out the window. This is really what BF was loved for.

Map Design - Not really a big deal if the graphics/textures were like the OG games. HOWEVER, hourglass needs to be removed lol no more words needed.

HUD/menus - Awful design but can be reworked.

Attachments - Reticles look like crap

Vehicles - The hovercraft needs to be removed easily the stupidest vehicle in the game and they have that stupid tuk-tuk in kaleidoscope which makes me feel like I'm playing fortnite again. The jet design completely I loved flying jets in earlier battlefield games because the cockpit looked awesome. I understand F35's have a screen instead of analog controls but my god the representation of this is awful. The driving/flying mechanics feel off as well.
Destruction - They neutered destruction BAD move. Destruction was so much fun in other games especially blowing craters in the ground for cover in BF1.

There's so much more to be said but I'm approaching the wordcount so you get the idea.

Final remarks EA robbed early access players plain and simple. There should be refunds or a class action lawsuit. This game is an empty shell.

I'm curious if they added portal after finishing the main game because they knew how trash the game was. Or maybe its corporate trying to push a different game while giving incentive to keep its loyal fanbase interested. Collapse",0,7,8
55,Battlefield 2042,Provenmental,"Nov 17, 2021","After Battlefield V, my expectations were not high to begin with but Battlefield 2042 managed to disappoint even more than I had anticipated. I have been a fan of the series since Battlefield 1942 but whatever this is, it is not Battlefield.

There are no classes, they have been removed in order to make ""specialists"" for monetization purposes. For those who have been around for a while, it is not news that the suits at EA have for a long while craved for the success that Activision has had with CoD and now Warzone and want to ape it in order to make a quick buck.

The specialists also ruin any resemblance of team play that the older games had. Even 1942 had the ability to heal your buddies and it has been a core part of the series. Now you have no idea who can heal you and who can not and because there is not a proper medic class anymore, it seems that the ones who could revive or heal you are nowhere and you will never get revived in this game. The same goes for ammo.

The gadgets are very unintuitive and apparently so poorly balanced that some of the specialists or their gadgets are disabled, making them either literally or practically unusable. I am having trouble using the gadgets because there do not seem to be any tutorials or intuitive ways that the game lets you know how you are supposed to use them.

There are very few guns and the progression is extremely confusing. There are no scoreboards or stats in game so it is hard to know what you get to unlock and when, or what you have already unlocked. The menus altogether seem to be missing things like server browser and character or loadout customization, at least ones that would actually work.

There is no single-player either. Not that it has ever been a strong suit for the series, but still. The destruction is also very limited, especially when compared to Battlefield 1. I have not had the performance issues that many here seem to report, but I do find the game graphically unimpressive, especially compared to the history of the series being so magnificent to look at. However, there are plenty of bugs and issues. For example, I was not able to switch to my sidearm at all in one match, even if I died. It only started working in another match.

Luckily, I didn't spend money on this because I got the 10 hour free trial via Game Pass on PC. If you have the opportunity to try it, please do and see for yourself how bad it is. If you can't test it for free, do yourself a favor and skip this for good or at least only buy it if you can get it for 10€/$. We need to show those suits that this is not acceptable and the only thing they listen to is money. If they had listened to what people actually wanted, we would have a good game in our hands.

60,Battlefield 2042,Mrgray208,"Nov 13, 2021","As a long time fan of battlefield games, I have to say this feels more like an APEX legends or other Hero Shooter than it does BF3. Some of the design choices are painfully obvious influences of more recent games and it really feels like people who made those choices (I assume higher-ups) didn't understand what makes the BF franchise not just another good looking shooter. I could list a number of these design choices but others have said it more thoroughly than I could ever.

I hope I can change this review if the Devs listen to the community and set aside their pride. Coming to terms with the sunk-cost of designing a bunch of systems no one asked for is going to be the big hurdle to being flexible and making this into a Battlefield game but I really hope they strip down a lot of the ""innovation"" and focus on just putting content in. 20 guns at launch is a joke and 4 maps (which are WAY too big) isn't a good consolation prize...Anyone who's played an earlier BF can feel this is just off. The engine looks great as always but the design of things if awful as it stands.

It somehow looks worse than BF1 which came out in 2016 yet perfomance wise on pc, it's awful. The sound design is poor. Explosions sound good, but that's it. Weapons don't feel ""punchy"" Like in previous titles.

Played Hazard zone once and died within the first minute to a team that spawned up a hill with snipers. Poorly designed and the fact it was loosely compared to Escape from Tarkov is laughable.

-| Really bad map design, you mostly spawn to instantly die

-| Already flooded with cheaters

-| A damn Hovercraft is stronger than a damn ""jeep"", ye RUBBER is very strong material guys....

-| Rubberbanding is normal in this game

-| Vehicle physics are pretty much on a prototype level at max.

-| You cannot revive most of your mates, because they will drop their weapon & weapon pickup interaction overlaps the revive interaction, so you can watch your mate dying while he can watch you swapping weapons like crazy instead of helping him

-| No scoreboard, they want everyone to feel good -> But this makes just everyone feel like an idiot who has to be hidden everywhere possible

-| German translation is cringe, you have to ""reject"" all information windows instead of confirm them or something. But even more cringe is the wrong gendering in the translation & the gendering in general

-| They did not listened the last 10 years at least

-| People will buy this crap anyway, which is sad and destroys how the videogame industry works

-| Again -> Cheaters on mass

-| And again, Cheaters on mass already in early access versions

The UI is absolutely atrocious and doesn't build on any UI customization from the previous games, from the awful tiny minimap to flag markers not disappearing while aiming and covering up enemies to the fact that the only way to identify enemies is by a color of a dot over their head, which leads to laughable situations where players run past their enemies thinking they're friends, and a remarkable amount of friendly fire. The gameplay is stiff and controls unresponsive, the gunplay is awful and the (admittedly, not all will agree) terrible weapon accuracy/bloom system is so much worse than in any game before. Graphically impressive, but ruined by vaseline TAA you can't turn off, and terrible framerate on a 9900k + 3080ti.

Increase in player counts is a great idea in theory, but ruined by both the developers (completely unfitting map design) and the players themselves (the match turns into two blobs of 64 players running between capture points, with the only gunfights really happening when they meet or when helicopters come into play). Adding AI to multiplayer matches is an absolutely baffling idea, and the half-braindead artificial teammates make each match look even more like a bunch of headless chickens running around an open field. Map design, while absolutely gorgeous to look at, is atrocious for gameplay, with huge open areas where infantry is practically useless, while snipers and vehicles have a field day. Portal as it is is woefully lacking in content (much like the rest of the game), and the server browser won't even tell you the rules of any of the bazillion servers beyond tags like ""custom points"" or ""changed movement"". Protagonist specialists don't shut up, other specialists scream from both sides of the trenches in all kinds of languages throwing me off.

Luckily for me I was able to refund my copy, of the game and I'll just be sticking to BFV and BF4. Which I recommend to anyone looking for a traditional battlefield experience.

12,Battlefield 2042,Molotov94,"Nov 16, 2021","I will just describe a typical breakthrough BF2042 game :

You spawn on the map.
You start moving towards the ennemy point.
First you have to understand how the new deplacement mechanic works. It is called ""the rollback movement"". Your soldier will frequently be teleported due to servers. Not a great add imo.

Then, after 3 minutes of walk in the infinite landscape, you will get ran over by a hovercraft.
You spawn again, you go back to the place you died before and manage to dodge the same overcraft.
""Hehe not two times buddy"".
You will immediatly get ran over by a second overcraft (the ennemy teams has 5 of them, not including Humvees and others vehicules ofc).

After getting killed 2 more times by a chopper, and a gunner in a humvee you manage to see your first ennemy.
You start aiming and realize it is really hard with 49 fps to shoot someone at this range. ""Holy **** my gun has horrible recoil, i hope it will get better with attachm..."".
An ennemy sniper kills you before you finished your sentence.
Go to settings ==> Put all graphics to low ==> 58 FPS.
Nice.

""F*** my squadmates are terrible, they are again so far away from the front that i cant spawn on them"".
You try to join an other squad hoping it will have better players.
You cant select your squad.

Few minutes of walk later (and an other death by the ennemy chopper) you see an ennemy not too far away.
With your 55 FPS and the usual rollbacks you manage to control your insane recoil and kills the ennemy using 28 of the 31 bullets of your mag.
""MY FIRST KILL LETS GOOO""
Here comes a second ennemy on your map.
You reload and wait for him. He didnt see you, it is an easy kills.
You shoot him the same way with you did few seconds ago but HE IS NOT DYING WTF ??
You have to swap to your handgun to finish him, but due to lags server you have to push your button 3 times so your soldier can actually swap his weapon. During this time the ennemy starts shooting you back.
TRADE KILL.
""F*** what happened ??"". You realize the game has the worst gunplay mechanic a shooter can have : bloom. You can shoot the exact same way two times in a row it will never have the same result because the bullets are not going where you are aiming at. Nice.

Few moments later, you die again trying to shoot a guy who is in your sight and you realize that bloom and rollbacks and insane recoil and long ttk are not the only problem in the gunplay.
You shoot someone.
You see him bleeding
You see his character react to your bullets.
But there is NO hitmarkers.
You understands the hit registration problem is still there. Just a superior version of what we had in BF4.
An hovercraft crushes you.

""Ok time to calm this kids , lets pick Engineer"".
There is no class system anymore.
""Ok time to pick the rocket launcher for my medic hehe"".
You shoot the hovercraft with your rocket. And die.
""How much damage did i inflict on him ?"". Impossible to know.
""Hey at least i damaged it right ? right ?"". No because all vehicules including chopper and tanks have self repairs. No need to have an Engineer to repair you, you just have to wait.
""What is happening i cant spawn ?? My character doesnt want to die, cmon ..."". You will find that this glitch is among hundreds of others glitches in the game.

""Ok, il will restart my game"".
The game crashes in the menu.
**** it"".
I could add, - the 14 points to capture in Conquest mode which will force you to drive 3 minutes to find an ennemy - the UI that hides the ennemy - the absence of scoreboard - the absence of indicators so you cant know if there is a medic nearby when you die - the impossibility to select the spawn of your choice when your teamates are stacked on a point - the AR that are terrible - The insane travel time of every weapon - etc etc Just dont buy this game.

15,Battlefield 2042,morzahofyo,"Nov 16, 2021","Possibly the lowest point in the series. It is a major step back in destruction, ballistics, progression, customization, and gameplay mechanics. It had legs, but for some reason they cut them off at the knees. Large maps, high player count, and vehicle call ins are welcome additions. But those features do not carry a game that is fundamentally flawed. The lack of a server browser and hardcore mode are just the start. Add in the lack of weapon options (probably to sell you more later), redundant attachments that masquerade as progression unlocks, atrocious random bullet deviation, and discontinuation of the class system (the heart of the battlefield franchise). Portal mode is neat, but suffers many of the foundational mechanical issues as the base game. Additionally portal does not contain a complete catalog of assets from the games it represents, and the destruction is downgraded from the original to the reduced destruction of 2042.

Hazard zone was supposed to be a shining light in this game. Its not. The gameplay is anemic, repetitive, and matches end quickly. The stakes are low, as well as the excitement. It honestly feels like the game was originally just going to be Hazard Zone and Portal, but at the last minute tried to make something analogous to a battlefield game. I do not recommend buying this game. It feels like it needs another couple years of development and a major overhaul.

This review just covered the gameplay deficiencies. Keep in mind the bugs and server issues make it almost unplayable in the current state. It is reminiscent of fallout 72.

The decline of the gaming industry is just a regularity at this point.Seemingly nothing can break the current trend of a never ending downward spiral of mediocre, broken releases, fake and scripted trailers, aggressive marketing to promote hype and missing content... Where do i even start with this one????
Game was evident to disappoint even with the scarce footage, media information and abysmal beta test, but somehow it managed to surpass it. Pretty pointless to list what has been said already, but I could possibly add some lines....
- Game has abysmal physics, pretty much all the vehicles are unusable. Planes dont take damage when you ram them into buildings, some vehicles can scale entire skyscrapers 90 degrees up and even fly in the air??? Tanks and buggies are glitchy and spazzing beyond control on rough terrain...
- The game introduced one of the most horrendous recoil mechanics i have seen in my 20 years of gaming. The guns seemingly just shoot the bullets in random directions around the targets and a attack on an unsuspecting enemy can take you between 1-3 clips of ammo.
- The legendary Frostbite net code makes a dazzling comeback - Enemies have the hitboxes/polygons of a building, yet almost no shots get registered as hits most of the times, even if you are next to the target or bombard enemies with thousands of bullets from a jet....
- There is no destruction, besides a few scripted walls and glass breaking. (not exaggerating)
- Weapons missing from full game, but available in Portal? Obvious cut content for future season pass.
- ""Part Disabled - 10 XP"" - no vehicle damage indicators. Weird damage balance like hovercraft taking 4-5 rockets to get destroyed? WTF?

The first day you couldn't even play 2042 online unless you did their half baked portal mode.
Getting in and out of vehicles is bugs all the time.
There's a bug that you cant use your weapons after getting out of a vehicle.
The only hero that is half interesting, the wingsuit chick, is bugged half the time and you cant steer, and when you can the gliding is really hard to control and feels bad.
Vehicles are super bouncy in a bad way. Driving a four wheeler and tapping a wall sends you into a spiral of 360s.
Hovercraft drives up walls.
You can spawn vehicles on top of buildings to make them unattackable
Most of the heroes are boring and cut and pasted from other games IE R6 Siege.
The 64v64 sounds cool but when playing the barren giant maps it feels like a half full bf4 server.
The maps are super uninspired and boring.
I've been killed by invisible enemies (bug from Battlefield 5)
Hazard Zone....lol.
Can't text chat with the enemy.
No voice chat.
Really disappointing amount of weapons in the game. Dice claimed there was over 70 but omitted that 50 of them are in the Portal game mode.
Weapon customization is boring and lackluster.
The specialist system almost sounds cool but it doesn't work well for a Battlefield game.
The microstuttering.
The running in place.
Changing mods on your + system is counter intuitive and confusing.
The bots look cooler than all of the specialists.
Bots laser beam you half the time.
Where is the damn scoreboard?

It really hurts to say this...

This is the worst Battlefield game I've ever played. Dice and EA continue to show that they do not care what the players want from their games. All we wanted was Battlefield 4.5, not this broken mess that takes like 5% from every other popular game and mashes it together in a way that doesn't work. I thought I would learn from getting burnt by Dice with Battlefield 5 but I wanted this game to be good.

49,Battlefield 2042,KiruskaLohushka,"Nov 15, 2021","1) Poor registration of hits, I didn't really understand how to shoot in this game, perhaps there is an element of randomness in the shooting.
2) There is no server list, you are forced to play on the maps on which you were thrown. In portal you can join an almost finished game, and in the main all-out warfare mode you sometimes wait for the server to fill up.
3) There is no table to view the kills / deaths / ping of other players, at best you can calculate your KD (you can see the kills / help / captures of the players of your squad, or the general statistics of another squad, i.e. competitiveness is removed).
4) I am glad that in all modes there is a store tab, otherwise I was afraid not to find it (just kidding).
5) Huge TTK, it is impossible to shoot two people, they overwhelm the mass.
6) Too long pumping, you need to kill 360 people in order to open all the modules for weapons, moreover, it became more difficult to kill people due to the large mode, earlier it was possible to fill in the superiority and clash of teams. The task for the skill skin (red-black skin) is unrealistic, you need to kill 1200 people with grenades or treat 2400 people with a Falki pistol.
7) Huge maps, you need to run 1 km to get to another point (in the next sector)
8) There is no pumping on the servers in the portal, the level is pumped only in the recommended section.
1) Плохая регистрация попаданий, не особо понял, как стрелять в этой игре, возможно в стрельбе присутствует элемент случайности.
2) Нет списка серверов, ты вынужден играть на картах, на которые тебя закинули. В portal можешь присоединиться к почти законченной игре, а в основном режиме all-out warfare иногда ждешь, когда заполнится сервер.
3) Нет таблицы чтобы посмотреть убийства/смерти/пинг других игроков, в лучшем случае можешь посчитать свое KD (можно посмотреть убийства/помощи/захваты игроков своего отряда, либо общую статистику другого отряда, т.е. убрана соревновательность).
4) Радует, что во всех режимах есть вкладка магазин, а то боялся не найти (шутка).
5) Огромный TTK, невозможно перестрелять двух человек, они перелавливают массой.
6) Слишком долгая прокачка, нужно убить 360 человек, чтобы отрыть все модули на оружие, притом убивать людей стало сложнее из-за большого режима, раньше можно было набить в превосходстве и схватке команд. Задание на скин мастерства (красно-черный скин) выполнить нереально, нужно убить 1200 человек с гранат или полечить 2400 человек с пистолета Фальки.
7) Огромные карты, нужно бежать 1 км, чтобы добраться до другой точки (в следующем секторе)
8) Отсутствует прокачка на серверах в portal, прокачивается уровень только в разделе рекомендуемое. Collapse",5,5,6

Some examples:

- it is practically impossible to play with more than 3 friends on a server together. It seems dice don't want teamplay platoons and clans anymore.
- no scoreboard
- no serverbrowser and no servers
- no persistent or rentable community servers
- no platoons
- no squadchange to your friends
- no teamswitch
- no all chat
- no spectator mode
- after every round u must rejoin a (server)
- lots of annoying screens & cutscenes
- broken and useless minimap
- big and soulless maps
- recoil broken and satanic hitreg
- no soldier class system
- no menu view to your stats
- very poor audio mixing like a tinpan
- footsteps are broken
- poor graphics like cardboard boxes
- broken chopper and jet physics
- performance on a good pc is weak!

Be aware that I only played less than 2 hours and I have already noticed all the things mentioned below...

- Ridiculous voice acting ingame + cringy voice lines at the end of the game. In French, some specialists voices feel like the voice actors were just reading their lines without thinking about the context (for example: Boris having no emotion when asking to be revived... Could you at least try to be suffering or begging ??);
- Muffled audio and very flat quality. Immersion is just about below ZERO;
- Uninteresting and empty maps, which are a pain for any player willing to play as infantry;
- Overpowered vehicles, you just don't stand any chance against them;
- Numerous bugs/glitches: DirectX errors, visual artefacts, 100% constant CPU use while very low GPU use, ...
- Questionable UI and very uncomprehensive;
- No scoreboard (like, really?);
- Lack of optimization: you can feel happy if you reach 100FPS with a high-end PC on low settings;
- Time to kill ridiculously high: you litteraly need a whole mag to kill a single soldier like... WHY?;
- Crazy bullet spread, unless being point blank, half of your bullets will land on the moon;

75,Battlefield 2042,IJustWorkHere,"Nov 17, 2021","Battlefield 2042 is hands down the the worst FPS I've ever played. I put 15 hours in (I'm stubborn to have lasted that long!) and have uninstalled.

I played and enjoyed Battlefield 1942, Bad Company, and BF IV. This is far and away the worst of the series so far. You're going to see some promoters of this game say ""you people will tear anything down; you'll complain about anything"". The problem is that it is very easy to complain about this deeply flawed game - there is very little it does right and I can't even think about anything it does better than any other FPS including earlier Battlefield games. Death by a thousand cuts.

My list of grievances go on and on. Even the opening cinematic is a eyebrow-raising tease depicting a ship on the ocean (there are no actual ships in game). In my case I have to run medium settings on a brand new 3060ti GPU just for it to perform adequately (even with latest NVIDIA drivers from Nov 16). The maps are so big that many players spend their time running from place to place - only to die and start again. Vehicles in the hands of a skilled operator are ridiculously overpowered and nearly immortal unless multiple people are working on taking them down simultaneously (tanks take a good 3 hits with rockets). There is absolutely no joy to be had in taking down helicopters - 10 points for damage and he's still fine despite being hit by a surface to air missile. It is nearly impossible to even hit a jet. Being a medic stinks because people will just intentionally bleed out since they have no idea if you are around them, another mechanic dropped from this game that is necessary for medics to be functional. Hit detection (with a very limited selection of guns that don't feel all that different from each other) is incredibly inaccurate, I've strafed many folks with guns from a tank only to not do any damage at all. I've basically given up on trying to engage people in 1:1 combat because it feels like a random number generator. If I have the jump on somebody and shoot them in the back at point blank range several times they manage to spin around and kill me at least a third of the time….it is absolutely outrageous. I am not alone here. I mostly play Casper and have spent over 10 hours spotting enemies and then watching my teammates engage them in firefights from above the battlefield. I've watched many dozens of times as my teammates come in behind the spotted enemy - with what should be an incredible advantage - only to then see my teammate fire at them, the enemy turns, they exchange gunfire for a few seconds, and then my teammate goes down for the count. This is not battle. This is a random number generator.

The only reason I'm even giving this game a rating of 1 out of 10 is because I sometimes feel like I'm contributing by playing Casper and helping my teammates to spot enemies with a drone but even there I believe the game is deeply flawed - the EMP dart requires you to get absurdly close to vehicles and then it doesn't work long enough/isn't effective enough for it to be worth using at all on tanks & ground vehicles. It is usually impossible to get close enough to helicopters to use the EMP dart because they are constantly zigging and zagging and are much faster than the drone - not that it would accomplish anything notable if you did hit them to begin with.

Speaking of working together - nobody works together because squads appear to be randomized without a way to exclude people or change squads. The specialists are annoying and do not translate well to a game where we have to see the same annoying characters over and over. Even faceless avatars with varying skins are more diverse than seeing the same characters spouting out the same lame taunt over and over at the end of each match. They've shoehorned in a bunch of different identities but still have failed to give us what really matters - variety. They call it Battlefield 2042 but all of this technology already exists except perhaps for the magical hacking ability the one specialist has. From a tech standpoint this is Battlefield 2024, not 2042.

Although you can see a scoreboard while the game is being played (to some degree) by pressing tab while the match is going, there is no fulfilling summary at the end and apparently no way to see how you did afterward. Having 128 players sounds like a blast in the end it is just too much chaos and even more unfulfilling because you can never have the sense you really made much of a difference with so many people playing. It is all just throwaway effort.

Battlefield 2042 is less a FPS game and more a ""frustration simulator"". If DICE's goal was to make a bad combat game in order to try and make young videogamers understand the pointlessness of war, I suppose I would say they have succeeded. Maybe making this wargame trash was their personal contribution toward world peace? Collapse",1,5,6

AAA Company for **** sake
Also how many development teams helped?

And only one thing SORT OF turned out okay?
Portal is the only sort of relevant thing. It BARELY has any content though.

This is the last company that needs your money. Some of the developers would rather sweep your criticism under the rug or just have it lost under the EA forums that they don’t even actively participate in.

The UI is horrible. It’s very unintuitive, it’s not user friendly and sometimes you can’t even tell what you enabled or disabled. Attachments are also locked behind 10 different clicks of the ugly UI

Gunplay feels wrong and sloppy
It gives no confidence when shooting
Sometimes it feels like RNG gunfighting

Very gimmicky outplayed ‘Hero’ system.
No one asked for this. DICE/EA are wanting to throw a lot on their audience while simultaneously taking away basic things from previous games. They do not deserve your money.

This is an executive driven cash grab merging all the current fads into one grotesque chimera of a game that feels like it has been outsourced to a Chinese mobile game developer.

Cons:
-10 Specialists for a 128 player game is ridiculous and has convinced me that the “No Pats” are just a clone army. Not to mention everyone being drawn to the few “Meta” specialists.
-No Classes (sure, ""classes"" are there but are meaningless)
-No Scoreboard.
-Very little destruction in comparison to previous titles (a staple of the franchise since Bad Company 2).
-No Server Browser.
-The ""back story"" seems like a rushed justification for kicking classes to the curb.
-No Spotting except for certain vehicle seats and Casper's drone which ends up lighting up the entire enemy team.
-Lack of weapons (4 or less in each weapon class).
-Sound design is awful
-Map design makes it feel less of a battle and more of a skirmish, despite map size and 128 players (see Battlefield 1 for atmosphere).
-Weapon recoil and slow time to kill makes it unsatisfying to play.

Pros:
-Vehicles feel powerful, albeit too numerous.

You'd think they would have learned from past errors like Fallout 76 and Cyberpunk 2077 and yet here I am, suggesting BF 2042 join these games on the list of dishonorable maggot-driven nightmares. They constantly get away with outright lying (false advertising), like promising that 2042 would have the most destruction of any BF only to have absolutely none whatsoever.

Beyond what seems to essentially be criminal corporate activity (again false advertising is illegal in most countries, so wth?), the usual modern industry norms plagues every aspect of this cheap cash grab: reinvent every single game mechanic around monetization. Class system which used to be a pillar of this franchise scrapped for operator **** making it impossible to tell friend from foe. Just this kills the game completely for me. Then this means there are no factions. No scoreboards. No guns. Maps are by far the worst of any shooter ever. Etc etc etc etc etc etc.

I won't waste more time typing, many other reviews here have everything in them already. Been playing BF passionately since BF 1942. Favorite entry is BFBC2. This is a travesty. I'll just finish on this:

Portal is fun for about 30 minutes until you realize there's no meaningful progression system and have access to all the guns from the start. Nothing to unlock. I was SO hyped to play BFBC2 remastered, was bored after 30 minutes because of this. It's so detached, it poops you into a game with everything unlocked, making every game identical and devoid of any goals or meaning. Portal is there just to appease the anger they knew would emerge from their money **** they call 2042. Get Xbox Game Pass, play the free trial that comes with it, then once you've agreed with me come and give a 0 on Metascore and use your life in a smarter way than on this corporate-bonuses driven dystopian brain-melting horse manure.

Game is nonfunctional at launch (sorry, I don’t care if the regular release is a week later when so many people had to pay $100 to play it early). 4 hours of my 10 hour trial were spent trying to get into a game. A few more were spent trying to find a Portal server that wasn’t an XP farm and then trying to host my own when DICE limited the number of Portal servers. When actually in a game, there are numerous game breaking bugs. I remember when our biggest launch day bug problems were giraffe necks...

2. Specialists are every bit as bad as people feared, and clearly are there for monetization. I hate the idea of heroes in anything even trying to resemble a military shooter (and believe me, every specialist but Irish looks stupid and out of place in a warzone) but the Marvelesque quips they give after apparently just finishing a BATTLE in a WAR are some of the cringiest aspects. Love that DICE also brought the same exact specialist quips to portal games too lol. There’s no tonal consistency between the setting of climate-change exacerbated global conflict that has collapsed entire nations and fun colorful characters flying around on wing suits and grappling hooks having the time of their lives. Very cool that DICE didn’t playtest their game and has had to temporarily disable a Specialist’s ability as it was apparently too broken.

3. Awful art direction. Okay, I’m a gun/vehicle/militaria nerd, I admit. But of the 22 weapons in 2042, how many really belong in a future setting? Many are already not in use in the 2020s, and slightly changing the name doesn’t change that. Of the guns and vehicles that do conceivably fit into a future setting, most have simply had ridiculous name changes (AK-24 that’s simply an AK-12, the Ka-52 being renamed Ka-520 lol). Special shout out to the ridiculous optics, which include a sniper scope with no BDC/ranging marks, the already discontinued Leupold HAMR, and an airsoft ACOG with the outdated chevron reticle. I remember when shooters used to hire military advisors lol.

4. Extreme lack of content. 22 weapons. 10 maps that are entirely empty for the most part. Less destruction. Only three gamemodes in actual 2042 (Breakthrough, Conquest, Hazard Zone). Clearly this is in place to drip feed us content under the live service model.

5. Portal is not the savior that was promised. It was the only thing that approached fun for me in the 10 hour trial, but really just represented worse versions of already beloved games. You’re only getting 2 maps per game and an incredibly limited pool of weapons. Funnily enough BC2 and BF3 even share weapons and vehicles, for instance the change of BF3’s US helicopters now just being the ones from BC2 (clearly saving time on recreating the actual assets from each game). I don’t know 1942 as well because I haven’t played it since grade school, but they even removed MCOM stations from Rush on Caspian Border and Valparaiso lol. Portal weapons and movement are considerably worse than the original games. And the editor (which is online and not usable from the actual game) is pretty limited, from vehicles/weapons being locked to their base game factions to not being able to separately enable/disable the minimap and the larger map for instance. There are even editor settings that are available for TDM/FFA but not Conquest/Rush for no apparent reason.

This can hardly be called a Battlefield game. It can’t be called a good game either. So much for the “love letter” to the fans DICE promised. Collapse",0,4,5

- Crouch sprint, jumping and pulling up on high walls, leaning etc

- Vehicle entering/leaving, changing places animation - on both land and air

- spirit of US vs THEM - we are all mercenaries, we all look the same, we fight for nothing. This was super prominent in BF1 or BF5 , where WAR as not a choice, and SIDE of war was also not a choice for a given soldier.

- fortification building / sand bags / mines / etc

- general lack of nice animations - melee, resurrection, granade throws, fence hopping

- special in-map kits (flamer)

- points / scoreboard - this one is big

- destruction is lowered - somewhat - you cant level buildings and all roofs are indestructible. without something like V1 rockets there is also no ooommth that can reshape battlefield

- initiative to play as a squad/team- classes/tools

- frontlines / bottlenecks / flanking maneuvers - its team deathmatch now with random spawns everywhere. Also thanks to AIR spawns and parachutes

- stealth gameplay / smoke / camouflage

- stationary weapons that can provide zoning and defenses

- assisting roles - medic/engineer/anti-tank - its all in one now - so you dont care about team as you can do everything alone or with two people. Also everything autoheals.

- no spotting xp

- no important points for dmging vehicles (10xp always) and no assists as drivers

- initiative to be a good leader for your squad (to earn points/for xp/for victory)

- suppresion

- no spawn camera

- foliage is not moving when you enter/leave

- scope zero-ing --==--

The base game itself (all out warfare) lacks content with only a handful of weapons and maps. Everyone plays selfishly. No one cares about playing the objective. 128 player modes was a bad idea, it is just a cluster F of people running like chickens with their head cutoff. This is just feels like an attempt to match what Call of Duty is doing.

Portal on the other hand has a lot of potential. It was actually fun playing BC2/BF3 games. People seemed to care about moving together and taking objectives. Portal does suffer from the poor performance of the game in general and has some strange gunplay issues.

well it looks sweet on ultra if you got one of those sweet new GPUS.ehm....and thats probably it
negatives
bad big empty maps destroying the great feel of old battlefields.dynamic of the game is in the toilet.
horrible netcode issues leading to idiotic hit reg,lag spikes and server issues.
horrendous audio issues with bad audio ques,echoes audio delays etc.its very distracting to play
terrific TTK for my taste.way to long for this kinda frenetic game.i wish there was hardcore.
one of the worst UI ive seen in a mp game. no joke.
terrible position of points to take on the highest vertical buidlings possible. which makes no sense to take.it takes way to long to go there.its better to leave them and go elsewhere to get xp.
vehicles way too op and no effective tools to destroy them.i play the grenade black woman and its a big hustle to get even a tank alone with all the toys.
and everybody knows it it runs like poopooo.i got a 3900x,32g ram and 6800xt and i get about 100 fps on fhd. cant even imagine guys with pascal cards or lower rtx cards.

Hit registration sometimes does not even work for SOLO play!

Loadouts get reset.

Flat boring maps.

Control remapping does not work.

Bullet spread does NOT follow gun aim during recoil, but rather it is random and comically extreme, with bullets going everywhere but where the gun is actually pointed. Note that this is not a player aiming skill issue, the issue is that bullets are randomly shot off in directions other than where the gun is actually pointing, irrespective of how good your aim is. Although it is true that some deviation is expected, even for perfect aim in real life shooting, the amount of deviation in BF2042 bullet spread is comically extreme. You've heard of gun accuracy being measured in MOA or sub-MOA? BF2042 gives you gun accuracy in the tens of degrees!!! It is unusably broken to the point where player aim doesn't even factor into the equation.

Lobby disbands after each match and goes back into searching for a lobby, so you don't get to play with the same people. Is this because EA cheaped out on server capacities and thus this gives everyone a fairer share of play vs waiting to play? As opposed to letting everyone play, with little waiting time, if they'd had enough servers with enough capacity?

Also, god help you if you don't get in a vehicle since you will be running forever only to miss the flag cap and then have to start running all over again. In addition, the game needs a bunch more polish, balancing, and overall tuning.

Honestly I think the biggest problem is EA's dogmatic insistence on sticking with the Frostbite engine which keeps the company from hiring quality people and studios to help them finish their games. If the company switched to Unreal then they'd easily be able to find experienced developers whenever they needed them. The only developers with Frostbite experience either work at EA or did at one point in the past.

UE4 is basically whipping it's ass with Frostbite in terms of overall graphics fidelity, FPS optimization, and stability.

No scoreboard has effected me more than I thought it would. I like knowing how I’m getting on in games. Performance issues are plaguing the game and the balancing is very poor. Vehicles are too strong especially the hovercraft. Attacking points on certain maps aren’t fun to run to. No cover at all.

78,Battlefield 2042,Schwarzyyy,"Nov 14, 2021","The only thing ""Battlefield"" about this game is its name and the fact that it launched unfinished, broken and riddled with bugs as it is tradition, although this one takes it to new and never before seen extremes. Unlike the predecessors this one however still would be the worst entry in the franchise had it launched perfectly finished and without bugs since this Battlefield is nothing but a soulless regression in nearly every way representing only a former shell of the franchise. This so called ""love letter to Battlefield fans"" comes with, in no particular order:
- the worst gunplay of any bf yet
- the worst graphics and visuals for its time yet
- the worst audio design and mixing yet
- least amount of actual content -> only 7 maps and 22 guns (hazard zone will be nothing but a meme in 2 weeks time and portal is a cheap last ditch effort to save this absolute disaster of a base game)
- worst map design yet
- worst weapon and vehicle balance yet
- worst UI yet
- worst performance yet
- worst settings customization yet
- most unfinished, bugged out and featureless BF yet
- ... and the list could keep going on without end, just see some more comprehensive ones on the games subreddit.
In conclusion this battlefield might be the first one that cant be saved by DICEs usual patch fixing frenzy in the first year after the launch. And even if DICE outdo themselves once again, the underlying game design choices are so out of touch with the core community, that nothing but a complete redesign of pretty much the whole game could save this franchise damaging kick in the teeth of battlefield fans. Unlike entries that launched rough before, like BF4 or BFV, where most die hard fans could at least see a genuinely good and fun game at the end of the dark, bug riddled tunnel, this one is the first Battlefield that is just categorially unfun, which hurts even the most die hard fans of this franchise.

With a bittersweet taste in my mouth I left the game in hope to one day return to the beloved franchise I've recently discovered. Waited 3 years and Much to my surprise the very last chance they had to keep their fans went down the drain...

Playing the beta, I did not feel that ""battlefield"" feeling with teamplay and the atmosphere that I felt with Battlefield 1 had. Even if I tried to like Battlefield V it also lacked the atmosphere, even if teamplay at least were there. I thought, maybe it's just in my head.
Head back to Bf 1 and I felt the Battlefield feeling from the first game when I started the game.
But then I thought I would give the full game chance.

Terrible hit detection, game breaking bugs, bad maps, awful UI, cringe-inducing operator quips, no campaign, no real progression/rewards, etc etc. It feels seriously hollow with barely anything to do, hence why there's going to be a season pass with awful and probably extremely overpriced microtransactions (thanks Fortnite). It's also pretty clear that they wanted this to be a battle royale entry too. Random operators, skins, obviously season pass, armor plates (these are criminally overpowered), absurdly large maps (Hourglass is run through the desert simulator), odd animations when you're downed, no scoreboard, no server browser, no map choosing, throwing you out of the lobby after every game, etc.

Weapons also have bloom which is the strangest thing I think they could have chosen for an FPS. For a game like Fortnite or any third person entry, that is somewhat understandable, but an FPS like Battlefield should not have RNG gunfights.

If you are considering buying this game, do not. It is soulless and hollow and I would imagine is going to be dead in about a month. The season pass is being added in 2022 and by then I don't think they'll be able to get the original player numbers back.

They removed stuff that was deemed great in previous installments, like the more realistic movement animations from BFV eg. wall vaulting, cover leaning, prone positions. An essential part of the entire identity of Battlefield called destruction (yeah, remember that?). Adding to this, the positional audio is completely cocked, the performance is less than ideal on a high-end system (5950X, 32GB, RTX 3080) and even all else aside, this game keeps crashing every single match I get to join if the servers are stable enough to let me connect.

EDIT 17th November: I have a hypothesis that this game is somehow coded in a manner that it's very sensitive to hardware instabilities, and I think that my ram was a contributing factor because the cpu couldn't keep up at 1:1 ratio as ryzen likes it. Reduced memory speed and no crashes since. Mind you this hasn't happened in other games.

99,Battlefield 2042,Jasmith,"Nov 14, 2021","An out of touch battlefield game by people who have never played one. This feels like a last second thrown together mess that misses many key features from past games. Features like the improved movement mechanics from battlefield V have since been downgraded or outright removed for no explanation and have been replaced with floaty fast arcady movements that are blatantly trying to rip off call of duty. Guns handle poorly and gunfights past 25m are next to impossible. Given that the maps are incredibly giant, flat, boring open spaces with no cover, expect many boring pointless gunfights with inaccurate weapons. Speaking of maps, maps are hugs empty arenas with next to no cover so vehicles can decimate you with little to no effort…. That’s if you can get ahold of a vehicle given that there’s 64 players per team and maybe 6 vehicles if you’re lucky. Destruction, a major component to what makes battlefield great, is next to nothing on the new maps. You can blow out walls here or there but that basically it. If you were looking for destruction like past battlefield games prepare to be disappointed. The only decent destruction comes from the classic maps in the new portal mode. There’s a new mode called hazard zone but it’s a soulless copy of other games that do it better and was clearly just created to salvage what was left of the br game they were clearly making this game to be. The only redeeming mode is portal, which gives players the tools to create their own battlefield experiences with assets from previous games. It genuinely is a fantastic mode that brings back so classic favorites. Overall I’m disappointed with this game, it’s lacking feature list that’s been improved upon up until this point has been scrapped for a more arcady monetize-able experience. DICE has a long way to go in bringing features back to make this feel like a battlefield game again, but until then I recommend passing and waiting a few months to see how they support the game.

1,Battlefield 2042,HeyImLea,"Nov 14, 2021","Im going to make this a review without going on about how DICE, its support studios and EA are the worst. I have nothing against the people who have spent massive amounts of hours to make this game, I just want to give my opinion on the game.
apologies if my sentences aren't perfect, English isn't my native language. :)

first off, I've been a fan of this franchise since I was 7 years old, I'm 23 now. I've like nearly every single release, except for maybe V (except for movement) and now most recently, 2042.

I've loved how the franchise that I love have moved forward and the movement being less and less static, gunplay being more responsive. learning vouzoiu and zouzou on bf4 was a fun challenge too.
anyway, my thoughts on 2042 (so far)

I spent a good amount of time in the beta, that was supposedly a few months old, and according to lots of fans in the community it was all going to be fixed for release. didn't work out great, huh?
the official release is on the 19th but EA and DICE are selling access to the game already. If you're willing to take my money (even more than standard price if youre not using EA Play) to play your product im going to judge it as if it was fully released.

Beta was broken, but I managed to put in around 10-15 hours even with the poor performance and almost drowning in bugs.

around comes ""early access"" that we're playing now, and credit where credit is due, many bugs have been fixed. elevators work, the sound is better, explosions looks a lot better, the UI isn't as ugly, but its just not enough.

* lets start with specialists, while it's a nice idea and something I actually would really like. I miss not being able to play as my gender in bf4 and only being able to play as a male for example. the problem for me is that it's not done right here, at all. I think that for most people BF have been about being a soldier among other soldiers, working together to overcome the enemy.

that's not the case in 2042, specialists are made out to almost be like superheroes and not needing anyone but themselves. They have too much character, they're good at everything and aren't restricted by class. I can be a medic Specialist with a healing pistol but also bring an RPG into the fight. there are no classes left.
by doing this, I cant tell who's going to be able to give me heals or ammo when running up to them, this was easy in the previous titles, I knew instantly who was a medic or support in BF3 for example, a game that was released in 2011.

* Teamwork.
I don't know what to say, it feels like DICE just wanted to rid BF of its identity. there's next to no teamwork here. reviving is clunky, I dont know who's a support or a medic because there are no classes, I don't know if anyone is coming to revive me, healing and helping your team doesnt give nearly enough xp, so you're not really motivated to risk your life to rush to the other side to heal your teammates.

*UI/UX/settings
where to begin? what happened here? the UI is surprisingly bad. how did we go from BF3/4/1/V, to this? I get F2P vibes when looking at it, doesnt feel finished at all. there's no indicator in the UI for what firemode I'm on, I cant resize my map, I cant change opacity of the objectives on the map, some settings do not work (crosshairs) and some are just missing (direct x12)

* Maps
We got 7 base game maps in total for release, who are all big and focus a lot on vehichles. not one map or mode for the people that enjoy infantry over large scale battles. disappointing.
I feel like the maps are okay, at best. they're too big imo, even for 128 players and there's not nearly enough spots to hide. you're always getting shot at. the flow isn't there.

* Performance
Shockingly poor across most, if not all platforms. Im on PC so that's what ill be focusing since I cant speak for my friends on the console side.
lowering the presets to low doesnt seem to do much, or anything at all. I dropped my settings from high, to everything low on 1080p on my mid-spec system, I messed around in the config file and gained around 15-20FPS total. going from 25FPS avg, to around 45-50avg. When its not chugging along at under 60, its stuttering, slowing down, or teleporting me back and forth. Other games doesnt teleport me, using fiber with 100/100 uncapped.

* Misc/QoL
Spread/bloom. - random bullet deviation.
Mouse Input not consistent
No server browser for main game
lobby disbands after every match
no squad management - cant join/create/leave/lock during games
no scoreboard
no all chat - let me choose if i want to see or hide the chat like in previous titles.
gun customization UI messy
Soundscape completely broken
UI/UX customization severely lacking
Spawns broken
Specialists - theyre not faction specific.
No Incentive for teamplay
lackling destruction

The fact that they've released the game in this state just boggles my mind, and what's more is that the dev's are doubling down that nothing is wrong or the changes they've made is better for the game is idiotic.

-No ability to pick your squad: staple for years and suddenly it's removed, why what does it enhance about the experience?

-No voice comm's: In a teamwork oriented game they removed the ability to talk to your teammates to coordinate. I had to type in chat to my tank driver that he had a hostile tank in front of him by the time I was able to finish we already had around into our vehicle.

No scoreboard: why would you want to be able to see how you're doing in relation to everyone else, that's only been a feature of every FPS forever.

Weapon bloom: I remember a reviewer once said that gunplay in an FPS is the central pillar of the game since that is how you interact with the media. DICE has completely dropped the ball on this, the spread is ridiculous and takes out any skill gap that should exist in the gunfights. Now getting into a fight with someone is just a random number generator.
--Weapon bloom 2.0: in portal mode there is a bug with Bad Company 2 that when exiting sprint it retains your hipfire spread when you ADS. The Dev's continue to stubbornly hold their ground saying this existed in OG Bad Company 2 despite numerous videos to the contrary.

-Portal server search: there is no way to filter out what game modes you want to play outside of a ""keyword"" search"" , not that it matters because the custom game modes are overrun with bot farms or heavily skewed rules that restrict one side to bolt actions only while the opposing teams to whatever they want. DICE needs to find a way to let players narrow down the framework of their search results based on various criteria.

-Portal Server part 2: There needs to be official servers for other game modes like TDM or Squad Deathmatch.

-General lack of features. The weapons released for this first person SHOOTER are very few. Only a couple maps when they had upwards of 20 to choose (copy) from Battlefield 3 alone. The game experience is very shallow and not worth the price of admission at this time.

That is just off the top of my head there is more when it comes to balance issues and the like and I'm sure others can articulate it better than me, but it boils down to this, skip this game for now. It is not worth your $60 (or up) in this current state.

No leaning

22 guns total lol

Plus system is clunky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥

UI is clunky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wrapped in cat ♥♥♥♥. Might be the least intuitive I've ever seen

No all chat

No server browser outside of Portal

No private/rented servers

Doesn't just roll into the next map after a game in AoW, back to matchmaking peasant

Cannot join friends already in a match (pretty sure I could do this in beta??)

No enemy footsteps

Enemies look the same as friendlies

Have to opt out of revive every death, no idea who can actually revive me anyway

Have to re-select spawn location every spawn

Poor hardware optimization

Cutscenes all over the place

Stupid ass 'look at me' after a match

Bullet spread / weapon inaccuracy outside of rock throwing range

Lack of game modes

No hardcore

Cannot join, create, or lock a squad

No military ranks associated with numerical ranks

No resizable minimap

Audio is poorly mixed

The maps, while stunning from both a scale and visuals perspective, lack any real flow for infantry combat. No separate Heli & Jet controls. Horizontal pitch (or yaw) when set to mouse movement is inverted by design and cannot be inverted again like vertical pitch can. So your aircraft goes the other way than your mouse does. Cannot customize loadouts before joining a game. Cannot select loadout or operator before joining a server which, in certain situations, spawn you directly into the game with whatever you had last game. This happens when joining a fresh breakthrough game, mostly. From what I can see, DLSS is not working properly or not making any difference Vehicle crosshairs are pixelated as ♥♥♥♥ UI elements do not have transparency element and distant 2D/3D map markers and UI elements do not fade out by distance and cannot be scaled up or down Obnoxious voice overs, operators are incredibly vocal, every time you do an action they say a line. Spotting system is contextual and misses a lot of the time. For example if you press Q over an enemy tank it doesn't always spot it, but places a go-to marker on that area. The team/squad order menu (or whatever it's called) is a pile of garbage. It covers the entire screen, it requires using the mouse to select the options, but not clicking on them for some reason, you have to depress Q. This needs to be redesigned into a friendlier and smaller semi-transparent wheel. Plus, it's not contextual at all and it doesn't seem to have an impact to other players, I requested ammo constantly and nobody even saw my request. Unnecessary changes to the aircraft flight characteristics from BF4 models On the spawn screen screen tanks/helis use the same icon, you simply cannot tell if that's a transport or attack heli that you are spawning into. When in tank, you don't have this little tank outline which tells you where the driver and gunner are looking at. No maps with water and thusly no boats.. despite there being a big ass boat on the loading screen. No stats page No commander No squad points for issuing orders or following them No HOTAS support No marksman headshot bonus for long range snipes Melee takedown animations have been gutted. All enemies are brought to a standing position before one specific kill is performed. Revive is glitched when downed teammate's head is too close to something. Cannot tell if there is room to enter a friendly vehicle without trying to get in it. Cannot dive underwater Damage dealt numbers, e.g. ""VEHICLE HIT 28"" after hitting a tank with a rocket, have been removed. This applies to both infantry and vehicles. Non-removable profanity filter Repairing vehicles does not give XP Faction locked weapons and gadgets in Portal No rule editor support for objective based game modes Grappling Hook is afraid of smoke Bullets are afraid of power lines Zoom issues with sniper scopes Inability to switch teams Vehicle entry and exit animations have been removed Weapons can't have different sets of attachments in different loadout presets. Meaning if you want to have a suppressor on the one semi-auto pistol in the game for one preset, you can't have it without a suppressor in your other presets. Lack of destruction/levelution ADS required to change weapon fire mode Cannot move while prone and ADS Crossplay issues on Xbox 'Assist Counts as Kill' has been removed No fixed heavy weapons No zeroing sniper scopes, starting scope (not sure about the others) has no hash marks on reticle for references AA rocket damage appears inconsistent BF5 movement mechanics removed This game is unfinished.

It tries so hard to be a flavour of the month game that it forgets to be a Battlefield game. We live in the days of the ""hero shooter"" so, of course, they try to be a hero shooter. Gone are the classes, everyone can be a medic, an assault, an engineer. You have a total of 22 guns to chose from in the actual game of BF 2042 (averaging at around ~3 per category). The operators are all different forgettable stereotypes that toss around cringy one-liners when you select them and after the game ends.

And this doesn't even touch on the technical state of the game. Right now, when you join a match there is a 50% chance that the enemy team won't spawn and your team is stuck in spawn. Or the map loads infinitely. Characters still glitch out of their vehicles (especially air vehicles). Sometimes you cant exit a vehicle you are in.

Many bugs for too much money. Even if the day-one patch fixes a few things, I can't imagine that the performance will be that better.

Thereby my GPU runs just with 40-60% (5700XT) and my CPU Xeon E3-1231 v3 works as bottleneck with 95-100% CPU utilization.

Also:
- Graphics worse then in BFV
- Maps way too big and steril, running is not worth in 99% of all situations
- Worse destruction then in BFV
- No Scorebord ?!
- No Squad change, creation etc. in-game; ALSO no Teamchange possible
- No server list

19,Battlefield 2042,izais,"Nov 15, 2021","Candid Analysis of a Battlefield Player from 1942:

Well, I would like to start the analysis taking into account the immense amount of expectation and hype that this game generated, in the first trailers the hope had been created that BF would return to its classic origin where it was most successful (set in modern warfare), with elements of the new graphics engines and new mechanics, it had everything to go right, well, if only the basics were done, maybe it could have been the best game in the series, but DICE did absolutely everything wrong (or almost everything), for every 1 right, 9 mistakes.

Starting with the main thing that completely escapes from what Battlefield is: System of classes that were TOTALLY removed from the game, ""oh but it's still there only called experts"", no, no, there's no class, you don't know who does what, no limitation, anyone can take a specialist, equip an ammo box and AFK on top of some high place with sniper and 12X scope, no medics in game, no support, no AT soldiers in short? Complete chaos, but not in the good sense, before when it was said that BF is a chaotic game, you imagined destruction (as it was in BF3/4/1/V), a lot of shooting and a vehicle falling, exploding, but in this one, it's a COMPLETE JOKE, the chaos here refers to DISASTER, I wonder, how is it POSSIBLE that in 10 years of evolution (BF3 to BF2042) many aspects have regressed so much? It was supposed to continue to evolve, not regress, destruction in the game simply doesn't exist, if before in BFV you took a tank, and went over everything destroying walls, fences and houses, in this game you have more chance to climb the wall of a house with the tank than destroying it has no destruction, and the destruction it has is freakish.
There are dozens of points I could mention here, scoreboard (there is no scoreboard), animations (which are not that bad, but are extremely buggy), movement (this is among the main points, the movement of the game is simply one of the biggest setbacks of the series that have ever existed), graphics and performance (if the horrible performance was explained by the surreal graphics, that's fine, but at various times the game seems to have PS2 graphics and even so the performance remains horrible, it's not uncommon for cases of people with high-end setup running the game at less than 80FPS), drivability of aerial vehicles (seriously, if you get to play, don't touch a jet/plane, it's horrible and you'll give up right away and probably ask for a refund) , as I was saying at the beginning, there are SEVERAL negative points, but I won't mention all of them or would I end up creating a book here, but BF2042 doesn't have positive points? of course there is, but it doesn't pay to buy a R$300 game just for hurricanes and the Portal game mode.

BF2042 deserves a 3/10 grade, I still think it's a generous grade, which should vary between 2/10 and 3/10, I don't recommend this game if you've been playing any titles before this one in the series, Battlefield 2042 is NOT Battlefield, it's a FAIL copy of Call of Duty Warzone. Collapse",2,4,5

29,Battlefield 2042,Knowbodie,"Nov 15, 2021","Battlefield since post BF1 has proven how disconnected they are with their fans/community, and BF2042 represents how disconnected they truly are. The major selling point to many of Battlefield titles previously was the use of teamwork & playing the uniquely crafted objective in order to defeat the opposing team. It seems that the franchise has done away with such a fun/enjoyable niche and substituted a cash-grabbing scheme just as every other AAA franchise has seemingly done.

Without mentioning the MOUNTAIN of performance issues the game comes with, these I feel are fundamentally wrong for a BF title and as a long-time BF fan, I was thoroughly disappointed in seeing:

-OPERATORS: The absolute worst thing to happen to this game; there is no distinguishing between friendlies and enemies for factions such as RU vs. US, or Team1 vs. Team2. Instead, in an attempt for players to buy new skins, players, and even gadgets included with the players, (potential pay-to-win scenario) DICE has made it so players can only select Operators/Heroes/Characters for both sides of the fight (They look the same for both sides) with unique gadgets previously held by 4 classes in past titles with their faction related skins. Other than the red indicator and other red chemlight/glowing features, there is no difference between the US & RU variant of the ""Espinoza"" Specialists.

NO MORE CLASSES: Additionally, any gadget can now be paired with any Specialist, paving the way for more potential problems with meta, unrealistic, and non-immersive gameplay that so many BF fans used to love. It shows that DICE is willing to sacrifice the core functionality of their games in order to make more money and develop a business model off of their franchise. I have personally never seen such a lack of team-based gameplay in a BF game throughout my 20+ years of playing. With a 30-second timer to be revived I find myself constantly bleeding out unnecessarily.

Overall, BF2042 has proven to not retain their core values/niche mechanics that the fans of the ongoing franchise seemed to love so much, and never asked to change. I genuinely hope pessimistically that this will be addressed and fixed, or I will no longer have hope in DICE which is heartbreaking. I hope that others that feel the same way voice their opinions en mass so that we can finally get an answer as to why something was fixed that was not broken in the first place. Collapse",2,4,5

A quick list of issues:

- Huge drop in frame rate from beta. Early Access BF2042 only uses ~60% of GPU and less cores of CPU than beta.

- Lag makes game unplayable. Even on wired Ethernet of ~23ms, rubberbanding happens every single match.

- No server browser for Dice servers. Cannot find best ping or desired maps. Can only select lowest ping of community maps, where XP doesn’t count due to bot farming lobbies being rampant.

- Gameplay feels less like Battlefield and more like CoD. Just grab the SMG (PP-29) that has no recoil and shoots across the map. Throw some tac sprint in for good measure.

- Hovercraft farms entire 2042 lobbies, climbs buildings, flies through the air and flips tanks. Hop in and rack up those points.

No easy way for large groups of friends to remain on the same server / game.
No Platoons / tags
No communication with the other team
Vehicle call in instead of capturing a point and taking control of a zone which would spawn a tank giving strategic advantage to specific flag.
Gun play is weak at best.
Maps are large but empty and poorly designed making it almost impossible to advance on foot
Sounds are base heavy and lack any treble, the sound of a rocket hitting a tank sound more like someone stamping on a wet sponge . (using steelseries arctis pro headset)
Graphics are odd / not good. Somehow they manage to be both soft and have hard outlines on objects. Seems somewhat cartoonish.
Performance is poor. DLSS somehow reduced fps for me and also resulted in an effect like a swarm of bees in the peripheral vision, had to turn it off. (RTX 3080 plus OC i7 8700K) 60 to 75 FPS aprox on Ultra.
Almost impossible to get a tank, heli etc with call in system. (they need to spawn on captured points!

Performance is terrible (i have a 5950x and a rtx 3080 paired with 64 gigs of ram) and was sticking around 40 -50 fps. Hazard zone is like the developers took all of the trending things about battle royale and shoved it into a game mode. There are only two game modes in the base game (what happened to grand operations?) breakthrough and conquest. I understand that there is portal and hazard zone, but even with those extra game modes the game feels empty. The UI is terrible, and the plus system where you can change attachments on your weapon on the ""fly"" feels like they thought it looked cool and shoved it in the game. Personally, i think its trash. Specialists, lack of weapon customization, empty and boring maps, graphics that look slightly worse than battlefield V, this game is a mess.

However playing the release, its terrible actually. The game feels like it is atleast a year away from being a good release. Everythign feels like it just stressed through, just like a cheap game. Its sad. Terrible performance also with a 9900k and a 3080. Dropping down closer to 50 fps on some maps making it completly unplayable. Often its around 70-90 fps which is also horrible but some might still be able to play fps with that low fps. This is with 1440p. Changing graphics down to medium didn't help either. Graphics and cpu is only around 50-70% which shows the game is hugely unoptimized.

78,Battlefield 2042,FireWalker,"Nov 16, 2021","I'm really disappointed by this game. I've bought every Battlefield game up until now, but this time they've completely missed the mark. This game has no identity. It feels like a mixture of several other games, and it just doesn't feel like a battlefield game at all. Why try to fix something that isn't broken? Sometimes it's better to stick with what works..
It seems like they've tried to reinvent the wheel when it comes to every aspect of this game.
There's not even a classic scoreboard in the game, so you can't see how you're doing compared to everyone else, which makes the game feel bland, boring, and not competitive at all.

They have also removed the traditional class system and instead gone for more of a ""hero shooter"" approach, with different characters that you can upgrade using microtransactions. The problem with this is that now almost every character looks the same, and it's extremely different to tell the enemy apart from friendlies.
They've also removed tons of other features that made battlefield unique as a franchise.

The end result is a game that just feels empty and without identity. The maps are too big and empty, and often times it feels more like a walking simulator now, despite the fact that there are now 128 players.
The graphics are not really much improved either. In some cases BF5 actually looks better, but yet the game is terribly optimized and runs poorly even on the RTX 3080 in some cases.

There's not even in-game chat anymore. You can't join the squad you want to join etc. Every server is now also filled with bots, which are not very satisfying to kill. Because you can't see the scoreboard you can't even see how many bots are actually on the server.
It's pretty clear that this game is not finished yet and should never have been released in this state.

Seriously, there's not even a scoreboard! A competitive shooter with no scoreboard....

What's even the point of playing when you can't compare your performance to everyone else? That competitive element is what makes playing games fun. Without such a basic feature it just feels pointless, more like a simulator, which quickly becomes boring, unfortunately.

If you're looking for that classic ""battlefield"" experience then you'll be disappointed. It's so bad that I actually canceled my purchase for the first time ever.

Now we get these operators that all have some silly special which I admit some are kind of cool while other almost feel like cheating.

Gunplay simply doesn't feel good, the only thing really worth using is the sniper, so that's fun for nobody.

On top of that you have to large maps which lacks content, an awful UI which makes no sense, the lack of QOL features like a FPS cap, eg. in the menu. Oh right, there is no voice chat, which shows how beta this game still is. Yes you read that right, there is no voice chat in a multiplayer shooter game, which has modes that requires team communication.

Where is the scoreboard? Why can't you crawl when dead? Why doesn't revive works if a player is to close to an object? Why can't players see when a medic is nearby? Where are the destruction of buildings, like we had in the last 3-4 games? Where are the guns and where are the fun guns? The list goes on of features that are lacking, which were present in earlier BF games. The game is not ready for release, not even close.

Pretty much the only positive addition is Hazard Zone, which could be fun, specially when you have unlocked a proper loadout, just a shame you have to grind in boring modes to really do that.

2,Battlefield 2042,mrgucci,"Nov 14, 2021","As a fan of the series since the first game, with thousands of hours in bf4/bf1/bfv, I have to say this release is a bad joke.

Listing all issues with this game is a bit pointless, you can google them or go to reddit/watch some videos. If you feel adventerous, play the game yourself although i do not recommend it. Main issues are:

Performance on a high end PC is just abysmal, low average FPS with constant drops and stutters, so heavy on CPU usage it bottlenecks everything no matter what your specs are. Most of the video settings make no difference, DLSS doesnt really help.

Map design for the most part is terrible, maps are large but empty so playing as 128 people is not really fun, there's little cover so infantry gameplay is next to non existent apart from the few buildings. And even these buildings feel empty and uninspiring. Also, shipping containers everywhere.

Gunplay is just plain bad, artifically adding bloom to weapons make you shot people but not really hit them, even point blank. Vehicle controls and physics are clunky and pretty tilting. 22 weapons are only available to unlock, mod system is very flat and doesnt really allow for much. There's no teamplay cause everyone is a superhero specialist (looking exactly the same so it's hard to tell who's on your team and who isn't).

UI and HUD has to be the worst I've seen in a long while, I'm sorry but whoever was the UI Designer either never played a game in his/her life (battlefield even more so) or its their first assignment in their career. In-game there's visual clutter everywhere.

Server stability is a big issue, Portal has great potential but no dedicated servers or reasonable search/filter/favorites UI make it a terrible experience to use.

Stay away from this game until its fixed, patched and improved. The price tag for it is just ridiculous in its current state. Collapse",3,3,4

Loadouts disappearing, attachment not working, shooting someone point blank with my full clip and doing no damage, falling through the world geometry, bad performance and low hardware utilization and many more.
This is unacceptable and has to stop! I just sign up for the Ea play for one month so I can try the game, but man, if you paid full price get your money back asap! This thing is a dumper fire.
Oh, I forgot to mention server issues, so many server issues, unable to connect, unable to start a match. On top of that portal really looked promising, until EA and Dice decided to kill the xp in it, so now you don't get xp while playing portal and it is completely useless!

7,Battlefield 2042,noxxid3,"Nov 15, 2021","Battlefield 2042 or in other words ""Call of Apex: 2042"".
The lead multiplayer designer is a fan of Apex and MW2019, and it really shows in the game design and gameplay elements.

Armor? Why is this even in the main multiplayer matches, yeah it makes sense for a squad based escape from battle royal game type but not in core multiplayer. The animation is almost exactly like MW2019 if you choose to use that as you gadget slot.

Medical pen, this is literally taken from CoD/Apex, it removes the focus of team play and relaying on team mates. Why carry a medical crate when you can self heal in a middle of a fire fight. This game completely incentives lone wolf behavior. Never in a game before have i felt so alone on the field even with 128 players.

Classes: This is basically gone from the game besides portal. And portal is basically there so you can farm XP, not sure how DICE didnt see that coming but they didnt. (or they turned a blind eye towards QA like they usually do).

The way the game makes it self feel like a hero shooter. You pick a specialist, you have one gadget and you run around aimlessly. You can choose a squad, you cant kick people from a squad but you can move to a random squad. Doesnt make sense. Now im so used to running a repair tool and rocket launcher that you cant even do that. Now i choose angel due to his ability to revive people with armor (which armor being very annoying to fight against), and the ability to call in supply drops. This right here, i can just sit in one spot with a sniper rifle get armor and be able to with stand a full mag dump from an enemy while using a stinger to take out air craft. This here is a huge issue. EVERYONE RUNS STINGERS because of the ""no class"" restrictions on weapons.

You're constantly getting locked on by everything in the game from ground to air to nades. Frag nades damage tanks and armor (why? I dont know and its stupid). Half the time you dont know when a pilot pops flares and it takes longer to even re-lock onto them.

Netcode is worse than BF4's launch, at least the hit reg in that game was miles ahead of this one.
Bullet bloom, you cant hit **** and it comes down to RNG
Mouse controls are inputted with controller so you have to change controller controls in order to get rid of mouse acceleration.

UI is horrible, they said that was being addressed, they lied. World icons are at 100% opacity enemies can hide behind that. Mini map scale is small as hell on ultrawide and you cant change the size of it. Crosshair and hitmarker colors do not change and is bugged. You cant tell if a rocket is incoming or you're just being constantly locked. Half the time the kill cam doesnt work

No scoreboards, no voice chat, no all chat.
You go through 15 different type of visual's before getting into a actual match to play and thats with even getting off the transport which is bugged.

Map design is horrible, you can take a jet and ram into an entire crowd of enemies on orbital.
Hovercraft are tanks that can spiderman up a skyscrapper.
DICE doesnt listen to QA

The game is about monetization of skins and specialists. Season 1 is delayed and you're stuck with 22 weapons and cant mix and match from era's. (Season 1 is delayed prob due to the huge backlash of issues so they have to fix that).

You go through 4 suppressors in order to unlock the muzzle brake.
Half the time you dont know if a rocket is incoming in the air.
The game itself is a toxic ceastpool of its own demise

This needed a longer time despite being worked on by 4 DIFFERENT STUDIOS.
TTK is a mess due to armor, you can take one full mag dump into someone without killing them and thats if you hit them due to bulletspread/bloom.

There’re many compare this one to cyberpunk 2077. Well, it’s partially true in a certain degree. But witnessing a hero’s fallen is nothing like seeing an old villain slowly revealing his true nature and becoming the way you always know him for.

Gunplay feels wonky as well, the M5A3 jumps straight up in the air after the second shot like someone is trying to wrestle it out of your hands. The whole thing is just really bad and really disappointing after the trailer. Oh, good luck getting frames over 70, regardless of rig.

The absurd map design makes 'running around' to be most of your gameplay time. Most of the time I just 'redeployed'; I mean I killed myself and respawned as I didn't want to run for another several minutes hoping to find an enemy.

The animation is horrendous. Who bloody designed to running animation? The way my character wiggles the gun whilst running looks so unnatural and 'programmed'. For a moment I thought my character was trying to do the good old shuffling dance or something.

The shooting mechanism is an absolute disaster. To describe it simply, imagine that instead of random boxes for loots, like those you would get from micro-transaction lunacy, there is an element of randomness in the bullets. Aiming hardly matters as the bullet spread is chaotic and absurd. This problem is exacerbated with the first problem mentioned: the map design. Such a massive but empty map design makes most of the gunfights to be long-ranged, nevertheless the chaotic bullet spread accompanied with crazy recoil makes these long-ranged gunfights to be an absolute nightmare.

Moreover, I was surprised by the number of weapons available in the game. I thought I was playing a beta again.

And the new specialist system....Right, this could be a personal preference, but I simply cannot comprehend why this system was implemented for a BF game. I thought this game was supposed to be the developers going back to the root, getting back the original identity of the BF franchise. However, what we have is a poor example of overwatch and apex wannabe. Furthermore, if you were going to use such system, at least make them feel special and fun. I really don't understand the point of this specialist system.

I could go on for hours: scoreboard, servers, destruction and so on. In fact, it would be much easier to list the points this game did well. Which, I conjecture, would be a very short concise list.

-The ui is slow and clunky. I don't know if its because of the fps drops but sometime it freezes when i try to change my attachments in portal.

-Where is the destruction you showed off at E3 2020?
-Where is the campaign?

-Bug where i can't leave the vehicle sometimes.
-Sometimes the parachute doesn't deploy.
-Bug where i got stuck in crouch mode.
-Bug where i couldn't look up or down.
-Where is the classic battlefield teamwork? Does the request ammo/ medic in commrose even do
anything?
-Why can't i mute the childish cringy lines after every game.
-I had it where all the obj icons would disappear when i ads on BF4, why isn't that in this game 7
years later. Can't scale hud, can't hide individual Hud elements.
-Why can't i switch the interact key to toggle?
-You can't mark/ ping the map in hazard zone. Why?
-Bug where you can't revive teammates if they are clipping or if they are in water.

No scoreboard
No stats
No destruction (compared to any past BF game)
No locked squads
No voice chat
No all chat (in M rated game... for your protection)
No platoons
No server browser (except Portal)
No emblems
No BFV movement system like promised, you can't even lean

TERRIBLE GUNS

Worst random spread in franchise history. It was fine in Beta, they made changes....
22 guns, including pistols
All guns feel the same
Pathetic customization, the barrel attachments for example are mostly COSMETIC

TERRIBLE FLIGHT MODEL AIR VEHICLES

Flight model of air vehicles is a joke (just like Beta). Any noob can dominate in heli
Skill it took to fly helis in Battlefield 4 is GONE.
Jets on the other hand are useless. They did no changes from Beta, seriously
Tanks, pretty much useless against a decent heli pilot
Hovercraft, better than any tank (and can climb walls)
Glitchy turrets

HAZARD ZONE aka HAHA ZONE

Boring and will be dead after 2 weeks. I can see why there wasn't much trailers. No stakes into the games

PORTAL

Portal could be great, but it has inherited crap from the main game, like the air vehicle physics. The air vehicles are not original, they are reskins of the 2042 vehicles! Same terrible 2042 flight model.

People use Portal to farm 1HP bots for XP mainly... and DICE didn't see this coming?

El Alamein map is just a flat desert... yeah it looks good, but 20 year old map design shows...
PC PERFORMANCE Performance is abysmal. Not everyone can afford a RTX 3090, and even with that you will be lucky to hit 100 frames. OTHER PROBLEMS 2042 maps are filled with copypaste buildings and cargo containers. CONTAINERS everywhere. Sound design is a downgrade, directional audio is terrible. Graphics don't actually even look good. BF1 from 2016 looks far better. Portal is the only thing showing promise, but you can just go play the real BF3 right now?

The bug riddled game is only the tip of the iceberg. This games overly chunky feel and poor optimization really leave a lot to be desired with this new BF game.

51,Battlefield 2042,Zoso-Overdose,"Nov 14, 2021","Where to even begin.

The core game, All Out Warfare, is barely playable (when you can actually get into a server). It crashes a lot. There are only a handful of weapons per class. Game-breaking bugs galore like getting stuck in a downed state and having to quit the match. There are many other game-ending bugs. The gun handling has been ruined by the introduction of random spread since the beta. For some reason the SMGs perform better at range than the ARs because of this.

Portal would be the saving grace, but it suffers from many of the same bugs. Noshar Canals on Rush is broken - in the match I played, spawning on teammates didn't work so one team was just stuck on the carrier. My friend kept getting the stuck in downed state bug so we were having to constantly leave matches. I would crash to desktop and not be able to join back.

This is really sad because I love Battlefield and want it to do well. There's nothing quite like it on the market. I worry about how many times can DICE f*ck it up before EA pulls the plug :(

I bought the Gold Edition and ended up getting a refund because in its current state, the game is barely playable, and the lack of weapons or progression (even unlocking new attachments is bugged) meant I wasn't bothered to put up with all of the bugs to try to play.

Seriously DICE, you ended support for Star Wars and BFV for this?? What have you been doing?

- Crossplay disabled on XBSX. Why can't there be input crossplay?

- Bugs - it's a BF game, there's always bugs. These will get fixed.

I have a tops spec PC, so performance doesnt matter from graphical side. What matters is server performance which is abyssmal. Constant stutters like the server was running 5Hz. I understand that lot of people play the game, but hey, shouldn't that be calculated in risk? You're offering a 64 vs 64 maps and servers doesn't pull off? The other thing is balance, or rather complete lack of it. In what world of any shooter a scout jeep need 3 rockets to be taken off? Hovercraft 4-5 hits, Helicopters have flares reloaded faster than player can reload rocket launcher. This is riddiculous. Weapons like PP19 have range marked as reduced and are on par with sniper riffles over 200 meters! Also damage is favoured to SMGs vs everything else.

Matchmaking is also bad, so GL if you plan on playing with more than 3 of your mates. You also get kicked out from server after each round to join a new one. After 10 games of conquest, I have only been put in 2 maps.

Lots of problems with assigning keybindings to air vehicles and impossible to make it similar to older versions.

The specialist system is one of the worst ideas ever (which has obviously been created to sell cosmetics in the long run), and the interface is one of the most counter-intuitive ones I've ever seen, I still don't fully understand how you customise your guns in the menu, I just use the plus-system when I spawn. It's frustrating to see that after 3 years this is what they came up with, 22 weapons (including sidearms). It's so annoying to see how they just ruin franchises like that, it would have been so easy to please the majority of players (old and new).... BUT NOOOOOOOO they had to release this **** of a game.

Loadouts are fine everything there works, maps are not good, too big for the game I'd rather it be like battlefield 4 but with 128 players on the same maps. What happened to destruction? No clue since there's no taking down buildings or a giant battlefield scarred with craters like in BF1 or BFV it's just cod at this point where all you see is vehicles exploding and that's about it.

The frame rate is around 30-40 with occasional drops to 20 I've seen people say they have a RTX 3090 and a Ryzen 5950x and it's at 40-50 so you know the optimization is absolutely trash.

What a dumpster fire of a launch, at least the BFV beta was playable and the only issues in that was revives and the fact that you could see the grey floor underwater.

63,Battlefield 2042,hacksuya,"Nov 15, 2021","Okay, so where to begin? Bugs and glitches are expected so no surprise because sadly that's a concept we the gamers accepted by buying broken games on release since 10 years ago. By doing that we set the bar too low to a point where developers and publishers simply release broken games expecting that we will buy them even though the quality is complete trash. And guess what, we do, we just can't help ourselves.
Onto a more technical approach toward the game. As many here pointed out: This is not Battlefield as we know. It's an amalgamate of Apex, R6 Siege, Fortinite and Warzone.
No classes,
almost so called ""levolution"" introduced in BF4,
no dedicated servers,
no stat page,
no scoreboards,
no chat (voice nor typed),
""specialists"",
they introduced these cringey voice lines while running around and doing stuff and at the end screen with those unnecessary animations of MVP. Like, why? Why did you think that's something Battlefield needed?
I also do not appreciate that we can change our attachments in the middle of the gunfight. To me, it completely destroys immersion (among other things present in this game) because it feels that our ""soldiers"" (not soldiers, our characters seems like privately owned fighters from those security companies we see in movies and series) carry them in the pocket. Maybe that's a thing and I don't know.
Also the wingsuit has ""Just Cause"" physics. Completely ridiculous. Ruins the immersion.
Lastly, the lack of weapon is disappointing. Barely reaching 20 guns while BF4 had almost 80 or more. I bet they will add more as they release the surprise mechanic called season pass or battle pass.
I regret playing more than 2 hours, because I really tried to enjoy but so many things are wrong. This is not a war game, it's just a bunch of people running around playing with expensive toys.

68,Battlefield 2042,TheSWEEPER,"Nov 15, 2021","Game is in a complete disarray and is embarrassingly bad A list of issues with Battlefield 2042 and what needs to be changed / fixed.

**1) No Scoreboard** - No scoreboard means you can't tell who's hacking, can't tell if the teams are balanced, can't see how many bots there are in your lobby, can't see everyone's ranks/levels, can't see everyone's stats and comparing yourself and your squad to everyone else, can't see latency of everyone in the match, can't see overall score, and can't see how many different classes are being played. The players have everything to lose when there is no scoreboard, yet EA/DICE have everything to gain. If you care about your community and respect us as dedicated fans of this series, you will bring back at least this one feature.

**2) No scoring system** - We've had a scoring system in Battlefield for many years now, yet such a system does not exist in BF2042. Shooting at enemy players does not rack up any score points, throwing ammo/meds or doing repairs doesn't rack up score points. Capturing objectives, playing as a squad, marking objectives, spotting enemies, etc, all of these do not rack up any score. All we get now is a basic XP system that cannot be shown or displayed to anyone. You cannot compare your score with people on your own team, let alone the enemy team. The removal of the scoring system plus the removal of the scoreboard both contribute to the lack of competitiveness that the franchise has been known for. Remember the days where you were at the top of the scoreboard with 0 kills but the most revives/heals? Say goodbye to that.

**3) No stats page** - So we have no scoreboard, no scoring system, and also...no stats page. We cannot even see our own progression and stats in the game. Remember the Battlelog days where we can see so many detailed stats and also compare with other users? Well we hit rock bottom.

**4) No server browser** - When you thought it couldn't get even worse, it just did. BF2042 has no server browser, you matchmake like you do in Call of Duty. We cannot manually select/search for games, we have to just use the matchmaking system that does the search for us. This is taking power away from players for no good reason. This opens the door for SBMM/EOMM becoming a thing which is a major red flag. It gets worse.

**5) Players do not carry over to next match, lobby disbands** - Out of all the things EA/DICE could take from Modern Warfare, they took one of the worst things ever introduced, which was lobby disbandment. When a match is over, everyone is thrown back to the main menu, you get no chance to rematch the players you just played with. The older CoD and BF games all kept the same players for the next map, meaning you could play with the same players match after match. You cannot do that anymore as the system now forces everyone to disband immediately after the post-match screen. Needless to say, but this kills what little sense of community this game had left. Well done.

**6) No real class system** - People confuse this issue with the specialist system when these are two separate issues. You can have specialists while also having a class system. The issue with BF2042 is that every specialist can use every weapon, every grenade/gadget, and every tool, with the only difference being the skin of your specialist and their special gadget/ability. Having no class system means it will be much harder to balance out your weapons, because now every single AR has to compete with every SMG, which has to compete with every LMG, which has to compete with every Sniper/Shotgun, and so on. The lack of class system means that a stricter meta will form compared to previous BF games where you still had more diversity of weapon and gadget use because you had to sacrifice something if you wanted something else. For example, in BC2/BF3/BF4, if you are running an AR, you can't use an RPG, if you wanted one, you had to sacrifice the other. This is called balance because you are balancing out who gets what. All a class system is is a package of things you get. DICE could have easily made specialists be a part of a class or ""package"", so certain specialists within a certain class can only use certain weapons and gadgets/utility. This would have been the correct way to go for BF2042 and a fair compromise.

69,Battlefield 2042,DaRealTeufel,"Nov 15, 2021","I was so excited for this since I have no fps games to play at the moment and every big AAA game has been a let down this year and last. I never pre order games though as it is pointless and played the free beta. I wanted to like it so much but it was so buggy on Xbox Series X that it was unplayable. With only a few guns to play with, 1 map and mode, and seeing the same two characters over 100 times got old real quick. I believe they built specialists around hazard mode and I think they work well with it but adding them to the core game was a big mistake. With there only being like 11 specialists at launch and not enough added later and mostly everyone playing the same 3-4 specialists, it won't feel like battlefield. Your meant to feel like a faceless solider that can die and not have massive importance. Not every single game needs to make you feel like the hero of the movie or game. Now on to the release or what they call early access  but is still the full game. Again I don't pre order AAA games nor buy day one, pointless. I have the game pass which includes EA Access and allowed me to play 2042 for 9 hours. Within those 9 hours I can paraphrase the rest of the review by saying it sucks and don't buy until a deep sale 6 months later. Now don't get me wrong there's a Very good foundation here. You have the good ole Battlefield engine, the movements of the character feels good along with core gunplay when it works. That's it though. First and foremost there's no campaign, which automatically should of lowered the price of the game not raised it 10 dollars on console  for ""next gen"", Which is a scam. With no campaign, there should have been more time to add more content to multiplayer and its just not there at all. The thing that worries me most is that BF5 was a ""Woke Failure from the start and almost no content added later. Bf 2042 gives you 22 Weapons in total with a handful more dedicated to portal mode, worse then any recent battlefield or call of duty. The few guns you do get come with a very small handful of skins that are very simple bland ones. The vehicles in this game feel cheap and blocky too. You get a few Massive but empty maps without much detail although pretty graphics at times, Two main modes, conquest and Breakthrough. It seems like battlefield strips away more and more modes every game. The performance is not there on new consoles and even worse on pc. Personally I dip below 50fps on Series X all the time. Next you have hazard mode which is like Battle Royale and a very simple version of escape from Tarkov. I thinks there's only map, that's all I got and it gets boring quick. Now the bread and butter and our potential savior is portal. A mode that for now combines Bf 1942 with bad company 2 and bf3 allows you to play 2 maps from each game along with a couple weapons and vehicles from them and a dedicated mode in each game that has potential. Seeing this mode makes me think they should of just remastered some old bf games and put them together in a bundle instead. If they add a lot more maps and guns to these games and even more games to the mode, there is something here. Like I said before I am very worried about post launch content. Even with portal though, you still have a buggy ugly glitchy ui. No scoreboard along with other features missing and poor button mapping. A small but necessary annoyance, on xbox you cannot disable crossplay within the game. You must go to xbox settings and disable crossplay which turns it off for every game which is annoying because I play a lot of co op games and like crossplay. On fps games I do not though with pc players. To wrap it up, there are a lot of bugs in this game but can be ironed out, a good foundation, and a potentially very good portal mode thats worth paying $70 alone in the future. Other then that there are way too many issues and missing content in the game and not worth the money nor time. Absolutely wait for a sale and months for issues to be fixed. Collapse",1,3,4

I decided to buy the game sechyas and what we have is the Battlefield 2042 game the most disgusting part that is possible!! pc rtx3090, i7-10700k,64gb ram has crashes, constant lags and 60-90 fps!! disgusting optimization, disgusting registration of hits in the network code, hanging management! the inability to continue the fight the respawn timer is at zero, lagging servers!!!

If I could, I would refund the money for the pre-order!!
I will never buy your product again!! Collapse",0,3,4

78,Battlefield 2042,LKYGOD,"Nov 15, 2021","I never thought that I would have to give a Battlefield game any negativ feedback. For me as a big fan of the Battlefield series I have always kind of looked over technical issues, bugs, etc. but this year I have to clearly express my opinion. I do not even know where to start - the best way to describe it is this: In every Battlefield except Battlefield 2042 you jumped into the game and had the typical Battlefield experience - action, gunfights, nice gunplay and a whole lot of fun mixed with satisfying gameplay and brilliant graphics and legendary maps. In BF 2042 you get nothing like that. The maps are just big empty spaces designed without any love. There are no urban areas, villages, cities or areas with some battlefield-flair in general. Just look at maps like Zavod, Dawnbreaker, Paracel, etc. or any of the BF1 or BFV maps. Vehicle balance just is not there. The weapon pool is just poor - it‘s even worse than poor - it‘s shameful. Battlefield in it‘s newest form with 4!!! assault rifles?! I do not even want to start with the UI - it is horrible - I have never seen such an unusable and non-intuitive UI in any game. Gunplay is **** Maps are **** Technical Aspect is **** No Battlefield feeling. Working parts of every Battlefield since 30 years have been removed. These devs are just **** clueless.

- No dedicated servers. Thanks to matchmaking you are always playing with random people.
- No way to join specific squad, all you can do is leaving your squad and joining other _random_ squad mid game. You dont see other squads on map, so you can not tell if they play objective or just soloing.
- There is no in game voice chat for squad coordination. Funny thing is that if you click the player on the player list there is an option to mute him, but... there is no voice chat.
- You can not zoom the map so if there is some heavy fighting around some oint good luck selecting the right point (squad mate, point itself, spawn beacon etc)
- No hardcore mode without 3rd person vehicle view, 3d spotting, kill cams etc.

They did everything to kill the teamwork making BF2142 into large scale COD/Apex/Fortnite.

BF2142 is like hymn for mediocracy - stats removed, low weapons variety (two types of launchers only, really?), overly simplified core game cycle.

I wont tell you much about the operators. They are useless and could be like skins for normal classes.

Voiceover is irritating, and i bet that there is NOT A SINGLE person not swearing on those opening non-skippable cinematics at the beginning of EVERY FREAKING round.

The game is truly unpolished and has so many problems and, really little positive things so far.

The Bad:
- poorly optimised
- bloom effect while aiming
- exaggerate recoil which makes shooting a nightmare
- Maps are HUGE but empty and with no repairs
- Too many vehicles spamming everywhere
- no leader boar and not stats
- unable to choose the server where to play
- unable to join different squads
- really poor team play, almost no one reviving teammates
- many bugs
- Snipers EVERYWHERE and too much verticality and mobility
- Spawning time is too quick and enemies are keep spamming nearby
- Spawn system is **** up, I got spawn killed countless time in few matches
- horrible sound for a BF game

Gameplay : 4/10

Gunplay : the assault rifles have more recoil than smg's and you wait to see more damage.
They are not.. the smgs is better on all ranges , the bullet speed is to low and in ranges it feels unrealistic, the guns fire on random spots , they have spread on bullets and it looks and feel awfull.
The weapons need re-edit to be some balance
SMGS fast bullets ,less damage , short range less recoil
Rifles big damage , bigger recoil , steady damage on all ranges

Helis - Jets - land vechicles

They need buff on all damages and the land vechicles need nerf on life.

A lot of bags on the gunfight.

Graphics : 6/10
The battlefield V have better graphics and perfomance.. this is the true..

UI MENUS HUD 4/10
The Ui is an nightmare !
I can talk about it all day..
The customization is too complicated , there is NO SCOREBOARD , NO STATS , NO real proggression or milestones to unlock something bigger , No ranking system.

Servers : 5/10
A lot of lags.. no high pings but lagging a lot of time

Bags gliches 3/10
the game is full of bags. i can talk about 15-30 bags.
at 50 meters and more the players are look like 2D pICTURES , they are moving and the legs and the whole animation is steady.
bags everywhere. bags on the servers.. when you play breakaway , sometime it throws you on a server in overtime period and it havent time and you waiting there for ever. you can't even deploy.

Maps : 3/10
Way to big , no cover , no nice places to fight , just a open map for tanks and snipers.
the battlefield V-BF4-BF3 have way better maps.

Contest - Weapons - customization 3/10

7 maps only , only 22 weapons (only 3 assault rifles , its like a joke) , limites weapons everywhere (and portal) , limited customization everywhere and the skins is nothing... if you play ww3 you will understand this is nothing.

Perfomance : 6/10
it needs a lot of optimazation

Teamplay - Chat - Voip 3/10

No teamplay no voip.

No classes just specialist
No teamplay just random fights
No close quarters fight just open world chaotic fighting
No Scoreboard , No Stats , no balance. no contest Only 2 modes , awfull menus and ui , filters and matchmaking on portal (the servers close after the a day and you can't find the again to play. The weapons take no xp on portal , there is no progression on portal.

97,Battlefield 2042,southinthemouth,"Nov 15, 2021","I typically don’t pre-order games, I took a chance on this game and promptly refunded after the first playtest. I wound up playing the early access through game pass and the game is insultingly rough — anyone who paid 90$+ to be a part of this should ask for a refund. I have leveled to about 30 and found unsatisfying gameplay loops, nothing to grind for, horrifically embarrassing specialist design (end of round quips), worst gunplay in the franchise (and genre, due to bloom and highly random horizontal recoil), and generally garbage performance on a high end rig (5950x and 3090). While Portal is the highlight of the game, it’s mostly plagued by xp/badge farm servers. Hazard Zone is a joke, I don’t think anyone will ever play this mode without serious overhaul or addition of content. The map design on conquest/breakthrough favors vehicle play to the point where you have to cheese the two good guns in the game to have any fun or hop in a vehicle.

There is an overwhelmingly negative response to this game on almost every media outlet — anything positive is likely due to a reviewer tied to EA/Dice. Sadly there are very few positives about this game other than generally it’s a battlefield game and yeah large-scale combat is generally fun, but overall the experience is bad.

Unfortunately it's completely broken, both in terms of intentional design decisions (no scoreboard, no control of teams or squads, no voice chat, no cross-team chat, terrible menu UI, cringy voice lines, etc.) and in terms of unintentional bugs (smgs more accurate than rifles, glitchy rubberbandy character movement that feels like first person mods for third person games, can't revive players sometimes, can't join multiplayer due to 'persistence error', etc etc).

2,Battlefield 2042,StoneFoxAU,"Nov 15, 2021","All the building blocks of a decent game but none of the polish.
I rate the game poorly because they have added or changed features that nobody asked for. These features somehoe passed the design phase.

Other reasons include poor performance, lazy map design and tremendously bad hit registry.
This game at times is a laggy mess I'll admit when it works it feels good but 60% of the time the bullets don't register or people lag out.
The vehicles and vehicle balancing are a whole other issue that I don't want to get into suffice to say EA should be aware of what went wrong.
Glitches are not few and far between sadly, falling through the map, guns refusing to fire, players being invulnerable and going on killing sprees the list goes on.

Let's talk about the operators and the lackluster content in the game on launch.
It's actually sad that ea and dice believe they can get away with the huge price tag this game has when it's 1. Not a complete or properly functioning product and 2. Has such a lack of content and to be honest the map design is pretty lazy. In their videos they talk about how they had to re-asses the way they designed their maps to increase performance and game flow for their ""larger"" conquest mode.
Now while the maps may be slightly larger they feel empty and the gameplay really reflects it.

Specialists should only exist in hazard zone they are a waste in regular gameplay.
Hazard zone itself was a throw away mode to draw players. It's lazy boring and lackluster. Imagine using the exact same maps from the regular mode, same weapons, same operators and the concept of the mode is such a waste of time to play.
Hazard zone is a poorly designed battle Royale mode instead of a risk it all exhilarating solo or squad based mode.
The feeling of loss in hazard zone is non existent considering you get everything for free and there's no need to pay for other equipment.
It feels like a very lazy tarkov and I think I speak for the community when I say we feel cheated by this lazy attempt at a tarkov esq game mode. If your going to make a tarkov esq mode please atleast look at what makes tarkov so exhilarating and so fun to play, there's a grind, missions, you have to find and craft loot and you well and truly lose everything when you die it's not an optional rule to the game it's the core concept.
Basically you made a lazy attempt at a title that should have been ground breaking but instead was a waste of $100 and everyone's time. It has potential and if given the proper care by the developers it can be a long lasting game with a vibrant community for each mode. But as we have seen time and time again it's unlikely to happen. Please fix the game poll the community and let us decide what we want from the product don't assume you know what we want. Not worth it in the current state but hopefully in a month or so they will have implemented the appropriate changes.

We hardcore fans of the franchise have to accept that EA killed BF and BF its not coming back

List of Current Grievances

Let me start by saying that I so desperately wanted to love this game. I have been playing Battlefield since 2142 and it is by far my favorite franchise. Below is a list (in no particular order) of broken promises and removed or stepped on features that, if any one of which on their own was missing, broken, or intentionally removed, I could live with. When taken in as a whole, however, it just... I don't know... this doesn't feel like Battlefield.
**GENERAL**

* Plus system is clunky dog ****
* UI is clunky dog **** wrapped in cat **** Might be the least intuitive I've ever seen
* No Campaign
* Lack of game modes
* No hardcore
* No military ranks associated with numerical ranks
* Audio is poorly mixed
* The maps, while stunning from both a scale and visuals perspective, lack any real flow for infantry combat.
* Non-removable profanity filter
* Lack of promised destruction/levelution
* Faction locked weapons and gadgets in Portal
* No rule editor support for objective based game modes
* No server browser outside of Portal
* No private/rented servers
* Doesn't just roll into the next map after a game in AoW, back to matchmaking peasant
* Cannot join friends already in a match (pretty sure I could do this in beta??)
* Cutscenes all over the place
* Cringe 'look at me' after a match
* Cannot customize loadouts before joining a game.
* Cannot select loadout or operator before joining a server which, in certain situations, spawn you directly into the game with whatever you had last game. This happens when joining a fresh breakthrough game, mostly.
* BFV and Battlefront 2 were gutted to make this **** lol
* No mouse and keyboard support for console
* Options and description for kill sounds changed from beta. During beta it showed you would be able to choose between BF2042 and BF1 kill sounds. This same option now only lets you choose between BF2042 sounds or no sounds.
* No Practice/Test Range
**IN GAME**

* Zoom issues with sniper scopes
* No zeroing sniper scopes, starting scope (not sure about the others) has no hash marks on reticle for references
* Biggest maps we've ever seen, highest scope magnification is 10x
* No holding shift/stick click to steady a sniper shot
* No leaning
* 22 guns total lol
* No ‘All’ chat
* Enemies look the same as friendlies
* Bullet spread / weapon inaccuracy outside of rock throwing range
* Have to opt out of revive every death, no idea who can actually revive me anyway
* Have to re-select spawn location every spawn
* No resizable minimap
* Cannot move while prone and ADS
* Damage dealt numbers, e.g. ""VEHICLE HIT 28"" after hitting a tank with a rocket, have been removed. This applies to both infantry and vehicles.
* Weapons can't have different sets of attachments in different loadout presets. Meaning if you want to have a suppressor on the **one** semi-auto pistol in the game for one preset, you can't have it *without* a suppressor in your other presets.
* No fixed heavy weapons * AA rocket damage appears inconsistent * BF5 movement mechanics removed * Obnoxious voice overs, operators are incredibly vocal, every time you do an action they say a line. * Melee takedown animations have been gutted. All enemies are brought to a standing position before one specific kill is performed. * Cannot dive underwater * UI elements do not have transparency element and distant 2D/3D map markers and UI elements do not fade out by distance and cannot be scaled up or down * Good luck finding your marker on the map **TEAMPLAY/SCORING** * No VoIP * No real scoreboard * No stats page * No commander * Cannot join, create, or lock a squad * Cannot switch teams * Repairing vehicles does not give XP * No squad points for issuing orders or following them * No marksman headshot bonus for long range snipes * 'Assist Counts as Kill' has been removed * No vehicle kill assists * Spotting system is contextual and misses a lot of the time. For example, if you press Q over an enemy tank it doesn't always spot it, but places a go-to marker on that area. * The team/squad order menu (or whatever it's called) is a pile of garbage. back Collapse",1,3,4

12,Battlefield 2042,CapitalistCow,"Nov 16, 2021","Honestly, this was a bigger letdown for me than Cyberpunk. At least I wasn't invested in that IP beforehand. It feels like EA is done with battlefield. Using checkers on a chess board isn't the same as chess. And using COD/R6/Apex mechanics on a battlefield map doesn't make it a battlefield game. We don't play this game for the aesthetics, we play it for the GAME. EA has somehow missed the reason why battlefield fans are battlefield fans and not COD fans. THEY'RE DIFFERENT GAMES. If I wanted to play COD, R6, Apex, etc. I would be playing those games instead. Specialists are the stupidest, most derivative, and most boring option they could have gone with. They ruin the game, as it's no longer a battlefield title without clear cut classes and class roles. The last thing battlefield needs is less team players. Gone are the days of squad synergy and team play. You want ammo, health, or reps? Too bad, you better bring your own damn kit. Because no one will be healing or resupplying you. They even removed quick chat options to request supplies, which I would be more sad about if the specialist system didn't already make it impossible to figure out who can actually supply you or heal you. Also now I can be a self reviving sniper with near unlimited ammo resupply, so screw balance I guess. Generally, the game is alright. Nothing special, and I would certainly rather play BF4 or 5. If they remove the specialists from conquest mode, the game would go up to a six or seven in my opinion. But right now I can't rate it any higher than a two since it absolutely and completely fails at even being something close to resembling a battlefield game.

It's crazy to me how hard they marketed this game towards die-hard battlefield fans and community members, and then immediately turned around and released some weird Frankenstein of a game meant to appeal to everyone EXCEPT battlefield fans. The only kind of Battlefield players who would enjoy this game are the ones who don't help their team, and treat every game as if it was a solo deathmatch. Coincidentally these are the players that the community hates the most. Prior to the release of 2042, they just ran off to a different game. But EA has basically just given battlefield to them with this release. So, will you enjoy this game? Well. It depends. Do you like battlefield? If so this game probably isn't for you. Did you try battlefield years ago but just couldn't get into it? Then this is the one for you. EA has specifically made this game for people who were turned off by the Battlefield parts of battlefield. Collapse",2,3,4

They did it, they've made THE BATTLEFIELD without the battlefield.

This is the most disappointing game I have ever played, my beloved studio DICE, so proclaimed as player-oriented and community-driven (Even under the EA's influence), were always trying to deliver a good product even with forced revenue boosted elements: Premium Packs in Battlefield 4, loot boxes in Battlefront, skins and boosters In Battlefield V but never it was such a delusional and disconnected from the community...This is a general review and I will not go specifically on each missing or slaughtered feature/game element

- Empty promises
- No balance
- Lying about the game concept and future plans
- Uncooked and unfinished with hundreds of bugs and performance issues
- Empty lifeless maps with 0 creativity and level design
- Re-used assets and complete lack of content at the start because battle passes, of course, lets increase grind so players will stay longer in the game until we have a chance to rush our production team and release a whole new batch of untested and unbalanced weapons, attachments, characters and vehicles.

And as a dessert, SPECIALISTS, of course since they like money and since creativity is now officially dead, they prefer to copy a popular concept that ruins the essence of the series without a reason! I am not against making money on the additional concept but give us the base game and then do whatever you want for a chashgrab from the new audience and current players, what we received is a spit in the face and that famous ""South Park"" We Are Sorry....
P.S. There is no recovery, this game will improve most of the issues with gameplay and balance in the next couple of years but it will never become a BATTLEFIELD

This game makes Cyberpunk 2077 release look like a HIT RELEASE.

By far one of the worst shooters that I have played:

Cons:
- The only thing that matters in a FPS multiplayer game, the HIT REG, is atrocious sometimes bullets hit, sometimes u are 10cm near the enemy and nothing goes in them;
- Rocket Launchers have the wild factor, being that they have moments when they decide not to explode on impact;
- Respawn bugs, a ton of respawn bugs;
- The Interface is trash;
- The menus are, surprise, BUGGED;
- The recoil patterns on weapons are garbage;
- The Bullet trajectory looks broken as hell;
- If I put a hamster on a wheel to power up my server, he would probably do a better job than their servers;
- The animations are horrendous, on EVERYTHING;
- The optimization is not there at all, the settings don't carry any weight in term of making your experience better (graphically or performance wise);
- The 128 player idea, good on paper, really bad executed;
- The progression is terrible.

PROS:
- None, like i really haven't found 1 good thing to keep me in the game.

Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game, I haven't played a more broken game than this.
This game needed at least 1 more year, guess the investors needed more money. I have no clue how it passed the QA and QC, being a multiplayer mode only and it being so broken makes me nervously laugh on how bad it actually is. Collapse",0,3,4
28,Battlefield 2042,fleskxx,"Nov 19, 2021","**REFUNDED GOLD EDITION**

I have played every single Battlefield game that has come out extensively and this is by far the WORST game in the Battlefield franchise I've EVER played. It's so disconnected from what a Battlefield game should be. Shallow, these **** specialists with no soul whatsoever, that satanic hovercraft, the maps, spawns.. I could go on forever it feels like! And as unexpected as ever the game is also very poorly optimized!I ran between 50-100 fps on all settings with a 3070ti and i711000k with huge drops whenever there was a firefight close by. DICE games has always been so smooth, even on lower spec computers, but this is just baffling.

Oh and by the way; here's a list of all things missing in the game as of today:

Core Features:
-No single-player story
-No standard server browser
-Fewer standardized game modes (Can't even play TDM or smaller scale modes without relying on community servers. Really?)
-Fewer base game maps than any other title (even including portal the map count is only 13)
-No persistent lobbies (seriously why do I have to matchmake after EVERY round?)
-Fewer in-game assignments (none outside of cosmetic unlocks)
-No class system
-Less character customization options (than BF5)
-No profile progress/stats page in the menu
-No battle log/stats tracker for other players
-No global leader boards
-No end of round assignment progress screen
-No dog tags (they still sort of exist I guess?)
-No custom emblems
-Fewer achievements
-No medals
-No swelling crescendo of dramatic music near the end of a match (obviously -this is the most egregious of the list)
-Less destruction (only a small handful of destructible buildings on each map)-
-No map altering levolution (There sort of is but the maps are so big, anything that changes doesn't really affect how you -play)
-No cross-game profile screen (BF 4, HL, 1, and V were all linked by a menu if you owned them digitally, was a neat feature.)
-No spectator mode
-No permanent community servers (would be useful for clans and events)

Infantry Gameplay:
-Fewer guns (even including all the portal guns, BF4 still had more at launch)
-Fewer infantry gadgets
-No manual leaning
-No diving while swimming
-No high wall vaulting
-No crouch sprinting
-No backwards prone
-No explosion knockback
-No rolling after falling from heights
-No ammo or health pickup off teammates
-No scope zeroing
-No thermal optics
-No indirect fire gadgets
-Less anti-tank launchers (Come on man only one?)
-No AP mines/claymores
-No static weapon emplacements
-No fortification building
-No resupply stations
-No suppression mechanic (This one I don't mind but I'm including everything)
Scoring System: -No squad wipe scoring -No player damage points -No vehicle damage points -No vehicle kill assist points -No headshot bonus -No long-range kill bonus -No assist counts as kill bonus -No squad objective play bonus -Oversimplified teamplay scoring (i.e. healing a teammate always gives you +5xp rather than the amount of health you give) Squad and Teamwork: -No commander -No special squad call-in abilities -No squad field upgrades -No in-game VOIP -Fewer factions (with almost nothing to give the 2 factions any distinction) -No cross-team chat -No ""create new squad"" option -No ""promote to squad leader"" option -No clans -No view of squadmates while in the spawn screen -No ""Medic incoming"" indicator in downed state -No rank names/icons, just a number. UI and Quality of Life: -Less control customization options -Less UI customization options -No HUD/icon opacity customization -No HUD scaling customization options -No gunsight reticle customization options -No network performance graph -No individual player scoreboard -Less detail in the 'who killed you' screen -No ultrawide monitor support -Very poor friend joining system TLDR; Dont waste your money on this cash-grab.

2. Technique upgrades. if you unlock upgrade for tank/helicopter/attack heli/jet it will be unlocked just for one fraction, so when in the next match when you will be playing for other fraction you will find that you don't have those upgrades. So just grind a little bit more.
Maps. First of all, they almost completely remove destruction from the game, you aren't able to destroy any building. Maximum you can destroy SOME walls. Now we have 128 players with a large map, only 128 players mode. In this case, we need more technique but we have only 2 slots for attack heli/jet, 2 slots for little bird/transports and 3 slots for heavy armor (tank/AA) this means that usually, you will run through the map.
3. **** UI. Too many levels of the menu for upgrading your loadout. If we talk about portal you just can't select attachment by right click, you must click by LMB and move to the first slot. No separate server browsers for regular game and portal mode. Also, I didn't find how to switch teams or squads. Don't even sure that it is possible.

31,Battlefield 2042,zoltanownsyou,"Nov 14, 2021","There's not enough space here to put how terrible and unplayable this game is.

This isn't a battlefield game. This is a warzone/fortnite hybrid and it's straight trash.

The huge, huge, huge maps of vast nothingness between objective points.

22 guns in total. Lol.

No voice chat? Are you serious? Indie games that take 1 month to create have voice chat.

Armor platings?? That's LITERALLY from warzone. And it's infuriating to lose a gunfight to a player who has armor.... game breaking.

The game looks like plastic on 1440p and I get 50 frames with an RTX 2080. The sound in this game literally equalizes all sound into one volume. Footsteps as loud as tanks. It looks and sounds worse than a early 2000s FPS title.

The physics in this game make no sense. The bullet registrstion and bullet spread will make you physically sick.

DICE has betrayed fans of this once militaristic FPS franchise which is now a child's game with operstors who have quirky one-liners and goofy outfits. All of this betrayl just to sell skins. Is this the definition of ""selling out""?

There is literally no scoreboard in this game. You cannot see hiw many kills everyone has. This is unacceptable.

There is no progression system aside from a number that keeps rising. There are no ""military ranks"". There is no way to check your stats or progression.

There are TWO GAMEMODES. LOL. Are you serious? And there are 7 maps. And not every map is compatible with each gamemode. So you will literally play 3 GIGANTIC maps over and over.

When you hit a vehicle with a rocket it says ""part disabled: 10 points"". TELL ME HOW MUCH DAMAGE I DID TO THE VEHICLE FFS.

There are robot dog AI that will laser you from 500 meters out. They are very common.

I don't think I've seen a building collapse in this game, for two reasons: #1 tgere are like 6 buildings on every map, the rest is just empty space. #2 I'm pretty sure the skyscrapers are indestructible.

The game automatically takes you to the menu after the match. You cannot play the same lobby twice. You cannot join or create a squad. That's right, I'm not making that up.

This game has THE WORSE and MODT UNINTUITIVE UI screen to ever plague a video game.

I tried very hard to enjoy this game, but it just isn't possible. I want to ask for a refund because this doesn't feel like a finished product:

First of all, it is filled with all kinds of bugs and frequent crashes that make it very hard to even start a match.

Furthermore, there are VERY few weapons, gadgets and vehicles, and the progression system to unlock them is awful. It feels like it was made in less than a week, just take all the 22 weapons and spread them as rewards over the player levels.

For 90€, 3 years and 4 studios developing the game there are exactly: 2 LMG, 3 SR, 3 DMR, 4 AR, 4 SMG, 3 pistols and 3 shotguns, and that is at level 100 (70+ hours), so for a big part of the game you are limited to mostly 1 or (if you are lucky) 2 of any given weapon category.

There are only 7 maps and 2 main gamemodes, and the only way to play is to queue in one of the 2 modes and hope the matchmaking doesn't bug out (which happens very frequently, I may add). That's right, you can't even choose which map you want to play because there is no server browser. And every time you finish a match, you have to go back to the main menu and queue up again. That means that it is very possible to play on the same map multiple times in a row, while you haven't played on other maps even once.

I could keep going on things like how atrocious the flying physics are, the replacement of the traditional classes with specialists that no one asked for, the lack of an ingame scoreboard, how they removed the enemy chat and forced you to have a profanity filter always active, the terrible HUD and menus (seriously look at them and tell me how this resembles a AAA game that has had thousands of people working on it for 3 years and not a technical alpha for a random chinese copy of battlefield), etc... but I think this is more than enough to warrant a refund.

I’ll just talk about the bad things of the game
Take in mind i’m talking from an XSX user perspective

No campaign

Only 2 Game-modes, I’m not counting HazardZone cuz that crap is already dead

Portal servers are DogWater
Servers in general are a bit better but still crap
No Solo-CooP progression system

Progression in general is MEH, there is no much to unlock, and the few progression rewards you with crap cosmetics

FPS drop in consoles (at least in XSX & XSS)
Poor customization
Tons of bugs
Tons of visual errors
Pop-Up textures
Crap physics

And talking about physics…
Game has little to no destruction, that Battlefield essence is gone, but not only on the destruction area, overall in general game doesn’t feels like a Battlefield, it’s seems like if it’s just a forced attempt of copying CoD. No1 works as a team, everyone is playing for themselves, there’s no medics, and no supports, only ppl with missiles, and there’s another problem, VEHICLES ARE SO USELESS, as some1 who loves tanks from past BF games, I feel so betrayed; you can’t do a push cuz your tank will just get demolished. There’s also no manual repair, so u gotta wait and sit as an idiot just to get back in action.

Maps are huge for NO reason, and although you still find enemies, there are sectors that are forgotten, entires buildings that are forgotten, and most of the area of the maps are just a flat areas where nothing interesting goes on.

Tornados are such a dumb idea, and they are no game changing, they just pass by and no nothing.

Aiming and shooting feels like **** bullets start going in after the 3-4 shoot you hit & head damage multiplier is so broken.

One of the most common BF problems is camping, and in this game OH BOY; the situation is even worse and because of one thing; SPECIALISTS. WTF was DICE thinking when they add them? They make no sense, they not only take on slot gadget, slot that could’ve been used for people to have gadgets that actually complements the necessity of your team, but their abilities are so stupid.

And I could keep going but I’m just tired and pissed TBH. If you are new to BF, buying the game is 70% recommended, but don’t expect a show, and if you were looking for a BF3, BF4 or even BF1 experience, I’m sorry, but this ain’t the game. Collapse",3,4,6

This game doesn't have the same gritty feeling as all your other battlefield games have, hell I even installed Battlefield V yesterday just to see if I was being dramatic, and just playing the basic intro in Battlefield V got me 50 x more hyped for Battlefield V than 2042. Map doesn't become destroyed after a while of playing, it stays clean, you can choose between a couple of middle aged specialists instead of actual soldiers, which is dumb, half the players look the same and there's 128 of us.

The maps have barely any hiding spots, they're massive and open, and those maps that do have houses that you can enter are literally a copy paste of the same house scattered, most of the times it's even just a container that you can enter. There's not any levelution which is what made the other Battlefield games feel epic. Playing this game feels more like I'm playing Call of Duty on the same engine used in Battlefield 2, with basic destruction added to only those walls that have a concrete material on it.

There's a serious lack of weapons to choose from straight from launch, it's seriously disappointing and it kills any drive to play the game.

Audio quality, it honestly feels like the whole game was designed by a team that has never worked or played Battlefield before. Usually the audio quality, music, explosions, gun sounds and ambient sound has been very epic, like in Battlefield V. But this game is a serious let down when it comes to audio quality.

Menu feels very annoying to use, it's finnicky and looks like it was designed for an iPad. The audio when you hover over menu options is irritating as hell, for the first couple of hours I thought it was an audio bug but no the sound is just like that apparantly, ear raping.

I've put 31 hours into the game cause I desperately want to believe there is a hot patch coming to fix all the endless amounts of inbalance and bugs in this game, but I don't feel like that's going to happen anytime soon and I honestly wish I could just get my money back at this point. What you'll end up experiencing when playing this game is spawning in, getting spotted within the first second, getting ran over by a hovercraft that is indestructible somehow yet everyone has one. You'll get to level 20 after 20 hours of gameplay and unlock that gun you've wanted and then realize it's utter **** and you might as well just use an SMG cause you can kill anyone from anywhere across the map with that.

56,Battlefield 2042,mikelowreyatl,"Nov 15, 2021","I am so tired of game companies rushing out completely unfinished products and then spending the following year fixing things.

Where to start... I don't even know. I've been a fan of this franchise for 20 years, and this ain't it:

The UI is horrible. No Campaign. Lack of game modes. No hardcore. No military ranks associated with numerical ranks. Audio is poorly mixed. The maps, while stunning from both a scale and visuals perspective, lack any real flow for infantry combat. Non-removable profanity filter. Lack of promised destruction/levelution. Faction locked weapons and gadgets in Portal. No rule editor support for objective based game modes. No server browser outside of Portal. No private/rented servers. Doesn't just roll into the next map after a game in AoW, back to matchmaking peasant. Cannot join friends already in a match (pretty sure I could do this in beta??). Cutscenes all over the place. Cringe 'look at me' after a match. Cannot customize loadouts before joining a game. Cannot select loadout or operator before joining a server which, in certain situations, spawn you directly into the game with whatever you had last game. This happens when joining a fresh breakthrough game, mostly. No mouse and keyboard support for console. Options and description for kill sounds changed from beta. During beta it showed you would be able to choose between BF2042 and BF1 kill sounds. This same option now only lets you choose between BF2042 sounds or no sounds.

No VoIP. No real scoreboard. No stats page. No commander. Cannot join, create, or lock a squad. Cannot switch teams. Repairing vehicles does not give XP. No squad points for issuing orders or following them. No marksman headshot bonus for long range snipes. 'Assist Counts as Kill' has been removed. No vehicle kill assists.

Zoom issues with sniper scopes. No zeroing sniper scopes, starting scope (not sure about the others) has no hash marks on reticle for references. Biggest maps we've ever seen, highest scope magnification is 10x. No holding shift/stick click to steady a sniper shot. No leaning. 22 guns total lol. No ‘All’ chat. Enemies look the same as friendlies. Bullet spread / weapon inaccuracy outside of rock throwing range. Have to opt out of revive every death, no idea who can actually revive me anyway. Have to re-select spawn location every spawn. No resizable minimap. Cannot move while prone and ADS. Damage dealt numbers, e.g. ""VEHICLE HIT 28"" after hitting a tank with a rocket, have been removed. This applies to both infantry and vehicles. Weapons can't have different sets of attachments in different loadout presets. Meaning if you want to have a suppressor on the one semi-auto pistol in the game for one preset, you can't have it without a suppressor in your other presets. No fixed heavy weapons. AA rocket damage appears inconsistent. BF5 movement mechanics removed. Obnoxious voice overs, operators are incredibly vocal, every time you do an action they say a line. Melee takedown animations have been gutted. All enemies are brought to a standing position before one specific kill is performed. Cannot dive underwater. UI elements do not have transparency element and distant 2D/3D map markers and UI elements do not fade out by distance and cannot be scaled up or down. Good luck finding your marker on the map.

No separate Heli & Jet controls. Horizontal pitch (or yaw) when set to mouse movement is inverted by design and cannot be inverted again like vertical pitch can. So your aircraft goes the other way than your mouse does. No HOTAS support. Vehicle crosshairs are pixelated as hell. Vehicle entry and exit animations have been removed. Option for 'Vehicle Aim Relative Control' missing. Unnecessary changes to the aircraft flight characteristics from BF4 models. No maps with water and thusly no boats.. despite there being a big ass boat on the loading screen. Cannot tell if there is room to enter a friendly vehicle without trying to get in it. To elaborate, you used to be able to see (from both a reasonable distance and, if memory serves, from the spawn in screen) that 'That APC over there' had [2/4] under the driver's name... so you instantly knew that the main gunner seat was most likely occupied and there was no reason to get in unless you wanted to hitch a ride. When in tank, you don't have the little tank outline which tells you where the driver and gunner are looking at. On the spawn screen tanks/helis use the same icon, you simply cannot tell if that's a transport or attack heli that you are spawning into.

I don't even have room in this review to start talking about the bugs. I'm so tired of this. Do better DICE. Collapse",0,4,6

UI elements do not have transparency element and distant 2D/3D map markers and UI elements do not fade out by distance and cannot be scaled up or down
Obnoxious voice overs, operators are incredibly vocal, every time you do an action they say a line.
Spotting system is contextual and misses a lot of the time. For example if you press Q over an enemy tank it doesn't always spot it, but places a go-to marker on that area.
The team/squad order menu (or whatever it's called) is a pile of garbage. It covers the entire screen, it requires using the mouse to select the options, but not clicking on them for some reason, you have to depress Q. This needs to be redesigned into a friendlier and smaller semi-transparent wheel. Plus, it's not contextual at all and it doesn't seem to have an impact to other players, I requested ammo constantly and nobody even saw my request.

60,Battlefield 2042,Yeesh,"Nov 14, 2021","Been playing Battlefield since I was a little one back with BF1942. And this sure as heck is not a Battlefield game. The direction DICE took this game is so far from what Battlefield is that this game resembles CoD and Apex Legends more than it does BF. Maybe they are catering to a younger audience or something. Whatever the case the Battlefield franchise is for the worse with BF2042.

The maps are way, way too large for the player count. The increase in player count does not matter at all when the maps are absolutely enormous. There is little to no cover between objectives. Remember when you'd capture a point and head with your squad to another objective all stealthy like in the bushes or a trench? Yeah .. that does not exist in this game. At all. Due to the lack of any cover you pretty much spawn and die constantly.

I could go on and on with a list like how there's currently no voice chat, the horrible specialist system, complete void of any squad based gameplay, the lack of weapons, vehicles being truly overpowered, etc., etc., but I will not as there are many other reviewers that have covered that.

The game has tons of problems that have to be fixed as soon as possible before the players stop playing the game.

To enumerate a few:
1- Performance, even with a top tier machine, your fps is gonna be low.
2- No scoreboards.
3- No classes.
4- Level destruction is almost inexistence.
5- No server browser.
6- No global chat, not even a voice chat to talk with your squad.
7- No UI info like damage done to infantry/vehicles
8- Most of the time, allies cannot be revived.
9- The sound is non-existent, a tank can touch your back and you did not hear it.
10- The icons of the characters that have ammo or health to ask for are broken.
11- The TTK of some weapons is rare. You literally hear 2 bullets and you can't react, mainly from the smgs, they outperform assault rifles even at long ranges.
12- Ground vehicles can scale buildings and camp all the match just there.
13- Only 22 guns.
14- No way to join a specific squad, all you can do is leaving your squad and joining other random squad mid game. If your friend is in another squad, well, good luck.
15- Unlike other battlefields, you cannot enlarge the map.
16- You can not zoom the map so again, good luck selecting the right point to respawn (squad mate, point itself, spawn beacon etc)
17- Many of the weapon attachments do nothing and you have 4 or 5 that are just there for decoration.
18- Sometimes you can't aim down or up, just to the sides when you respawm.
19- Hitbox ghost
20- Player ghost, yep they can be invisible and even your teammates can spawn without the icon and looks like an enemy.

This game has potential, but I can't reasonably see it getting there for at least another year. It's absolutely mind blowing that this game was delayed for so long because they wanted to get it right, and yet, it's released in this abysmal state. It's both disappointing and frustrating.

I feel like BF2042 tried to do everything, and in its attempt, it failed at all of it.

Here is last nights experience (playing on Xbox Series X) just to sum it up:

-Playing online and getting wrecked by PC players.
-Find out that turning off crossplay is annoyingly difficult, but figured it out anyway.
-Find out that if you turn off crossplay, you can't find any matches. So I frustratingly turn it back on.
-Load into a game, find that I can't spawn.
-Finally mess around with stuff and then I can spawn, but find out that my loadouts are broken and I can't select a gadget.
-Spend the whole match without access to a gadget
-All of my customizations seem to disappear after every match
-Get frustrated with how buggy main game is so I switch to Portal and play the official BF 1942 type.
-BF 1942 in Portal is far worse. Buggier than that one dude in Men in Black.
-My tank's zoom sights are far to the left of where I'm actually firing, and they continually move around.
-Continually getting one-shot by assault rifles.
-Weapons randomly won't fire for some reason, or when they do, no bullets actually leave the weapon.
-Back in the tank, my tank shells keep getting blocked by invisible walls and the smallest of branches between tree's.
-Quit in frustration.

That's pretty much how this game goes.

No need for a full length review, Dice has devolved horribly since Battlefield 4, Battlefield 1 was great, V had some great mechanics but we were told ""Don't buy the game"" because we didn't like revisionist history, and 2042 is the pinnacle of failure that doesn't feel much like a battlefield anymore.

+ Poor frame rate w/ a 3080 and Ryzen 7 5800X

+ Having everything available to all classes defeats the purpose of classes! I have no idea who has ammo, med packs, etc… the class system was a stand out feature in BF!

+ Bugs everywhere… that’s what prompted me to write this…

+ Portal is good, but I bought BF2042 for a new BF experience.

+ Maps are too big for Conquest. There are fun moments, but it just feels empty. + Lack of basic features for an online multiplayer game. VOICE CHAT?! Come on!!! This is not an indie developer creating something from scratch!

+ No flight stick support

The list goes on and on. COVID was tough on everyone in a lot of industries, but if you’re going to sell something have some decency to be proud of it. AND LISTEN TO YOUR FANS. Collapse",2,2,3

Even with the double amount of players (from 64 up to 128) i have never felt this lonely in a Battlefield game. There is no (yes, really, NO!) interaction with your fellow team/squad mates which is just crazy considering the series past emphasis on teamwork and squadplay.

The bugs are game breaking (Stuck in revive mode, not being able to spawn, joining games that end within seconds, and so on).

The weapons all feel ""off"" when fighting over distances beyond 25 meters (In other words 99% of all firefights) and the guns simply don't hit where you are aiming.

The UI is impressive in its lack of intuition and just navigation around your loadouts is a challenge in itself. Want to have a clear and precise understanding of the battlefield through the UI? Well, your not getting it here, it is all kinds of cluttered and simply put awfully designed.

Lastly the crazy focus on ""operators"" and their cringy one-liners is just too much for me to handle. Hearing my character laughing and being ""sassy"" following a major battle with thousands of people dead is so stupid it hurts me physically.

There are so much more that i could say about my negative experience with this game but frankly i don't feel like wasting any more time on it. For more insight and guidance regarding the state of this game head over to reddit where all the games faults are brought into the light.

From a (former) die hard Battlefield fan, i really do NOT recommend anyone to buy this game in its current state. It is simply horrible and i encourage you to not repeat my mistake and buy this game, it is not worth your money or time, trust me.

20,Battlefield 2042,MajDroid,"Nov 14, 2021","My concern are not the bugs & issues, Battlefield in the first couple of months always had those, my biggest concern and disappointment is how much they damaged the core mechanics & formula of Battlefield that made it always stand out among competition.

Battlefield is about teamwork (and they did a great job with improving that to a great extent with BF5) but they decided to drop all of that, drop classes and turn it into mindless sandbox shooter and the mentality of lone-wolf rambos.

A good example on bad design, there's a gadget slot that let's you either choose a rocket launcher or repair torch, who would abandon rocket torch or ammo or health box in favor of repair torch?! So good luck finding anyone out there fixing your tank.
That's one example and i can count tons more (tanks controls feel bad and inferior to BF5, you feel like you continuously struggle with movement and inferior to BF5, maps way too open with no flow and feel soulless, everyone gets every weapons which makes everyone running around with 2 - 3 OP guns and ignoring everything else and damaging balance, dropped many great features from BF5 ....etc).

Everyone was hoping for modern warfare game built on the great elements brough in BF5 with the setting of BF4/BF5 and they promised that they will listen to the community and work with them yet we got a Frankenstein monster that feels too chaotic, flat without any tactical depth and all just about running as a lone-wolf and shooting anything that moves with no sense to overall progress of the battle.

I, as a huge Battlefield fan since BF1942, am extremely disappointed with the outcome and it's obviously we veterans or longtime fans are no longer Dice's target audience and they're attempting to attract the audience of other games making the game feel like COD:MW Ground War 2.0. Collapse",2,2,3

I won't list them, you can find that info all over. The game has been buggy and difficult to play. It performs poorly on even high-end PCs.

Aside from the missing basic features and bugs, there is a general lack of content. Battlefield 3's DLC ALONE offered more content than all of Battlefield 2042 has.

This feels like a game that was not developed to be a Battlefield game, but was switched back at the last minute. I am not sure the Dev's have played a past Battlefield game. Sure doesn't feel like it.

The Portal mode is the only saving grace and is a cool concept, so that's why they still get 2 points from me here.

While my server issues have minimal at best, the gun gameplay is not enjoyable. They increased the player size and the map scale, but the maps feel too big and empty. Overall, the game has lost its charm and character, and what we were given to play seems to fall short compared to other Battlefield titles.

I don't recommend this Battlefield 2042 its current state, as it needs many more months, if not years, of development time.

Leaving bugs aside as I feel those are unavoidable with software this advanced.

Guns don't do enough damage and/or time to kill (TTK) is just inconsistent.
The sound effects, foot steps, and overall environment SFX is just lackluster and missing something.
Limited immersion maps are too big even for 128, not enough game modes out of the box (yes I know portal..)
No squad voice chat.
The specialist just don't work, it's like large scale Apex legends without the stakes or impact. They load out system further pushes players to build for themselves and not team comp that changes as the match goes on.
The gun play doesn't feel good at all and is completely inconsistent as well as there being an extremely limiting amount. I'm willing to bet that's so they can excite people with new weapon delivery releases similar to BFV etc..
There's no scoreboard so there's no incentive to have top score or perform. I get toxicity avoidance but score board helps motivate squads to get those extra points as a squad to be the top not just kill farmers!

Portal is just a watered down version of the previous games with a crap engine. I'd rather just go play them? I hope this helps I think it has alot of potential but right now underwhelming.

- constant bugs and glitches even though better then the beta make the game unplayable at time

-inconsistent frame rates even with 3090s and 2080 it GPUs

-lack of a consistent time to kill, some times and enemy will take 8-10 shots some times 4-5 not to mention the inconstancy in how damage received is felt, some time you die instantly other time you get shot 4-8 times and wonder how your not dead

-lack of enough vehicles, the maps are so huge the fights so far away that these are the only way to have fun most of the time, instead you are getting shot running to A1 through miles no mans land

-you have no idea who gives out or can do what do to specialists

-said specialists look the same on both teams
{i know they added tiny red lights but it doesn't fix the issue)

-cannot host severs if you make one and leave is goes away

-no server browser for AoW the freaking primary mode taking away player choice

-no scoreboard

In a live multiplayer environment your character will load in - then do a non-cancelable weapons check/reload animation where you are completely exposed- and if in a high-populated area, not have any time to react to prone enemies and die/repeat the whole thing again. The Ui is a mess. it's confusing, disorganized, and trying to find even a loadout option is fumbling in the dark with no explanation.

The worst feeling is being a medic. As opposed to tossing unlimited packs that still allowed you to have a gun handy- like every predecessor before it, you're left with a Dart gun of sorts, with terrible XP rewards on use (5? 5?!), on top of healing ammo restriction, and god help you if anyone shows up while you're trying to lend a support hand. Because you have to swap weapons to save yourself, you're guaranteed to die trying to heal teammates while fumbling back to a gun - all for almost zero XP to even show for it. This leads to everyone haphazardly running around firing as best they can, with no strategy, no support, and no point at the end of the match.

Since classes or teamwork in squads don't seem to matter, it's sort of a ""every man for themselves"" mentality which- you may as well go to a Battle royale type for that, versus a 20+ minute conquest match where no one really seems to give a damn.

I'm glad I got the game pass free 10hr run at this because if anything, after 5 hours it's made me appreciate BF5 all the more, and I'll return to that. Politely, I will hope some things can be tweaked because... Oof. Am I disappointed. Collapse",2,2,3

49,Battlefield 2042,Asleader12,"Nov 14, 2021","Gonna keep it simple. Worst Battlefield Game in the Franchise History. Heck Hardline was way better

In typical Dice and EA fashion instead of building upon the foundation of the last 2 titles, they decided to reinvent the wheel for everything.
Here is the list of systems redesigned again

- Shooting system…clunky and horrible
- Sniping. Absolutely horrible compared to BFV or BF1
- Movement. Feels like an Indie title especially coming from the amazing system in BFV
- Destruction. Sad to see but scripted and boring.
- UI and HUD. Worst UI in history of gaming, horrible is in every possible way. Confusing, inefficient and doesn’t work on PC or Console. A shadow of the decent UI in the previous titles.
- Maps. Lifeless, boring, thoughtless just a bunch of random areas chosen for maps.
- Specialists. Completely ruined teamwork, balance.
- Factionless. WHY this is not 6v6 tdm its 64vs64 u need factions…u need a story…u need a plot or the game feels pointless.
- Portal…love story my ass. Fun for now, boring in a few weeks.
- Weapons… a far cry from other games. Go look at Vanguard or MW 2019 and compare it to the basic, first draft of weapon animations in this game.
- Audio…guns sound horrible. Overall ambiance sounds Flat and again lifeless. Footsteps either super quiet or u hear everything from 300 meters away.

Legit DICE took everything they improved and developed with the community for the last 6 years and threw it all in the trash. This game is absolute **** Collapse",0,2,3
50,Battlefield 2042,hlewis899,"Nov 14, 2021","The game came out completely undercooked and uninspired. A graphical improvement over Battlefield 3 & 4, but a step down from 5 & 1. Game could potentially be fun if it wasn’t rife with bugs that make the game unplayable. Gun variety is laughable for a modern FPS (especially with the Battlefield title), and the agents are lifeless and incredibly generic. Just go play one of the older titles.",1,2,3
51,Battlefield 2042,Frozburn,"Nov 14, 2021","This game is absolutely terrible. Forget about the **** map design or any other issue for a moment. The performance of this game alone makes this game a 2/10. A 5900x and a 3080 can't even run this game well enough. It lags too much, choppy... terrible gunplay (the gunplay in the beta was way better)

Portal is a gimmick, no scoreboard, terrible sounds, terrible voices (the specialists) and the specialist system just doesn't fit Battlefield anyway. It's like they copied everything from every other game and hoped that it would work out for them. The game feels soulless, the immersion is completely gone (compared to every other BF game, especially BF1) - there's no ambient noise to make you feel like you're in a war. The music is also terrible. No idea what they were thinking with that one. No server browser, no enemy chat (can only type to your team) can't even create squads in-game. Can't swap squads. There's only like 4 viable weapons. The UI is terrible. Tanks have some sort of input lag that magically goes away if you use your zoom but if you remove zoom optics it's so unresponsive. Very bad air physics. Jets are useless. No TV missile for choppers (not even for Portal BF3), no ECM? No APS? No Reactive Armor? Smoke in AOW on tanks lasts like 4 sec and recharges in 30? What is this game?

Anyone looking to buy this game - just don't. Maybe in a year it might be worth it but even if they fix the performance (doubt it), the bad decisions won't be fixed (massive core gameplay issues) and the terrible map design. A running simulator.

See you on the next Battlefield. Collapse",1,2,3
52,Battlefield 2042,fameofthewolf,"Nov 15, 2021","Played all BFs and all CODs since the very first ones.

This game is without a single doubt in my mind, the WORST BF.

This game is clearly in actual Beta and should not have been released but they did it anyway. It is the most riddled with bugs AAA game i have ever played on top of servers not working.

They completely stripped it of typical features, server browser, classes, voice chat, ability to change squads, low selection of weapons, inconsequential loadouts(you can equip any attachment at any time), and any other game modes besides Conquest and Breakthrough. Hope you didnt like smaller map playlists without vehicles cause thats completely gone. Have you ever heard of games taking away features for no good reason? No because most devs arent brainless.

This is on top of awful game design, pacing is simply terrible because of the huge maps, you run for 5 minutes from point to point hoping you dont get sniped or vehicle killed before you even get a chance to engage anybody because the maps are huge swaths of open area. And you mostly do get sniped or killed by a vehicle so youre spending 10 min just to get to a point on Conquest and you trade kills and then you start the cycle over again. It is atrocious. They have learned nothing from other shooters on the market.

The current DICE devs dont know how to design a good BF experience, and thats a fact. You know its a huge red flag when they stripped a bunch of features and dont QA their product properly.

CoD releases games every year and while they may not be perfect, have never been as god awful as this BF. BF 2042 has been in development for over 3 years, and this is the best they can do with EA funding. Collapse",0,2,3
53,Battlefield 2042,caatalyst07,"Nov 15, 2021","Fan of the series, started playing BF1942 as a kid and sunk thousands of hours into every subsequent game until BF1. I still jump into BF4 from time to time but have moved on to play a lot more survival focused games like Dayz and Tarkov.

I was looking forward to playing 2042 a great deal as I’d missed the previous two instalments as I wasn’t looking for a historical experience. I preferred the BF4 arsenal, weapon modifications and progression that came with it. I was also looking forward to having a more casual shooter to jump into.

I pre-ordered the gold edition and played the open beta. Refunded now.

2042 feels like multiple game studios were working on multiple games within the same engine and tried to cobble them together with very little time or thought about synergy. It feels like the starting point was “How can we make battlefield appeal to BR and survival trends” rather than “how can we improve and innovate the battlefield experience”. The game is riddled with technical and design issues as a result of trying to appeal to too many audiences. Some can be band aided but a lot of them are deep rooted into the game which would require an enormous amount of work and balls on EA/DICE’s part to fix which I just don’t think we will see. DICE used to set the trends with Battlefield and this is what I was hoping for. A Battlefield game that new its strengths and built on them further for the next generation of hardware.

Ultimately the game lacks passion and soul, like it was built exclusively to try and compete for current trends but as always EA/DICE were late to the party and executed their strategy poorly leaving a lack luster product that is an okay experience at best.

Highlights:

1) Menu and UI is frustrating at best, infuriating at worst.
2) Weapons and customisation is barebones. Step backwards from previous titles
3) Weapons and customisation offer no real gameplay changes or value.
4) Weapons feel terrible to shoot due to weapon spread
5) Animations often feel cheap and whacky like a F2P BR game
6) Specialists were clearly built for hazard zone and band aided into all out war creating a poor and unimmersive experience
7) Specialists are goofy, cheesy and cheapen the whole experience with tacky one liners
8) Graphics, especially the maps just feel like a step backwards
9) Performance on a 3070 / i9900k was inconsistent, barely hitting around 60-70 fps
10) Tons of UI elements missing like score boards, squad changing, server browser
11) Spend more time in menus watching cheesy tacky animations whilst waiting to get in games
12) Portal was sold as the saving grace but ultimately falls flat due to lack of customisation and bare content

If you’re a fan of the battlefield formula then I cannot recommend this title at release. A huge disappointment. Collapse",3,2,3

-Классы - теперь просто для вида -Ужаснейшая оптимизация (гораздо хуже, чем у киберпанка на релизе)
-Разрушений стало меньше, чем в прошлых частях БФ

Then if you're lucky and don't have an error at this point, you get a 30 second count down, followed by a movie intro to the map you're on.

27,Battlefield 2042,TheLoneOnion,"Nov 15, 2021","I was really excited for this game, but unfortunately I just cant bring myself to recommend it to anybody. Currently as I write this review all the servers are bugged and stuck in a never ending overtime ( Joined 6 servers in a row , all bugged )

The entire operator system is garbage and clearly only put into the game to sell skins, which is pathetic. Also the games story makes no sense, why are we all ""no pats"" when in multiplayer its RUSSIA VS AMERICA. Like are the countries powerful enough to attack other foreign nations but not powerful enough to have their own militaries, but apparently have enough money to hire an ARMY of personal mercenaries? Those mercenaries that get dropped off by ACTUAL soldiers? Also it looks REALLY stupid when you're fighting a team with the exact same operators as yours. *slow clap* And on a side note the AI soldiers all look way cooler than any of the operators, which is also pathetic on its own.

Weapon variety is awful and for some reason DICE thought it was a good idea to give each weapon less attachments than their previous games, and this is clearly only because they have to work around their stupid switch attachments on the fly system which only allows you to have 4 different attachment types ( looking at vanguard you can have 8 to 10 on each gun, AND THEYRE WORLD WAR 2 GUNS FFS ), which that in its own makes literally zero sense. LIke yeah in the middle of a firefight I'm just going to swap out my optics, ammo type, and barrel in 2 seconds. yup.

There are only TWO game modes for the main game. Conquest, which is just a hot mess with the map size and player count, and breakthrough, which just divulges into a zerg in between the attacking points/ Why have such a HUGE map but focus all the fighting into a small area?

There is NO voice chat, at all, which is a BIG LMAO. There is no actual scoreboard, because reasons?

The gunplay is just terrible. Hit Reg is pretty much non existent, and you better hope you NEVER have to fire your gun while moving because apparently any sort of movement turns your gun barrel into a piece of limp spaghetti because your bullets just decide to go everywhere but where you're aiming. The gun spread in portal is its own disaster but to save a paragraph, just think 2042 but worse :)

Hovercraft....I'm convinced they just didn't do any internal testing because if they did they would have realized that the hovercraft can literally climb the sides of skyscrapers and fly through the air.

The game is clearly unfinished, clearly a cash grab, and clearly broken. I paid 158 Canadian ( after tax ) for the ultimate edition. This game is NOT worth even a quarter of that. Why did DICE decide this game was ready for release when it clearly isn't?

On a side note, Hazard Zone clearly received little to no love and is probably just going to end up like firestorm ( received pretty much no marketing at all other than that AWFUL trailer, and the game is out in 4 days ) I'm quite confident its just going to end up being Firestorm 2.0, abandoned and forgotten as if it were never part of the game at all. Which is sad because it seems that any time DICE tries to do ANYTHING unique, they just fail. They couldn't even copy hunt showdown or Tarkov properly. Hazard Zone is what I was most excited for and seeing how bare bones and unfinished it is just hurts.

33,Battlefield 2042,G1zm0666,"Nov 15, 2021","Worst battlefield launch in the history of the franchise.

I would give it a 1 just for the graphics.

Main problems:

1. Insanely clunky UI - the social tab, the T menu - don't get me started.
2. Performance - playing with 5900x and 3080 GPU i have inconsistent frame rates, some hard drops during firing that make it really hard to hit.
3. Attack of the clones - everyone is the same character and its hard to tell teams
4. Portal - I was counting on this mode being the saving grace for this game but sadly, it inherits many bugs from the core game - such as weird bloom in gunplay, super clunky UI etc.
5. Portal doesn't have any progression - so the very limited selection of guns is already unlocked at start with all their attachments.
6. Portal progression seems to affect the main level - but it was immediately nerfed after launch since DICE can't be bothered to QA the game to find exploits pre launch.
7. Impossible to join friends on the main game modes - i tried several times - the result is that I get queue for the server, when it finishes it says party leader selecting mode and goes back to main menu.
8. Impossible to join more than 3 friends - currently its only possible to join 3 friends (even though it doesn't work for me at all), so if your clan has 5 or more tough luck - you will play on different servers.
9. No scoreboard - kind of kills a lot of the gameplay satisfaction.
10. Sound is terrible - something that for me was a staple of battlefield games is just horrible, its super silent although things are going on around you, and footsteps sound like they are on top of you even though they can be many meters away.
11. Maps - there is much less detail in the new maps - very little unique stuff, usually large empty areas and some copy pasted empty buildings around objectives.
None of the new objectives seem to create memorable or interesting combat loops, unlike most maps in BF4.
Seems to me they were created in a hurry without passion or much thought.
12. Specialists gameplay - once most people reached around level 25 you start seeing the asian chick with the scan wallhack ability all the time - this kills any tactical gameplay.
Other operators are quite bland, most people below 25 will play Falck for self healing and nice XP farm for revives- can be bundled with ammo pack for maximum farm.
13. No squad menu - cant swap squads in game - cant reassign leader etc. - kinda kills the experience as you get randomly assigned to a squad at the start of the map - add to that that after every match the previous squad gets replaced so it is always a coin toss.
14. Guns - they seem really inconsistent - there is some weird bloom going on - sometimes the guns are laser accurate and sometimes they are not, can't say if its a bug or not, add to that the net code is quite crappy so its very hard to hit people at range.
15. Snipers - since there isn't a real penalty for recon kit - as you can take any gun with any gadgets there are loads of snipers and marksman everywhere, consider that as I said most maps are large and empty aside from some buildings at objectives this makes it sniper heaven.
16. No server browser or private servers - technically there is 1 for portal but not for the main game, this was a staple of battlefield because you would find a nice server you liked and keep returning to it everyday and get to know the admins and players - form a small community.
17. No all chat - this game tries to cater to snowflakes, I suspect that the similarly to YouTube removing dislikes, DICE removed all chat and scoreboard to avoid people getting their feeling hurts.

Almost everywhere I look there is a big issue or step backwards.

As a fan of the franchise that owns all BF games I'm sorely disappointed and feel cheated for buying this game - especcially at a premium to get early access.

If the rumors are true and there is indeed a day 1 patch that will release at the end of early access it would be doubly disappointing.

I played the BETA and really enjoyed it, knowing that it was an older build, and happy in the fact that DICE had confirmed that near all the issues with the BETA had been resolved in the release version.

Unfortunately, the release version is a massive step down from the BETA version for me, for a number of reasons:

Scoreboard - there isn't one. DICE don't want you feeling bad if you have a poor k/d, therefore they're not going to show you a scoreboard where you can compare your stats to anyone elses. This also means you can't see if anyone has been cheating/hacking and has a 120 k/d ratio. You can't hack on console you say - well see the second dot point.
Forced cross-play on xbox, with zero console aim assist to combat it. You can't turn cross-play off on Xbox. 90% of the people you come up against are on PC and you just can't compete against m&k when there's no aa to help. You could turn cross play off in the BETA, but they've disabled that in the actual release - now you can only turn it off in the xbox settings and it's buried (hidden) 5 layers deep in the settings, and it also means that you can't cross-play in any other games once you've disabled it.
Loadout issues - so you play to level up your character and your guns, but the funny thing is 9 times out of 10 the loading screen is broken and you can't actually choose what guns you want to play with, so you load in with the basic first assault rife the game gives you, without any attachments that you've opened up and also no gadgets to use. You can't change this in-game. You're stuck with that gun and no gadgets unless you pick up someone elses gun off the ground.
No server select - in the all out war (standard conquest) mode, you can only press play, and you have to trust the system to place you in a game. You don't know where that server is and based on the lag, the system doesn't care if it places you in an oceanic one, a US or European one etc. Once you're in a server, you don't know where it is located. You also don't know what map you're loading into, and how far along that game is. It also doesn't keep you in that server. Once a map is finished you're booted back to the main menu to find a new game, which could be the same map, and also another game that's close to finishing.
Errors - tonnes of them. I couldn't play much at all on Saturday as the game just errored out trying to enter any game mode.
The characters - although I'm not a fan of the specialists, I don't mind them so much, but some of them are just game breaking and 90% of people are using the broken ones, such as the one that gives out free armour plates. You're forced to use him also, due to the unfairness of having to constantly fight people with 20 more HP than you.
Removed all aspects of team play.
The gunplay - random at best. There's bloom on all guns and it's a flip of the coin as to whether your bullets hit their target or not. Gun fights aren't won by skill, they're won by chance to give those that aren't great a fighting chance.
The maps - some are gorgeous and look incredible. But they are also lifeless as they are just too big. Some of them have next to zero cover and you just spawn in the middle of an open desert, then are forced to watch a gun chambering animation before moving - usually by that time you've been shot.
Portal is amazing, although I wouldn't know it as about 80% of portal games error out for me. Also, DICE have made it so you can barely level up anything when playing portal (levelling is severely capped) to combat idiots that have filled the portal servers with farm xp game modes (AI with 10 health and no weapons).
I could go on about the no chat, small amount of weapons available, and the general unfinished and broken aspects of the game, but that's plenty for now. Like I said - I'm a massive BF fan and I've been waiting for this game for years. Disappointed is an understatement - maybe in 6 months it might be worth playing. Until then, save your cash if you were on the fence. Collapse",0,2,4
45,Battlefield 2042,Chip229,"Nov 14, 2021","This is without a doubt the worst game I have ever played. The visuals are worse than battlefield 4 (2014) and performance is terrible on high capacity machines. Plethora of missing features that were included from previous games. There are only TWO game modes to play, with less than twenty weapons total. The gun play is absurd, and this is an FPS. The game has absolutely no polish and even basic functions like customizing your load out are filled with bugs. Collapse",1,2,4
46,Battlefield 2042,punisherer,"Nov 14, 2021","What a terrible game.
Its unfinished.
Has tons of bugs, crashes constantly.
No scoreboard, ea/origin/steam integration sucks.
Limited weapons, pinned 100% cpu usage.

Per reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield2042/comments/qs5gh9/a_list_of_issues_with_battlefield_2042_and_what/

1) No Scoreboard - No scoreboard means you can't tell who's hacking, can't tell if the teams are balanced, can't see how many bots there are in your lobby, can't see everyone's ranks/levels, can't see everyone's stats and comparing yourself and your squad to everyone else, can't see latency of everyone in the match, can't see overall score, and can't see how many different classes are being played. The players have everything to lose when there is no scoreboard, yet EA/DICE have everything to gain. If you care about your community and respect us as dedicated fans of this series, you will bring back at least this one feature.

2) No scoring system - We've had a scoring system in Battlefield for many years now, yet such a system does not exist in BF2042. Shooting at enemy players does not rack up any score points, throwing ammo/meds or doing repairs doesn't rack up score points. Capturing objectives, playing as a squad, marking objectives, spotting enemies, etc, all of these do not rack up any score. All we get now is a basic XP system that cannot be shown or displayed to anyone. You cannot compare your score with people on your own team, let alone the enemy team. The removal of the scoring system plus the removal of the scoreboard both contribute to the lack of competitiveness that the franchise has been known for. Remember the days where you were at the top of the scoreboard with 0 kills but the most revives/heals? Say goodbye to that.

3) No stats page - So we have no scoreboard, no scoring system, and also...no stats page. We cannot even see our own progression and stats in the game. Remember the Battlelog days where we can see so many detailed stats and also compare with other users? Well we hit rock bottom.

4) No server browser - When you thought it couldn't get even worse, it just did. BF2042 has no server browser, you matchmake like you do in Call of Duty. We cannot manually select/search for games, we have to just use the matchmaking system that does the search for us. This is taking power away from players for no good reason. This opens the door for SBMM/EOMM becoming a thing which is a major red flag. It gets worse.

5) Players do not carry over to next match, lobby disbands - Out of all the things EA/DICE could take from Modern Warfare, they took one of the worst things ever introduced, which was lobby disbandment. When a match is over, everyone is thrown back to the main menu, you get no chance to rematch the players you just played with. The older CoD and BF games all kept the same players for the next map, meaning you could play with the same players match after match. You cannot do that anymore as the system now forces everyone to disband immediately after the post-match screen. Needless to say, but this kills what little sense of community this game had left. Well done. Collapse",1,2,4
47,Battlefield 2042,Kipp14,"Nov 15, 2021","This game is rushed, nothing is on point (lack/remove of animation, you can’t dive underwater , you can’t lean, no with explosion,… Destruction is a totally joke, remember their video showing a big skyscraper falling down for the next battlefield ? It’s was only for a demo, because in the game it’s only big regular square and almost no destruction at all even on small building.

UI the designer of this **** need to be fired, the menu are a mess, the setting are a mess, you can’t even play another game it’s bring you back to the menu. Seriously dude did you design a mobile game ?

Lack of content, no solo, 23 guns, less vehicle and bots and only 2 modes for 2042 (with almost no balancing). I mean 3 years and 4 studios to have that kind of game is really laughable, dice from 2010 did better than this.

No naval warfare, no boats is that The bugs , yea 10 thousands of bugs And the best removing all aspect of battlefield game, no scoreboard , no voice chat, no able to choose squad, no team play.

There is nothing that saves this game. It has lost its roots, has become worse in any aspect compared to any of the previous tittles. The main problem is not this game, is what they have done to the franchise and how unlikely I see that they do something to regain my trust or any other Battlefield fan ever.

57,Battlefield 2042,iamagamerbro,"Nov 16, 2021","2042 alienates part of Battlefields core player base. The inclusion of Portal doesn't go far enough to make up for their changes in fundamental gameplay. It's bad enough that it carries over into portal making it an unclean experience. Portal doesn't feel like battlefield either. It feels like I'm playing a different game that copied battlefields maps. The maps look great even though they aren't faithful recreations. It just doesn't play right.

The battlefield series has always had this magical feeling of being a military sim and an arcade game in one making it easily accessible. You could jump on the game and act like a complete idiot and have a lot of fun or you could go sweaty, get your adrenaline pumped up, and compete for top spot while trying not to throw your keyboard through your monitor. Hell, you could even do both at the same time. However, the sim stuff was never **** with. It would draw you in and get your heart racing as you battled your way through the maps. Everything felt proper.

As a competitive player the only thing that kept me playing was the need to get good enough to place in a decent position to be able to enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played because I was really bad at it when I started. While I don't mind people running around acting like idiots because I do it myself, I don't want to loose what has kept me drawn to battlefield for the last 15 years.

With 2042 they threw the simulation and competition out the window. It's all play and little work. I can't take this factionless, classless, scoreboard less, stat less, XP exploitable, moon vehicle physics, 3rd person takedown piece of **** seriously. The realism is gone, The Competition is gone. It's 100% an arcade game with few military sim features now. They have changed the fundamentals of battlefield and screwed up features that have been in the ENTIRE battlefield series.

Well, the reactions on the released game now show how ""smart"" EA really is. The have launched another gigantic flop.

90,Battlefield 2042,OnlyTheTruth,"Nov 14, 2021","The worst battlefield i have ever played.

Completely stripped of all emotion and features to make room for a notyet implemented heavy monetization system. This game is barebones to the maximum with only 22 guns in the main mode and 7 maps. The maps might be big, but they are empty as **** and not fun to fight on as infantry. Since all teamplay features have been removed anyways, even specialist follow the design philosophy of solo play. All of them are selfish as **** and there is little incentive to be a team player with the lack of rewards for actually helping other players.
Vehicles are both **** to control and hilariously busted. Why does a ****ty hoverboat out of rubber take 5 antitank rounds to destroy, when it can move at mach 5 while ignoring gravity (see a video of it climbing buildings in hourglass). All vehicles regen health passively, there is pretty much no risk of dying if you have higher IQ than room temperature.

Hazard zone is just a barebones spin on battle royale. Expect it to be dead quicker than BFV firestorm. Portal is cool, but the laggy ass movement of 2042 exists in portal aswell. The guns also suffer from the same random inaccuracy as the base version guns. With only 2 maps of each respective omage game. It's really not enough to save the package.

The game runs like absolute dog**** even on a 3080 / r5 5600x setup. It's buggy, laggy and the hitreg is busted.

SKIP THIS GAME. Maybe buy it in 2 years if it's playable, but so many core features are either missing or fundamentally ****ed up. I doubt Dice will ever be able to make this game actually decent, like they eventually managed with BFV. BFV might not be perfect, but it still miles ahead of this soulless ****heap of a game.

Empty maps with 4-5 buildings thousand steps apart and that's the map design for all of the maps and you know what even they are optimised extremely poorly and this games shows that there was lowest effort put in the map design, i wouldn't even call it a design a kid draws better maps with his toys then this AAA title. Gun play is not so bad but it doesn't feel like I am playing a bf game.

Maps are too big, air vehicle are not fun their main gun are terrible and the visibility is none, guns are not pleasant to use, the game runs like ass on all but two main game maps (all Portal maps run great), orbital is fine, the beta seems to have given them the time to optimize it, but that's it, the game was not a month from being done, it is not an other, it's a year from being done.

Classic modes in portal are really good though, I give points to the game for it, but they just took the best maps on the best modes of the best games so that was expected, but to me, those old games should not be shelved like that when they are still great to play but have no official support, no moderation, no true vanilla experience, so we have to play on awful private servers to play there. It makes me tired of giving money to EA and Dice.

C'est n'est pas un Battlefield, on ne peu pas appeler cela un AAA. Graphismes décevants, une très mauvaise optimisation ! (Entre 70 e 90FPS avec une RTX3080 - Intel Core i9 10900F - 32Go RAM) -

Des cartes plus que vident, un level design honteux, une hitbox, netcode complètement foireux - Des équilibrages armes, véhicules, codés au hasard (4 roquettes pour un aéroglisseur, qui oneshot tout ce qui passe, sérieux ?). Pas de scoreboard, Pas de classes, pas de destruction, des serveurs à la ramassent (rollback fréquents), pas de stats, pas de chat pour discuter avec les joueurs adverses ?

15,Battlefield 2042,Keksiq,"Nov 14, 2021","Это самая худшая часть серии Battlefield, В игре напрочь отсутствует оптимизация, у меня RTX 3060 и i9 10850 игра выдают на самым минимальных настройках графики от 60-100 фпс. Причем в этой игре напрочь отсутствует какая-либо графика, все текстуры зданий глиняные и пустые, техника выглядит ужасно, модели персонажей смотрятся неправдоподобно они совсем не смогли в пропорции человека, персонажи выглядят как спички.
Теперь про геймплей: В это просто невозможно играть, оружие стреляет куда угодно, но только не в точку в прицеле, ттк сломано полностью, все бегают с дмрками, просто потому что она убивает за 0.5 секунды, когда любая ar убивает за 2 секунды и это только в том случае если вы мастер аим. Танки и машинки - физика вождения в этой игре в миллион раз хуже чем в киберпанке 2077, в иной раз лучше бежать пешком, чем садиться за руль. Ах да, камера от 3 лица внутри техники, кто это делал - его надо уволить и запретить создавать игры, более неудобной камеры не было ни в 1 игре в которую я когда-либо играл.
Оружие в этой игре создавал какой-то клоун, некоторые оружие настолько сломаны в плане геймлпея и ттк, что с остальным бегать даже не захочется (это я про дмр).
Карты: Как можно было сделать настолько плохие карты, они полностью пустые, у тебя есть огромные опен-филды и точки захвата, по сути все, никаких объектов помогающие пехоте хоть как-то передвигаться ничего этого нет ни на одной из карт, ты просто бежишь по пустому полю до точки, потом снова от точки до точки через огромное пустое пространство. Это прям очень плохо, я играл в бф3, бф4, бф хардлайн, бф1 и таких плохих карт никогда не было, к тому же как я и сказал ранее все текстуры в игре просто ужасны.
Регистрация попаданий - работает сама по себе, ты можешь убить выпустив 5 пуль, а можешь и не убить за все 30 стоячего человека.
Режимы игры:
Портал лично мне абсолютно не зашел, бф 1942 вообще не играбельный режим как по мне, бф bad company туда же и bf 3 с картой граница каспия, из-за плохой регистрации попаданий, из-за плохой физики игры, из-за ужасно сделаной физики броска чего-либо (гранат, патрон и т.д.)
играть в эти режимы даже не хочется.
Hazard zone - режим игры полностью копирующий игру The division 2, мы с друзьями сыграли 10 матчей сделали стрик из 6 побед и больше в него заходить не хотим. Он сделан очень плохо: во-первых количество реальных игроков удручает, 32 человека это оооооочень мало, если вам повезет то вы встретите 3 отряда людей за игру, но в большинстве случаев, вы находите 1-2 и на этом все, вы просто убиваете ботов десятками.
Режим совсем не заставляет тебя искать данные, вы можете победить так и не подобрав ни 1 флешки, денег вы получите все равно много.
Игра совершенно не стоит своих денег, все кто говорят обратное, наверное сами-то и не играли.

The gunplay in the game feels like a complete after thought. Half the time, it’s difficult to tell if shots should be landing or if the game has poor hit registration. Maps are huge…and open. Very open. You spend far too much time traveling to the action, often traversing dangerous open ground in the process. Gun balance is all over the place with SMGs outclassing ARs, snipers reigning king with the open map design and DMRs being the most situational of weapons. Game runs poorly on PC. So, there’s that. This could’ve been something to look over if the core gameplay was engaging, but its not. Its more frustrating than anything else. Bottom line: gun fights feel like they’re decided by the toss of a coin, and the maps don’t offer much by way or tactical depth. When you’re not running the length or Caspian Border to get into position, each experience really just feels like a mindless mosh pit. No doubt some may be enthralled about the this.

42,Battlefield 2042,bishnold,"Nov 15, 2021","After the launch of BFV I was resolved not to buy another BF game at release. Instead I got a 10h trial with the Xbox Game Pass to check it out and boy am I glad I did. I am pretty sure they were developing some battle royale monstrosity and changed their mind mid development, leaving 2042 with a confused design that feels crudely mashed together. There is a lack of harmony between practically every element of the game. Before you even get into a match you are left frustrated by the atrocious menus which feel like they were designed for mobile or consoles.

The settings menus are disorganized and hard to read.
The multiplayer menus are devoid of functionality.
There is no server browser, only matchmaking. The ONLY option you get is the gamemode, and those are distinctly lacking compared to previous games.
You can't choose what region to play in or an acceptable ping.
You can't choose what map you want to play on—you get thrown into a random map and can end up playing the same map several times before you get what you want.
There are only two main gamemodes.
When the round ends you get booted to the main menu, but not before the game forces you to wait through multiple post-match filler screens and cheesy Overwatch ""hero"" style one liners.
There is no classic scoreboard so you can't see ping, K/D, classes, number of players, etc.
You can't change teams.
You can't join, create, lock or kick from squads.
You can't chat to the other team and the chat box is so tiny your messages get hidden.
The specialist/class system is nonsensical and has no rock/paper/scissor style tradeoffs with their weapons/equipment.
There are very few guns and hardly any equipment to choose from.
Specialists have absurdly broken special abilities like the wingsuit that can cover huge distances or the gizmo for hacking aircraft.
Despite the maps being gigantic the guns have absurd random spread that makes medium to long distance engagements a diceroll.
There is no xp incentive given for teamwork as in previous games.
Range of movement is a downgrade from BFV with multiple features like crouch-running missing.
Despite the lacklustre graphics the performance is ABYSMAL, even on new high end hardware on low settings.
Rough releases are common for BF games but this is something else—I don't believe it is salvageable with the effort Dice are likely to invest in it. It COULD be fixed, but it is not likely to be.

Battlefield 2042 was revealed to the world in form of a bombastic trailer that got everybody and their loved ones hyped up to no end, until the absolute **** disaster that the Open Beta dropped.

""Calm down dude, it's only a 3 month old build, the final release will be MUCH better and more polished"", the people defending this inexcusable garbage said. So how did this excuse hold up? ABSOLUTE ****

This game does NOT feel like Battlefield but rather a bastardized mutant stitched together out of Call of Duty, Apex and a few aspects of Battlefield. Let me remind you this game was supposed to copy MW 2019 and was not even intended to be a proper Battlefield from the get-go.

Furthermore this abomination disguised as a final release lacks BASIC features in any FPS like a **** scoreboard (not a joke), voice chat, all chat (dice doesn't want your feelings hurt in a game made for adult didn't you know?) not to mention the UI/UX is downright atrocious, the movement is a straight downgrade feeling incredibly janky and floaty (BF5 had amazing movement in contrast), it launches with 22 (YES TWENTY TWO) guns total including FOUR assault rifles and the game also lacks a server browser for the sake of implementing SBMM to continuously sell the whales skins.

Let me remind you that this game has had 3 years of development time, 4 studios working it, Battlefield 5 and Battlefront 2 died for this atrocity, looks worse than Battlefield 1 which released 5 years ago (which btw had less devs working on it than this) and a delay for the cherry on top. Not to mention the abomination that is the specialist system which throws the beloved and iconic class system straight out of the window in order to yet again sell more skins ($$$ is a constant here).

I found the maps to be a simple open box with a lack of interesting terrain that they have over-hyped. It feels empty despite the introduction of weather changing the map and such.

After 27 hours of playing this game , overall I think there is alot of fun to be had here.I will break down each component of the game and give my opinion:

Specialists:
While controversial, since they have replaced the core class system, the new specialists while are generic in terms of abilities, being similar to a lot of other games. The specialists work well with the environments provided , the non-linear map design allow for dynamic gameplay. While accomidating a variety of playstyles between players. No specialist feels overpowered with their abilities , there are some bugs with the wingsuit after playing with it the most with the specialist offering it.

Overall the specialist system is pretty decent.

Guns:

The guns are pretty wonky right now , gun progression unlockiing new guns is incredibly slow. The current meta being mostly based around the SMG's , specially the PP-28. Being the current best gun to use.

Hit Registration is abit wonky too as of now , depending on server latency, it ranges from game to game however these decencies can hamper you experience.

Attachments progression is great , while I can think of any improvements there probably are some.

Maps:

The maps are great , being non-linear , accomidating all playstyles and providing a range of environements to fight in.

Portal:

Portal is great too, if you enjoy traditional Battlefield with the twists provided by custom servers back in the day, I highly suggest playing this. While the content provided is lack lustre currently , the ability to create unique game modes I think surpasses the current in game content for portal.

For people who dislike the specialist system , the game is definetly worth buying for portal.

HardZone:

Havent played , cant say.

Bugs:

Being recently launched, their are plethora of glitches that you can look up, the game is further pretty unoptimised, with frequent lack spikes on a variety of system specifications. If this would hamper your experience, i suggest not playing.

Lack of content:

There isnt much being UI provided content , the lack of stats and traditional scoreboards is pretty annoying.

The lack of all chat I think is a good decision , since toxicity between both teams occurs. However for people saying there is no chat, are misunderstood for lack of VOIP , which is annoying and confusing to why it is not at launch.

Overall:

Overall, the game has a very good foundation to become something great , the bugs do hamper the experience , I would suggest buying if you want to play it after a couple of patches. Collapse",7,2,6

5,Battlefield 2042,chappie2323,"Nov 15, 2021","I'm a die hard BF series fan. I played all battlefield since BF2. Every game was bought, played for hours, loved for years. But this BF feels like a fan-made mod. It's anything, but Battlefield. It's a bad mixture of Apex Legends, COD and a free-to-play Chinese fps for mobile phones. The gunplay - disgusting, DICE made the bullet spread completely random. They cut out all the game modes but conquest and breakthrough and made the maps HUGE. Which resulted in endless running from one objective to another only to get sniped in conquest and 64 vs 64 battles in one little sector in Breakthrough. This is not a BF game, this is garbage. And don't get me starting on the UI and the lack of scoreboard ""to make new players feel comfortable"" bs. Oh yeah, they copied the specialist system from cod, yeah, but they missed the fact that each faction in game had different specialists, because it's STUPID to kill operator named BORIS only to get revived by the Boris fighting on your side.
PLUS. I can't mention the optimization of the game, even though it was the thing for DICE since BF3 I think. You can't get above 50 fps on 3700x and 2060 super on any settings in 1080p. I mean it's a not to notch pc but, why does the BF V runs WAY better while looking extremely better? Collapse",0,1,3

I'll start with the good, or rather the ""okay"". The gameplay itself is fine. Guns feel good, sounds are good, vehicles are good. I love the ability to swap scopes and mids while in gameThe problem is while the core gameplay elements are good, there's no WOW factor. You would hope that the first BF game released for next gen would have it, and sadly it just doesn't. I want to love this game, I've tried playing it for the past few days hoping it would grow on me, but it just hasn't. My biggest complaints revolve around the general interface, menu system, navigation elements, controls, and the maps. For starters, there's really only 3 game modes. I know that's not all that different from previous years, but they need to bring back more centralized objective based game modes. Conquest is what it is, a playground for vehicular warfare. Personally that's not my my cup of tea. I love the vehicles, but the maps are so large and the objectives so spaced out that if you don't have a vehicle, your going to be running around for awhile before you see any action.

12,Battlefield 2042,Kensh1nBE,"Nov 14, 2021","You should expect quality coming from a Triple A game & studio. Instead we got a completely new and revamped Battlefield that reminds me all the time of PUBG. Don't get me wrong but I like the fact that studios and developers creating something new and dare stepping out of their comfort zone. But we as veteran players know that Battlefield is a game that likes to set the standard for the next Battlefield title and so on.

Cons:
-Devs saying that they were gonna keep most of the physics from BFV and yet released something far from the standard.
-Devs and reviewers are being paid or told on how to review the game. The twitter accounts from the devs was such an organized attack on promoting ""ThE BeSt BaTtLeFiElD gAmE wE hAvE eVeR cReAtEd""
-Basic and poor destruction that feels like BF3-4
-Performance issues while GPU & CPU are only utilized for 50-60%
-128 players (I've noticed that when encountering more players the lag spikes starts to occur)
-Map design (this is the worst map design I have ever seen in a BF title. Textures are sharp, every buidling and model looks squared, too many open space. The game throws you into a tutorials on the dessert map, at first I thought I downloaded BF2. My first reaction to this was: ""I want the game from the trailer"".
-What's up with the bullet spread?
-Long range shooting feels RNG-based
-UI (It's improved comparing with the Beta but still has a long way to home. I see people on reddit making redesigns who should be hired immediately)
-Options menu is a mess but this is the least of my concerns
-The classes. Besides destruction, the classes are the kind of thing that makes Battlefield classic. I don't like the mixup with operators and classes. There is already so much to focus on and now I have to filter players of them cheating or having some kind of sketchy operators that can scan through walls. The players don't like it and it should be removed instantly.

Mids - Pro's:
-The scoreboard. Everyone is complaining about bringing the old scoreboard back. I honestly don't care at all. This Scoreboard is a step into the right direction and devs should make everything a bit more objective based to have a much better team experience.
-The weapons. I don't mind having 22 guns to choose from. In the end I only play with the same kind of weapons and at this stage of the game with all the hitreg problems there is no gun that has my preference. People also seem to forget that this game has more weapons which you can find in the Portal mode.
-Portal. This is the only spark the game has to offer but at this point I'm starting to think if it wasn't better for them to release remakes of the games with the BFV engine (Remakes, not remaster). That would've put them in a better spotlight then BF2042
-No story mode. It's personal preference between 'Play a story once' or 'play a better multiplayer'. However we now have a full team concentrating on Multiplayer and still received a burning house.
-No all chat. I leave this in the middle but I don't miss it at all. 90% of the time the chat is being used to flame.

Once again they pulled the rug from beneath our feet. Took our money and run. They will come back in 6 months with a update that makes everyone happy just to take it away three months later.

Nothing about this game is positive. It's a disgusting, abysmal insult to the franchise, and plays more like a cheap mobile knock-off of Battlefield than a next-gen AAA iteration. Frankly, it's easily the worst game of the entire franchise. I've never given a negative review for a game - usually I'll just leave it alone and move onto something else. But not this time. The sheer gall that EA has to create this utter tripe and then sell it for top dollar is the most insulting thing I've seen in this industry. This game needed a good 2 more years of development, if not a complete overhaul.

The woeful part about all of this is they'll get away with it. Again and again they ruin games by forcing developers to rush to please investors. People will continue to pre-order ultimate editions and EA will continue to exploit this by increasing their speed at churning out awful, unfinished content for higher prices. They're a business first and foremost and care very little for the games that they produce or in fact the players.

We'll never get everyone to stop pre-ordering and unifying against EA—that's a lost cause. Instead, sadly, the only people that can really do something about it are the developers who can choose to stop working with EA entirely.

Score updated to reflect changes.

I cannot and will not comment on the multiplayer aspects as that was not why I got BF2042. I simply wanted to screw around and have fun with my bro on co-op.

Before the game even officially launched, the progression for solo and coop matches are stripped away, leaving us with near-stock weapons with basic attachments. No news regarding reimplementation or anything, just a broken promise of ""shared progression"".

We really don't care if there are players out there who think getting everything via bot farming on BF Portal makes them feel cool or something. It only makes them look like skill-less fools. But we do care if someone at DICE/EA decides that the solution should be that ALL solo and co-op matches, including official modes, should have progression stopped. It's an utter disgrace of a decision and shows absolutely zero thought at all.

Aside from that, I've had fun with coop - no lies. AI on highest difficulty is satisfying to play against. It's not perfect but good enough. At least with Portal I can play the other BF teams, fully unlocked so there's some fun to be had there. My verdict -- co-op is fun, but if you're getting it for just that, then don't get it until they reinstate progression for solo and co-op. Or on a massive discount.

Да, именно так, несмотря на странную оценку пользователей.
Хорошее развитие серии, в котором есть контент для любителей любого Battlefied, для вечно ноющих что раньше было лучше portal, hazard zon как напряженное и динамичное сессионное развлечение в силу низкого ттк и постоянного сражения с врагами, All-out-warfare как развитие идей battlefield.

К стрельбе были претензии в бете, из за низкой отдачи, отдачу поправили теперь.

Ощущение и передвижение персонажа очень походит на warzone(modern warfare(2019)), не думаю что это большая проблема, для современного милитари шутера это скорее плюс, ибо позаимствована она довольно хорошо.

Войс-чата нет, хотя разработчики уже написали что он выйдет в ближайших обновлениях.

Браузер серверов со всем контентом уехал в портал, он никуда не пропал как пишут некоторые пользователи.

Баги так или иначе пофиксят, они слишком много денег ввалили в эту игру-сервис. Оптимизацию так же подвезут по той-же, на мой взгляд причине.

Контент наверняка будет завезен с 1м сезоном.

Как мне кажется это очень удачное продолжение battlefield, возможно в последствии hazard-zone станет бесплатным, добавят скины, батлпасы, контента накинут, ивенты завезут.
Из этого Battlefield EA будут очень долго качать деньги, по модели проверенной warzone.

Мои личные ощущения на 9 из 10, эта игра явно не хуже 6 из 10 все что ниже 6 это нытье ради нытья... как мне кажется.

A very solid Battlefield?
Yes, that's right, despite the strange user assessment.
A good development of the series, in which there is content for fans of any Battlefied, for always whining what used to be better portal, hazard zon as a tense and dynamic session entertainment due to low ttk and constant battle with enemies, All-out-warfare as a development of battlefield ideas.

There were complaints about shooting in beta, due to low recoil, recoil has now been corrected.

The feeling and movement of the character is very similar to warzone (modern warfare (2019)), I don't think this is a big problem, for a modern military shooter it is rather a plus, because it is borrowed quite well.

There is no voice chat, although the developers have already written that it will be released in the next updates.

The server browser with all the content went to the portal, it did not disappear anywhere, as some users write.

Bugs will be fixed one way or another, they have poured too much money into this game-service. Optimization will also be brought up for the same reason, in my opinion.

The content will probably be delivered with the 1st season.

It seems to me that this is a very successful continuation of the battlefield, perhaps later the hazard-zone will become free, they will add skins, battle passes, content will be thrown, events will be delivered.
From this Battlefield EA will be pumping money for a very long time, according to the model of the proven warzone Collapse",9,5,18

I preordered the Gold Edition and have played the game since the beginning of the early access and to be honest: I was very disappointed in the beginning. I'm talking about heavy issues concerning the servers, connection, and the game itself. It was partly unplayable.
I am also underwhelmed by the maps themselves, even though they are mostly working for what they want to be, they are just not as stunning as in previous parts (e.g. Arras). Furthermore, the buildings are a farce in comparison to what I expected.

After a few days in which I put LOTS of hours into the game, I have to change this impression. Sure, the overall graphics haven't improved. But first of all, the developers uphold a close communication with the community on their Twitter page and have fixed server issues quite quickly. They also adapted some changes (e.g. increase of tickets in breakthrough) which really helped improve the feeling of the entire game. There are still annoying bugs (e.g. revival or spawns), but that's nothing that cannot be fixed by patches, especially since they already announced a huge day one patch.

The gameplay itself feels good for me, the guns mostly are what they are supposed to be, even though the ARs could use a little less bloom and the hovercrafts are way too strong. But the game works. At first, I was skeptical about the new specialist system since I know the ""old"" battlefield since 1942. But to my surprise, I got used to it really fast since everything the old system did is, even though in another way, still in the game.

To sum it all up, I am not 100% convinced, but I see the potential and since BF4 also had a really rough start, I believe that the developers are eager to improve and fix the minor issues to create a better overall experience. I am definitely having more and more fun from day to day and hope that DICE continues listening to the criticism of the community. Collapse",7,1,4

And Hazard zone is relative fun :). the operators are fine, their specilas are good and change most battle scenarios. Customizace in battle is fantastic :).

But there are issue: No voice chat WTF DICE(yep confirmed they add it)
No Scoreboard(Confirmed they add it)
Few Weapons only 22(Ok with portal their more but still only 22)
Clearly we know that in BF3 and 4 a lot of weapons the players didn't even play, but still better more weapon diversity vs few weapons.
No dedication class(This is for me worst thing because all or 95% communite playing only Recoiless 5 RPG. Bring back dedication class omg.
When it comes to the USA vs. Russia, there should be different equipment and not that they all run with the same characters with same customization and skins. All BF game they had different nations with customization. Why is here USA vs Russia and both nations they have no different customization characters? Or different skins per Nations.

10/10 Review:

Hear me out veterans. I was just as loud and as unhappy as most of you here.

And then I started my trial. Was fuming by the end of my 3 hours.

Fast forward to almost being done with the 10 hr trial and I realized I've had more (new) fun in 2042 recently than I can care to remember.

I'll take no scoreboard to not being able to try out a chopper because of sweaty pilots hogging them.

2042 is flawed and I'll only be playing Espinoza to spite EA and will not be spending a penny more than $53.99 because I really think this is a worthy experiment from DICE to (maybe) truly evolve the series.

I'm in because 2042 still provides that adrenaline rush you get with vehicular combat.

Won't be sad to see all those pledging to abandon the series go because I still see them sh*t talking in the game chat instead of you know, PTFO.

3/10 Review:

I might as well have been dropped into the middle of No Man's Land in Red Dead.

Running simulator extraordinaire.

So purdy and yet so empty. Just like the broads running around on Insta today.

I know the series is supposed to evoke the sense of being on an actual battlefield, but this is still supposed to be a game, yes? Or, are we gonna start turning this into some survival/sim type game where I gotta stop and pull out an MRE and cook it too?

The prettiest UI and none of it tells me what I want.

Feeling lost, overwhelmed and bored is definitely groundbreaking for this series.

Gonna finish out the remaining 7 hrs for lolz, unsubscribe from EA Play and wipe my SSD down with an alcohol wipe before setting it on fire. Just to be sure. Collapse",10,3,16

90,Battlefield 2042,firebladex,"Nov 15, 2021","So people use metacritic to complain. But if you want an honest review:
- Its a really fun battlefield game. The all-out warfare is impressive (64 vs 64) but choatic. You will end up dying alot because you really need to have eyes on your back. Breaktrough is fun mode, but being 'the attackers' is just tough love.
- I played on PC with 5900x + 3090 at 1440p. I got smooth 140 fps on ultra settings.
- Portal offers many choice. I love to go back to the WW2 era. The old but new maps like El-Alamein is reliving my childhood fantasy.
- If you read that people are complaining about having only 4 assault rifles... Its just something to flame on. Why would 4 assault rifles be bad? Who says they won't add more later ? Like CoD does. People judge this game too quickly.
- People complaining about PC performances; people think that their 2060/2070 is state of the art hardware and expect to have no problems running this game. What people forget is that having 128 players in a server, means it will ask more processing power from your system. You cannot compare this with a 12 man tdm server on call of duty. Like in World of Warcraft, I get 400 fps. But once there are 200 people in my screen and casting spells, i guarentee you, my fps will drop to 20 and everything will feel like a powerpoint slideshow. Its not only about hardware and optimalisation. Its a compromis you have to make if you want big all-out warfare. So stop comparing ""But i get 200 fps on BF:V and i get only 70 fps on BF2042, this game is bad and badly optimized so i will leave a 1 star review"").

What could improve:
- Few bugs (mostly on xbox) could be fixed like; UI bug which doesnt allow you to change gear, joining a crashed server (it shows the round has ended but a new map wont load) and when you die, you sometimes get bugged and cant respawn. Dice should give these bugs piority as it influences gameplay alot. Minor bugs like falling through the map after dieing... i consider this normal if you compare that there are 64 vs 64 people shooting at eachother which all kind of tanks and airplanes.
- Remove bots. Really DICE, I truely stand behind many of your choices, but the bot thing... I understand but no.
- Weapon handle; aiming is really difficult with for example assault rifle. Even shooting short bursts make it sometimes seem impossible to kill while on the other hand, i feel like dieing instantly when enemy shoots at me.

What you should ignore:
- People complaining about no scoreboard; BF2042 tends to motivate people to push objective. It doesn't matter how you contribute to it. If you are the sniper staying behind, the medic that attacks or the heli that brings down hell on your enemy. Scoreboards dont tribute anything to it. Having scoreboards in other BF always led to discussion and complaining about a person when he was really good with airplanes or tanks (you could easily get 40 kills - 0 deaths). I can remember the hate and crying you would get and people call you cheater etc.
- It tried something new with specialist. I like'd the old class system better as well. It was much more clearer somehow. But after playing more than 20 hours you get the hang of it and you see the point they are trying to make. Yet people complain just because it is a change and they don't like change.
- I am really happy about no voice option. Collapse",10,4,25

Map size will take some getting used to if people aren’t calling in vehicles. My biggest complaint especially at the lower levels is this feels like an infantry farming simulator. Vehicles are crazy strong and at low levels you don’t have the tools to deal with them.

10,Battlefield 2042,Medic7345,"Feb 13, 2022","The time I spent playing this game: 383 hrs 57 mins

2.3, the current user score is far too low when I write this. This game is much better and is generally being undersold. For example, I would bet big money that those writing a poor review for this game have not spent over 24 hours playing it. At first glance, yes, the game looks terrible. However, after playing it past 24 hours, I enjoy this game. Why?
1. Choices. This game offers a vast number of play styles and choices. Want to fly in the air or travel on the ground? Do you want to fight solo or support a team by being a medic? Want to fight up close or far in the distance using a sniper rifle?

2. The maps are great. They are massive, with enough for 128 people having 5-6 mini battles throughout.

3. Talking here only for the PC servers, since I have not checked out the cross-servers, this game's skill level is very high. Many highly talented players play this game, and you are sure to find competition at ALL levels. Think you are the best in the game? You will very likely find another player with your skill level or higher.

4. I think the graphics are amazing. Battlefield 2042 has incredible artists making the clouds in the game - yes, the clouds. I think the mountains and all the nature bits of the game are fantastic and artistic. Running through the forests and mountain ranges alone is... actually fun.

Take it from me - I have died probably more than anyone else in this game. However, it is STILL fun to play. The gaming community is underselling this game... and frankly makes it a rare gem. If you buy this game, try and play it long enough and be humble.

UPDATE several months later: The flaws of this game:
1. Scoreboard only includes your squad and not everyone in the game. It does compare your squad with other squads, but that is not accurate of individual performance.

2. I found I have to play cross-platform in order to play. If I play only with PC users, there can be instances where there are not enough players to start a game.

3. This game is riddled with bugs. Some bugs are easy to live with, but several bugs crash the game. I have heard of people getting stuck and having to redeploy. I have heard of people getting stuck in the sky or the earth. I have had it that all players and vehicles become invisible for a long time, and only their guns are seen. These bugs continue and, in some way, are getting worse in the game since its launch months ago.

4. There is no way to play nonviolently. Every aspect leads to violence for anyone that wants to chill out in this game and relax - probably not the game for you.

5. In the in-game chat, I have heard racist remarks. Swearing is consistent amongst users, but this is **** starred out.

6. This game is competitive. If you are playing to have fun, get ready for abusive language about your performance in the chat.

7. Overall, the community is low in this game. Either nobody is chatting, or there is some argument happening. Trolling is pretty consistent in this game's gaming community. Collapse",8,1,7

There are some bugs, but nothing that a few patches couldn’t fix. Specialists are a bit unnecessary, but they don’t make the game less enjoyable, just different. The core gameplay is still really fun. The expanded scale and verticality of the maps allow for a really unique experience that no other games has to offer.

While there is a server browser for Portal I would like to see one for the main 2042 gamemode as well. Would also like for the game wide scoreboard to make a comeback, as it’s nice to know how other players are doing even if the list would be huge for 128 player matches.

Personally I have never enjoyed or finnished the campaigns of the previous games. They always felt a bit tacked on. So this time I appreciate that the resources that would otherwise have been spend on that have now been dedicated to make the Portal game mode which is almost like another game on its own!

The massive, well-designed maps offer plenty of room for experimentation and emergent stories, and the modes are a blast. And that’s just All-Out Warfare. Between that, Hazard Zone, and the expansive Battlefield Portal, Battlefield 2042 has something for everyone, without feeling like it’s stretched too thin. It’s a true evolution of the series, one that pushes back against a stagnation that threatened the series’ future. It won’t be for everyone, but for players who crave imagination and fun from their Battlefields, it will give them everything that they crave and more. Collapse",10,1,8
22,Battlefield 2042,jinx20001,"Nov 13, 2021","i think the reviews are blowing it out of proportion how bad the game is, ive played 12 hours and had a blast with the game, its got its issues but they are very dependant on the system being used ive found, i play on a 5900x/3080 pc and at 4k using DLSS quality and get a fairly consistent 80fps or so, many of the bugs in the beta are gone, flying vehicles dont teleport no more etc. there are some issues though like in portal i cant seem to ever put an attachment on my gun and trying to do so ive had two crashes in 12 hours. a friend of mine uses a 7700k/2060 pc and has far far more issues than me as one would expect but it seems the game is very very cpu dependant, anything less than the very latest CPU's seem to be having all kinds of problems and that IS on the developers and EA, they needed more optimization time and players are suffering now.

portal itself has been awesome, some of the bullet spread of weapons has been questionable but the maps remastered are great and the ability to create wild game modes is in full swing you just have to go and find them.

hazard zone has been a surprising amount of fun, very difficult but very rewarding all the same, its pretty shallow and i have 1300 hours in escape from tarkov so this is very very shallow by comparison but its a side mode to complement portal and conquest and im ok with that, brings my boys together for some proper team work and its ok, i like it.

the main conquest is as it has been for a few years now which is chaotic and crazy, the new maps i like, reminds me of the big maps in BF2 and that encourages sticking closer to your team mates and using transport, they all have their hot zones and filter points and as long as your pc can handle it the action stays smooth enough to have a good game.

its far from a solid 10, but its in no way a 1/2/3, absolutely no way. its a bit of a mess but there is a good game in here with potential, the hate for EA is justified though, its quite clear its another game pushed out of the door when it needs another 6 months on the burner but im still having a good time with it, i realize that's rare and its in such a mess who knows what your experience may be like, for that reason it might be wise to wait on some patches and polish but i still think its a good game in general.

24,Battlefield 2042,BunetsCohost1,"Nov 13, 2021","Aside from the typical DICE launch/prelaunch buginess this game pushes the bar forward for Battlefield and the FPS scene in general. If you're a longtime ""veteran"" of the franchise (talking refractor engine days, BF2 for example) you'll come to appreciate the massive sense of scale that was missing from the series is back. You can't just run to every single objective on the map and zerg, you're expected to use vehicles and actually defend captured points! The days of solocapping flags with no interference are gone! 128 players makes for some wild action movie gameplay moments that was simply not possible with 64 players. I thought the tornado was just another gimmick like Levolution in BF4 but it's dynamic in it's path and rare to see, adding to the visual presentation of the game. Destruction is on par with BFV and is visually superior in some cases. Smoke effects especially on the rocket launch are breathtaking. All the bar pushing visuals you'd expect from a frostbite Battlefield are present. Hazard Zone is a nice take on a tarkov like mode but it needs more meat, there is potential there. Portal is the love letter to fans that dice claimed it would be, I just hope it gets continued support and we get to see more refractor games in the mix. MEC remastered? DICE plz. There are gameplay concerns in this early stage, specialists don't seem as bad as people made it out to be but I'm unsure of where the meta will go as more are added. Will every specialist remain useful in time? The weapon count in the AOW mode is unfortunately low for my liking. Don't necessarily need BF4s reskined guns with the same stats but a few more weapons with actual variety would be helpful. The plus system is also a nice spin on customization but it's somewhat clunky at the moment. Then there's things like supposed sbmm, the lack of a scoreboard, weird weapon spread when moving, or no server browser on AOW etc. These are things that need to be addressed immediately for the long-term health of the game. I don't agree with many other reviews or opinions you may see where they think these things will plummet the game into oblivion, there's just too many positives weighing those issues down. This isn't a BF4 catastrophe, lawsuit filing level launch, not even close to that and anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant or wasn't around back then. I truly believe when the dust settles and more meat is added this game will at the very least surpass BF4. Collapse",9,2,17

There are way too many bugs for it to be incredible, and the customization with guns is certainly disappointing. (There are like 1/3 of guns that were in BF4) However, the game has plenty of potential, the gameplay loop is fun and invigorating. The gunplay and visceral feedback from the weapons are really great. It feels much more realistic from a gun point of view, (reminds me of “modern warfare 2019”). I think this game is worth $45 or if you’re a big fan of battlefield, your preorder. But I understand why people dislike the changes that it added, but that all can be subject to personal preference.

68,Battlefield 2042,Cometer,"Nov 16, 2021","First of all. BF2042 is fun. A real gameplay improvement over past Battlefields simply because of quality of life gameplay improvements such as vehicle drops and being able to change load outs on the fly. It’s a good game because it allows you to mix different eras of Battlefield bringing some of the best maps, vehicles and weapons from past games. Meta critic user ratings has lost its value because people use them just as a way to criticize specific companies and provide a completely emotional and biased review. Many didn’t even buy the game and played the final version. There are people giving reviews of the beta. What’s the value in that? I see people giving high praises to previous Battlefield titles that had a pretty low user score. So whenever a new Battlefiled title comes out it seems previous titles are great games while the latest release is the worst Battlefield ever. Let’s be clear about what is actually bad or needs improvement.
- Some things are or feel unfinished in BF2042. There is no voice comm for starters that is so needed for squad gameplay and that was clearly left out in order to release the game on schedule.
- There are no scoreboards as in previous games. I understand why but there should be an option to enable them. The reason not to use scoreboards to motivate players is indeed logical. Battlefield games are not like COD. They are focused on theaters of war where everyone big or small contributes to win or lose in countless ways. In past Battlefield games there were players that were constantly on the top of the scoreboard for some arbitrary logic. Either they were a medic healing everyone and getting lots of points. Or they are sniping killing everyone from a well protected position thus ending the match with a great K/D ratio. And so on and on. Meanwhile there is this guy that has been transporting troops from one point to the other. Or focusing in defending a couple of points that gets a low score. Like it or not that low score removes the fun and sense of achievement. So in BF2042 Dice decided to instead give more focus to how players contributed in the overall match than a typical scoreboard. Most heals, most covering fire and so on. It’s a good approach considering the type of game but choice is something that should always be a priority. Dice should focus on bringing scoreboards back and giving people the choice to enable it or not. A valid point of criticism is also that without a scoreboard or a team overview so to speak its hard to know if a server is balanced. Or if there are too many specialists of a certain kind. There is a small advantage for not having a scoreboard. In previous Battlefields once people noticed a team was losing and players were starting to quit the game, more people quit making it harder for the losing team to recover. Keeping players ignorant is sometimes the best choice.
Some people are complaining about no classes. That I don’t understand. In each Battlefield and COD game people criticize in how it’s always the same and they need to evolve. Well they evolved. The new system does bring an additional flavor to the game. Does has advantages over past games. Specifically the fact that you can better tailor your character to how you want to play instead of the old class system that forced you to use a limited loadout depending on the class you chose. In BF2042 the loadout is fully customizable. Your not limited by a fixed class. Specialists give you specific gadgets and passive traits that suit different people play styles without overpowering you. It is clearly better than past games. People resist to change but also complain if a game doesn’t evolve. If you search online for actual comparisons between the classes and the new specialist system you will see that those that took the time to compare it always end up with the conclusion that the new system is better.
Performance wise the game needs improvement. Graphics are really good but not to the point that for some reason a RTX 3080 struggles to get 60 FPS with RTX ON. Also the lack of Ray traced reflections makes no sense. It’s a step back from what people expect. In any case the game runs fine and looks amazing with some minor tweaks.
Some last notes. Environmental hazards, changing weather and gameplay conditions. Map flow and so on are usually left out from player reviews. The fact that there are so many weapons because you have content from different eras is also left out. So keep that in mind. All these things are positive things that are only available in BF2042. A clear evolution over past games.
So given all the pros and cons I’m giving BF2042 a solid 8. It’s a good game that could be better with some improvements as detailed above. It brings enough progress to the formula to be considered better than some competitor games and even past games in the series. Collapse",8,0,2

Campaign

To state the obvious the game doesn't have a campaign and for a $60 title I don't understand how it doesn't have one.

They created this [lore web-series around 2042](https://youtu.be/FJVCfhLEYdo) and it just ended there. No more videos. I personally would have loved a campaign around 'Irish' played by Michael Williams. Sadly he passed away in mid of this year (2021) and now we can never get it.

Such a missed opportunity to build lore around all of this technology. Sometimes I just want a getaway from the competitive'ness and just play a campaign. If you're searching for the same thing, you won't get it here.

-----

Content

Content is barebones and bad decisions were made when making it.

Upon playing Battlefield, if you didn't know this game is developed by EA so they do EA things. Do you know what that means, they introduced 'Cap XP' to the point where your XP is capped for that entire day for earning too much. You can still earn XP but it's capped to a specific amount each day.

- 2042 has 7 maps (not including Portal maps), while Battlefield V has roughly 18 maps.
- 2042 has 22 weapons, while Battlefield V has 60+ weapons.

You see where I'm going with this? Yeah... The game just lacks content.

-----

Support Roles/Specialists

First off, as someone who main's Medic... Support roles are meaningless in this game.

Ammo? No big deal, you can now pickup ammo from the ground.

Recon? No big deal, classes can now equip a sensor grenade.

Medic? Pretty much pointless. It takes a whole minute just to revive a teammate compared to Battlefield 4 or Battlefield 1 where it's just instantaneous. You can play as the Medic Specialist and you have a heal gun, sadly you can't revive teammates with it. What's the point in a heal gun when you'll just re-gen the health 10 seconds later?

The only perk for the Medic Specialist is the ability to revive a teammate for full health... And that's it. They literally brought a perk from the defibrillator once you fully charge it, but instead it's now a character perk. Why kill off a mechanic that wasn't broken?

Specialists are more self-served rather than manually benefiting the team/squad, this mechanic is what sold millions of copies. Yet you got rid of it. Battlefield, this isn't Apple. You don't need to redo the charging port/headset jack EA. Please stop.

Portal

The Battlefield Portal game mode the ability to mismatch previous Battlefield titles with the current 2042 or older titles and make your own Custom Games or even play 'Hardcore' is what saves this game. This... This was the most fantastic feature DICE has done in 4 years. Without Portal, the game would have been dead at release. It even has a custom browser while the core game-modes don't even have one. Portal was the most fun I had in a long time. Just jumping into Battlefield 3 maps and just going on a rampage taking over flags, taking over a tank and getting the objective. You can't get anything like this from any other game... This is Battlefield, not that bland crap in core game-modes. It's truly remarkable what you can create and play with Portal. ----- Overview All the details from DICE not having a campaign, a scoreboard, the UI, vehicles, lack of weapons, lack of main maps, lack of Portal maps, re-design of the classes... This Creative Director needs to be fired. He still has a mind of a 5 year old that played too much Black Ops 3. He took steps in the right way like Portal but took huge steps backwards. [Here's a list of items](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/qw8m3b/list_of_things_that_were_removed_in_bf_2042/) of how much got removed from previous titles to this game. DICE purposely stopped Battlefield V development in 2019 to help make 2042 better with more resource management and this is what EA DICE came up with? This is a disgrace to the series. Congratulations to the Portal team, I will buy you a beer. The core game-mode on the other hand... DICE, you failed the fan-base. I can easily spend 60+ hours in Portal, is it worth $60 though, sadly no and that's where I come in and say, I don't recommend it. Get it on a sale. Collapse",5,0,2
72,Battlefield 2042,WinterSoldierAM,"Dec 5, 2021","I would love to love this game. I'd love to sit here and write up the ways in which it pushes the franchise forward and captures on my and others' joy for the series, but the fundamental truth is this: this is the worst Battlefield game there is outside of the phone games. You can ignore the joke and rage reviews and even the user reviews entirely and still see that this game is getting torn apart by critics. And that is due to a few different things.

The first thing you notice about the game is the completely different gameplay from previous games. No class system anymore, now you have operators. Each operator has a special ability but all operators can use the same equipment, weapons, secondaries, etc. What this does is it makes everyone run very similar loadouts. Worse, there are very few weapons in the game and the gunplay is fundamentally flawed. Not only does it not feel engaging or responsive, there is no weight to the guns and your shots rarely go where they are supposed to.

This is a far cry from previous games that felt so responsive and rewarding when you could set up a snipers nest in a building miles away and snipe an enemy. 2042 is about spray and pray. To make matters worse, the maps are terrible. 128 players adds nothing because the maps are so large and desolate you can still run for ten minutes around the map and encounter nobody. That is until a helicopter carpet bombs you into oblivion becuase there is no cover anywhere. The modes are uninspired. While conquest is a decent improvement on previous games the map and player count detract from it. The other main mode feels like a poorer version of Battlefront 2's co op gameplay. The Portal is honestly really good except it is still held back by core gameplay issues. While you have access to classic modes, maps, and weapons and can even use classes, you still have to play via 2042's terrible gunplay and movement. If it was truly a legacy experience this may have been different. Another issue is the terrible ui. Marking targets is worse than previous games, scoreboards are gone, the colors are atrocious, and there is just so much clutter. I have played Battlefield 1942, 2, 3, 4, Heroes, Hardline, and 1 and all of them without exception are better than this game. Even V in it's current state is better and offers more fun and better gameplay mechanics. 2042 is what happens when you throw everything about a franchise out the window to pursue elements of other games without being able to capture upon what makes those other games fun to play. As it stands, it's just a mishmash of a bunch of different fps games with no real identity. It doesn't play like a Battlefield game and it doesn't play like other shooters. It feel lifeless, dull, and boring. I truly hope this game can be improved but from what I've seen it would take a total rehaul from the ground up. Given EA's proclivities to support games to that extent I would not advise others to hold out hope or put your faith in the company to do so. I highly recommend waiting on this game. I know many want that Battlefield experience. I do too. But this game will not give it to you. Try it on Xbox with Gamepass or origin pro on PC before buying and see for yourself. Maybe this game is much better a year from now, but as it stands it falls short of the series and of modern fps standards. Collapse",5,0,1

I'm playing on a RTX 3080 and this gaming is absolutely mind blowing, it's light years ahead of anything else in the FPS category. The gunplay is near perfect, the vehicles are amazing, the visuals are second to none, the levels are massive and entertaining. 0 rating is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
- No scoreboard is retarded but if you hit tab a mini scoreboard comes up at least.
- Voice chat with 64 other team mates would be dumb. With that being said, the kill-mic (when you can briefly communicate with your enemy after a death) is always a good time.

EA brought DICE new cheap student Developers.

= Battlefield 2042 that absolutely feels like students summer project/try to copy BF on Unity engine.

""new"" DICE cheap team failed miserably.
- UI is horrible
- ""Heroes"" / Specialists concept was absolutely not needed for BF. EA just copy-pasting CoD for nothing good.
- Gunplay is a mess, hit- detection not working - ""blood"" splash on enemy character is clearly visible but damage not counted.
- Maps are awful. No gameflow whatsoever. Flags are placed just randomly, with no concept in mind. Some maps are absolutely flat.
- Jets and Heli are now having absolutely ""new"" controls and feels very sluggish, slow and underpowered.
- just 22 guns overall.
- NO SCOREBOARD!?!?? in game

Every working part of prev. Battlefields starting from BF2, is missing in Battlefield 2042. Even little things like scaling minimap, or adjusting opacity of UI ingame. New DICE screwed up even switches in settings Enabled/Disabled frustrating and you can't say which is on or off now...

Good points are that it's easy to kill players, the controls are smooth and flexible, wide weapon and gear customization, beautiful graphics.

Bad stuff are: menus and we talked about this with BF1 and BFV, cheaters running amuck right now, game sometimes won't launch, terrible muffled and quiet audio (was fine in beta), some maps are TOO big and too hard on graphics performance, some keybinds are hardcoded to certain keys if you're left handed or like to use different keys, FOV configuration takes some figuring out.

Anyways, the actual game has some highs and some lows. The fundamental gameplay is very fun and screams Battlefield with big moments and chaotic warfare. The maps are big but as long as you actually use the tools at your disposal action is not hard to find. I love the verticality of some of the maps and they are all athestically pleasing. While I thought specialists would ruin the game they might actually be some of the best additions. In terms of abilities they are a mixed bag with some feeling out of place (wall hacks) and others feeling pretty useless but at the same time I've never had the freedom of flying or grappling around the map to get a positional advantage or planting makeshift cover for my squad. It really is fun and only those who refuse to accept change disagree here. But hey, if you don't like a certain aspect of the main MP you don't have to care, Portal solves all your issues. While I think it would benefit from paid hosted servers like older games and I hope that is added, it really does have everything you could ask for. Tons of maps, tons of guns, tons of options. The battle royale ish game mode is OK too. Now on to the negatives, as you can see this is a 6/10 which is just slightly above average so clearly there are issues. Performance is not great, this just needs to be better there is nothing else to say. There is a laundry list of small b7t noticeable features hat have been removed too. Full scoreboard? All chat? Squad changing? There is a whole lot more where that came from and it really does impact the overall experience when you expect a feature that isn't there. Next up is the fact that the base game only has 22 guns, not a whole lot when compared to past entries. With that said, the guns are at least varied and perform in their own niche with lots of attachment options. I guess it beats having 5 guns that do the same thing. Its clear portal is where the other guns went. People also seem to have a problem with the general gunplay. Personally I agree to an extent but not NEARLY as much as some are making it out to be. There is an accuracy penalty for moving and in some situations is extremely frustrating but for the most part is avoidable with smart play and good aim. I won't carry on this list forever but another issue stems from the lack of a class system. Well sort of. There are classes in the game and each specialist is a part of one of those classes but you are allowed to take whichever equipment you want. It means everyone can run around with a rocket launcher (and they do) and you never know who has what. It makes some equipment almost unseen such as ammo or health packs and generally contributes to less overall teamwork on a team wide level. No longer are there dedicated healers and revivers, but instead everyone can revive, which sort makes it so that less people take that job seriously. On the other hand it let's you run whichever gun you want which isn't a bad thing considering the lack of them.

Overall, this game has amazing potential and I really think it can get there with support. We know more guns, more specialist and more maps will come for free. There is an nvidia driver releasing on the 19th which should help performance. I imagine a lot of bugs will be fixed by then too. We all know what AAA games are like now. Release first and fix later. And yet, I keep playing because well, it's just fun. Should you accept this is the way it is and buy it anyway? That's your call, I wouldn't blame you for not supporting this practice, especially not the early access overpriced gold edition. Give the trial on EAplay/gamepass a try with some friends and have an open mind. You might be surprised how enjoyable it is despite the issues. Collapse",6,0,5

Ive ran into few bugs, biggest one for me was not being able to revive my downed teamate for whatever reason. All out warfare and hazard zone are great in my opinion. I do feel some of the maps are too huge in scale, requiring you to travel very large distances to find the action. Yet, something about the game feels off to me. The destructible enviroments are very lackluster, i mean my jet literally bounced off a skyscraper but when i run into a light pole it blows up. The reactive weather disasters are fine. Really wish they caused more carnage especially with buildings and cars. The bullet spread is abysmal sometimes, especially with AR's. Im not personally bothered by the ""lack"" of weapons, imo you dont need fifty guns cause they all end up feeling the same to me. The specialist system is ok. I feel like it would flow better with traditional classes at certain points, but it honestly really isnt that huge for me. I am just glad i am having fun, and this game is in no way a 0 out of 10.

Sure, it has it's issues, but I really don't think issues like lackluster performance, no chat, and no scoreboard merit all the 0s I've been seeing. I wouldn't be surprised if people are just review bombing at this point, even those who've never even played the game and just want to jump on the bandwagon of hate. First of all, the specialists aren't all that bad. I know the class system is miles better, but some of the specialist abilities can lead to some pretty awesome moments and plays. Also, a specialist system will likely lead to more content being released over time, which will keep the player base more engaged.
Second, the environments are actually decently destructible, it's just the maps people have been playing on don't have much to offer in terms of buildings and things like that. I've also seen a lot of people complaining about the lack of chat, but really, not many people talk to randoms in battlefield games, or at least that what I've noticed, and when you want to talk with your friends, just use something else like discord. The sound quality will likely better anyway. However, there are definitely
some pretty glaring that are pretty impossible to ignore. The first is weapon variety. Only about 23 guns in the main game is pretty pathetic. I know most of the guns are in portal but I would have gladly waited another half year to at least have more than 4 ARs to choose from. Also, the servers suck pretty hard and the lack of scoreboard really annoys me. But overall, I think people are seriously over-hating a game that is actually really fun at it's core. Collapse",8,0,3

This game however has a small annoying flaw. The game design of the game seemed very attractive to me and in my opinion it is a ver or too bad there wasn't a campaign that would have been spectacular.

I'll start with the one I feel the most indifferent with. (Just a FYI, I will not be mentioning glitches as EVERY battlefield title on release had plenty of problems, this is not a BF 2042 specific problem).


Gun play. In comparison to BF3, BF4, and BF1 the TTK is relatively similar yet different. With the lack of weapons you rarely get killed with anything other than the starting rifle as it works great in all situations. It's not like the other weapons are not good either, they just lack universal play. Map design. The maps lack vertically, which I would argue is what made games like BF4 special. The maps are all large with little exception making chaotic close quarter battles non-existentent. Graphics. I'm playing on PC with a 3070 and i9 11700k so it would be unfair to call the graphics good without mentioning this. Content. This easily spooks me the most. Alot of customization and content seems to be missing which could make this another No Man's Sky. Simple stuff such as the leaderboard is missing which is a literal core game feature. As mentioned before the gun category is lacking extremely. I can forgive this if every weapon is viable but that will have to wait until I unlock them all. Gun customization feels alright, no complaints. Thats raps up my negative thoughts on the game, here are some pros that I believe make it a 5-6 out of 10

The new Portal mode is extremely fun. It's a shame they spent so much time adding all those weapons to side gamemodes and not the main game. Custom games is... custom games with little change. The map disasters are all fairly cool. I do wish they added more man made disasters instead of weather based disasters. I would love to see radiation, explosive, or fire change the objectives. Map design. Although the maps are mostly flat with no major vertical titles they are still designed fairly well. Feel free to disagree. Specialist. People hate the idea of Specialist yet complain when people don't play medic or anything else for that matter. Specialist allow players to ""multi-class"" and better support teams with bonuses or abilities. I dont mind it because they don't provide stupidly overpowered bonuses that can't be nerfed or changed. Once again, feel free to disagree. The vehicles are hit or miss. Maybe it's just me but tanks feel like they have ungodly amounts of armour compared to BF1/BF4. The hit boxes are TERRIBLE, rockets will hit yet not deal damage nor points. The crew positions are cool but not practical. In summery this is the average live service game from the new Era of ""release then fix"" games. The game is fun, but lacks personality and content. I would definitely hesitate to pay the full 60 let alone the 90 usd for the gold edition. I Collapse",6,0,9

VS

Battlefield 2042 early access:

Если по мелочи:
- можно смотреть сквозь стены и за* карту, если лечь под переделённым углом и смотреть в угол стены.
- если ноги упираются в стену персонаж начнёт «экстравагантно» (xxx) махать рукой вверх-вниз.
- визуальная подсветка противника НЕ возможна или возможна но только в технике за «ОТДЕЛЬНОГО пассажира» или после 50 лвл… разработчики.. вы издеваетесь? battlefield bad company 2 – подсветка противника возможна СРАЗУ с уровня «0».

Если серьезный глюк:

- Пуля летит чётко в голову модели противника. Трассер входит в голову – через 0,5 секунд – противник, как стоял, так и стоит, но ещё через ещё 0,5 секунд – противник уже в 10 метрах от трассера… и так очень часто (постоянно).
- При этом снайпер не может подсветить противника вплоть до 50 лвл… и в чём смысл игры за снайпера? Чем он по вашему отличается от штурмовика с той же винтовкой…
- Сервера Компьютеров + Консоли = ад для Компьютера. Автоматическая коррекция попадания это легальное читерство. Настолько реалистичное управление снайперской винтовки у Компьютера: вы НЕ попадете в цель. Зато (штурмовик) автоматчик с XBOX легко за 3 выстрела вас заметит и попадёт чётко в голову, почти с другого конца карты.

Последние две части Call of duty дали окончательно понять направление развития сетевых шутеров, и это направление мне совсем не нравится. Battlefield 2042 не во всем хороша, но на контрасте она выигрывает у любой другой игры. Уже это не дает мне права ставить меньше 5 из 10, но ребят 0?! Серьезно?!

I have 30 hours into it and enjoy it yes the bugs and some gunplay can be a little aggravating I recommend trying the 10 hour trail and deciding for yourself as reviews are not the best place these days to see how games actually are as most reviews are just rage, trolling or a cesspool review bomb spewing from r/battlefield2042 and at present it can be pretty hard on your system and needs some optimization. For me it runs fairly well at 5120X1440 on a 3090 and a 5950x at 132fps others mileage will vary.

90,Battlefield 2042,whynotwoji,"Nov 18, 2021","Right, so a lot of people are talking about frame rate issues, stuttering, rubber banding. Firstly, I cannot say i'm experiencing the first two but rubber-banding is an issue that has been drastically reduced since the start of the pre-release.

I'll start with the things that i dislike and the reason why they didn't receive 10/10. The hit reg of guns is currently in an appalling state for ARs and Marksman rifles. It is that bad that guns such as SMGs are winning gunfights from short to long-range against guns such as ARs. This however has been noticed by devs as they are working on a fix to a 'bloom' related issue.

There are other bugs such as hovercrafts acting badly. But to me this is not a bug that i dislike as it makes the game more fun. Like how is a flying hovercraft causing anyone any problems? Battlefield to me is a sandbox war game so things like this make it more enjoyable. Like trying to get a hovercraft up the stairs to hold from inside a building.

The rest of the gameplay feels fun and enjoyable. The maps are huge but the player can spawn in vehicles to get around easier. I personally found it more enjoyable to stay near one set of objectives and attack/defend these as this makes the game more exciting.

Some people are finding the bugs unbearable.. but they don't really phase me at all. This could be due to the fact that I play Star Citizen, so I think i've managed to build up a patience for them... Collapse",9,0,5

94,Battlefield 2042,Neravine,"Nov 18, 2021","A great game marred by some fixable technical problems. The bones are rock solid and deliver a satisfying Battlefield sandbox.

There is a histrionic hate bandwagon aimed at this game and it's not a fair representation of what it's like to play it. 13 maps in total including portal and a logic editor for creating custom game modes. There are only 22 guns in the main game for now but when you include the ones from portal that doubles. Ultimately a great BF experience that will improve to become a solid entry in the series' history.
A common complaint is what people are calling “bloom” but should simply be called bullet spread. This is minimized but not eliminated by standing still. You cannot move and shoot in this game with accuracy, but people who are more used to BF 5 or Call of Duty tend to overlook this.

What is ultimately going to happen is lots of people will hop on the hate bandwagon and pass on this game, only to pick it up on sale later and realize they have been missing out. If you’re still skeptical you can sign up for EA Play Pro and try it through that service. You will also gain access to the other BF games that way.

I strongly recommend the game, especially if you prefer the gunplay from BF 1-4 over that of BF 5 or Call of Duty.

96,Battlefield 2042,jeanbonbeurre,"Nov 19, 2021","After 5 days of playing the early access and over 45 hours of play time, all I can say is that the game is nothing short of amazing, everything about what makes the battlefield franchise so good got better:

- having to pick a specific class and being locked to a set of weapon is no longer the case, instead the specialist system give more freedom to mix and match whatever you feel like playing.

- The graphics are truly a showcase of what next gen is all about, the attention to details is outstanding, after finding the right settings and having a descent computer, the game is perfectly smooth. The world feels alive, the ray traced ambiant occlusion adds depth to the world, draw distance is just breathtaking considering the staggering amount of geometry.

- the dynamic weather system drastically shift the tone of the game, you'd be fighting in bright daylight and a few minute later under a heavy storm or the rain. It set the scene for epic fights.

- the game is more squad focused, instead of having a scoreboard, the highlight is now your overall squad position, you can see your squad it at any time and at the end of the game you see how well your squad did compared to others

- there progression system is very well balanced, every weapon have its own mastery, you unlock new barrels, sight, ammo and grip with each new level. Vehicules also have the the same types of unlock, meaning each tanks or helicopter is different depending on what the player choses to equip.

- the gun play managed to hit the perfect balance between too arcade without any recoil, such as abusing spraying, and too strict such as what some tactical shooters have with recoil patterns and player velocity influencing the accuracy. Each guns feels very unique and the sound effects really give them a heavy metallic/heavy impact feel.

- 128 players all out conquest is stunning, starting a game and looking around gives you the impression of being part of something big about to happen, and to be honest, every game end up delivering on this promise: planes flying across the battlefield, rocket passing by, cars jumping from hills, buildings being destroyed, wing suit rushing through the sky and so on, literally everywhere you look, some trailer worthy action is happening

- crossplay is finally here! the bf community is now unified. This was a long awaited feature, the days of browsing custom servers to find a proper game with enough players are gone, now the matchmaking is instead, in literally 10s of search, you are matched in a full game with 128 players.

- DICE even threw in a freebie for those feeling nostalgic, you can now play older maps with older load out if you wanna take a break from regular conquest!

This is just the tip of the iceberg and I could go on and on saying what amazes me about this new entry in the franchise, Dice really did an amazing job and managed to deliver a product up to my expectations while keeping the bf tradition alive. This is indeed a love letter to BF fans and you can tell by the amount of work that went into creating this masterpiece.
Anyone who don't see it is probably too busy actively hating by looking for flaws, listening to rant opinion on YouTube or simply following a meta opinion given to them instead of spending time on the battlefield. If you want to spend countless hours having fun, do yourself a favor and buy this game! Collapse",10,0,4

* I believe more content will come (maps, weapons, operators etc.), so for the start I can't complain with what I got.
* I miss however scoreboard as it was in BFV.
* Chat is chaotic - I never know who is speaking - is it team chat, party chat, global chat... Dice/EA - it is an exam for you guys. I hope that most of the issues get sorted out very soon.

but thats not the real issue, the rubberbanding is. it only happens on the real servers with lots of players on, its unplayable. brings back memories to DayZ, fighting zombies unarmed- but with weapons, except that the bullet deviation + hitreg + rubberbanding (making enemies practically appear 5 places on your screen) just impossible to kill with a 30 round magazine
the game has potential but seeing that the pre-release was stalled by a week, and now their day 1 patch is stalled by.... A MONTH?? while its """"fully released""""
i cant get a refund. 120 euros on this one. im a fan of glitchy games, but this is just not even funny because its too broken to even laugh at
its like experiencing a persistent lag spike
only thing i can do for now is to grind xp and levels by putting ammo box on a drone and flying around to resupply my teammates
the drone doesnt even fly straight, it damn zig zags, sometimes entirely refuses to fly in the direction im telling it to go
the spotting seems to work like hitreg, sometimes you cant spot any enemies for minutes, sometimes you can, but get no xp

politics ruined battlefield, and now theres no scoreboard because immature people had their way, and their insecurities just couldnt handle seeing their teams scoreboard, what is this orwellian nightmare? its Battlefield 2042.
sometimes you get loaded into a server with zero spawnpoints, i consider this the peace mode. theres zero spawnpoints for the whole server
this zombie server stays up for people to join into over and over, really fun chat in that one
oh and the chat? 18+ game where your job is to stab people to death and blow them up
yea you cant use swear words, thats a bit too wild. your characters can though. they could just have done it like in league of legends (easily the most sensitive fangroup of any videogame) where you can toggle profanity filter on/off- but no. the developers team knows better than the individual players

i wish i could compare this game to something, but i really cant, its just all in all a combination of the worst features from all games ive been at - so far

theres also no useful anti tank weaponry until youre lvl 60 and level up the .50 cal rifle well enough to get armor piercing, and mines at first available at lvl 38, so until then your team just contiously gets mauled by hovercrafts (and you cant revive them when they get run over)

there is some potential with the game but every time i dreadfully click the BF2042 exe, i can just feel my mood shriveling away, traumatized by the caustic burns of the lacking features, and lacking gameplay, and .. lacking game
even lacking chat

i wish i could refund, just the chat being limited to team only and **** i was gonna say kindergarten language but even back in kindergarten profanity was allowed- i dont know what to call this, politically correct language or just straight up tyrannical freedom of speech infringement- just the chat would be enough for me to refund it

this game feels like a stupid experiment, a moneygrab
makes me want to go back to the hopeless cheater jungle of call of duty, or just quit gaming all together
extremely depressing.
playing this game and realizing that they still didnt fix anything since the beta, 6 months ago was it? just feels like youre in a hopeless abusive relationship with a prostitute- thats right you paid for it, if youre masochist mate you better take off your pants because this will blow up your crotch with suffering.

they did lately add a feature where your character will sneeze if you were afk for about a minute in game, though. so theyre doing something. theres no doubt that you will require an up-to-date corona passport to play this game, maybe the hitreg and all those other problems is really based on social credit score? the whole combination feels omnious.

i might also add they have this little mode called hazard
you spend 5 minutes to get into the game
sometimes you die in 10 seconds
takes about 5 minutes to quit the game also

this game is an abomination of online dictatorship, hardware bottlenecking and hell-breaking glitches

you may dodge the lag issues if you throw 5000 dollars into your computer, but i personally dont think BF2042 is worth that much

i dont think a formal apology for this game would be enough, DICE might have to start up their own trauma treatment facility or something for this oops

only way they can screw this one up more is if they made it so hovercrafts cant climb skyscrabers
because thats the only viable way to get to the last damn base on breakthrough, you go 3 men up elevator to be shot right in the eyes by i kid you not, 10 rpgs and 3 battletanks, on the rooftop. no stairs. dice? did you try this game out? ever? aprils fools? Collapse",0,0,1

Yes there are issues, including extreme weapon bloom, balancing etc etc and yes some features are still missing. This however, does not make Bf2042 a bad game, it is simply a game that has been released too soon. With time, given that EA does not cut funding due to all the negative press, the game can become fantastic. There is a lot of potential here, and with time I think DICE can deliver a spectacular experience, given the opportunity.

Once i upgraded my cpu from i5 2500k to ryzen 5 5600g i went from 20-30 fps unplayable mess to 80+ fps, but im at 1366x768 but i have seen people get 60fps with my setup at 1080p.

Also the game is great, balance is so much better than Battlefield 4, no JDAM Cancer (yes i used jdams in bf4, but **** that **** for overall gameplay) and patches are coming out to get better performance and improve game, alot of problems have allready been fixed. Also the graphics are nice, even on low it is the best graphics i have seen from any game. 128 players franctly is amazing, the amount of fire and action really makes you feel on the battlefield, some objectives need optimizing, but really its a step in the right direction. The class optimization is great, allowing you to change attachments in game.

(the graphics looked terrible on my old system, for some reason when you have a higher end system the hardware allows the graphics to shine, dont ask me why, but im guessing its something to do with texture processing)

-The balance in this game is great, with so many lock on weapons, mostly everything has the right amount of damage applied.

-Helicopters arent near invincible like in previous titles, can be locked on using ground based weapons alot easier, . Such a good idea considering in bf4 the helicopters could survive a very long time and be quite hard to hit as a ground player.

-Gunplay is fun.

-No game breaking microtransactions to speak of as of writing this review. Or i may have missed it but i didnt notice it while customizing my loadouts, thier was like 5 skins available for each loadout with normal versions and like 10 with ultimate, so you have to buy ultimate to get better rewards and the likes, but compeletely optional.

-Portal, what a great idea, and fun to play. I hope they bring more classic maps from all those games, exspecially 1942 for me.

Cons:
- Weapon aim at range can be somewhat hard to hit other players, but small iissue really
- Didnt get rid of Jdams entirely, instead it takes alot longet to kill which is great, but just annoying for ground vehicles, why cant thier just be a anti armor secondary that is free aim then it solves the problem, but much better now than in battlefield 4.
- The bugs at launch, but alot has been ironed out, for example turret glitchiing and elevators etc, all minor issues, and quite amusing at first, but they are better removed.

Time will tell, all the initial bad reviews were down to the bugs, and performance, shame it wasnt released later because now all these people going to have a sour taste in their mouth. Anyway the player base is still healthy.

60,Battlefield 2042,Bobaganoosh,"Dec 2, 2021","What even is this game?

They tried to make a Battlefield-inspired Apex/Fortnite type game, but it doesn't do that type of gameplay as well as either of those, while simultaneously breaking the mold that is Battlefield.

PC performance is completely inconsistent and doesn't utilize my hardware well at all. CPU sits at 40-50% while GPU is around 70% at 1440p, but I can't get more FPS even if I turn settings down.

I have been waiting until a couple patches came out before writing this because I wanted to see how they did with fixes and updates. They've fixed some of the collision issues, but every patch introduced more issues and game breaking problems (like mouse doesn't work to look left or right...at all...without completely deleting your movement settings in your profile file).

The latest patch also added a santa-clause and woody (toy story) skin...and santa's sleigh skins for vehicles. If you needed to know what this game is about...it's monetizing skins. The lead designers is a guy from Candy Crush that left the studio the day the game launched. All the people who loved this game series left a long time ago. It's dead.

Game launched with:
*Hit-reg is broken and they don't know how to fix it.
*Server lag is a constant issue they don't know how to fix.
Graphics fell off a cliff since BF:V and BF1.
*No scoreboard and they've made it clear they don't even care to add it back.
*Huge bullet-spread (think star wars blasters, or random number generator for where your bullets go)...they've improved this a little, but with the broken hit-reg it barely matters.
*No server browser, it does matchmaking only, so you play the same maps again and again, no persistent lobbies even, so you keep ending up with new people.
*You can't play with more than 3 friends on the same server.
*No Voice chat in game. This might(?) get fixed.
*No all-chat. They've given no indication they'll fix this.
*You couldn't revive people if they were touching a wall...any wall...might be better since patches?*Specialists..omg this is a joke. They're terrible, their quips at the end of the match are just horribly cringe and annoying. You hear the same ""one-liners"" again...and again...and again...and again...
*And between the items above, the team-play is gone.

*maps are awfully designed. Breakthrough is actually impossible on some maps due to cap points on top of buildings where defenders can spawn vehicles on top and just camp elevators. There's practically no destruction. Some small copy-paste buildings that are usually plain-white buildings with absolutely nothing in them can be destroyed, and some walls of square outpost buildings can be *poofed* away, but there's none of the micro-destruction from previous games, and there's no levolution or gameplay-changing destruction events. There's almost no cover in areas between capture-points. The maps are mostly flat, open, killing fields with nothing in them. They didn't spend any time in the design phase thinking about how the map will flow and how people will move from point to point so they just left them barren.

*every map starts with all the vehicles having to go through a tiny choke-point at the spawn, so the tanks, hovercrafts, whatever just all funnel into each other and flip over, half explode, it's just stupid. Hovercrafts launched way too overpowered and can drive straight up the side of a building, so they were everywhere. They patched them to blow up if more than one person looks at them at the same time, but didn't fix the physics at all.

*there are only 22 guns. I hope you like them all a lot (you won't). With the bullet-spread at launch, only one gun in the game actually worked and it was an SMG. First patch, they improved the bullet-spread on other guns, but added recoil to that SMG to nerf that too.

*Every match starts with about 6 cutscenes, then ends with cut-scenes, there's no scoreboard, progression is a mystery, you can't change your loadout between matches, and if you want to try and snag a vehicle early, you can't change your loadout until you die, even though there's over 30 seconds until the match actually starts after you pick your vehicle.

So at this point, I'm sure you get the point that it isn't a good Battlefield game, isn't a good Apex-competitor (even though it tries to be), and with all the issues and lack of content, it just really isn't a good game. I have put several hours into this and have tried to like it and have fun with it, but it's just fundamentally bad. And it isn't just the bugs that made it bad, it was the design decisions that they stand behind vehemently. EA and DICE are completely tone-deaf to the community. They don't care. We all expected launch bugs (it is BF after all), but this is a whole other level of no QA being done at all before launch and what they've decided to make is just a bad game. Collapse",1,0,0

It filled a great niche between milsim games like ARMA and twitchy games like COD. Using class based objective gameplay, with a slightly faster pace but still utilizing teamwork, tactics including balanced and fun vehicle play. All that is gone now.

BF2042 is not even a BF game to me, the specialists are hokey cringe worthy arena shooter stuff, and we can tell this was the supposed to be the semi-arena shooter Battlefield. Hazard Zone was really the only intended game mode, the Conquest and especially Portal modes are panic adds. But it all just falls so short.

Then there is the myriad of technical issues that I won't document here, they are being talked about all over the place already.

For all intents and purposes they have abandoned the entire franchise for this misguided redesign. The best I honestly think we can hope for is this release to fail miserably and the developers be forced to do some soul searching and come back with a legit, back to the roots BF ""7""

Les spécialistes ne sont là que pour copier les Moba et autres Apex, R6 Siège et consort, leurs capacités ne sont pas équilibrées, le teamplay est encore plus inexistant qu'avant (on ne sait même pas ce qu'ont choisi comme capacité de support nos équipiers de la squad !!), l'individualisme est roi et chacun fait sa sauce dans son coin (quand il n'est pas en train de courir dans des décors vides pour chercher un truc à faire).

Entre le fait que les dev n'avaient pas prévus les centaines de fermes à XP à la sortie du jeu, l'absence d'une quelconque curation qui rend la navigation dans les serveurs totalement hasardeuse, la suppression des titres et description pour tenter d'endiguer le farm à XP, l'impossibilité de noter ou de donner des tags à une expérience, réduit grandement l'intérêt du mode.

1) Class system is totally broken. For example if I switch class to medic during the game I do not have ability to heal friendly players! In Battlefield V there were no problems with switching classes

2) In 80% of cases I am getting killed by tanks or other armored vehicles or snipers.

3) Every time I switch on the game I am experiencing massive stuttering during first minute of gameplay making the game unplayable. I have $4000 modern PC.

4) Respawn is also **** up. When I respawn, the next second I often get killed by enemy which is nearby. The only thing I appreciate about respawn is that it's faster than in Battlefield V.

5) When the game is over you cannot see any scoreboard. It just not there...

6) There are characters and weapons from Battlefield 3, 1942 and bad company 2. Why?

7) Overall the way how you want to edit your classes, join the games is stupid and not that nice. If there would be simple list of game modes, e.g. :Team Deathmatch, Rush, Breaktrough etc. it would be much more nicer instead of weird rectangles named all-out warfare, hazard zone and portal. It does not make any sense for players.

8) No campaign!!!

In conclusion, if DICE or whoever is responsible for this game will take care of it, remove the bugs and update the game - more maps, bug fixes, fix issues with classes, I will be considering to install this game, but it's such a garbage I had to uninstall it. Collapse",1,0,0

First you get yourself into a horrendous User interface which was created with no UX designer in sight. You get 3 tiles and a bland and unintuitive game menü with inconsistent options all around.

After this you finally get to the game, which is bland, boring fast paced arcade shooter with no resembelance what a Battlefield game should be. The gameplay just like the worst Call of Duties, theres literally no teamplay, the specialist system has no place in a Battlefield game.
Best of all. Everybody looks the same. You can't tell friend from foe, but don't worry. Half of the time, when you open fire, the enemy didn't get hit anyways. The netcode and the hitregistration is awful to the point where you can finish a clip to an enemy who walks away with 100HP.

Let's also talk about how unoptimized this game is. Literally runs like crap on configs which should pull 140+ fps. I'm talking pulling 50-70frames instead of 140+. Oh, you want to tune your settings to get this joke of a game run better? Good luck with that. Between Ultra and Low settings, you'll gain around 8-15fps tops. DLSS also not working. How nice.

EA and DICE has a tendency to abandon unsuccesful projects, so if you don't like to gamble wait around 4-6months and if the problems seems to be fixed get it on a sale.
Until then, go play a game which actually was finished development before publishing.

THIS GAMES NEEDS AT LEAST 4 MONTHS OF DEV TIME.

tldr: It runs crap, its boring and bland, its buggy and probably the live service will be terminated.

If you bought it, try for a refund, if you didin't buy it, dont't even think about it.

88,Battlefield 2042,TheNoobPolice,"Jan 9, 2022","This game offers absolutely nothing to core FPS players who played infantry only, objective-based tactical modes in the past, like Domination, Frontlines, or even a proper TDM mode.

You are forced to play silly massive player count modes against overpowered vehicles to unlock anything in the game. Literally, there are no infantry modes that are part of the main game experience. In a game where the vast majority of players are infantry.

The gameplay can summarised as a ""run for 5 minutes trying to find an enemy and then get blown up by a helicopter"" constantly looping subroutine.

The game has a lot of bugs not relevant to the design. I like bloom gunplay in general when it's done right like BF3, but in this game it's sabotaged by hitbox and server hit registration issues. I wouldn't trust DICE to have the subtlety to understand the right feedback from the community regarding what are bugs and what are design issues.

The worst-in-industry UI, huge gamut of missing features/modes and appalling performance of the game are all absolutely unforgivable.

EA, please bin this franchise, and spend a minimum of 5 years dissolving DICE and rebuilding a new dev team sorting the wheat from the chaff internally to arrive at a level of quality we saw in titles like BF3 for their time in some new and exciting IP's.

91,Battlefield 2042,Reph3at,"Dec 1, 2021","Everything good comes to an end and, sadly, what we're witnessing is the end of Battlefield. Not only as our beloved franchise but, I'm afraid, as a title. Remember Medal of Honor? EA basically deleted it after Warfighter's fiasco. I had really high hopes for this game, I've been playing Battlefield since BF3 came out, so it's 10 years now. I really loved 3 and 4 and Hardline to some extent. The problems began with Battlefield V - it was ruined by poor marketing and political correctness, and when one year after it's release it finally started to play well, EA decided to drop it's support. This time, EA deceived us with marketing referring to previous installments in the series (the trailer that was released in June had parts of Battlefield 3, BFBC2 and other community favorite moments/footages). The game that has been released is far from how it was being teased. Map design is poor - that's a result of bumping player count to 128. The maps lack details that were present in previous games. There is barely any destruction. As for the specialists, while I can live with them, cringy lines playing after every game are just too much to handle. There are just 22 weapons in the game, this is nothing when compared to Battlefield 4 which had over 70 of them. As others pointed out, we lost lots of basic features (which DICE now calls legacy features lmao). And finally, we come to the technical aspect. The game is far from being finished. Hitreg is terrible, UI is a joke - sometimes I don't even know whether a toggle is enabled or disabled. To me, this is an unfinished mess, which started as a battle royale game but then it was (poorly) remade into a Battlefield game. The only positive thing about this game is that thanks to it's disastrous launch, Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 3 servers (the ones with DLC too!) are populated again so I can play quality titles instead of this crap.

Negatives:
- The biggest issue with this game, which cannot be fixed, is that the maps are just too damn big. There is way too much running around aimlessly, before being gunned down in 1 sec and rinse and repeat. Even 128 players feels too few for the size of the maps. It seems like DICE / EA looked at Battle Royal games and said: ""Hey, people love huge maps, let's do that."" Completely ignoring the fact that a Battlefield game is a very different gameplay experience from a BR. Just like BFV's Firestorm, it seems something that was pushed down the dev's throats by upper management to chase a trend.

- On top of that, the map design is just bland and empty.
- No scoreboard, which has been in every FPS game, since forever.
- No chatting with opposite team. I understand online games can be toxic, but not even being able to say ""GG, wel played"" after a match, is so frustrating and feels like an ""empty"" experience.
- The performance is terrible even on high end PC's. The graphics don't even look that much better than BFV to warrant such a performance hit.

Positives:
- The graphics look good in some cases.
- Some parts of the maps look cool
- The new specialist classes are perhaps an interesting addition. Don't really mind it.

While CODMW2019 remastered an classic and added modern and new features, BF2042 takes several steps back.

It is clear to me that the Battlefield DNA that was so clearly in Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 has degraded heavily with time and I think the biggest culprit is Star Wars Battlefront 1-2.

Creative tactics are no longer encouraged to win flags/battles. Instead it's just ""go in and try to have fun in the chaos"" and ""oh, because the chaos we designed poorly, we're not going to show you how bad you did in it"".

What made me buy Battlefield over other shooters is no longer here. What DICE thinks is Battlefield, is something else.

We no longer have single-player, which Im fine with. But I am not sure what we get in return?
A ""dark"" backstory with specialists spamming tacky/hacky/cringy one liners?

There are countless of features that were in BF4, BF1 and BFV that are not present here.
Features that players saw as staples of the Battlefield DNA.

The 128 player mode does not add any value, I could see DICE doing 80 players or something, but the game is obviously less stable with 128 and does not add value at all. It's more chaos instead of the ""controlled chaos"" BF players are used to.

Me and my friend could cause serious damage to the enemy team with creative ways in previous Battlefield games, but this time DICE decided we are all just more bricks to their walls.

I would not recommend it to anyone as it is now (2021-12), not because of bugs but because of the obvious discrepancy between the players image of Battlefield and DICE, they are very, very, very out of touch with their own playerbase. Collapse",5,0,0

As of now there is just so much wrong with the game. If you are playing on the older generation of consoles, the delay is so bad the game is nearly unplayable. For the newest generation of consoles, there are still problems with his registration. The decision to go with specialists instead of the traditional solider/class system was a big mistake. The specialists do have the traditional classes rolled into them to an extent, though it does not work very well. Gameplay is not enjoyable, as vehicles such as the Volte, Nightbird, and more are extremely overpowered, to the point where they are game breaking. There are certain guns as well such as the K30 among a few that are leagues above the rest, which puts newer players who do not have these guns at a disadvantage. In addition to all of this, when you are downed, there is a decent chance your character will be half inside a wall, which makes teammates unable to revive you. I'm honestly not sure this game can be salvaged. With other games recently released such as Halo Infinite that I am playing much more of now, and even returning to Battlefield 1 instead, I think this game might be in a doomed state.

Было бы банально написать, что Dice пробила дно, скорее она на нем установила победный флаг - методом утопления. Не буду писать про технические проблемы - их правят и поправят еще. Не буду писать про скудный арсенал - это тоже решаемо и не критично. Но упорото все остальное. Карты - это пустыни, по которым хаотично дрифтуют стритрейсеры, врезаясь в дома, друг в друга, тараня заборы и деревья, в попытке задавить хоть кого-то. Меньше всего это похоже на поле боя. Скорее больше напоминает Безумный Макс, только в постановке ментально покалеченных. В этих бескрайних пустынях разбросаны точки притяжения игроков, где творится безумие и хаос. Респауны сделаны просто гениально - вы обороняете одиноко стоящий небоскреб, выбираете точку возрождения на нем и появляетесь в 150 метрах от него - с произвольной стороны. Иногда вам везет, а иногда прямо с той стороны, где в данный момент небоскреб атакует команда противников - просто посреди них. Кстати, у вас нет какого-то определенного противника - ваш соперник это такие же вы, но под другим флагом. Меню просто плохое и неудобное. Нет счета, нет нормального браузера серверов, плохие индикаторы на поле боя, непонятно как вы сыграли относительно других, зато расскажут, кто больше всех поднял, а кто больше всех пометил врагов. Время между матчами забивают какие-то непонятные заставки и пролеты камеры, в этот момент вы не можете, например, заниматься своими делами, настраивая арсенал или приступить скорее к игре - сидите и смотрите одно и тоже в сотый раз. Конечно авторы попытались все эти недостатки чем-то компенсировать - им это удалось: после окончания раунда вас ждут роскошные стойки персонажей и смешные фразочки от них же. Если бы мне было лет 8-10 - я был бы в восторге. Режим портал игру никак не спасает, сколько бы хвалебных отзывов про него не рассказывали и не писали. Это неплохой фановый режим, не более. Карт там мало, играют в него тоже не особо. Про хазардзон вообще писать смысла не вижу. Играя в эту батлу возникают вопросы ""зачем"": зачем это выпустили под тайтлом баттлефилда, зачем из этого пытались сделать баттлефилд - непонятно. Эта игра не стоит ни 2300, ни 1600, за которые можно это купить в данный момент. Рублей 300-500 вполне достойная цена, чтобы вы могли бы задаться своими вопросами ""зачем"", но вот только зачем вам это делать.

-What multiplayer FPS game doesn't have a scoreboard?
-What battlefield game doesn't have a server browser for conquest?
-Why cant i choose my squad?

-Hits not registering.
-Dying while stationary
-Kicked out of the game session with no error or explanation
-Cant Join games due to ""Unable to load persistence data"" error which happened the whole week, unable to join games for days,

46,Battlefield 2042,Anarkroft,"Jan 14, 2022","Ha, enfin un opus Battlefield dans la guerre moderne !
Ce préambule me donne le sourire : on part déjà sur le bon pied. Ça faisait trop longtemps qu'on enchainait des épisodes première ou seconde guerre, pas du tout adaptés à la jouabilité d'un BF.
On retrouve donc nos armes sur un fond de guerre moderne, avec beaucoup de changements au tableau (et ça aussi ça fait du bien, les épisodes qui s'enchainent sans grand changement, c'est sympa 5mn mais pour le côté ludique, on repassera).
Au programme : les classes sont des prétextes interchangeables (un médecin peut s'équiper d'une trousse de munitions ou bien d'un lance roquette), ce qui est pratique et polyvalent pour toutes les situations (+ possibilité de changer en cours d'une vie selon conditions). On découvre un côté ""héros"" comme dans pleinnnns de jeux à la mode, mais il faut surtout y voir des presets d'équipements. Toujours des paliers avec des niveaux liés à de l'expérience engrangée lors des parties dans le but de débloquer des classes, des armes ou encore des véhicules.
Enfin un rééquilibrage des véhicules, les deux derniers opus leur faisant beaucoup trop la part belle (avions destructeurs et intuables, chars beaucoup trop puissants, enfin surtout l'infanterie pas assez puissante contre les blindés, des anti aériens inutiles et inutilisés, etc etc....) = presque tout ça est fini ! Comme n'importe quelle classe peut s'équiper d'un lance roquette ou d'un anti-aérien, la suprématie des véhicules est limitée : ils sont puissants, mais destructibles sans requérir 20 soldats au lance roquette. Il reste toujours le Z11 (pardon, il s'appelle Nightbird maintenant) qui est toujours trop puissant contre l'infanterie, mais c'est nettement moins pire qu'avant !
Côté technique, c'est bien mais pas exempt de défauts. Le jeu est beaucoup (trop) consommateur pour le processeur, tandis que la carte graphique se repose; graphismes au mini ou au maxi, pas de gain de FPS pour qui aurait une carte graphique digne de ce nom. C'est clairement un point à améliorer, même avec un I7 dernière génération ça ne sera pas Byzance.
Egalement au programme, le côté ""mod"" (mot ici mal employé, il s'agit plutôt de serveurs avec des règles personnalisées). Il est possible de jouer à d'anciennes cartes (par ex. de Bad Compagny 2), avec les règles et armes de l'époque, ou tout bonnement avec les armes du jeu normal. C'est une excellente idée, qui apporte une liste de maps jouables plus importante (mais pourquoi ne pas les avoir intégrées au jeu de base, que diable !).

Malheureusement, on n'échappe pas aux modes actuelles du jeu vidéo : serveurs accessibles uniquement en matchmaking (génial, comment attendre 30s pour rien !), et un genre de ""play of the game"" en fin de partie, avec les persos qui sortent leur phrase toute faite : pour ce que ça apporte (c.a.d rien), ils auraient pu s'en passer.

En résumé, un bon épisode. Pas parfait, mais nettement plus plaisant à jouer que les derniers. Au moins on est sur une bonne progression :) Collapse",7,0,0

No Singleplayer so the developers can focus on the best multiplayer experience. Well, for the BF2042 Core-Game it's just a joke. So many bugs (Respawn bug, crashes, Notworking Weapons etc. just check out reddit, you will find plenty of guys having trouble even with decent gaming rigs). I personaly think 2042 is boring, good graphics, gameplay feelds good, but there is nothing really new, like BF4 with new skins (well there are Hovercrafts and VTOLS now), the maps are not as iconic as the older ones, but well new content to come - I actually hope they track down the plenty of bugs first.
Talking about ""Battlefield Portal"" I'm pretty impressed, playing old modes and maps from 1942, Bad Company 2 and BF3 is fun! And - fun fact - in that mode I don't experience any bugs.

They have already removed my favorite game mode ""Rush"" due to their dwindling play count. Not only that, but the player count is so low I have difficulty finding servers of any game mode. Eventually, when you due they are filled with AI-controlled ""bots"" due to lack of real players.

Now let's pretend you DO get into a server.. you're welcomed with server lag, fps drops, guns with horrendous hit registration, and bugs such as your character getting stuck in limbo after a death which is only fixed by closing and restarting the who game making you miss out on everything earned in that round of play.

Quite simply it is so horrendous there should probably be a class-action lawsuit filed for false advertisement and/or fraud because there is no possibility a AAA developer the likes of DICE and EA should be able to sell a game that is fundamentally broken in every way imaginable.

Flying a Helicopter, teleporting through the air and into buildings.
- Poorly optimized. Similar framerate on low and high settings. Maybe a 5-10fps difference.
- No Squad management in-game, can't switch between squads for example. Can't even see members of other squads.
- No scoreboard.
- No classes (There will be ""meta"" loadout and specialist combinations that everyone will use).
- Un-populated Portal, Breakthrough and Hazard Zone servers. This might be a region issue, as the matchmaking seems to only match on low latency.
- Dice said if matchmaking fails to find a match, it will start a game with bots. I have yet to see this happen.
- Can't host portal servers (Global quota reached error)
- No dedicated / self-managed servers.
- User interface can be counterintuitive and confusing in certain areas.
- Numerous balancing issues. For example helicopter AA rocket lock-on jets, you need to be extremely close. Yet infantry AA seems to have a much further range.
The PP-29 is the most powerful short to medium range weapon. The Assualt rifles don’t compete against it very well. The AK has extreme recoil to the point where it is very underpowered medium range.
- Hovercraft is the most meta thing in the game. Oblivious to rocket fire and tank shells.
- It feels like the maps don’t encourage tactical gameplay very much. In comparison to Battlefield 3 maps for example.
- Most buggy and glitchy Battlefield I have ever played.

Personal Background:
Started playing competitively during the Bad Company 2 years and continued throughout Battlefield 3 until the launch of BF4. Took part in many tournaments and competitions. Was looking forward to a good comeback to those modern/future eras, with good tactical gameplay and map layouts.

Conclusion:
Overall the game can be fun to play at times (when it works as expected). There are some good innovations and some not so great/confusing. And I can imagine a much better experience on a high-end machine, running a 3080 or 2080 graphics card. There is a lot of potential with Portal, but that feels wasted without dedicated self-managed servers and the inability to host due to ""Global quota reached"" errors.

Recommend waiting a while until the game is out of ""early access"" and also having a high enough spec-ed machine before buying. Collapse",0,0,0

Battlefield 2042 is a mediocre version of what EA would do if their goal was to launch something in a similar state that Battlefield V had at its launch. It's pretty bad. Apart from the glitches the 128 players thing is an expensive gimmick that isn't supported by the tech and gameplay design, and all the mishmash just not fun for some reason. Add to that a ton of lacking and absent essential features like server browsers, teamwork indicators and score tracking and movement variety and the list of downgrades would sound like we're talking about a mobile version of a PC game.

I can't give a higher score for copying the older classics in the Portal feature. So there: All out War is pretty bad. Hazard Zone is okay. To continue treating the customer base like greedy bastards is way out of line. Collapse",2,0,0

However, since they ARE barely distinguishable, it makes it all the more noticeable when you're surrounded by 8 wingsuits, 7 identical ghillie suits, and 6 shields. Like a step and repeat background.

The bugs are bad. Really bad, to the point that even if they all get fixed, this launch needs to factor into the score. But even without the bugs, I'll be REALLY surprised if I'm still being pulled to play this in a few weeks. Customization feels empty. Certain guns have glaring issues with aiming and bloom so you're railroaded into an even smaller selection if you want good results in gameplay. Frustrating lack of small and scattered vehicles means conquest railroads you into an even smaller selection of specialists in case you get stranded and need more mobility. Portal takes older more successful games, and slathers them in pretty visuals, but problematic design in gunplay and audio, and no progression so you're mostly running on nostalgia, which is smothered by, well, yeah, the new game mechanics.

It has its moments. but 2 good moments for every 3 bad moments is a pretty accurate ratio, if not a little generous. Hope the issues get fixed so it can be passable, but even then, down the road, it'll be remembered as much and as confused as hardline. A weird experiment that ultimately fails. Collapse",4,0,0

A game that crashes even more after every patch, a shooter game where shooting still doesnt work after months from release, full of bugs, non intuitive UI, super bad performance, unbalanced gameplay, clown specialists that makes me feel like playing a comedy shooter when the exodus movie gave me the feeling this will be even more grittier than battlefield 1. Now that was a fukin lie.

The missleading marketing was so good that so many people including myself ended up preordering the game.. This should be illegal and is similar worse like CP2077 when it released.

- No scoreboard as we knew it
- No Server Browser for AOW
- No VOIP
- Crossplay invite friends is buggy
- U can only join a match with a maximum of 4 people (one squad)
- 128 players are way to much
- Way to huge maps that makes me feel playing a copy pasted far cry
- Almost no cover and IF there is cover it can do electric dmg to you or even explode, like wtf?
- No Squad play and almost no XP rewards for specific gameplay actions
- No Content, no battlepass
- Almost no destruction just scripted stuff like the rocket on orbital
- No gritty atmosphere but fortnite style saturation
- Most cringy voicelines ever with voice actors that doesnt even fit to the specialist
- Netcode is a mess
- Hitreg is a mess
- Aim assist for console players is a mess
- I could continue.. but I wont waste to much of my lifetime for this.

Portal with restricted XP to 300 a minute and NO ribbons. You can gain 6K XP in 20 minutes while making 25-35K XP in 20 Minutes in a standard AOW round if you are good at battlefield. This is a joke. Who made such bad calculations? No one even plays portal anymore because of the restrictions.

Hazard Zone.. well I dont even want to start here. There is literally no value in this mode. You try to extract and obtain coins you then can spend to play your loadout you can play in AOW anyway. Just to do THE EXACT SAME THING you did before being able to buy your loadout with coins. No other rewards nothing. This game mode is already dead like Firestorm 2.0 back in BF5. Wasted. They hyped this mode into oblivion. Holy moly..

Content got delayed to ""early"" summer. Scoreboard got delayed from february to march. This is a joke. What the heck happened to DICE? This is not battlefield and this is no live service. This is a bad aprils fool joke.

13,Battlefield 2042,TheoML,"Nov 17, 2021","List of some of the features that have been removed in this Battlefield.

Core Features:

No single-player story

No standard server browser

Fewer standardized game modes (Can't even play TDM or smaller scale modes without relying on community servers. Really?)

Fewer base game maps than any other title (even including portal the map count is only 13)

No persistent lobbies (seriously why do I have to matchmake after EVERY round?)

Fewer in-game assignments (none outside of cosmetic unlocks)

No class system

Less character customization options (than BF5)

No profile progress/stats page in the menu

No battle log/stats tracker for other players

No global leader boards

No end of round assignment progress screen

No dog tags (they still sort of exist I guess?)

No custom emblems

Fewer achievements

No medals

No swelling crescendo of dramatic music near the end of a match (obviously this is the most egregious of the list)

Less destruction (only a small handful of destructible buildings on each map)

No map altering levolution (There sort of is but the maps are so big, anything that changes doesn't really affect how you play)

No cross-game profile screen (BF 4, HL, 1, and V were all linked by a menu if you owned them digitally, was a neat feature.)

No spectator mode

No permanent community servers (would be useful for clans and events)

Infantry Gameplay:
Fewer guns (even including all the portal guns, BF4 still had more at launch)
Fewer infantry gadgets No manual leaning No diving while swimming No high wall vaulting No crouch sprinting No backwards prone No explosion knockback No rolling after falling from heights No ammo or health pickup off teammates No scope zeroing No thermal optics No indirect fire gadgets Less anti-tank launchers (Come on man only one?) No lock-on launchers (The M5 works with the SOFLAM but that requires 2 people) No AP mines/claymores No static weapon emplacements No fortification building No resupply stations No suppression mechanic (This one I don't mind but I'm including everything) Vehicles: Fewer vehicle types (and separate vehicle progression per faction even though they are functionally identical... why???) No naval vehicles (Except I guess the hovercraft technically) No vehicle gunner direction indicator No lock on direction indicator No vehicle enter/exit animations No tank turret decoupling (This was so great in BF4!) Less vehicle driver/pilot customization options No tank zoom customization options No tank gunner customization options No heli gunner secondary weapons No separate heli/fixed-wing controls No control input while looking behind/free looking in aircraft (BF1 and V pilots, this one is gonna absolutely suck for you guys) Scoring System No squad wipe scoring No player damage points No vehicle damage points No vehicle kill assist points No headshot bonus No long-range kill bonus No assist counts as kill bonus No squad objective play bonus Oversimplified teamplay scoring (i.e. healing a teammate always gives you +5xp rather than the amount of health you give) Squad and Teamwork No commander No special squad call-in abilities No squad field upgrades No in-game VOIP Fewer factions (with almost nothing to give the 2 factions any distinction) No cross-team chat No ""create new squad"" option No ""promote to squad leader"" option No clans No view of squadmates while in the spawn screen No ""Medic incoming"" indicator in downed state No rank names/icons, just a number. UI and Quality of Life Less control customization options Less UI customization options No HUD/icon opacity customization No HUD scaling customization options No gunsight reticle customization options No network performance graph No individual player scoreboard Less detail in the 'who killed you' screen No ultrawide monitor support Very poor friend joining system No console aim assist (big fat **** you to console players there, dice) Collapse",2,0,0

Such a shame because they always had the ‘cool guys’ approach to FPS’s. But with this new game, all the traits of a good Battlefield experience have been lost.

Too many standard features are missing, the game is nowhere near finished in terms of gameplay and it’s aesthetic glitches galore.

The concept is great, but the execution is lacking in all areas. It’s not competitive because progression purely around unlocking guns. Even winning a match basically means nothing.

There’s no team focus anymore because you can’t rely on anyone in your squad. Past Battlefields used the class system to balance the fact you may not be talking with anyone in your squad, you certainly depend on them. No, free for all.

Because there’s no squad focus, you’re left traversing massive maps on your own, no incentive to mob up with a squad.

The gunplay is inconsistent, guns used to feel powerful, and balances to a class, now, guns that have the same stats (literally) the same, feel vastly different. The sound design has flourishes of what we’ve come to expect. But for a 2021 game, it’s a massive step back. All the weapons have this low bass tone.

The UI is one of the biggest let downs. All the tried and tested elements from previous games are gone. They’ve remastered it from the group up, problem is, they’ve not done a good job. The colour choice create accessibility problem, the control mapping is all off and lack of features you need to have a clear idea of focus and progression. Gone.

_

All they had to do was remaster BF4 with all the things they learnt on BF1 and 5 and package it up with the new No Pat lore, big maps and it would have been the best BF game ever.

Maps are too big (even for 128 players) so there's not a lot of actiion compared to other games, too many open spaces, bloom fire system which makes gunfights RNG based, destruction of surroundings is poor, leaderboard doesn't make any sense now, BF V ttk and of course a lot of bugs.
I have to say that graphics and models look good + sound design is great.

This game's player base has dropped to laughably low numbers, the only people that still play this are too good at this game for it to be fun for any casual player as the casual player base has left to go play literally anything else. Complete lack of games modes or any real substance that makes you want to come back to play this game. Only positive I can come up with is that it is much easier to run now than at launch. I am deleting this game after this review update. I hate it. F**k you EA for making this.

This game was free for me and I feel ripped off.

My friend gave me a code for this game that came with a part for his pc so I got this game completely for free.

Wow this game is just horrible. Not even going to touch on the lack of features since that seems to be the #1 complaint. This game runs absolutely horrible on a 2070s and 3700x. Had to drop the settings hard to get a stable frame rate. Servers are terrible, hit detection is non existent, and lots of game breaking bugs.

55,Battlefield 2042,MowMow,"Nov 19, 2021","Battlefield 2042 is a game with potential, but that's just it. There are very big issues in its current state which is why I think the game definitely needs more time to fix.

So what are some of the game's biggest issues? First, optimization for PC is bad. There are many moments where I would get massive FPS drops downwards to -48FPS in 1440p. I've lowered the settings to low, but even then it still wasn't enough. The game is very CPU bound and unfortunately does not utilize it properly.

Second, there are gameplay decisions that are questionable. Of course, I'm talking about the Specialists which replaces the classic Battlefield classes that many fans and veterans are used to. Unfortunately outside of Hazard Zone, it does not work. Specialists essentially promotes a more lone-wolf playstyle in Conquest or Breakthrough contributing to a more selfish playstyle. I would argue it severely underhanded a lot of the teamwork elements that Battlefield was known for.

Third, the base game lacks content. Outside of Portal mode, vanilla BF2042 only has a few selection of weapons and customization. There are a total of 22 weapons currently. While I have no doubt that more weapons will get added over time, I just wished we would have more selection and variety right from the start. Hazard Zone is also VERY lackluster at the moment, there are very serious balancing issues within the game mode. However, I think Hazard Zone can be salvaged with a series of balancing passes and content updates to add more depth to the game mode.

Fourth, the menus and UI is atrocious. Navigating the menus is very clunky and at times frustrating to use. There is too much clicking I need to do just to customize my weapons.

Fifth, the game is missing features from previous Battlefield games. There is no stat tracking page which means no scoreboard or leaderboard systems. Mechanics from previous games are also missing such as the movement system from BFV (i.e. rolling, grabbing high ledges, etc). Also the removal of All Chat is just unnecessary.

With all this being said, I truly believe that a person CAN have fun playing this game. Yes, the game has major issues. YES, the game has bugs. Does the game deserve a score equal to that of Ride to Hell Retribution with 0-2 scores? No I don't think so, because there is potential for the game to be good. For example, Portal mode is where I spent the majority of hours into and it is incredibly amazing reliving the classic Battlefield moments. If DICE ever decides to fix many of the core issues of the game such as removing the Specialists (which I don't think they will) or reworking the Specialists to fit more into their designated class roles as well as fixing bugs and adding content. I believe the game CAN get better over time. I only wish that DICE would get things right from the beginning. It's clear the game needed more time in development.

In conclusion, would I recommend someone to buy Battlefield 2042 now? Hell No.
I think it is better to just wait and see if the game does indeed get better in the future. Only until then, can they make an informed decision as to whether to buy the game. Collapse",4,0,0

Also, this game is absolute proof that positive critic reviews are mostly purchased by large developers (surprise surprise).

Issues:

Maps are way too big with no detail, definitely rushed. There are vast tracts of land with zero detail, cover, anything. Just CLEARLY unfinished work.
Destruction is a major downgrade, EA flat out lied on this one.
Graphics are a big step back.
The UI is an embarrassment.
A college team of interns could have crafted a better UX.
No VoIP
No Scoreboard
No ""All"" Chat
The 2042 voice lines are so cringe I mute the game sometimes.
Performance is mediocre on my high end PC
The specialist system is disgusting and ruins the flow of the game. No need for teamwork/collaboration anymore. It's just a free for all where no one knows what to do, leading to horribly unbalanced matches.
No squad switching. So if you're alone in a squad with no one to spawn on to, you're beat.
Endless glitches and bugs that require restarting the game.
The gameplay itself is average. Specialists really degrade the experience. Why wouldn't you just play COD at this point? (Which is a stable game on a great engine BTW)

Portal is pretty fun if you happen to find a good server with settings/weapons/class system from the older games. No surprise, all of that still works really well, and is a breath of fresh air. Literally the only thing remotely redeeming about this game. Really hoping that this part of the game can thrive because there's truly nothing else like it on the market.

Overall, just really sad to see how far this franchise has plummeted in the past few years. And we thought BFV was bad.

Don't buy it. Wait.

Then get the game to a nice spot yet never carry the improvements over. This being the most egregious in terms of BF5 to 2042.

EA/Dice you guys have to start taking actual notes on what people loved from past titles and stop aiming to reinvent the wheel all the time. BF5 movement is far superior for example, the medic distance, the bleed out system, fortifications would of made sense in 2042's wide open maps.

Specialist System could have been fine, but it isn't implemented properly. Cringey voicelines. Comical characters that don't fit into the BF series. The new maps are big and empty and lack destruction. In Breakthrough it doesn't even makes sense to recapture a lost objective because theres no way making it to the objective in time. Same in Conquest is this a running simulator or BF. Players will just Gather at one or two Points. The atmosphere of previous titles is gone. Ever heard the whistle in BF1 lots of people rushing an objective. Mortar explosions, a flamer guy burning through trenches. That game had soul. Nothing is there in 2042 we got some goofy, wacky characters, oversaturated maps and weak sound design. Scoreboard missing and dumped down XP system lowers motivation.

Portal mode is better and is a blast from the past. But i doubt it will last very long. Very few maps. Even with the custom servers thats sadly not the way of gaming anymore.

There is zero innovation or creativity in BF2042 and it shows - blatant copied elements from other games, lack of design focus and a complete backtrack from what a battlefield title should be.

I've played every Battlefield game to date and enjoyed every one of them except Hardline. This will be the first Battlefield game I refuse to purchase.

There are always issues with BF titles - netcode, hit reg, server stability, missing features and bumpy launches plagued by bugs. The difference here? Previous titles had solid gameplay, solid design from the ground up & really fun core game experience. It was literally worth waiting for a polished title.

With BF2042? This game is not salvageable. It will take a year to polish and even then you will be left with a bland, soul-less design mess lacking any credible gun play or gameplay.

The only saving grace this game could have had was the addition of Portal which I assume is the love letter to Battlefield fans. Unfortunately with it's lackluster launch features and general lack of options, configuration & content it merely gives you a glimpse into how bad ""BF2042 all out war"" actually is, that it can't even compete with a 10+ year old game.

Assault rifles shoot plastic bbs and not actual bullets and considering how overpowered SMG's are it's not even worth picking up an assault rifle.
Tanks- What can I say, they are way too powerful against infantry and considering that rocket launcher does only 20hp of damage to a tank you need 2 people to shoot it with 5 rockets for it to die which is ridiculous.
Helicopters - Let's start with little bird and how overpowered it still is, 32mm gun is accurate but deals a ton of damage, rocket pods can destroy entire squads if shot accurately. In general they need to be nerfed in some way to make them not as powerful as they are now. Attack Helis are okay but 2nd pilot seat gun is way too OP for what it is, 3-5 well placed shots and players just die no matter what.
There is a lot of issues I could name from rubber banding to ridiculous hit boxes, from shots not registering or me dying when I'm behind a corner.

Conclusion - So far the game is honestly not worth buying and EA overhyped this game way too much for what it is, Lack of guns, classes, game modes/maps, vehicles makes this game kind of a biggest disappointment in Battlefield history. I would say stay away from this game for at least another few months until so called game developer named EA fix their issues and hopefully make this game how it was meant to be. Collapse",2,0,0

94,Battlefield 2042,Skeler42,"Dec 16, 2021","This game is not that what we wanted. They made so much promotion that the game would be fcking awesome and i and many other beliefed it. I personaly thought it would be a ""new"" Battlefield4. When the beta was lauched i liked it to play. As the game got launched i ordered it. Now is the 16.12.2021 and the game got better. The hotfixes realy fixed great issues. I played it for 80 Hours now and it is boring. I know there will be more Maps in the future.

The issues.
The main issue in my oppinion is that it doesnt FEEL like a Battlfeild of the previous time.
The maps are to great and to open. U have to run so long find some enemies even in the 128 player mode. When u look at the maps from the previous BF games u will see, that the maps arent as good as the maps in the previous games.
The weapons arent good. As an example u can look at the Assaultriffles. IRL u can use an AR on mid range fights but the new Battlefield made it impossible. To much recoil and spray for range fights. Shotguns are useless because there are not much closerange fights. The MPs are not useless because u can fight on close range and even midrange. The snipers doesnt feel good and i dont like em to play. The tactical rilfes are even more useless than ur mom in the bed ;).
The game need way MOOREE weapons.

Pros
The graphics of the game are ok
I enjoy the vehicles very much and they are very well balenced.
After the third hotfix there where no fps drops and i got constant frames.

1,Battlefield 2042,themig29,"Nov 19, 2021","The Good

The games on-foot movement mechanics are actually a lot of fun. Movement, including jumping and mantling is fluid and consistent. Parachuting is more realistic than in a game like Warzone, but allows for some additional tactics. When you are parachuting you can either control your descent and move with greater speed and maneuverability, at the expense of being able to fire you weapon. Or you can release your chute controls and descend, but have your weapon up to fire. Zip lines also allow you to be able to shoot in any direction, which helps when moving into fortified areas.

The graphics, when they aren’t hampered by bugs, are great as well.

The Bad

Content (what’s missing):

This list is literally too long to do justice here, so I recommend checking out the subreddit for the game on this.

But there are no classes. You’re stuck with specialists that are piecemeal in terms of gameplay and being able to respond to in-game situations. There’s also no lock-on anti-vehicle weapons (SMAW/Joker), which is a problem when dealing with the insanely OP and overly fast hovercraft. You also can’t dive to get away from enemies, making you a sitting duck in water. Weapons attachments are also extremely sparse and poorly implemented. There are no thermal/NVG scopes, and the items that are available essentially have identical duplicates in most cases meaning that a significant number of attachments are cosmetic in a sense. There is also no scoreboard, no VOIP, no squad switching, to setting a squad leader or battlefield commander, no persistent leaderboards, etc.

Content (what’s there that shouldn’t be):

Specialists... look, they aren't terrible, and apart from two of them who have excessively powerful anti-vehicle/air capabilities, they are relatively well balanced. But it’s clear that this game originally was meant to be some kind of Apex/Fortnite/Overwatch hell-spawn. And it seems that EA got cold feet about it and then tried to pivot back to an actual Battlefield title last year. And boy does it show. The character design reeks of the uncanny valley, and the end-round quips might be some of the worst cringe-inducing garbage I’ve ever seen in a video game. Against the backdrop of a literal climate apocalypse, you have these “No-Pats” (non-patriated mercenaries) working for either the US or the Russians because they have literally lost everything, quipping like a bunch of idiot Twitch streamers. It’s awful.

Map design:

Most maps are poorly implemented. Ground-unit conflict points are too far away from each other. You can spend a third of the match just trying to from waypoint to waypoint in this game. Levolution is sparse, and poorly implemented. There are random tornadoes, which don’t do anything other than suck up players and spit them back out to parachute back into play. I’d rather play BF4’s Siege of Shanghai on permanent repeat than any of these maps.

The Ugly

Gameplay:

It’s a shooter with absolutely garbage hit-registration, further complicated by an insane amount of bloom, that was either included to reduce the skill gap or added as a quick fix to issues in the beta. It’s also incredibly imbalanced. It plays like a failed shooter from a decade ago.

Bugs:

There is no way to sugar-coat this. People are having a myriad of issues, including, but not limited to:

- Loadouts not working requiring leaving games altogether
- Revives not working
- The game crashing for no reason
- Glitchy visuals that don't provide proper feedback about what is happening right in front of you
- Getting stuck in a downed state and being unable to be revived or to respawn
- Spawning on your team but with the opposing team’s colors and indicators

UI:

Aside from the new “plus” weapon attachment menu, which works well for in-game attachment switching, it’s an unmitigated disaster. There is so much having to move in and out of specific US pages just to accomplish a handful of things, particularly trying to switch your weapon attachments, that it makes you not want to do it at all. You can’t even see who’s in your party in the game menus without having to click on a tab to go to the “social” tab, instead of having persistent squad details section in one of the corners of the screen. Worse still is the Lead UI programmer going onto Twitter and commending their team for a job well done and then hiding behind complaints of harassment when the user-base came back with questions and ideas.

Final thoughts: I cannot stress enough that you stay away from this game at launch. It’s not worth $60. It needs massive fixes just to make the game playable as a shooter. Collapse",2,0,0

6,Battlefield 2042,KMFR,"Nov 28, 2021","I've been a big fan of Battlefield series and have played every single game since Battlefield 1942. However, this... this feels *nothing* like Battlefield.

There's no proper scoreboard and no stats, which completely takes away the fun and competitive nature of the game.

There's no global chat, which takes away the social aspect of this game. No more gg's after a good match, no more acknowledging someone after a nice kill or a dogfight, no more issuing weird challenges to the other team, no more discussing a new map or whatever. Now it's like playing against bots, not humans.

There's no classes. I want to play as a generic soldier on a Battlefield, against other generic soldiers. Not as some cartoon character against other (mostly same looking) characters. This is a truly idiotic change.

You can't choose squads either. I mean... I don't even... what? Who in their right mind would even implement a ""system"" like this?

On top of all this, movement, gunplay, vehicles all feel off and very unlike previous games. Heli's and jets don't feel like you're flying (why didn't they just copy the dynamics from BF4 which was perfect?), gunplay is terrible, movement feels ridiculous... the list goes on and on.

I don't even care about bugs at launch because I know they can be patched. However, this whole game seems to have been built by people who have no idea what the fanbase wants, and no idea what Battlefield has always been about.

That's why this will be the first Battlefield I'm not buying. I had such high hopes for the game, but I don't think the game could be salvaged with patches (even if they tried, which they obviously won't). Collapse",0,0,0

- Only two modes on 7 maps for AoW that feels like you are playing wide open fields.
- Control points in breakthrough mode on top of skyscrapers what can't be captured because there are 11 vehicles on top.
- Hit registration, or lack there of. You will dump an entire clip into an enemies back to have them turn around and kill you.
- You can get in a vehicle and shoot and kill yourself because the animation still has you outside of the vehicle.
- Crap FPS on the highest end systems. Changing the settings makes virtually no difference.
- No stats page
- No server browser
- Lobby disbands after every game, no carryover
- No distinctions between factions except the glow stick colors. Soldiers around the world wear glow sticks to make themselves unseen to the enemy. Sometimes you see the Betty White specialist kill the other Betty White specialist who is then revived by the Betty White specialist.

45,Battlefield 2042,ThanksItSucks,"Nov 20, 2021","Battlefield 2042 started out as a carbon copy of a CoD like battle royale game, and unfortunately it shows. Along the the numerous graphical glitches the games core systems are flawed and full of bugs. The time to kill is way too high, early weapons are weak and ineffective while most vehicle weapons are extremely underwhelming.

The lack of a story mode is a little disappointing because they could have done a really cool campaign considering the world building they've done and the tiny bit of back story given to us in short cut scenes. Oh and the little animations that play when you first spawn in are really stupid, and have resulted in deaths because I see this cool charging handle pull animation instead of being able to shoot.

Now how can the game be improved?
1. Hardcore game modes
2. Buff vehicle weapons, spraying someone down with a mini gun shouldn't be easily shaken off, and tank rounds exploding should affect players.

Sadly, as rumors says actual devs. lacks of imagination and had to copy/paste some features from cod. Any way, the game itself is great but it has some flaws like you have to reach lvl 58 to unlock every weapon/gadget in the game. The portal thing is uncompletlely done and Hazard Zona feels like a non-sense mode. I must say The great experiences comes in breakthough, conquest is too large even for 128 players, I would like to see 128 vs 128 for conquest maps because the maps are really bigs. The game has some things from battlefield 4 but as I didnt manage to play deep that game i couldnt understand what is different from it, but it has that feelling. For 60USD game I must say is a great game but I would expect for is half price because just Breakthrough is the great mod for playing here. As I said portal feels uncomplete, hazard zone meeh, and people create umbalance servers in portal. I just goes for breakthrough and, well, people complain about lack of global chat and voice chat. I mean, you don't have to chat global with people unless they are your friends right? and well, about the voice chat i had to use discord, this made me forced to meet new people to play as team. It was a really good experience when you adapt. Also some minor things like no scoreboard (uncomplete), you cannot create a squad, you cannot change from USA to RU, sometimes there are servers with infinite tickets and cannot start/end, and in some maps devs were to far when setting points in top towers making it impossible to reach it (even because attackers just have 2 air units to deploy and attack). Some flaws that make me think it deserver a 7.5/10 Maybe with feature content and some fixes game would reach a 10/10 Until that feel free of read, watch videos and avoid the game if some of this problems affects you the gameplay in ways that cannot let you enjoy it.

Per gli altri Battlefield di portal(la terza modalità) la configurazione delle armi dato il fatto che non sia possibile utilizzare la configurazione delle armi in tempo reale, mettere un mirino o altre cose diventa macchinoso.
Grafica molto buona con un gioco di luci che a differenza del vecchio non ti immerge, promesse non mantenute completamente, e con edifici non distruttibili adeguatamente, mappe che da molti giocatori sono considerate troppo poche, io penso si sia il contrario (non so quante sono numericamente) ma comunque si deve tenere in considerazione la grandezza di queste mappe.

However the UI/UX is a disaster. You can't just select and play TDM on the new BF42 maps, you have to scroll to the hidden server browser to find all the fun game modes and maps. Quick access is limited to the 128 player conquest on (way too) large maps. The default settings of the game are bad as well, you definitely need to adjust many options for a good feeling. Scoreboard is bad. Even managing to join the squad of a friend is difficult.

Therefore playing TDM, rush or small conquest on the new BF42 or even BF3 maps is awesome and really fun. TDM on Noshar Canals feels like back in the days when BF3 came out.

68,Battlefield 2042,Serb-Dad,"Nov 22, 2021","Definitely a promising Battlefield Installment with many exciting features, such as the 2 new modes, Portal and Hazard Zone. With action-packed gameplay which makes this game still so much fun, yet it is lacking some features that would really lift this game into the light.

They have scrapped the original class Model and it's not entirely bad, I actually quite like this new system. but it feels a lot less like battlefield's original class system. Every gadget can be put in any of the classes and it has lost its rigidity. Adding specialists which have their own buffs and special gadgets that are unique to them. However, everything else is open season, although untraditional, it still is a pretty fresh customization model that can alter gameplay drastically. Yet, it still seems bare.
Comparing this to Battlefield 4, which has 110+ weapons, 32 assault rifles alone!! this game has a measly 22... yeah, very underwhelming. Even compared to Battlefield I and V, it is lacking severely.

Many more gameplay aspects are missing too, in-game chat, The destruction is buggy and seemingly scarce. It definitely has the scale of a battlefield game but without its signature destruction and map altering changes, it just doesn't feel like a battlefield game. Even with the newly implemented weather events (which are still pretty cool on their own!), it just feels a little underwhelming in the destruction department. Especially from a game that is famous for collapsing skyscrapers and leveling city blocks.
There are also a lot of out-of-game features that are missing too, leaderboards and stat pages are nonexistent and no Server Browsers at all.

One big turn-off I've experienced is the weapons fire spread and bloom. Nearly every weapon seems uncontrollable even on stationary targets while sitting still. It is poorly implemented making your bullets go everywhere off target even when Aiming Down sights, making nearly all gunfights RNG.

One more thing that seemed odd to me, where is the campaign?? Not even a single-player experience like Battlefield 1's war stories?? Honestly a shame, with a setting like 2042 where the world seems to be hit with a major world-altering conflict and we see nothing of it? I was really hoping to see more of this world on the brink of collapse during humanity's peak. it is disappointing to see them take this in a Multiplayer only experience and I feel it would have made this game a lot better.

But does it have potential? Yeah, it does. Even with its broken and chaotic bugs, it is still a fun and awesome game. I hope they fix the existing bugs and bring back the aspects and weapons choices similar to that of other battlefield games because right now Battlefield 2042 feels a little underwhelming and fairly empty shooter. Ambition is great, but too much can really make or break a series. Especially for die-hard fans.

Now I will talk about 2042, and in my first days of play I already have an opinion, I will summarize it with this phrase: ""It is clearly unbalanced in many aspects"".

I will focus on specific aspects that I have seen. Too many attack vehicles, especially in advance mode maps that are smaller, you are constantly killed by tank shots even from behind because they have surrounded you or helicopters with dispersal bombs that you do not even know why you have died. The MC5 goes too fast for a tank guy, it does better to kill by running over than to shoot. For example, zone A1 of the Renovation map with so many enemy exit vehicles is practically indefensible. Defensive material against vehicles is clearly lacking.
On the other hand, there is a lack of quad-type vehicles to move through the great distances of the maps. Few to no starter weapon accessories, in some cases not a sad peephole. The one who already has a higher level is greatly favored compared to the new player who to which they fall everywhere. There are no statistics whatsoever, nor can you even see the data of the last game once it is finished.

When the game released into early access, people were defending it on the basis that ""it hasnt released yet"" and the bugs will surely be fixed at full release. They werent.

It runs very very poorly on PCs that ran the previous title just fine and it looks objectively worse. The hit reg has been broken for weeks. The AoW mode is just unbalanced and boring running simulator if you're playing infantry, which you will be... quite a lot. The spawn system is a complete mess. You spawn in wide open areas as sniper bait, or in front of tanks or in front of enemies routinely. The UI makes it damn near impossible to select squad mates that are on objectives. They increased the player count to 128, which the servers clearly cannot handle consistently. This is a game with tons of potential buried under more tons of performance problems. I actually feel kind of bad for the artists that worked on this title. You can see the love and hard work put into that aspect of the game, but the balance and performance issues are glaring.

I'm running a 1660ti and an i5 9th gen system with 16gb ram. Yes, it's a moderate spec by current standards, but I expect to be able to run new game releases at least on Low settings at a playable framerate. Being new to this Franchise I've missed all their previous launches, so had no personal experience of what went down in the past. I have however read and watched many user reviews of their previous titles at launch and can clearly see a pattern that is still being followed. That being games launching in an incomplete state. Followed by many patches and updates in an effort to turn the game into what it should have been at launch.
I was excited about this title. Especially after playing BF4 for a couple of months now and seeing what that game can do even 7 to 8 years after it launched. And then I moved onto BFV, which I have to be honest blew me away with it's overall polish. I understand that both BF4 and V launched with similar issues to 2042 and that I am now experiencing these games with the benefit of years of patches and fixes and optimization. But for EA and DICE to not learn from these previous launches is a real shame. Currently the FPS player base is rotating between games like Vanguard and Halo infinite, which are all vying for our attention and valuable game time. Battlefield offers gamers something different, or used to. Perhaps after a number of patches, fixes and optimization updates 2042 will be a solid game that will offer something different for the FPS player base. Perhaps not. Time will tell. Collapse",2,0,0

First of all - i don't have fun in that game, i simply don't, even tho fps shooters are my favourites.
This has nothing to do with BF3, BF4 and so on.
The maps are huge, and they are awfully designed. You have a desert, some more desert, two buildings and some more desert. Same goes for almost every map, but change desert for planes of grass. Out of that, we can have a nice vehichles rekting you all over the place cuz there is nowhere to hide from them. My memories from BF3 are special ones, as the maps here was 10 out of 10 in comparison with that one.
The guns - there is no guns. Forget about grinding 100 years in BF3 to try everything out, there is just about freaking 20 guns for a whole game for EVERY class (sorry, operator).
128 people not fun at all. You have one place where everyone just shoot each other for about 3 to 5 minutes, then you should run 5 kilometers marathone to be killed in the middle of the desert by a heli.
Cringe voicelines, absolutely cringe and awful. BF3, once again, was a masterpiece at that.
Destruction is good, but still laughable, as there is one or two buildings you can destroy, the rest is desert.
Even tho i have an old videocard and i understand it, but boy, 40 fps with THAT graphics on low's - laughable, there is no optimization. Hell, even people with rtx 3000 series are getting some problems.
Bugs are one hundred percent to show up in every game you play, in general, that feels still like beta, still scuffed.
Im heartbroken, as BF3 was once a game, that i've DREAMT of getting. I've build a completely new PC just to play that game, just to enjoy every piece of it, it was mind-blowing. Right now, do i want to build a new PC to run that 150 fps on Ultras? Hell no, i don't and i won't. 10 years later, that is not what i expected out of gaming industry, constantly selling us a raw, unpolished, bad and just soullles project. Literally everything in that game is bad, i have nothing else to add.
I wish i could say every little piece of that battlefield making it that bad, but i believe that everyone, who actually played this game, will understand everything i've said and alot more.
Sad, that we live in such a time, when we can't just have a mind blowing game, as we used to get before.

If I'm to ignore all of these annoyances for a second and focus on the actual game. The biggest let down for me is the vast size of the maps and number of players in each server. Sure, it's probably a technological marvel that they got this running smoothly (well.... not smoothly) but due to its size it makes the individual player and his/her actions feel so insignificant and it gets boring really quick.

11,Battlefield 2042,kilkarazy,"Dec 1, 2021","I’ve played Battlefied since Battlefield 1942 with BF4 being my favorite.

Much is being made of the bugs, which yes are bad. The root problem though is how terrible the maps are. Battlefield 4 was darn near broken at launch, but my friends and I sat through all the disconnects and glitches. Even with the issues, when you got in a match it was worth it. Unfortunately that’s not the case here. The game could be as polished as modern warfare 2019 and it would still suck because of its design. These maps were clearly not play tested by the community, or if they were the feedback was ignored. Wide open empty maps with small combat zones do not work for the shining star of battlefield, which is conquest. The move to 128 players should not have required the maps to be 5x as big. It slows the gameplay to a crawl and is frankly boring. The map design is bland with very flat looking textures. Destruction is nearly non existent. It’s like the developers completely forgot about what makes battlefield great. Removing the class system for specialists was a huuuuuge mistake and I don’t think the game can improve until that is reinstated. It changes the team dynamics and creates a meta which Battlefield traditionally was able to avoid.

Dice & EA flat out lied to players. We were told the beta build was 3 months old but the game released with nearly all of the same technical issues. They do not deserve your money, especially when the game doesn’t include a campaign, so “more time can be spent on multiplayer.” If all the time is being spent on multiplayer, there should be more than 7 maps and 23 guns. It’s really a shame because this was the game to bring battlefield back to its roots. Overall - the performance sucks on PC, the sound design sucks, the music sucks, the little one liners the characters say at the end of the matches are HORRIBLE, the gunplay sucks, the game is just flat out awful. It’s just not fun. The days of BF3, BF4, & BC2 are gone. Collapse",2,0,0

14,Battlefield 2042,Enthusiast98,"Dec 2, 2021","Battlefield 2042 is a very mediocre game for its price tag. It is plagued by very poor map design, an unacceptable amount of bugs and glitches, as well as the lack of basic features many of which are considered a staple of the Battlefield franchise for good reason (e.g. proper scoreboard, diving in water, switching squads, destruction, all-chat, etc.). While bugs will likely eventually be ironed out, very poor map design remains a significant issue: maps are so huge and offer so little cover that maps hardly flow well, making them an eternal running nightmare for infantry. Vehicles suffer too, as specialist abilities mean that there is little predictability about the movements/loadouts of enemies - there is no incentive to push with a tank or helicopter given how many people run rocket launchers/anti-vehicle grenades and how quickly one can subsequently be killed.

Furthermore, 2042 doesn't know what it wants to be tonally with very clean maps and quirky specialists (""aNgEl dOeS iT aGaIn!!11""), as well as weird skins (Boris as Santa Claus) meant to emulate hero shooters, while the very premise of the game and its marketing prior to release try to paint a rather grim, gritty atmosphere. Optimization additionally remains rather poor.

Even if they fix half of the issues with this game in the coming year, it will still be garbage. I won't buy the next game, and possibly, i see this game killing the franchise as a whole.

It's a shooter, but the gunplay is so messed up that I can't shoot or hit enemies. There's very basic shooter functionalities missing like a score board.

They left out so much functionality that each and every BF game before this one had. They eliminated the classes in favor for specialists, they didn't put in any stationary guns or AA, it only has 23 guns with no customization whatsoever because all the attachments just do the same, the maps are horrible flat open spaces with no cover, no levelution, no destruction.. the map design is broken where in 3 out of 7 maps, you can't win as attackers on Breakthrough.

They left out the campaign, so you would think.. with more time spent developing, more studios than ever, no campaign, the actual multiplayer would be better, more content, more functionality, better balanced, less glitches, great gunplay??? big NOPE.

Then they added some extraction game mode which I refuse to even start, never played it, never will. I don't want to be in EA's or Dice's stats to be a player who started this game mode to even give them the slightest idea of something this is what the community wants to play, because it's not.

Then, the only GOOD thing about Battlefield 2042, is Portal. It was added by an additional studio in just 14 months development, to make up for all the lack of content in the main game, and it's actually the only good thing about this whole package deal, BUT.... they are killing it by eliminating XP and progression so there's actually no players or servers to be found.

I asked for a refund but it got declined because I already put in too many hours because I still tried to give this game a serious chance and I tried to like it, but now it's just $120 down the drain, I hate it, I don't even have the urge to play it anymore (only if they re-enable XP and progression in Portal I will play just that).

Server issues constantly in my experience. Almost every game I encountered a loadout glitch where all of my loadouts for every vehicle and gun had to be recustomized. The maps are walking simulators when you're not constantly dying to vehicles. No scoreboard in a first person shooter was a big no-no. Only 6 maps on launch. The worst part is that it doesn't feel like battlefield. The gunplay feels shoddy and unresponsive. Specialists we're the worst thing ever introduced in the series. Classes made it simple but now you can run a medic with a sniper and ammo basically being a one man army. With specialists it ruins the immersion and roleplaying that has always been in battlefield. It's something that doesn't belong in battlefield but maybe COD. Speaking of the two medic specialist. If you play one of them in my experience you cannot revive people in walls.

У этой игры есть некие недостатки (а назовите мне игру, в которой их нет), все мы люди и каждый воспринимает их по-своему.
Мне понравилась графика. Она красивая, в синглрлеерный шутер я бы точно поиграл, но с другой стороны - тебе нужно предтоповое железо и желательно ГГц побольше, ибо что она делает с процессором, одним Дайсам известно. Повышение частоты с 4.8-4.9 до 5.1 даёт нехилый такой буст в производительности.
Карты: большие... и, наверное, на этом всё. Часто нужно бегать, есть какой-никакой интерактив с ними, присутствует разрушаемость.
Оружие: достаточно. Многим тут не понравилось, что их слишком мало, верно? Но вспомните прошлый части, сколько их Х вы выбирали? По какой причине выбирали? Почему НЕ брали то или иное оружие? По этой же причине их уменьшили и... правильно сделали. Но с другой стороны, некоторая техника стала ещё той болью в заднице, если вы не в скваде и не способы его уничтожить (всё ещё жду новое оружие, которое будет способно эффективно уничтожать технику пехотой, сейчас это ракетница и клеймор, для первого нужно 100500 попаданий, а до второго ты не добежишь, если против вас играют ноулайферы), а большинство играют в эту игру чисто расслабиться, побегать, пострелять. Игра в команде - это не совсем то, за чем приходят в эту игру.
Остальное может в будущем изменят, доделают, но в сыром остатке остаётся довольно неплохая игра, которая даёт какие-то позитивные эмоции, но с другой стороны - это не совсем ""готовый продукт"" (про ценовую политику промолчу). Что-то работает криво или не работает совсем, нерегулярные патчи (для игры в таком виде они должны выходить каждую неделю, чтобы исправлять весь тот бред, что они выпустили, начиная от недавнего обновления, которое убивает DXR-1 с кривой визуальной составляющей с ""готовностью к следующему выстрелы"" до бесячей фичи, когда тебя бьёт вертушка, то тебя замедляет... ну или так кажется, из-за чего твои шансы на спасение равняются околонулевыми, визуально это выглядит плохо).

I felt compelled to write this after EA and the devs started gaslighting customers and fans who were upset with the state of the game and started paying news outlets to paint customers and fans in a negative light.

Battlefield is dead. There, that's what it is. I've been playing since BF1942. I've seen the ups and downs. I have always kept believing because I've always had a lot of fun. Even after BFV (great game, but they just gave up and stopped support way too early) I thought BF2042 would be the great revival. They would take back the crown.
The trailer inspired such confidence in this game. Then the beta came. It wasn't great but we were promised that it was an old build. Cracks in the foundation appeared.
Then the game was released and everything turned out to be a lie. Like... everything. They turned it into a hero shooter. All the qualities that made battlefield battlefield just vanished. EA and Dice still to this day pretending that everything is okay and take month-long vacations without any decent communications. This is going to be another Anthem. We'll see a promise of improvement soon, and then the announcement that the game will be abandoned. Shareholders will laugh, while the fans get a kick in the nuts. I'm not going into detail about everything that is going wrong and is missing, it's already been done in detail by others but it far surpassed ""just a few bugs"". This game is fundamentally flawed.

All we wanted was a Battlefield 3/4 brought into this generation of graphics and gameplay. And you spat in our faces.

Balancing weapons and vehicles is completely out of proportion. Jets and helicopters are totally op, and tanks and other vehicles might just make it out of the spwan before being hit by Thousand Missiles, since of course everyone can carry a rocket launcher or C4. In addition, there are the maps that are simply a disaster. Everything is open you have no cover and after 2 minutes on a map you realize that there is absolutely no love in these maps. In general, the content that the game offers is a joke after about 30 hours you have unlocked everything there is and you have nothing left to do except farm up to XP up to level S999 and I don't have to tell anyone that this is not fun. The performance has also gotten worse with each patch, both for me with good hardware (3080ti and new Ryzen) and for my friends with slightly older hardware and with the last patch it only crashes non-stop after 5 minutes in one round.

1. Broken vehicles from simple ATVs to jets in bf3 maps - everything just feels wrong and out of this world. 2. Broken hit registration, back to bf3's launch bugs and problems yeah? Well no, it's even worse. Sometimes I would dump entire magazine worth of round into the enemy player literally point blank and nothing registered as a hit. 3. Broken gunplay. Forget about weapon recoil patterns and and fair recoil feel, just random spread after 3-4 bullets.
4. Lack of players both on portal and native 2042 servers, bots are everywhere and that is simply outrageous. 5. Limited arsenal. 6. REALLY BAD PERFORMANCE ISSUES hitting 80 fps and then dropping to 30 felt disgusting. Luckily the portal maps we to work more stable. 6. Infantry / vehicle balance.

68,Battlefield 2042,teemkay,"Feb 16, 2022","As a long time Battlefield fan, all i can say is that I am incredibly disappointed in the product that DICE thought was suitable for release. The game runs like garbage on my powerful pc (i9-9900k, RTX 2080ti, 32GB DDR4-3200Mhz) but besides it running like trash, the game just seems like an early alpha build of a Battlefield/Call of Duty Warzone clone that takes all the bad aspects from both franchises and melds them into the abomination that we call Battlefield 2042.

The maps are complete trash, they are huge so 90% of your time in the match is spent just running in giant open fields, not getting into any fights. But don't worry, you might get into a fight or two before you die and have to run for another 20 minutes to find another one - or you'll just get picked off by a sniper.

Everything in this game is a severe downgrade from previous Battlefield titles. All first-person animations are downgraded in quality, with a severe lack of detail from the team at DICE (e.g., when unloading an empty magazine on the AK74u the magazine still has ammo in it) Throwing back grenades in Battlefield 2042 doesn't have ANY animation, the grenade just flies away because the specialists have telekinesis.

All of these issues listed above, without even going into how awful the actual gameplay itself is. Hitting enemies is a roll of the dice more than anything - the server desync is so bad that there'll be times where you unload a whole magazine into someone point blank and don't even get a single hit marker. This desync is likely directly caused by DICE's ridiculous fixation on having to have 128 players in the lobby. Having 128 players in the game is incredibly taxing on cpus, and it leads to unstable client performance for users - the 128 players also impacts server stability, leading to increased amounts of desync experienced by the players. DICE had to also decrease the server tick rate to 45hz from 60hz in previous titles which leads to even worse hit detection.

Never the less I feel a need to somewhat rant about this, only because I have never been so let down about a game. I was an enthusiastic to hear about the release of 2042, pre-ordered the game like many other, and also sadly let down like many others. I was disappointed to see the class system did not return with the new installment of battlefield along with radical changes to the franchise itself. Looking past my own personal feelings about changes they made, I would not have been as mad if there was a good core gameplay. I never had any trouble running the game even running on an older system (not the performance I would expect but not terrible like some others). The game released in a terrible condition with new bugs and glitches popping up in every game you play (if you could actually get in a game during launch week). To me this wasn’t a battlefield it was something totally different that they slapped the battlefield name on just to sell more copies of the game. One good thing about this game it made me realize what I did love about the battlefield games. It wasn’t just the chaos of 32v32 or now in this case 64v64. Looking back it was just the sense of feeling like I was a soldier with my friends being my brothers in arms in my squad and old DICE just knew how to give a sense of atmosphere like this. Now with this battlefield I just don’t feel that, even with dice coming with new content in the summer I don’t feel like anything will change that for me, the game lacks a soul. I hope, I really hope I’m wrong and DICE can pull a miracle and somehow make this a better game but again I don’t see that happening. I played the **** outta battlefield 3, 4, and 1 all amazing games and even nowadays since the failure of 2042 battlefield 5 has felt like an amazing game even with its faults during its lifespan, but after only 2 months and 40+ hours I can no longer stomach playing over other amazing game releases.

- Maps are too big yet there are few places you can fight considering youd obviously just die if running around in the open. And this game has a lot of open.
- They increased the player count yet reduced the squad sizes. So you'll often have no one to spawn on and will have to start at a base or objective over and over again, walking to a fight just to get gunned down randomly rinse and repeat.
- The ""heroes"" or whatever theyre called are goofy, unlikable and kill the immersion of what was once a semi serious franchise.
- Gun selections are limited considering its locked to the era of the hero you want to play. So there is an illusion of multiple choices but in practice it's very limited.
- Runs like ass, even on my 3080ti, raytracing makes it even worse, dlss didnt make any improvements when i tried it.
The list goes on and on. I'm not even trying to crap on this game with a low score 2/10 is the honest experience and i regret every penny of my pre-order. Do not spend your money on this game, buy an older battlefield on sale or call of duty Collapse",2,0,0
87,Battlefield 2042,WolfTongue,"Apr 10, 2022","Leider hat die Qualität nach etlichen Titeln der Reihe massiv abgenommen.

Nicht funktionierendes Gaming, Glitches sowie miserables Balancing, Fahrzeuge welche Wolkenkratzer erklimmen können sowie viele andere Punkte. Wäre dies nicht schlimm genug, hat man auch noch sämtliche Statistiken aus dem Spiel entfernt und bei selbst den großen Spielmodis dafür gesorgt, dass man maximal mit 4 Spielern gleichzeitig spielen kann (nachjoinen oder ähnliches ist leider so gut wie unmöglich).

Battlefield war schon immer als ""Betafield"" bekannt. Bei einem so umfangreichen Titel muss an aber auch davon ausgehen, dass früher oder später immer Bugs gefunden werden. Allerdings das Lobby-Limit auf 4 zu begrenzen als auch die zahlreichen fehlenden Features, Statistiken als dass es teils einfach nicht oder unspielbar war hat mich um ehrlich zu sein schockiert. Daher finde ich persönlich, dass es kein Wunder ist, dass die Spieler auf die funktionierenden älteren Titel zurückgewichen sind.

Alles in allem fühlt es sich für mich so an, als wäre das Spiel ein paar Jahre zu früh auf den Markt gelassen zu worden oder als würde man dringend Geld brauchen - egal was es kostet. Denn für mich ist nun die Battlefield-Reihe erstmal ""gestorben"" wodurch ich mir keinen der Nachfolger mehr leisten werde.

10,Battlefield 2042,noamam,"Aug 9, 2022","first of all, I want to say that it is my first big purchase of an online game like this, I'm not gonna lie I was pretty naïve because I saw the trailer and I thought I was going to buy a firkin movie of a game. the trailer did do its job to the fullest, even the gameplay trailer looked awesome, fantastic graphics cool vehicles and more. what can you ask more of an all out war game. the first few weeks of playing it I loved it, although the majority of people disliked the game which I understand completely because
the game had numerous bugs and defects that need fixing. I still believed someday it would change for the better, loved the gameplay of vehicles and in general, for like 4 months I really enjoyed the game even when there was only 1000 or less players online. don't get me wrong I didn't think from the beginning it was worth 60 bucks but I was willing to play it anyway(because I couldn't refund). now here comes the part that I really hate, when this ""season one"" came I was exited because I knew it would bring lots of players back but the changes to the game were absolutely trash. and here are some for example; the bolte, a vehicle that can be unlocked at some point in the game was one of my personal favorite light vehicle. Dice changed its category for the same as the tank heavy vehicles. now, why tf would I use the bolte if i can just use the tank, its way better obviously, it has more health, more destructive power and more gadgets, and as I expected after the update I didn't see one bolte in the battlefield.
The second reason, Dice reduced the amount of vehicles in each match and that makes the game pointless and really boring. its supposed to be an all out war action game, with tons of destruction, tanks shooting and jest flying by and bombing the area. now its call of duty game in a big boring map with some lame ass cars with little guns and each team of 64! can choose only one aircraft 2 tanks maybe an helicopter (same category that makes it less useable, and each map the amount of vehicles is a little different but still a really small amount).
and as a result for like 4 games straight I didn't get to be neither in a tank or a helicopter, sometimes there are carriers that the pilot doesn't even shoot from only the passengers can, and some lame LVs .
The third reason, why the hell did you guys bring down the most fun mode in this game.. the 64v64 breakthrough mode it was what the game was supposed to be. that was the reason I paid for this game!!! now its some boring 32v32 in a small map with one jeep for each team and maybe one tank. and the season map is boring as hell earthier. this game started ok but was trash because of bugs, it started to get better until you **** it up again and now with more bugs and unstable changes to the gameplay. Dice please, you have the resources already, make this game good, just listen to the ones that are actually playing it. add triple the vehicles in each match do more destructive buildings(idc if it means less players)

0,Half-Life 2,pcgamereviewer,"May 3, 2012","A standard by which all FPS games should be compared and/or measured against in today's modern world. Truly the best overall game that has ever existed by a great company named 'ValvE and a multi-platform game which still shows beyond-oustanding PC support to it's most faithful audience and/or customers. This is simply better than CoD, Halo or any series for that matter, genre - RPG, FPS, RTS, MMORPG, etc... the list goes on. Simply put, an engaging story, amazing physics and challeging and innovative gameplay and puzzles as well as deep character development and excellent level design. Get this and any title made by Valve, The Orange Box e.g. has this game and a few others and is easily the best gaming bundle deal of the century because of one reason - it has this game and the fact that you won't find a better game than this, I can assure you and anyone who reviews this with a 0 or something like that because of Steam. Steam has greatly changed and improved over the years has no idea of what they're talking about and should go and play CoD and then start talking as it'll change their mind and they will see, just how perfect this game is, just how much it has achieved - awards, game design, technology improvements and innovation as well as being a pure, landmark title that noticeably and simultaneously remarkably stands out from today's games where campaign's last only about 6 hours or less (compared to Half Life 2's length of approximately 25 hours or more) and do not care about their fans or the fact that the game is complete garbage and continue not to fix or upgrade it. Having said all this... there's still not enough to be said or praised about this title, what it represents, how much it has made known gaming as an activity/hobby, achieved - i.e. (that is) famous, just how good it is and how it deserves to be played by anyone who is interested in anything or any certain type of game as this game is simply put, as the best game that has ever come out and existed and will contine to be so for centuries to come, having its name yelled out and its legacy and origin living on (no pun intended). My PC friends, you will find no better game than this and me constructing long sentences for this game review is completely justified when you understand how good this game is and when you have played it - being immersed and absolutely bewildered at just how good this game is - if I haven't said it enough ALREADY - THIS game is good, more than good, in fact if I could rate it 20/10 I would do so but that would lead to an improper fraction and also metacritic doesn't let me :(

Overall, that is all. BUY NOW as YOU WON'T REGRET IT, if I haven't convinced you enough - look at the all other positive reviews and take these facts for one: highest metacritic scoring game - EVER, most awards and impressive achievement shown and won by a game, biggest PC community - mods and support and made from ValvE - the people who implemented Steam - a download client program for PC (like XBox Live for Windows) and made many Source game-engine based games that were successful and have been continuing to make blockbuster sequels since then including continuing and expanding this 'Half-Life' game into a series and they are known for much, much more other stuff and being the most awesome people on the planet that make games for gamers by gamers as they say, a great development team and/or publisher of their own games and/or work, need I say more about this game or ValvE... ?!

1,Half-Life 2,Duderoth,"Apr 15, 2011","I just replayed Half-Life 2 again about a month ago. Even in 2011, seven years after its initial release, I am still reminded why Half-Life 2 is one of the greatest first-person shooters of all time. Not the greatest, but definitely one of them.

I think the greatest strength in Half-Life 2 (gameplay-wise) is the level design. Over the course of I believe 14 levels, you see an incredible variation in locale, level structure, lighting, and gameplay. This is complimented by such a flux in mood, intensity, and immersion that you can't help but to just be enthralled by it.

For instance, the entire first 3 chapters of the game is a slow build-up to an intense climax. You start as a fugitive, running across the rooftops of City 17 to escape the Combine Overwatch. You are allowed to take a short, 10-minute breather in a safe-haven, then thrust back into the bowels of the city's sewer system, and finally driving your own airboat through the canals. It's such a gradual build you hardly notice it, until you reach the end of the climax, discover you've been holding your breath for the past 30 seconds, and that you've been maintaining a white-knuckled grip on your mouse this whole time. And that's the first 3 chapters.

After this you are treated to some incredibly creepy locations, and some more intense escapes/shootouts. All the atmosphere is enhanced with some pretty incredible performances both animation- and voice-acting-wise, even if you consider that this is 2011.

And wow, the voice acting. These are some of the most incredible video game characters to this date. Immensely believable, highly emotional, subtly expressive, the characters help suck you right into the story and world that Valve created, and you could almost be fooled into thinking they are actually talking to you...

Oh and that reminds me, the story. Okay, so it's not laid out for you word-for-word what's going on, or what relevance all these characters have in terms of the story from the instance you set foot into the game. I have read a lot of reviews and seen a lot of complaints. Yes, Valve did not flesh it out in its entirety in the first chapter. No, you pretty much don't have a clue what kind of influence the combine and the G-Man are right from the word go. But to be honest, I don't care. When it comes to story-telling, I personally enjoy the opportunity to discover the story for myself, and not just have it told to me if I were a five-year-old. There are some pretty subtle hints laying around concerning backstory, main storyline, and intertwining character plots. If you look for them, you'll find that this is actually some interesting sci-fi, more driven by characters (which it should be) than by what's necessary to pluck a plot twist out of your ass. So overall, the story ended up being a plus in my opinion.

Other than that, the graphics are still good, though a bit dated, physics are awesome, and the gravity gun continues to be the best weapon in the history of gaming, Go Valve! Now I just can't wait until my Portal 2 pre-load finishes... Collapse",10,34,36

It is a worthy successor, a promise for more to follow and that valve cares of their comunity. Every single aspect of what made Half-Life 1 special was taken care of, enhanced and implemented into Half-Life 2. They kept their special way of storytelling, not interupting the gameplay much, but letting the player explore just as much of the universe as he likes to. A universe that keeps continuously growing during HL1-2, the episode addons and even Portal since it is also playing in the very same fictional Universe.

Half-Life 2 has nice graphics but you can have a bad computer to play it. It also has a beautiful storyline and there are no cutscenes in this game. That is good because you feel like... you are Gordon Freeman and in the center of... everything. This game has 15 chapters... well 14 because chapter 15 is the credits. Many of you will agree that the scariest chapter is ' ' We Don' t Go To Ravenholm...' ' . I think it doesn' t fit there where it is but they put the chapter in to show the physics.

The bad things. Is Gordon Freeman a Superman that he can drive and open doors without hands? Sometimes it is boring to listen other characters because they talk too much. Little graphical failures and they are the bad things. Thanks VALVe for this fantastic game and I am waiting the Episode Three.

Characters have really their own personalities, the physics system of Source SDK is that good that it's truly one of the most important factors of the game.

Everything about this game is just about perfect. The gameplay, the graphics, the music (what little there is), the story, everything. What really disappoints me is that once games such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Halo 3 came out, everyone seemed to forget about this near perfect game. Why this is disappointing is because this game is actually better than both of them. To be honest, this is not my favorite video game of all time. Super Smash Bros. Brawl still beats it. However, it doesn't beat this game by much. When the chips are down, this game could still top most competition. I really want the Halo and Call of Duty fans to try this game out, and see if this is really better than both of those games. If you are one of those fans, and you have tried this game out, say yes if this game is really better than Halo or Call of Duty. If it's not better to you, say no, or don't vote at all.

Anyway, Half-Life 2 = Amazing. The graphics are good! People have to realise that Half-Life 2 was released in 2004. It does not have the graphics that we have today. Half-Life 2 provides excellent voice acting from all the cast, including the great Merle Dandridge (Alyx Vance).

Half-Life 2 also has famous actors such as Robert Culp and Robert Guillaume. Half-Life 2 earned 39 Game of the Year awards. This shows that, well, Half-Life 2 is damn awesome.

34,Half-Life 2,Tarem,"Feb 12, 2012","There is no better game in the world. It combines elements from almost all genres, from first person shooters to puzzles. The game has some horror elements, and some parts that make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. This game has something for everyone.
The game itself is pretty good. For being released so long ago, the physics and graphics aren't as bad as you would think. Actually, they're pretty nice. In my whole time playing I've never seen a texture glitch, or an error in the physics. It can run pretty good with an out of date computer too. You don't need to steal a computer from NASA to play this game well. In fact, that dinosaur of a computer you keep in your back room or basement could probably run this fine.
When you're playing the game, you know A LOT of time went into designing and planning this game. It seems that whoever made the game knew which turn you would make before you made it, and planned for it accordingly. The design of the levels are so complex and interesting that I don't know how any human being could create something so amazing. You may walk through a door and find that the hallway ahead is blocked, so you take around five or ten minutes navigating through air vents and dark rooms, only to find yourself popping out right on the other side of the blocked hallway. Ten minutes to move ten feet.
The characters in the game also add to the amazing feel that the game gives you. The characters really find a way to connect to you in this game. It gets to the point where you actually feel like you're Gordon Freeman. It makes you want to laugh and cry with the other characters. The emotions that the game conveys are amazing.
To sum it all up, this game is amazing. Absolutely amazing. I could not recommend this game anymore. This game is easily my favorite game of all time. If you have a little money to spare, this is the absolute perfect thing to invest your money in. Every second you play it will be worth it. Collapse",10,6,6

38,Half-Life 2,AdmiralGadoosh,"May 18, 2012","I've just replayed HL2 again for about the 10th time and can honestly say it still provides more entertainment, story and game play mechanics than any other FPS in recent times I can think of. Yes - it's a linear shooter, and there is nothing wrong with that if you understand how to do a linear shooter. We don't need constant screen hints telling us we have ""Jump here"" or ""Crouch behind this rock"". We don't need radars or flashing arrows on the screen telling us where to go. FPS games these days are aimed towards people who can't think and need to be told how to do everything. In HL2, yes we follow a linear path, but we also left to think for ourselves, solve little puzzles and even sometimes take on a kind of platforming style unlike COD (and many others) games where we just watch the fancy explosions and get told where to go and what to do (and I just had to laugh at his comment in another review - ""The story's nothing special either. Although it's linear, there's no objectives so it's possible to get lost on where to go/what to do"" - My point exacaly, because you have to think for yourself !). HL2 gets the cinematic approach spot on, makes us feel like we are part of the story where other FPS games makes us feel like we are just sat there watching a shallow action film. Every enemy in the game has to be approached differently, unlike most other shooters where you just aim and hold down the trigger and again watch the fancy explosions and gibs flying everywhere. And to moan about the graphics ??? Seriously ? Why is it that's all people care about these days. To me this game still looks great even today (8 years later is it ? I can't remember the release date atm), and if you don't like it check out the great MOD community (Cinematic mod). So if you like to think for yourself and actually take part in something called game play, this game is for you. If you like a dumb shooter where you constantly told what to do and are impressed more with graphics and explosions, stick to your COD games. Collapse",10,6,6

Half Life 2 is just one of those games that gets everything right. To find fault, one must look pretty hard. Valve brilliantly incorporated it's source engine in their true masterpiece.

When you find truly good games, you of ten find things put in by the developers to enhance the realism. For example, in Metroid Prime, Samus's reflection can be seen during flashes of light and certain events. She also interacts with her arm cannon if you wait around long enough, creating the whole image that Samus isn't just what you tell her to do. This is evident in HL2 in spades. Explosions deafen you, guns wield realistically, and infinite amounts of care went into character's expressions and tone of voice.

I enjoyed the zombie level so much that I just brought the left for dead games for 4 euros from steam. All the levels have their own very distinct character but somehow you move from one to the next seamlessly. The campaign has so much variety- you could be driving along the open coast next to the sea in one (with the sound of the sea in your ears if you get a quiet moment) or feeling oppressed and claustrophobic as the evil combine guard infiltrate the apartment blocks you're hiding in.

The gameplay is varied, you could either be trying to avoid walking on sand to attract antlions, driving around in different vehicles, or shooting through hoards of zombies/combine. Along with this, the game uses a physics engine to make gameplay varied, either in puzzles or in combat.
The story is immersive, well paced, and interesting. Superb dialogue. Along with all of this, the game looks and runs very well.

The game had minor faults. Some areas would feel a little too long, i found myself really only using the shotgun and SMG, the other weapons I would use only once my ammo ran out. The rocket launcher I used basically when I absolutely needed to e.g when trying to take down a helicopter. The ending was great, but left more questions than answers.

The original, as of the time I tried to play it, was just too frustrating and the graphics too dated to get into - at first. Then I played Half-Life 2, and realized what an interesting sci-fi world this was to explore.

Half-Life 2 got me hooked, and then I went back and played through Half-Life 1.... multiple times. Half-Life 2 is just incredible, and its hard to believe so many people play such bland... trashy FPS games these days instead of flavorful titles like Half-Life or Half-Life 2. The storytelling in Half-Life 2 is also special, despite being an action-FPS game. Like Bioshock, Half-Life 2 has a way of telling the story to the player while they are doing other things in the game in such a way that the player never really feels bored with being told a story, despite the fact that they accumulate knowledge of the world and all its intricacies throughout their gameplay experience.

The physics and gameplay are also masterworks of FPS gaming. This is one of the first gaming worlds that ever felt ""real"" to me. The graphics are superb for their game, and honestly are acceptable by many even considering today's standards, assuming you aren't spoiled by the recent influx of advanced-graphics FPS games these days that have crappy storylines.

68,Half-Life 2,PotatoesCanFly,"Nov 14, 2015","Half-Life 2, what to say? It's been out for over 11 years, what else is there to say?

Graphics 9/10: For a retro game made in 2004, the graphics do hold up well. Despite being very, very dated.

GamePlay 10/10: So Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter, but like the original Half-Life, it's not just, ""Oh I gOt AlL tHe NoScOpEs!!!!"" It's fun, encourages exploration, and the A.I. Is amazing.

Story 8/10: It's good enough. Basically this alien race known as the Combine wants to eradicate humanity.
Simple as that.

Sound & Music 6/10: Is this really that important? I mean, the sound-track is good, but nothing special.

Multi-Player N/A: Half-Life 2 has no multi-player, so it wouldn't be fair to rate.

Overall, Half-Life 2 has held up very well over a decade, and is very fun to the end. Collapse",10,4,4

The controls are not groundbreaking nor spectacular, they're simple and fun to use, especially in vehicles.

88,Half-Life 2,PureLombardi,"Nov 29, 2015","Shortly before typing this review up, I had completed Half-Life 2 for the first time. As a modern gamer who has played most of the top-rated games out there, I was curious about this title. Gradually, it blew me away

Initially, I thought that the game was overrated. Considering I haven't played Half-Life 1, the game was a bit unappealing. Take that with the gunplay being a bit on the plain side, and I thought I was in for a long haul of datedness. I deleted the game and forgot about it for months. But when I played it for the second time, its constantly thrilling gunplay, well-made levels, weird & wonderful creatures and lively animations opened up to me.

The game did many things opposing the norm: no cutscenes, physics-based puzzles in an FPS game, and ahead-of-its-time graphics and mechanics. The physics are still better than most games today and killing hundreds upon hundreds of enemies doesn't get repetitive as you might think because of it.

Its story polarized me. Upon perusing Half-Life 1's synopsis, the story became very interesting. I just wish there was more of it. The game seems to focus more on gameplay and environments, as you blast and drive your way through the Combine. Speaking of that, the universe boasts a fascinating backdrop that treats its audience intelligently, letting you figure out the state of the world yourself. That's something you rearely see in games before or since HL2 came out.

I agree that Half-Life 2 is one of the best FPSs of all-time, and to an extent, one of the greatest overall games. On the other hand, I do think that people mostly attribute this because of HL2's revolutionary influence. I know you can say the same about the film Citizen Kane, but I think that films don't get as dated as video games, since they are not virtually produced. I may not think that this game is top 10-20 worthy, but I have put it in my top 40 almost instantly, just like how I completed the game. The game does grab you, and surely enough, the experience is nearly as powerful as a headcrab grabbing you. You try to run, but the thing leaps on to you, and you're stuck in its immense grasp.

I could go on and on, as a matter of fact, so many have done just that on metacritic and, well, anywhere else. Also, for a game made in 2004, these graphics are SUPERB.
Don't get me wrong, if you are unfortunate enough to still not have played this software, when you do, it should be easy to see it is a masterpiece. The big bad shooters of today have got their own thing going on. Call of Duty, Halo, Battlefield, and such are okay, but to be honest, when I play these games I don't really care about the game itself. It just doesn't seem fun to me. They just don't seem to possess that pizzazz that half life 2 carries. And really, to me, how fun it is is a pretty damn important part of a game.

22,Half-Life 2,Heisenberg93,"May 24, 2015","After completing the first Half-Life I was expecting great things from the second chapter, and in fact I was not disappointed. If Half-Life was a revolution, Half-Life 2 was more a further refinement of that revolution.

The consequence of this is that Half-Life 2 is significantly better than the first chapter, which was already a masterpiece. The most amazing thing of Half-Life 2 is, of course, the gameplay: for an fps is just perfect. Already the first chapter was very advanced for its time, but Half-Life 2 went even further. One example is the way the game has used physics (thanks to the Source Engine) to offer one of the best weapons in the history of video games: the Gravity Gun. The Gravity Gun is the apotheosis of all that an fps has to offer. It is a crude but powerful weapon, fun to use and above all original. It is an example of how everything around you, in a game, is alive if you only try to touch it. This, by the way, is also possible without Gravity Gun, but without it is less fun. Another way of how Half-Life 2 has pushed beyond the standards is the introduction of puzzle elements, simple but fun, in a context with which apparently had nothing to do. Place some batteries to provide power to a gate and open it, may seems like silly but not in an fps game. Even using the Gravity Gun to take a rotating blade, or an heavy box, and launching it against an enemy is the art of using the enviroment as a weapon, and it is fantastic.

Other weapons that have gave an higher gear to Half-Life 2 were some like the Pheropods to control Antlions, or the Overwatch Standard Issue Pulse Rifle. It is so cool aesthetically. And the way it shoots, the way it recharge as well. The secondary attack was brilliant and was based on a fantastic physics and bounce mechanism. It was a weapon really fun to use. Last but not least important step forward made by Half-Life 2 (and soon followed by fps games came later) was the introduction of large open spaces where the player could really feel free to move, to experiment, to explore. The difficulty level was generally good and the enemy AI was great and when they were in large groups could get you in trouble. Just perfect as I said.

Personally I found the story of Half-Life 2 fantastic and also higher than the story of the first chapter. The setting in Eastern Europe was really beautiful. The game begins exactly from where the first chapter ends, but compared to the first chapter, Half-Life 2 has brought up more raw and human issues such as slavery, despair, infertility, redemption and hope. I appreciated very much the vision that the game give of Gordon Freeman: his fate, his stasis and his connection with the G-Man, his return as a prophecy, his eyes green as hope, the man who goes back and saves the day, a man of few words as Alyx Vance said, The One Free Man (nice language-game with his own name). All this just to describe one of the greatest and most charismatic characters in video game history. A special praise goes to other characters in the game such as the G-Man, Eli and Alyx Vance, Dog, Dr. Breen and especially to the Combine that are among the greatest villains ever seen in a game.

The graphics of the game was impressive at the time, and it was even 10 years later when I played it. The Source Engine realized everything perfectly, from the characters to the environments, from weapons to the shadows. But what amazed me the most was the detail in the faces, facial expressions, dubbing and lip sync that were just perfect.

Half-Life 2 is a majestic game. Valve gave one of the examples of what can be done when the videoludic art pushes the limits in all its forms. A timeless classic. Collapse",10,2,2

From scaling roofs to making your way through the sand in a jeep, this games missions are great and keep you wanting more. My one downside for this game is the ending, the cliff-hanger ending, although Valve has released Episode One and Two. So I guess it's not a cliff-hanger in a way.

just replayed it for the, let's say, 100th time today and yet i was surprised by how innovative and mind-blowing an FPS experience can be!
remember, the game was released in 2004 when almost every other FPS title out there was a replica of Doom!
the level design is great
music, simply pleasing to the ears
dialogues, humorous
characters, lovely and utterly believable
weapons, standard-defining (especially loved the .357 Magnum)
enemies, not so much varied but otherwise greatly designed and implemented into the game design

""Gordon Freeman"", the most reserved yet lovable protagonist of the video game history, and perhaps the first MIT graduate to feature in a game :D

And I can tell that I've played many games since I was a teenager, but Half Life 2 is just a very immersive game for me which drove me deep into the post-apocalyptic world once again with no disappointment.
The game has it's unique story with very cool and interesting characters. It has great character Alex, which is one of the best female characters in gaming in my personal view. The graphics is still impressive and there is no cheap feeling as with many other games, even modern ones. Of course game has great overall design and believable world which expanded just perfectly from the first Half Life. It has very good combination of story scenes and shooting/action scenes which is hard to do for many developers of the games.
There is a pretty standard arsenal of weapons but also few unique ones. Such as famous crowbar and a gravity gun, which is very fun. Game has it's physics based puzzles and maps where you can beat the enemies with no actual weapons which is very cool. There are vehicle and vessel which can be used in the game and it's a bonus to the great experience.
After replaying it of course I've seen more and more things that should've been improved or made better even at the time of release. For example every area in the game has it's limits where you can go, do or see. I also wish there where more puzzles or more interesting areas to visit, but the game quite short in length. Overall it's all very far from ruining the total greatness of the game, in my opinion. One thing to mention though I wish the game was actually finished after next Half Life 2 Episodes, but unfortunately what we have in 2017 is a script from the writer and tones of half life 3 memes, which is pity.

The music is an absolute amazing addition to this game, with soundtracks coming into the game at the right moments (driving sections of the game). I thought I was going to spoil this game by playing a large amount of Garry's Mod before playing and making the main characters look silly, but boy was I wrong. If you think there is no story or it is a horrible story, once again you have no idea. The storyline is another excellent dystopian story which is made clear by the Rebels and Citizens trying to survive in this horrible world. And if that is not enough for you, the game is riddled with challenging puzzles to make the game experience even more enjoyable.

Facial animation was revolutionary at the time. and it came with steam! at the time i had dial-up so i was **** and moaning because it took an additional day for the game to update and it wouldn't let me play without it. but now, thank god for steam. It is single handedly doing the heavy lifting to keep the PC gaming community alive. Valve, keep doing what you do. Episode 3 wouldn't hurt, but Half-life 3 would be even better. I have yet to play a Valve game i didn't like. I remember drooling over gaming magazines when they were showing images from the upcoming HL2. and the videos they released that showcased the physics. That clip of the manhacks coming down the hallway, whirring along slicing up everything in their path. And their take on audio is awesome. The sirens, the voices of the combine through masks or communicators. the sound of those weird energy orb thingies. down to the solid way the very first handgun felt in ""your"" hand.

This is the game that got me hooked on shooters. In that respect I guess it has a lot to answer for! And, along with Episodes 1 and 2, it remains my favourite to this day. Valve have taken their 1998 classic Half-Life and improved on it in every conceivable way. Much improved graphics, much improved physics, much improved AI, and much improved weapons, most notably the wondrous gravity gun. Once again it mixes a wide variety of spectacular environments with some satisfying puzzles and some fantastic combat. It also develops the story started in the original and fleshes it out nicely. Another important gain is the introduction of Alyx and her father Ely. Alyx will be a welcome companion and will, periodically, fight by your side. This is a big factor in HL2 the introduction of team play. You will have small bands of resistance fighters with you sporadically during play in the single player mode and this adds a team element which greatly increases immersion and the sense that what you do matters.

Looking at the actual shooter aspect, HL 2 more than passes the grade. Aiming is done without much difficulty and you are presented with a new gun type after a while which keeps things a little more interesting.

Услышал я про неё впервые ещё лет 8 назад, играл в демку, да и забил. Но вдруг решил пройти классику.
Ниже мнение человека, который не проходил игру в 2004, 2005... а только в 2016, в конце 2016.
Я не ньюфаг, прошёл игру с удовольствием, местами было скучновато, местами очень весело и эпично.
-Геймплей тут вполне стандартный. Он неплох, но местами, а точнее ближе к концу, он становится довольно скучноват. До середины игры дают покататься на 2-х транспортных средствах- багги и лодка на воздушной подушке, довольно неплохое разнообразие игрового процесса. Плавно перейдём к физике. Физика шикарна до сих пор, а в 2004 просто взрыв мозга... , но порой она выдаёт такие нелепости или странности, что немного не по себе. вообщем за геймплей 7,5-8/10
-Сюжет довольно интересный. Диалоги было интересно слушать, а финал так и вообще очень крутой вышел. А лицевая анимация просто шик, тоже до сих пор смотрится улётно, а в 2004... За сюжет 8/10.
-Атмосфера и музыка. Атмосфера тут бывает настолько разная, что диву даёшься. То это налёт хоррора, повсюду какие-то хлюпания, шорохи, темнота. То это атмосфера одиночества, едешь по дороге на той же машине, а на ней никого, вокруг только горы и океан. Ну и атмосфера пост-апокалипсиса. Музыка хороша, порой задаёт тонус вести дальнейшую битву, она довольно динамична, местами просто расслабляет. 9/10 за атмосферу и музыку.
Вообщем на данный момент игра всё ещё ОЧЕНЬ хороша, если вы не играли в неё и вы не ньюфаг, не презираете старые игры, а любите их, то я настоятельно рекомендую данную игру, кто знает, может она станет одной из ваших любимых!

65,Half-Life 2,frozen_flame123,"Jun 8, 2015","Come on, is a review even necessary? It's freakin' HL2! Game of the decade, game of the year, and ton of other awards. The gameplay and story are great and the graphics still hold up today. Gordon Freeman is a boss, the voice acting is damn good, the weapons are great, especially the Gravity Gun, and the game is fairly challenging.

However the reason that I think that this is the greatest game ever made is not even because of the game itself, but because of its impact on the gaming world. Few games have better modding communities than this game. Gmod, The Stanley Parable, Fistful of Frags, and many others. The same argument could be made for HL1, but I think that HL2's modding community is more prevalent than its predecessor.

You are not a gamer if you don't play this game, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Gaben will never give us HL3 because he is too busy eating cupcakes and having sex with Steam's sales figures to continue making games, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play this game.

88,Half-Life 2,default_access,"Jul 9, 2018","It's hard to believe that, prior to Half-Life 2, Valve had really made only one game. Of course, it was a masterpiece. Half-Life single-handedly reinvented the first-person shooter, putting the emphasis on cinematic pacing and complete immersion in the experience. As a result, it paved the way for many of the outstanding first-person shooters that have followed. And while there was little question that there would eventually be a sequel, no one could have imagined the long and torturous development process that led to Half-Life 2. Well, it's time to forget about that, because Half-Life 2 has arrived. And, in many ways, this big-budget sequel does what it sets out to do: Half-Life 2 is a technically amazing, sharply honed first-person shooter that pulls all the tricks that made Half-Life such a beloved experience. With that said, many of those tricks feel more than a bit familiar now, and the game itself is saddled with a disappointing story.

The game was the kick-off for the Source Engine, that would be used for many other great games. The game provides a new storyline for the Half-Life-series and a total new environment. For the first time wondering around in the outside world (Eastern-Europe?) experiencing the consequences of the events that happened in the Black Mesa laboratories.

The first game ended with the mysterious Gman and this game starts with him, dropping Gordon Freeman off in City 17. Directly meeting the Combine confronts you with the earlier mentioned consequences. The Combine conquered the world after the aliens landed first via the events of the first game. As a survivor of the ""Black Mesa-incident"" your trying to find out whats going on and what needs to be done. Overall the game has different great atmospheres.

The linear style leaves very little room to get lost, which is something that turns me off of a game immediately, and gets you through the story in a timely manner while still leaving small areas that can be explored at the player's leisure. While the characters may not be especially deep, the voice acting is spot-on and is one of the better examples of good voice acting in the gaming world. If you didn't play through Half-Life, which I strongly suggest you do, you may not understand a few plot points. However, not playing Half-Life does not ruin the experience of playing Half-Life 2.

The level's spiral layout makes it easy to fall off numerous things numerous times, but even this level mixes up the gameplay with a bit of horror. This doesn't matter all that much as the game's story and characters are the best I've ever had the fortune to play with. Every character is developed well (even the headcrab Lamarr), and by the end I was genuinely sad when the credits rolled. Each level feels amazing; you get a real sense of being the underdogs in the war against the Combine. This is a must buy, if you don't have the bloody game already.

I played it and both the episodes several times, each time longing for more. It is the most perfect game I have ever played - I recently played MW3 at a friends house, and got bored after an hour, I kid you not. Half-Life 2 is the most original game I have ever played, it deserves its rating. How MW3 got its high rating I'll never understand; it's basically the same game as MW2. People need to look away from just having the best graphics, they have to start looking at storytelling and innovation. This game has soul.

Now that having played through it again, as well as both of the episodes, I really came to appreciate how decent the game is, even compared to the games coming out nowadays. HL2 is not just an FPS game. It might seem like so at first, but there is a whole new level of depth to the gaming experience when it comes to this game. HL2 puts the player in all sorts of varying environments and against all sorts of enemies, each time changing the situation, so that you're never bored. The game is very dynamic. It keeps you surprised, changing the challenge all the time. On top of that it is very rewarding, as games should be. If you spend some time to explore for example, you find good items. The weapons are very enjoyable to use in combat, and some are even pretty unique. The Gravity Gun for example is very diverse in its applications and can be easily used for most of the combat situations in the game. The rocket launcher gives a whole new meaning to the term ""homing"" as you navigate the missile at your enemies with a laser sight. Every weapon is fantastic, whether it's an awesome sniper crossbow, or bugbait used to attract antlion creatures to attack the enemy. The storyline continues from the first game, except takes place a few years after. Gordon Freeman (the playable character) now finds himself in a dystopic society, where alien civilisation by the name of Combine is ruling over the humans on Earth. The story of HL2 manages to show tyranny and oppression really well. The story still leaves some loose ends, which opened up an opportunity for the sequels. Half Life 2 is generally an all round great game with no outstanding flaws whatsoever (although I felt that earlier parts of the game weren't as good as the latter parts). Great story, fun gameplay, beautiful visuals, nice soundtrack, and very lifelike NPCs (they act just like real people!). Collapse",10,5,6

Not many games have this unusual balance of realism with the fiction of most games but this game does it well. You are placed in an Eastern European locale, not very common with games, filled with powerful imagery of propaganda, graffiti, and the feel of an Orwellian fascist state. The characters are also good and a nice change from the uncanny valley-esqe companions of other games. They look and emote like real people and all have their fair share of important and serious lines with some lighter toned comical lines, however they don't show up much. Even the poor unlucky civilian bastards are kind of interesting and you actually feel a bit sad when they die, of course you also feel angry when they can't navigate through a simple hallway. The friendly and enemy AI are both impressive but in combat, they sometimes have their moments. The music is great with its balance of atmospheric dark rhythms and upbeat techno songs. And, get this, it actually has a story! The game sometimes feels dragged on at times ( aka Highway 17 and the gunships ), but the areas with ammo and health do appear in almost every level.

Consequently, some technologies in the Source engine might not have been on the same level as, say, Frostbite 2. That still doesn't stop it from looking absolutely amazing today, complete with lip-sync and NPC animations that don't plunge straight into the uncanny valley...back in 2004. The gameplay and story are also pretty solid, the latter particularly because it never takes away interactivity entirely just to show you an overwrought cutscene. It might lock you in a room, but you can still bunny-hop everywhere if it makes you feel better.

Right from the start, the game had me hooked, and this is despite the fact that I had never played the original Half-Life before. Valve manages to deliver the perfect blend of story-telling, action, and puzzles in a way that keeps you immersed and interested from start to finish. Even when you're sitting through a bit of dialogue, you're intently listening to the trade of words, eager to learn about the state of your world and what must be done for the betterment of mankind. The voice acting is incredible, the shooting mechanics work well, and the story is phenomenally written. I find myself returning to City 17 regularly, despite the linear gameplay. The only reason I'm hesitant to give this one a 10 is--well--it's not perfect. I mean, it's all there: the voice work, the story, the environments, the immersion. Every little bit of it is absolutely incredible, and yet, I refuse to give it a 10. Maybe it's because I'm a little skeptical to the idea of a ""perfect game"", or maybe it's got a shortcoming that I've overlooked... In order for it to be perfect it has to have it all, and that includes replay value. The unfortunate thing with such a story-driven game is that once you've played it, you already know what happens, so there isn't much reason to pop the disk in again. Nonetheless though, this will always be one of my favorite games of all time, and if you haven't yet given it a try, I highly suggest that you do. You won't be disappointed. Collapse",9,4,5

Despite its outdated graphics and being a 2004 game, the gameplay is way more superior than most FPS games today (i.e. Black Ops, Modern Warfare 2/3, Halo, etc.), and it has an excellent deep plot, which, for me, has political themes as it is about a revolution against foreign alien invaders called the Combine. In addition, the plot has much twists and suspense that will make you feel intrigued and curious on what's going to happen next in the game. In HL2, you play as a mute Resistance leader, Gordon Freeman, in a revolution against the Combine, which was indirectly caused by the Black Mesa Incident in HL1 and with the excellent first person feel, you are able to go in Gordon Freeman's ""shoes"" as he leads the resistance against the alien invaders. Plus, there are puzzles that make the game challenging, which are mostly used by the Gravity Gun, an awesome weapon intended for carrying objects used for puzzles, and using innocuous objects as weapons against Xen aliens and Combine Soliders. Another proof that HL2 is superior to today's FPS games is that there are various enemies and environments, thus making the game less repetitive and more addicting, especially in the Ravenholm level and the Citadel missions, where you can even throw Combines everywhere with your gravity gun, making you feel like a god.

As someone who has been a fan of Half Life 2 for years, I have never really quit playing it - although I have taken some pretty big breaks in between. It is during my current playthrough that I decided to come write a short review on Metacritic to describe just how I feel about this game.

I am sure there isn't a reputable gamer alive that isn't fully aware of Half Life 2 and the hype surrounding it. And as beloved as it is, I would still so far as to say that this game is one of the most underrated games of all time.

How can a game that is widely considered by many as the greatest shooter to date, and even still by others (such as myself) as the greatest video game period, be underrated?

As difficult that would be to explain, it's equally difficult attempting to convey just how great this game is in so short of space. Indeed, the fact that a game so good can be so under appreciated is something that has baffled me for quite a time. In my humble opinion, no amount of praise or appreciation for Half Life 2 would suffice. What Valve has created is simply a work of art. The visuals, sound, gameplay, and storytelling are of among the best the gaming world had ever seen. It's incredible just how amazing and groundbreaking was every facet of Half Life 2, in respect to the time it was released, and even more incredible that each groundbreaking aspect was all in the same game. The game that literally had it all. The Beatles of the PC gaming world. The fact that Half Life 2 can still be played today, 8 years later, and can be every bit as impressive as modern shooters (more, in some instances), truly testifies to just how great this game is.

The game's physics were at the time unheard of and still even today are quite good in how you can use the gravity gun to pick up and throw objects at enemies and to solve puzzles. As you play, you will see the characters develop and you will start to care about them and how they interact. The whole game being a long continuous level is also really cool as you can clearly see how the whole game links together.

88,Half-Life 2,WyvernCritic,"Nov 18, 2013","Half-Life 2. There is so much to say, and the true greatness of this game cannot be expressed in a simple review. After playing through this game, you look back and just want to play it again, to experience it all over again. Even today, Half-Life 2 still holds up in the 'looks' department, running on Valve's truly amazing Source engine. What makes Half-Life 2 so great, you might ask? What makes this game from 2004 still one of the best games ever made? Let me indulge you.

As a preface to this review, I implore you to play the original Half-Life. Otherwise, this review may be a little confusing. Although playing Half-Life is not needed to understand Half-Life 2, it certainly helps in terms of the story line.

The game begins with a greeting from 'G-Man', a familiar face from the previous Half-Life games that can be seen wandering throughout Black Mesa in Half-Life. After G-Man ends his tidings, you awaken on a tram headed for 'City 17'.You have no idea why you are on the tram, or what you are doing, but you know that something is afoot. You are Gordon Freeman, a bearded scientist that used to work at Black Mesa as a physicist. This brings me to 'point one', of what makes this game truly great. Instead of being a burly super-human bullet sponge trooper with the 'generic rifle 9000' strapped to your back, you play a mute physicist. Yes, a mute physicist. This makes it a lot easier to get immersed into the game and feel like you are Gordon Freeman. This is enhanced by the fact that Freeman does not speak throughout the course of the game, allowing you, the player, to think what you wish and not be told what you are thinking by your character bursting out in song.

The story line of Half-Life 2 is a wonder to play. I won't spoil any of it for you, you'll have to experience it for yourself. A myriad of characters help Freeman on his way, fleshing out the world and making the places Freeman explores seem alive... or dead, as the case may be. Brilliant voice acting from all of the cast puts the cherry on the cake and does wonders to immerse you in the story of Gordon Freeman.

But what about gameplay? Surely gameplay is the most important thing in a GAME. Don't fret Half-Life 2's gameplay is some of the best in any game. Ever. Forget lousy 2 gun limits and boring AK-47s Freeman can carry a whole truckload of weapons and grenades; all tuned to fit in with the setting and the world. From the early pistol to the RPG and the combine weaponry, the guns in Half-Life 2 do not disappoint. The weapons feel good too they have a nice oomph to them and feel like they should as well as the animations being great across the board. Even by today's standards. And we're talking about a game that's almost 10 years old. But, it's not just guns. Oh no. Ohhhhh no. A bit into the game, you get the Gravity Gun the star of the show. With this beauty, you can lift and throw physics objects. This may seem boring at first, but wait until you pick up a buzzsaw and shoot it at that headcrab, splitting it in two. That feels awesome. But, it's not just a one-gun show. Throughout different levels, you get different, cool weapons to try. At one point, your Gravity Gun even becomes supercharged, letting you throw PEOPLE. Yes, you pick up enemies and throw them at each other.

What more can I say about this game? You owe it to yourself to play this if you haven't already. Log on to, or get Steam, and go buy it now. You'll thank me later. Trust me. This game is truly worthy of its legendary status in the hearts of many gamers. You don't even need a beast PC to play it either. As I said, 2004. You can run it. Trust me.

10/10. From the heart. One of the best games ever made.

89,Half-Life 2,FrankLicorice,"Dec 30, 2013","A heavily anticipated sequel to the seminally influential Half-Life, Half-Life 2 is an indubitably well-executed and enthralling media experience. The game artfully exemplifies a precipiced human race beset with the horror of a xenocratic dystopia whilst also providing interaction and levity with relatable characters, both central and minor. From the very outset, I was immersed in the eerie mystique of the opening characters and the ostensibly artificial setting. The player's character, Gordon Freeman, never speaks, nor does he need to; his humanity and heroism become progressively apparent as the player completes the game, despite the perennial air of mystery he conveys.

The immersive realism of the game is brilliantly augmented by precise and complex game physics, impressive facial animation, and the perpetual necessity for the player to utilise his environment to complete chapters, rather than the gameplay being excessively linear and unchallenging.
The dark, tyrannical undertones of the game stir the player to empathise with the plight of the fledgling resistance movement and become further psychologically involved in the plot. Half-Life 2 is gripping, stimulating and revolutionary. I wholeheartedly recommend it. Collapse",9,3,4

The only thing interesting is the Gravity Gun, but that's also kind of boring because even games like Sonic 06 implemented this combat feature for Silver the Hedgehog. So yes, the combat is meh.

The graphics is still pretty good for today if it has improved lighting and better textures. The story is very uninteresting, I also don't feel attached to characters like Alyx, Barney, and others. Like the part when you are seperated from Alyx and you have to go to Ravenholm. I'm just like, meh I'll move on. I don't feel worried of other characters in danger and all that For a game that is supposed to be story driven, it is extremely BAD AT STORY.

People say that this game is a physics puzzle game, but guess what? None of the puzzles are hard. All it takes is to stack enough objects on one specific place and move on. Nothing challenging there, so why is it a physics puzzle game?

The game is very linear, but also provides some exploring you can do to find hidden pockets of extra health, armor and ammo, which is stupid because you'll encounter a lot of them on plain sight, so you can survive this game on hard mode without ever finding the hidden supplies.

Overall, for today's standard, it is an average cookie-cutter first person shooter and for $10, it's good I guess. Collapse",5,8,11

5,Half-Life 2,vahn,"Jan 9, 2013","I'm so going to be hated to death, but I didn't love this game as many others tend to do, even though it's actually very good game for itself and even 8-9 years later it's still fresh to play and doesn't look aged at all. But despite all that, I definitely enjoyed Half Life 2 less than the previous chapter. I wil also say that I started with this chapter and then bought the previous game. First of all, I did like how the game, like I said, is still fresh: the graphics are surprisingly great and the engine is extremely good, and once you get the gravity gun you can exploit the physics of the game at its best. The characters are, for the most part, very remarkable and likeable to interact with, so nothing wrong here, except that maybe some characters disappear and reapper from the plot and will eventually confuse some people (or not). The game is also very balanced in the combats, with a good variety of weapons, a great variety of (very smart) enemies and with also many different situations to play. Infact, the best word to descrive this game, is ""variety"": you'll have a lot of situations in the game and they all are surprisingly fun to play and hardly bore you (like the boat section and ravenholm, where you will exploit the gravity gun). The story is...interesting...but I tend to get confused at times and I don't remember really much. And here comes some flaws in my opinion; while the story is good and well written, the game somehow seems very padded because, with some exceptions, the sections seem like a bunch of different parts glued all together! This isn't a big deal but, because of these sections that look like different parts completely, the story might get confusing, because (like I said) characters might appear and disappear all of the sudden and the story seems to get a halt for a pair of hours (the biggest example to me was the teleporter sceme: it seemed like an excuse to insert another part of the game). While I liked the first game because there wasn't much to understand, but only much to discover, in here it felt like I needed too much to understand, with nothing to discover at all. Also, this is kinda personal, I never got the links between the first game and this one (one big reason why I HAD to buy the first), but after finishing that game I still don't know what happened here after the events of the first (especially since that the ending of the first game didn't look like it had anything to do with the start of this. Except the presence of G-man). Maybe I'm just dumb, so I might be totally wrong on complaining this much. Moving to the combat: while I hated a bit the first game for the unbalance between the enemies (entire magazines to dispatch a few soldiers, while few shots would take down big aliens), this game actually fixes a lot of issues, especially with very well balanced weapons and with enemies that, for what I saw, have weakpoints (a head shots seem to do more damage here). My biggest complain here, is that the weapons aren't that many, even if there's the gravity gun. Quality over quantity is always the rule, however we could have used more variety of guns, or have a better thought for using them. For example, one of the rifles is rather bad because of the small magazines, and both of the rifles' secondary fire is very limited due to the lack of proper ammo; the magnum is great, but I hardly found that many ammo to use it so often; the grenades must be choose apart, while it should have been a button instead, or at least a faster way to choose it. And few weapons won't be used at all after certain parts, like the pheromone bomb. And while the gravity gun is a great invention, I found it very limited at times and, to be honest, I used it only on one section (Ravenholm), and NEVER used it again, because there was almost no other reason to use it afterwards and, strangely, only a very limited amount of weapons could be used. On the other hand, when it gets powered, things change completely. Just too bad it's for a brief time. All in all, I liked this game, but I honestly expected much more: while the first one had flaws and could use some more story and more balance, in here the situations don't always match the story properly, resulting in some unnecessary padding at times, and while it was very innovative for its time (and still kinda is), right now we also have games that took from the innovation that this game made and actually evolved it. Probably I'm just not a fan of this game and opinions will be varied, but it's still a good game to play and there's nothing exactly wrong with it. However, if people can't go past the ""oldness"" of this game, probably it's better to step away. Or else, give it a try and see for yourself. Collapse",8,4,6

But with Half-Life 2, they slow down and take some time to think. And not only that, the action is amazing and fun.

What it sets out to do is so beyond our standard notion of videogames that it defies that categorization. The fundamental difference between Half Life 2 and ""videogames"" is that Half Life 2 wants you to go on an adventure, not play a game. Do you see the difference? Videogames are predicated on the fact that they have to entertain you through the provision of some form of ""play"" or ""game"". Half Life 2 isn't about getting to play with a gun, or killing a roomful of aliens: It's not a game. It's not play. All that stuff comes as an afterthought. The entire point of Half Life 2 is that you get to witness the most important day in Gordon Freeman's life in its entirety - and It was one hell of a day. If you were to watch a playthrough of Half Life 2 without having any control over the character at all, It really wouldn't effect the overall experience that much.

12,Half-Life 2,azeitona,"Nov 29, 2014","Actually, I liked the first game better. Half Life 1 is my favorite game of all times. But since I'd give that game a 11, I'll give HL2 a 10.

So, ok, I'll look at it as it was back in 2004 and I'll say how it stands today.

The atmosphere is incredible. The soundtrack is really memorable, the graphics were awesome in 2004 (maybe not as beautiful as FarCry, but still...) and the whole universe presented to us is well created. It just... feels real, and the team seemed to draw much inspiration from books like 1984. And I love 1984. The whole concept of a dystopian world amuses me. Of course, the graphics have not aged that well, but the world the game presents is still very memorable, and still is very atmospheric. Few games do that nowadays. I can think only of Batman: Arkham series, Bioshock and maybe The Last of Us, but I have not played the last.

The gameplay, for me, at last, is not as good as Half Life 1. The weapons lack some punch, but the enemies are fun to deal with (although it's a shame that they scraped some enemies from HL1). And the gravity gun, oh man... The gravity gun is so awesome that I never seen such a cool weapon in any other game. It's a game-changing weapon, and it was there also to showcase the realistic physics engine.

And the Half Life series always had such a great pacing. Calm moments. Exploration moments. And really fast-paced moments. And the game plays really well on all of them. And that's thanks to the amazing level design, which is as good as the first game, if not a little better.

The story is pretty simple, and much people complain about Gordon being idolatred by everyone... but, c'mon, he saved the **** planet Earth, and he is just a theoretical scientist, who barely know how to use a gun. And the journey of the hero is a bit clichéd, but you actually FEEL like you are saving the world. I mean... let's look at Master Chief, for example. I kinda like Halo. And Master Chief saves the **** galaxy, but I don't feel like I'm really doing it. It's like ""oh, I'm saving the galaxy, ok"". And Half Life there's a feeling of desperation, and it is all very subtle at the same time. It's really damn nice. And the story tells you so much with so little... there are still few games that do this today. And, this time, I can only think of Bioshock. Few clues in the environment that tell a much bigger story. That's something more games should seek to do.

So, yeah... to me, it's not as good as the first one, but it is an amazing experience if you enjoy first person shooters. And even if you don't like the genre, you should give it at least a try. Half Life 2 is one of the best games of the 2000's, and has a perfect balance between old mechanics (huge weapons limit, frenetic gameplay, absence of iron sights, level exploration, puzzles) and new mechanics (story-driven game, changes in pacing, search for a somewhat realistic universe). So... try it once you can! You won't regret it. The worst that can happen is to you find it boring, but it's not gonna piss you off. Collapse",10,4,6

-Set dificulty higher.
5) The story is an incoherent mess.
-Follow the storyline. It aint hard to understand if you understand english.
6) the art is soviet era rot, brown and grey and depressing That is because the enviroment is supposed to be depressing. It aint Angry birds you're playing.
7) the assests look like they are from 2004, you know when videocards had 128mb of ram and people were playing games on the ps2 and original xbox? And don't forget that this game was made for original xbox. -The game is for 2004, so I guess it looks like it's from 2004.
8) puzzles involve moving boxes around, and platforming with above mentioned **** controls. All in all, this game just does not stack up to great shooters like like crysis, Stalker, Metro, New Vegas, DayZ, etc. I supose if you are into playing old games like Fallout 1&2, Thief, etc., then you'll like this one. But if you are like me and find old PS2/xbox era games totally unfun, then stay away. YMMV blahblah.

DOG is amazing you can play fetch with him and I made him spaz out. I mean like I was not playing with DOG. I was playing with Alex. DOG was on the barrel and Alex was throwing rock at me.

The standard for first person shooters
Hype can ruin your experience with a game.
The higher the hype, the higher the expectations, and rarely does anything live up to it’s hype.
Half-Life 2 however, does.
Half- Life 2 is a near perfect first person shooter with star wars level of innovation.
I didn’t really understand what was going on in the game and why it was going on.
The story and its characters couldn’t keep my attention at all, everything pertaining to the story seemed so generic to me, luckily though the gameplay is good enough on its own to take you through the 10 plus hour journey.
Half-Life 2 is a very linear game, but at the same time every section of the game feels connected, it feels open world… you hardly ever feel like you are bread crumbed to the finish.. When you find passages you feel like it was your work, when really the game cleverly got you there with its carefully constructed design.
The pacing is nearly perfect
you’re slowly hand fed new weapons..
you’ll get to a point in the game where you’re introduced to a new weapon and then instantly have to use it for what its intended for, this is a perfect way to get you accustomed to and comfortable with everything at your disposal and prevent you from wasting unnecessary ammo.
There wasn’t one weapon or item given that I wasn’t thankful for or that I didn’t find useful.
This is great considering you’ll find yourself in some spots out of a particular set of ammo.
The game play is also varied, so you’re not quite sure what to expect.
Some games find a formula and stick to it.
Half Life 2 doesn’t do this
one minute you’re playing a stealth shooter, the next moment you’re playing call of duty style taking out troops, and 2 hours later you’re cruising through the world with vehicle based combat only to end up at a horror game style section
This variation keeps the game from ever feeling like a grind, but at the same time the stress is kept at a near maximum.
You won’t find too much challenge outside of the final few chapters, but the constant feeling of survival mode will definitely have you stepping away for a few hours or days.
I now understand why everyone wants half-life 3 so bad.
I loved climbing through every hole not knowing who or what would meet me on the other side.
Half-Life 2 is a must play for gamers to experience the magic every developer has been chasing since 2004

You are never in one place too long, or doing something for so long it becomes tedious, as the game takes you through different areas, changing your play style subtly and introducing new mechanics and weapons (such is the world renowned Gravity Gun) as well as new enemies. The story unfolds very, very well and the pacing is of the highest quality you will find in a shooter even now in 2011. Voice work is top-notch and animations can be stellar even by todays standards.

59,Half-Life 2,CulturalFiend,"Jun 8, 2012","Some of the negative reviews here are partially correct. For the most part, however, they are wrong. At the time of release, Half-Life 2 was exceptional. Technically speaking, Half-Life 2 was years ahead of its time; just as the first Half-Life was, years before. Half-Life 2 brought a level of interactivity and immersion that gamers had never even thought of. The game was able to accomplish a very cinematic feel and tell a great, detailed story without the use of cut-scenes. The facial expressions of the characters in Half-Life 2 were something that blew away many gamers. Facial expressions in video games have never been done with such detail, the only game that has beat Half-Life 2's facial expressions is L.A. Noire. L.A. Noire didn't come out until 2011, seven years after the release of Half-Life 2. That tells you just how technically advanced HL2 was. Facial expressions were not the only aspect of HL2 that seemed to catch player's attention. The physics engine is what had many players and critics alike in a frenzy. While real-time physics had been in video games before, Half-Life 2 took it to a whole new level. It made players actually use physics in order to solve puzzles and defeat certain enemies, instead of using the engine as something cool to look at, e.g., Halo series. The level of immersion that followed was overwhelmingly satisfying. Players were given the freedom to interact with many objects and do many things that they normally could not do in other games. Half-Life 2 gave players the illusion of freedom; many puzzles were designed so that there was no specific way to accomplish them. Not only that, but many areas had secret alcoves and otherwise unreachable areas that could only be reached if the player utilized the physics engine, giving players a sense of an open-environment. Half-Life 2 is able to create a very non-linear experience within an extremely linear game. I believe that this is one of the main reasons why critics loved it. Many of the things I have said here only scratch the surface, Half-Life 2 has immense replayability value. No there isn't any collectibles, or levels to achieve. But the game, much like a good movie, had many small things that were easily missed. Playing it through for a second time, a player will be more likely to discover these little things. Secret areas, interesting mini-puzzles, and G-Man sitings are a few things that make the game worth playing again and again. I first bought this game four years ago, and it completely blew my mind. I have since replayed it four times now. With every playthrough, I found something new. Half-Life 2 truly is an amazing game. If you are reading this and have ever considered trying it, but never got around to buying it, take my advice: go buy Half-Life 2 right now. I sincerely believe that Half-Life 2 is our generation's Super Mario Bros., it's simply a game that will always be remembered. Thanks for reading, Signed: Culture F. Collapse",10,3,5

The pacing and difficulty curve is well crafted and the game manages to make traveling tense and exciting. I'd say that unless you're one of those people who hates a game that isn't constant action then play this game just for the experience alone.

I only really have one problem that is that the allies you get aren't very clever and don't seem to have a sense of self preservation. All of the NPCs seem to rely very heavily on Gordan Freeman to the point where you have to wonder how the resistance survived before he showed up.

But this is just one thing that you won't really notice while playing because this isn't a game it's an experience that everyone should have! Collapse",10,4,7

However the facts are this is a completely 100% linear lane, only can be argued by the fact they have ""puzzles"" in the game, its just a nuisance and something added in to make you think, and force the game to take longer than it should. I like the fact they make me think but atleast make the puzzles fun. I mean really stacking boxes, or holding down the E button to lift/drop gates, etc... Its not fun!

While the game does have some great qualities, It's very overrated. Let's talk about the good first: The graphics are amazing and have aged so well! You'd never guess it was made 7 years ago. The games progression, while linear, is very varied and entertaining. There are action packed moments, puzzles, and vehicle sequences. Unlike other shooters, this game does a great job of making fights feel epic (strider battles!). Now for the bad. The story is boring and the characters aren't very interesting. There are a few deadly glitches. The enemy variety isn't too high. The vehicle sequences are mostly boring. Sometimes the varied gameplay takes you from playstyles that you like to playstyles that you hate. Feels a bit formulaic at times.

The story is quiet good but even this has problems. It is presented by conversations but the volume of the NPCs is so unbalanced to the game I can't hear them. There is also no explanation for most of what is going on. The ending is very good but it comes at the end of a bland level and ""boss fight"".

The story is a masterpiece, showing you a world held hostage by the powerful Combine, an alien race who came to Earth after the events of the first game and all but enslaved us. Remember the physics of the first game? Half Life 2 has cranked those up to 11, with beautiful flames that will have you standing by fires and realistic crows that take off when you approach. And then there's the combat. Like the first game, it is executed perfectly, but I noticed that many of the guns are almost exactly the same. You get the standard pistol, the crowbar, the shotgun, the smg, the rpg, the grenades, and the crossbow. The only weapons that seemed new were the assault rifle and the gravity gun. Oh man, the gravity gun. I could write an entire review just about that, how you can pick up and push items, solve puzzles, etc. Throughout the game you'll visit a number of locales, from the Antlion-infested beaches to the city of Ravenholm, which is positively crawling with zombies.

There wasn't a moment where things seemed repetitive or bland. The story, all viewed by speechless Gordon Freeman, the protagonist, is great. It is about Gordon Freeman's escape in City 17 where civilians are captured by the Combine (alien empire-type baddies) and areas are scattered with Headcrab zombies. He has a great female companion named Alex Vance who accompanies you in the adventure. Overall the story is brilliantly executed and is pretty damn awesome.

Around the fact that you are smart enough to go trough a game without a guide and a army, that you can be emerged in an amazing universe and understand a complicated storyline, that you can understand your objective without it flashing in red and gold every 3 seconds, and that you can solve physics based puzzles, under pressure and enemy fire without any clues.

Half-Life 2 is not only a sequel of a critical acclaimed video game, but is one of the best video games ever made.

The plot takes place in the fictional City 17, where Gordon is woken up after his 20yrs long stasis, from original Half-Life, where he finds that the world has changed a lot in his absence, now the Earth being ruled by an unknown alien race called Combine.

After the Seven Hour War, the humanity has been willingly enslaved so they will still live, rather than the whole world to be annihilated. However the player later discovers that combine suppression field will prevent them to re-product, so that the current generation is the last one.

When Gordon comes back, everybody knows him and what he has done, and practically considered a hero, and a legend.

During his journey, once again, this time Gordon doesn't fight for saving a facility, and the whole world, shortly becoming Combine's prime target, and in same time, the symbol of freedom for the Resistance.

During the plot, the player meets again the iconic characters, and antagonists from the original game, such as Eli Vance, Dr. Breen, but also the xenians that now are friends, headcrabs, zombies, and also several new characters like Alyx Vance, dr. Judith Mossman, who both later will become iconic characters of the sequel.

Half-Life 2, beyond the new friends, also features new enemies, such as Antlions, more zombie races, and others.

The gameplay is just flawless. As the first one, Half-Life 2 is a FPS, but, same, in which the player will need to solve puzzles to progress in the game, listen at splendid dialogues, and decent, mature and great conflicts.

The sequel has the same characteristics, is still linear, but with great replay value.

The level design is just astonishing, with detailed buildings, great lightning and water effects, physics, and many others.

Most of the weapons from the original game we're not kept, but many others we're introduces, such as the 9mm USP Pistol, SMG1 with it's grenade launcher, spas-12 shotgun, a re-created crossbow and RPG, a BugBait(also called Pheropod), an alien-ish AR2 Rifle, advanced grenades, and the 2 iconic weapons, the crowbar, and the Gravity Gun.

As an ,,bonus,, Half-Life 2 also features more usable vehicles, such as Airboats, and Buggies.

Beyond the game play mechanics, great level design, unbelievable story, was also introduced one of the best game's friendly and enemy AI, which are pushed to their limits and skills in both non-scripted events, but scripted as well.

Same with the physics, which are shown the same way the AI is, though regular, but scripted sequences as well.

After this, Half-Life 2 had a sort of chaotic development, like you've seen in E3 2002 gameplay and trailer, the game was totally different than the final product, as it's been set in a darker future. The original plot can be found in the Raising The Bar Book, which features concept arts, original design and others from Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, And Half-Life(both originals and the sequels).

The original plot also inspired many mods, most notable being Missing Information.

So, after all this, I guess you all have seen great/good/decent sequels, but there aren't many that not only live to the expectations, they even surpass them.

Half-Life 2 is a great shooter and is a must-own and play. Collapse",10,1,2

45,Half-Life 2,thedarkestdie,"Sep 12, 2014","Half Life 2 is a stunning masterpiece. I played this game a long time ago on the orange box for the PS3. TBH it didn't stick back then. Years later I played the game on PC, after playing the first game, and I was shocked at how good it was.

First the game's physics is superb. It's a lot of fun to drop enemies and watch their death throes as you take them down. It's such a simple thing yet Valve does such an excellent job at it thanks to the physics of the game which few games out there will ever be able to come close to. That also brings me to the gravity gun. A weapon that will become your best friend upon receiving it. It can snatch and throw objects and can be used on the fly with a simple push of a button when using any other weapon making it a handy gun for breaking and moving obstacles or busting open the many supply crates in the game.

Now for the games story. The story is pretty straight forward. In the beginning of the game you show up at City 17, ruled over by Dr. Breen the former administrator to Black Mesa in the previous game. Dr. Breen is essentially a puppet for a transhuman race know as the Combine to ensure domination of the human race by the Combine who rule the human race with totalitarian brutality. The story's narrative is non-cinematic in nature yet it manages to tell the story with crisp clarity. Constant control over Freeman in each of the non-action story sequences deliver a great sense of immersion few games have.

In terms of gameplay the game does an excellent job at balancing great face-paced action and slower non-action sequences to give gamer a quick breather before pushing onwards in their epic journey. The gameplay sequences are also rather superb and varied. One moment you're on a dune buggy dodging antions, another you're trying to outrun and destroy a relentless chopper, in another sequence you're fighting zombies in a dark overrun town. The variety keeps the game unpredictable and fun, and with great gameplay freedom, along with a great arsenal of weapons, you bring down the house however you see fit.

The game moves at a great pace and its one of the few games that I'd play again just for the sheer experience of it. The superb narrative, graphics, gameplay freedom and physics make the game a true masterpiece that will stand proud among the best games the gaming industry has to offer. Few come close to the masterpiece that is Half Life 2. Long live Dr. Freeman! Collapse",10,1,2

Seriously; you don't even need to READ a review to play this wonderful game made back in that period where you still loved Half life. From early betas, to the current state, I still love this master piece that will be standing forever into the ashes of old and good games. This outstanding shooter will never bored from playing it over multiple times. After all, where should I start?
Characters are very well made, not that good graphics for that period but who needed them on that type of small monitors? The voice acting is one of the best and gives you the feeling that they're really there talking live to you! They have also a great plot into their own minds, body and flesh. Makes you wanna stick around and love them. Gordon Freeman, the main character, doesn't speak at all but that gives you the idea to think like him, for yourself, not him for you. The soundtrack should have the Pulitzer Prize for great performance and I still like the songs today. The story is one of the best one I ever met into a video game (FPS). The Half Life Trilogy is sent from 2000s all the way to 2030s. The Seven Hour War in 2012/2013, also having a great appetite for me in the idea of Half Life. Too bad they didn't release a game where you take part of it LIVE and seeing the world going to hell. Graphics aren't the best ones but for that time, they were rocking hard. The physics are GREAT and makes the game need-to-play. Facial animations are great even in beta where I noticed they looked like the same in the current game, but with no voice acting. The weapons are told to be human and Combine, some even Combineized. Adding extra attachments for their use of power.
This game may have some little bugs over there and over here but it won't stop you from playing it as long you're not activating console cheats and exploiting the trigger on the maps!

58,Half-Life 2,Ryphereon,"Mar 16, 2021","Half-Life 2's Gameplay wasn't very enjoyable to me since most of it is a loop that goes as follows: Shoot enemy => Take cover to reload => Repeat until enemy is dead.
Half-Life 2 does throw new and original weapons at you, like the iconic Gravity Gun, at certain points throughout the game. These weapons are usually creative and fun to use and are probably the best aspect of the game, but their novelty usually wears off after 20 minutes or so, from which point on you basically go back to the old Shoot-Reload loop - albeit with a new weapon at your disposal.

Half-Life 2 sometimes takes a break from its Shooter gameplay with other types of game segments. These segments are a bit hit or miss, ranging from ""fairly good"" to ""no fun at all"" (I especially disliked the boat part around the start of the game, which took me at least 1.5 hours to get through and was extremely unfun).

I didn't fully understand Half-Life 2's story since I haven't played the first game, but my impression was that it was fairly good. The atmosphere of the world around you is set splendidly within the first few minutes and characters felt very ""real"" in terms of dialogue.

Lastly, I'd like to mention that the game can be very creepy or downright disgusting at times because of certain types of enemies. I won't go into detail about them, but just know that this game is rated 17+ for good reason. Collapse",6,1,2

Yes, the graphics are good, gravity gun is interesting but the game gave me the feeling of ""hey, now we are using the gravity in our games and this is very innovative. so you should appreciate it as a classic"". No... Half-Life 2 is not the best game ever made, it is not even a classic. It is, however, a fairly good game with good sound and atmosphere, average story and shooting physics and some spectacular graphics for its time. There are some chapters that are too long, such as the ones where you use an airboat, in which the game feels more like a tech demo where the devs are trying to impress. And the worst thing about the game, a huge minus, is that Half-Life 2 will likely give you nausea. In some chapters I felt sick and my face went pale.

I remember, I loved this game back then, it had some awesome graphics which was well optimised as well, and loved the different uniqe parts (ie. driving a buggy, etc.). Now, the game is basically OK, but it has a lot of flaws. First, it happened to me a lot that I got stuck in some terrain object/wall piece/etc., which is pretty frustrating in the middle of combat. The ""helpers"" are more like a pain in the @ss rather than helpful, they are always in the wrong place and one just can't move freely because of them (especially in the heat of a battle). But my biggest concern is the story: throughout the game, I didn't have a clue what is happening. It was always like ""Run, Gordon!"" ""You have to go to place B!"" and so on. And there are no cutscenes or other story telling points, only your companions, who tell you you have to do this and do that. It was just a big running, with lot of fights, but for what and why, it was not clear to me.

And then you'll have to kill 100 people and 20 monsters to get to the other level, where you'll drive a boat and kill another 100 people and this time 30 monsters. Then someone comes to you and says hey, I'm your father! And then you're like ""Noooo!"", and kill a couple hundred more. The plot can be written this short:
- Gordon joins resistance
- Eli is captured
- Mossman is a traitor
- Alyx is captured too
- Mossman is a traitor again, so prisoners are freed
- they blow **** up

So what kind of plot is that?? But anyway, it's nice to play in the parts where it's well made and not too repetitive. For example the lighthouse, turret defense and driving parts I liked.

The enemies are extremely repetitive and the AI is pretty useless considering 70% of the time they just stand still and shoot. Ravenholm isn't scary and the zombies are easily killed. The best part of the game is the story and characters, for that it deserves genuine praise. From a 2004 point of view, some aspects were groundbreaking, but fact is, you can't give a game so much praise just because it's amazing in some areas, and average in others.

87,Half-Life 2,TheUnbeholden,"Apr 22, 2014","There was something very incredible about the original Half-Life. It was ground breaking for its time because it was the first game I played that really felt alive. Half-Life 2 is a step back in some ways. While it continues the same classic formula of run and gun rail shooter, it however goes back in several areas.
While it has more of a storyline than Half-Life, its just not very interesting. The combine are perhaps the most bland enemy I've ever seen, the key problem is they are unmemorable. Like a weaker version of the Strogg (from Quake).

While it has the best physics (which makes sense as you are Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist). The game took a nose dive into a completely different locale. The claustrophobia of underground research facility is gone, and some classic aliens don't make a come back (bullsquid/hound eye)... and Vortiguants are friendly -_-

The game also noticeably lacks difficulty, even on hard the game is perhaps the easiest I've ever played.
Less explosive barrels - Half-Life 1 had a perfect balance. Every time I saw a barrel in Half-Life 2 I knew someone was going to either go near it or hide behind it. Less health kits, once again HL1 had a perfect balance.. here I always find 2-3 to many. Those unlimited ammo/grenade supply crates where so unnecessary.

The mediocre AI.. I want the AI to find ways to circle around me and trap me in corners, flush me out with grenades. The airboat portion in Half-Life 2 was dragged on far too long. In between each section you kill a few easy metro cops and then on you go... like some sort of tech demo.

+Gameplay is fun, and level design is logical
+Ergonomically designed, so you can play the whole in one sitting
+Characerisation
+Very long
+Ravenholm

-Easy game, even on Hard
-Bland enemy design for the combine
-Unmemorable music
-Mediocre AI

-Physics puzzles brought FPS a interesting twist, but I thought that they really didn't do anything substantial to move the genre forward. Instead it feels like a technical achievement rather than the merging of FPS gameplay and physics in some meaningful way. Using the physics gun to launch objects at enemies is about as far as it goes in this regard. I think future games to come end up achieving something like this more so.

-Why does Gordon have to be a silent protagonist? I feel like it's more a crutch on the story. Collapse",8,1,3

89,Half-Life 2,AidanM,"May 26, 2013","I'm just not as high on this game as everybody else. There is some good FPS fun fighting various kinds of creative enemies. There will be a few moments where you will kill lots of enemies at once with a car, toilet, or bouncy disintegrate thing where you will sit back and admire your work. Some of the guns are still more creative than current FPS guns. However, while its moments are great, there is way too much shooting waves of basic soldiers without any of the creative others from a far distance, which is not only boring but annoying because only one gun has sights. There are too few opportunities to use the gravity gun, the very fun weapon which is really the signature piece of this game. And while I said the guns are very creative, they fall to often under the linear spell where they are used in one situation well and disregarded for the rest of the game.

98,Half-Life 2,cidgrad01,"Oct 27, 2014","I know I am treading well-worn ground, here, but Half Life 2 is one of the few games I’ve played that has lived up to the hype surrounding it. I felt like I had to tip my hat, because it is perfect in every appreciable way.

Even though HL2 is a decade old, I only recently got around to playing it thanks to a Steam sale. Absolutely fantastic. I love everything about this game. Still looks gorgeous, not at all dated like the first Half Life game. Voice acting is spot-on. Mechanics are good. Nice selection of weapons without having TOO many. Gravity gun is a blast. Music is used very well: long stretches of silence with appropriately creepy or intense electronic tunes depending on what’s happening.

What pushes this over the top for me, though, is the story. It was barely there in Half Life 1. You still have no idea what’s happening in HL2 but you discover bits & pieces as you play. At one of the resistance HQs, for example, there is a bulletin board full of newspaper clippings about the alien invasion which took place while Gordon was…elsewhere. It’s a nice payoff which helps everything else happening in the game make sense. Aside from that, you may only hear certain plot points once or twice from NPC banter. Even if the banter doesn’t contain any story information, though, it’s all scripted well and fun to listen to.

HL2 also appeals to gamers who only play shooters for the pew pew and don’t care about story. The maps may be linear (which I don’t mind in a shooter) but you have a lot of freedom and fun ways to go about solving them. There is also a nice mix of gameplay elements which keep things fresh, from turret defense moments (literally) to vehicle driving. You’re not always marching through hallways so it’s very difficult to get bored.

The only complaint I have is that there’s no Half Life 3! Of course, I’d rather have an excellent series which rarely releases games than a series that releases a title every year and beats everything we liked about it into the ground until we can’t stand it any longer (*cough*Assassin’s Creed*ahem*). Half Life 2 is one of those amazing gems that is still as good today as it was on the day it was released. Definitely a game which everyone who considers themselves a gamer should play.

Good dialogue was few and far between, with most of the speech just being ""look its Gordon Freeman!"" or ""are you Gordon Freeman?!"".... its disappointing to say the least. I'm not counting the graphics because my pc isn't great and the game probably looks amazing on ultra settings but I wouldn't know.

Secondly, the story isn't at all innovative or different, I couldn't care for the characters or the world. I wasn't interested enough to who, what, where, why, when or how for any of the story's components - it's nothing new.

However much anyone says about the gravity gun, to me it will always be a glorified hand - it picks things up and throws them. Apart form that the combat is just like a typical fps although they did a good job with the weapons.

hl2 is a brilliant masterpiece, or to be precisely: the engine is the best since...well hl1 i guess.
the new, sharp looking graphics and awesome, never seen before physics, were state of the art back then and have brought us many, MANY great looking games.

apart from this half life 2 is a dumbed down ripoff of the first game, the story is poor/hollywoodstyle with little surprises.
even worse: the intend of the devs to make it EPISODE 1(to sell more eps after the first) is a good indicator for how they write storys...they didnt!
as an fps it was slower, the enemies where not as ""smart"" and, apart from the hand-holding(the robot/girl), the unlimited grav gun really messed it up for me(get a chunk of trash/barrel/whatever and shoot at enemy-->instakill), leaving you with enough ammo at any given time.

i wont even start about steam.

try black mesa, the hl1 mod for hl2 engine and see for yourself.

BUT if you are not such an old ***** as myself, and dont know about the glorious times of fps games,
when enemys tried to actually kill you, instead of running for cover, it sure looks like a well made game.

i think it doesnt deserve 9,2 user and 96 meta score, and thats just my personal op.

25,Half-Life 2,mortabunt,"Oct 4, 2013","Half-Life 2... Often proclaimed one of the best, if not one of the greatest first person shooters, if not video games of all time. Released in 2004 to great fame and accolades, I was but then an 11 year old devotee of Sonic, Metroid, Zelda, and Star Wars. I hardly knew or cared. But as I grew older, and the internet became more prominent in my life, I began to hear of this wonderful thing called Half-Life 2, starring this great hero, a nuclear physicist named Gordon Freeman, who battled against the evil Combine to save humanity from its position under the jackboots of a tyrannical alien regime. When I discovered TvTropes, I got exposed to many more references to this game. I was told of the epic journey of the great hero fighting all alone against the future straight out of Nineteen Eighty-Four. I read that I was supposed to be a critical piece whose actions and choices would decide the fates of billions. I read about leading the citizens in rebellion against their alien oppressors in a climatic battle in City Seventeen. I heard about the awesome Gravity Gun. I read about the fearsome striders. I read about turning the antlions on the invaders. I read about the horror of Ravenholm. I heard about great and memorable characters, an engaging story, and so many other things which sounded like heralds of greatness.
I first got my hands on a valve game, Left 4 Dead, in '08. And I loved it. I still do, just as I do Left 4 Dead 2. I got The Orange Box in 2010. I got it more or less for Portal. Portal, damn, that game is fantastic. As you would expect, having consecutively played three superb games from Valve, I was very much looking forward to the next game in my sights: Half-Life 2. So I selected it from the main menu of The Orange Box on my Xbox360 and began a new campaign on the medium difficulty setting. I as already an FPS veteran at the time, having played through games like Metroid Prime 1 & 2, Bioshock, Metro 2033, Goldeneye 007, the Halo series, F.E.A.R., Doom, Doom 3, and Quake 4. With everything begun, I was prepared to be blown away. I was eager for the greatest FPS ever made.

It sucks.

I personally rate games mainly on story, gameplay, and characters, with all of these being roughly equivalent. For me to approve of a game, it has to do well enough in these three categories. However, I ultimately pass judgement based on whether or not the game was fun to me. I can forgive quite a lot of if a game is an entertaining experience. Do I think Half-Life 2 is fun? NO! I think it's awful. I had to force myself to finish this game. It failed in story, gameplay, and characters. It wasn't even something that I could enjoy taking the piss out of.
I know, you're probably frothing with rage and confusion over why I think Half-Life 2 is an overrated piece of crap. I've heard the arguments from the fans, but I just don't see it like they do. I respect their opinions, but I disagree. Truth be told, I feel like this game was always very close to being the great experience I was told about. Of course, realistically, nothing could have lived up to the hype. Even though I habitually make a note to deliberately not buy into hype, it was impossible to go in with anything other than great expectations. I could argue that it had to end in disappointment, but I disagree. I've played other great games, like Call of Duty 4, Bioshock, Far Cry 3, Metroid Prime 2, Metro: Last Light, and Portal, and felt that they deserved the praise they got. Perhaps not the extravagant fanboy praise, but plenty of praise and accolades nevertheless. Half-Life 2 got so many elements right and had a lot of good ideas, but the execution was so often feeble. If maybe just only a few elements were different, then perhaps I would be raving about how I love this game. And I think that, had I played it when it first came out, or at least within two years of its release rather than six, then I could very well have been much more favorably impressed. I could I personally actually quite like Half-Life 2: Episode 1, which was a much tighter game with a much more interesting and dynamic plotline where the player character actually seems to accomplish things.
The story is irritatingly impenetrable while being of only vague concern, and yet still managing to hang constantly over the player while constantly keeping them in the dark.
The gameplay is the worst part, given how it fails to make combat fun in a first person shooter while bloating the game to excessive length with vehicles and puzzles.
The characters are mostly forgettable with a few good exceptions. Gordon Freeman is the worst possible kind of protagonist for this game. Alex Vance should have been it.
The game is not fun except in small doses and in certain parts. Your experience may vary. I would recommend watching a walkthrough or LP rather than spend money on it. Collapse",1,10,52

27,Half-Life 2,ShawnD,"Dec 29, 2014","I'm giving this game a low rating because it does most of the things I hate:
-Unskippable cut scenes.
-Acting like I care about any of these dumb characters.
-Half the game is driving. Rage pulled the same stunt in 2011 and that too was a disaster. All it does is make the game painfully slow.
-Does this game even have a plot? It was so boring that I didn't care to find out. A good game tells you very little so you're left wanting to know what the story is. HL2 does the exact opposite. Unskippable cut scene after unskippable cut scene. Instead of googling to find what the story is, I'm googling to see if there is some console command to skip the stupid cut scenes. I can't believe someone at Valve actually thought it was a good idea to force players to watch the same crap every time they play the game. Start a new game - hey I wonder if that face hugger is going to screw up the teleportation this time. I'll need to watch the 5 minute cut scene to find out!
-It seems like large segments of the game are unfinished. Half of the game is driving or walking, but there's nothing going on. There's nothing to shoot and there's nothing shooting at me. Why was this left in the game? It's like they forgot to add monsters and nobody in beta testing noticed how boring those sections of the game are.
-Physics are completely broken. You can run 100mph in reverse just by running backward and jumping. At least bunny hopping from quake took some practice.
-The guns seem a lot crappier than they were in HL1. The amount of ammo one can hold has also been greatly reduced.
-HL1 was awesome because it was straight forward. It told a story without telling you anything. An experiment goes wrong, monsters appear, military try to cover the whole thing up, etc. HL2 is about.... what exactly? it's about running through water canals because a guy in a turtle neck sweater is the leader of some people who wear gas masks. This is Metal Gear Solid level of bad story telling. Snake, you have nanobots inside you because blah blah clones Big Boss blah blah The Combine blah blah turtle neck sweaters.

You can't truly grasp how boring this game is until you watch someone do a speed run of it. Then watch someone do a speed run of Quake. Which one looks more like a game and which looks more like a tech demo? Collapse",3,8,43
28,Half-Life 2,Alpacalypse,"Mar 22, 2015","This game has aged horribly. The story is rather decent, but the gameplay is just pathetic. Shoot your peashooter weaponry at guards and zombies, and then use your gravity gun to pick up a saw and throw it at people.
You will then take the saw with you on your entire game and use it exclusively.

Sure, you can argue that a game that has a good story is all that matters. But, a sandwich with the world's best bread (the story) is still a horrible sandwich is the meat is made out of a dead dog's **** (the gameplay)

As it stands, Half Life 2 is a prime example that gamers will reach to the bottom of their fanboy purses to make anything Valve makes overrated.

This game would be better fitted as a book, to be honest. It tells a great story, but the gameplay is just so agonizing that I couldn't get past 40 minutes. If you want a good first person shooter, go play Far Cry or Call of Juarez: Gunslinger.

35,Half-Life 2,Conner428,"Nov 10, 2013","Here's the problem with giving an overrated game a bad score: people will ignore what it says and just say that that person is wrong. First of all, I am not hating this game just to hate (hell, at least I gave it a 3). Second, I am taking all the hype for this game out of the equation. Graphics: I honestly felt like I got a beta version of the game when I started it and saw the very basic (borderline texture starter kit) and dry textures. The guns didn't look too bad but everything else looked like it hadn't even started rendering (yes I played the game on Ultra settings). Concept: put a gun in front of the screen, give an invisible entity a name, and have people tell it to do stuff only to always be interrupted mid sentence by enemies and never find out what they were going to say. Valve tried to give Freeman no personality or dialog so that the player could relate with him but the outcome was the exact opposite. It felt like just controlling a floating gun with zero personality. Story: The biggest confusion for me was how much people praised this game's story line. You literally start the game with many questions from the last game and are only given more questions. The G-Man spouts off nonsense and makes it seem like it's important and you wake up in god knows where in the future (no clue as to how many years because the game never specifies). No one is shocked in the least to see you after so many years looking the exact same you did when they last saw you and they ask you to go from point A to point B for no good reason. That last sentence is literally the entire story. One full game and two 3 hour episodes with absolutely no story progression except for the end of episode 2, and even that isn't that great because you had no emotion ties to the character who dies. People will constantly defend this and say ""Valve will eventually explain the story. Just give them time"". Why? Why judge a games story based on what your assumptions are? That's not innovative, that's sloppy writing. AI: I never even knew this was something that was seen as something great about this game until after I beat it........ so I have no idea why it's praised. Enemies act like enemies (in annoyingly low numbers and way too weak (even on hard)). Alyx is uncomfortable with how she acts with a guy who is probably twice her age and is actually quite annoying pointing out everything that happens in front of you. Replay Value: None. The game is linear with nothing on the side to keep it entertaining. Physics Engine: similar to the AI, I didn't even know this was something that was looked at as innovative. A physics engine should not determine a games worth especially when it's only used to have you ""solve"" kindergarten puzzles or to encourage you to use a weapon (Gravity Gun) that was boring and useless right after its tutorial. Conclusion: this entire game felt like a students project for an indie game. No story, no atmosphere, bad dialog, slow paced, confusing for the sake of being confusing, and has a complete lack of feeling like any work was done with it. This game was very underground when it came out (mostly because pc gaming wasn't as big in 2004) and so most of its original praise is from the, for the lack of a better word, hipsters that played this game. In essence, this game is a hipster game. It's a hipster game because it's full of things that normally wouldn't be seen as good but it's praised for those things so people jump on the bandwagon (similar with Stanley Parable). This actually only a small fraction of what I can say about this game but I am not about to write three reviews for one game. Collapse",3,3,26

The whole game all you do is try to rescue one person or meet up with another person, in very cramped environments. That might've been forgivable if this game was fun or challenging, but the fact of the matter is it isn't. Also, the ending is AWFUL. Could it have been worse? What really happened? it felt like they didn't know how to end it so the developers just took a dump and modeled it after that. Half-life is supposed to be about story and this game had very little. If you want to play a good FPS play Far-Cry (for those of you recommending Doom 3 instead of this pile, I'll have you know that Doom 3 was trash too). Far-Cry had great action, audio, gameplay, and a decent story (not great by any means, but definitely better than this connect the dots junk).

37,Half-Life 2,AnonymousMC,"Jul 16, 2006","This is a good game dont get me wrong. But what kills this game for me, and makes me want to throw it out the window is, in a word: Steam. Steam kills this game and any other game that uses it. In my opinion Steam is the worst thing to hapen to gaming since E.T. for the atari. Im a Marine who is on deployment right now. I dont make alot of money so it was a choice between picking up F.E.A.R. or Halflife 2. I had played HL 1 and loved it, and only a demo of F.E.A.R. I chose HL 2 and have had a game that i could not play for 4 months because i dont have access to internet on a navy ship. What Valve didnt realize, or just didnt give a .... about what that not everyone has internet. Yes 'most' gammers do, but not 'all'. Also 'most' gamers that i have talked too or seen on forums are angry or scared about what this means for the future of computer gaming. If someone dosnt have internet access he cant play games on his computer? That right there is reason enough for this game to get a 0. Its not like it helps fight piracy, in my eyes it makes it worse. There are cracks for this game everywhere, it took less time to find a crack then to register the game with Steam. Someone like me who has no problem paying for a game and registering it Is forced to go get a crack because he cant get his laptop to an internet source for the hours it takes to do the initial update, but its easy to take a flash drive and get a 30 second download of the crack. Valve has alienated so many gamers with Steam, and agin in my opinion has given pirates a major victory, by forcing someone who would normaly never download a crack to get one just to play the game he bought. Basicly, I will never buy another Valve game after this. They have lost me as a customer and i will recomend to all my friends who come to me for game advise to stay away from this company and any games they make. I shoulda got F.E.A.R. Collapse",0,1,9

The basic game mechanics are so outdated and unimmersive it's difficult to take it seriously. Small things like meleeing enemies with the crowbar and mounting turrets as well as primitive controls and movement make it seem really amateur for the standards of today. The one thing that makes this game stand out is the level design. The levels aren't only long and adventurous but they manage to cram in so much variety with so few tools and gimmicks. The use of the physics engine as well as the famous gravity gun is particularly commendable. However, the shooting has no weighty feel to it, and weapons don't have any recoil. Enemies take damage with no seeming impact until they die. The characters are almost non-existent because the game's lack of cutscenes prevents any real development in the story. At every point when you play Half-Life 2, you feel like you're using compiled C code rather than playing a video game. It just feels like software that's made for a specific purpose.

Implemented as a tool in the war on piracy and as a means of efficient game distribution and praised by such magazines as PC Gamer, Steam is in reality a bloated, poorly conceived and overly intrusive internet portal whose required installation is used for updating and registering games. If you don't have a broadband connection you can literally spend 4 to 6 hours waiting for this ridiculous process to conclude. Even with broadband the hit or miss nature of the overly complex and unreliable installation procedure may require repeated downloading of large files and that can be particularly painful for those of us with limited bandwith usage restrictions.

I'm not talking about long load times, stuttering, bugs, etc. Most of those have been updated out of existence by now and were probably due to my comp being strictly middle of the road anyway. No, I'm talking about this sequels storyline being almost completely disjointed from the original, and the way the game keeps rubbing the physics engine in your face (BTW Max Payne 2 had Havok Physics as well and IMO utilized it better.) First off, I'm a huge fan of HL1 and kept looking for some explanation of what happened to Xen, these Combine guys raise a whole new slew of questions and leave the old ones completly unanswered. We aren't even given much of a hint as to how all the supporting cast of HL1 made it to City 17 from Black Mesa. When I first played, it made my head spin. It's like they took the characters from the 1st and dropped them into a completely different storyline. And yes, the 1st time they gave me a physics based puzzle I thought ""wow, cool!"" when every other puzzle turned out to be a variation on this theme, I started to get a little peeved. That said, the story is still enjoyable, the graphics very impressive, the combats fun, and for those of you worried about the A.I. it does get better when you turn up the difficulty. Still a little annoying that they don't start off on the level of the marines from HL1 though.

The ONLY good thing valve ever did was make left 4 dead 1 & 2, every other game they made sucked major balls, ecept portal which is average at most).

79,Half-Life 2,Z.Zaminiski,"Dec 6, 2004","To all you rate HL2 higher than 5 you are not doing HL2/valve or fellow gamers any favours. do NOT encourage valve to create another slightly-above average game. if you like to compare with doom3, then HL2 rates perhaps 7. i dunno who the raters are and they dont know me. however, my FPS-credentials started with the original wolfenstein 3D, so i've seen/played almost all the 'worthwhile' FPS until HL2. for all the new innovations (physics, facial mimic) valve fails to make the most of it. with physics we have little and easy puzzles that involves weight and counter weight - in kinder-garden are we? for human-face mimicry, minimal use in-game and lots for ""story-line cut-scene"". meaning it does little for gameplay. immersion you say? well, was the FinalFantasyMovie conviced anyone it was real? it was not mean to be right? but just what computer technology is capable of. we are not suppose to fall-in-luv with high-polygon-count characters are we? HL was alot better in terms of innovations, puzzles, challenges. one weapon missing from HL2 arsenal is the strategic trip-laser-mine. why is it left out in HL2? HL2 puzzles are contrived. contrived to demonstrate the physics abilities of the game engine. ramps for the airboat? who place them there? surely not the combine who must be stationed there to stop rebels? antlion sand-traps? oh my, are we having fun 'walking' about with metal doors? yawn. then there's the countless crates freeman must destroy! oh the humanity! and what is inside these big boxes but one single clip or couple of litty bitty things. who left these around? the rebels? why didn't the combine who 'own' the place clear it up? a few nice touches were when rebels throws freeman stuff/supplies! the countless explosive-barrels! how conveniently place near combine troopers for freeman to pick off. the countless barrels! are the level-designer somewhat confused? while the levels do not seemed like levels because the environment/architecture is convincingly real the gameplay suggest an arcade shooter. there are places were if freeman do not rush the 'nest' of combine they don't stop pouring out. scripts and why they are bad. that said it all actually. more scripts=more movie like but this is a game...remember? the things that happened by scripts/triggers MUST seem incidental or a direct cause of player's actions. the player in real-time causes stuff to happen, thus the joys of interacting with the game-world. like closing a door would stop a dumb flesh-zombie from entering. if the game-world pretends to be the real-world then everything should be happening simultaneously at will. the arrival of an interactive-agent, you, would immediately begin to cause effects on the environment and NPCs but thru AI not scripts. bad scripts example: it is somewhat odd dog knew to open a gap BEFORE freeman knew he had no where else to go? or if you reload a segment over and over the scripts played like a broken record? this indicate poor AI to AI interactions and AI to player interactions. Scripts are cheap and their novelty wears thin fast. scripts are much too linear, just like HL2 game/level design. exploration and wondering around is discouraged. there are a few 'secret' places to find for rewards but freeman was just being strung along. HL2 didn't try to be rainbow6. the squad you ""command"" are just as dumb. they mill about blocking your way or utter polite 'sorrys' and try to get out of your way. they cannot obey a simple (of two) command to stay out of trouble. while they seem to admire freeman they just never listen to him for long. there are so many thing poorly done with HL2 that it felt rush. very abrupt ending. instead of a scientist caught in something way, way over his head which he must overcome in HL, freeman becomes little more than a puppet-on-a-string. the mysterious G-Man acts mysterious, like a angel or devil nearby but not involved other than to have this condensening tone of speech. one just expected much more from valve but it does not materialize. the only thing that did was the G-man, at the end to stop the show... HL2 is merely counting on existing HL-fans and not trying to win new ones, not with short gameplay (someone 'compress' gameplay to about 3-4hrs), not with low replayability (if you knew what you knew you would play it over and over again because each time it is a little different or just as fun), not with weak (copied and mixed up from originals like 1984, aliens, resident evil/zombie flicks/starship-troopers/matrix) story line, not with steam. much like when valve came out of HL little known newcomer Far Cry does a good job (it is also linear but you can take your own sweat-time) surpassing kings of the hill - the Doom and HL series... ok for all high-raters, play it again sam? then rate it again.

94,Half-Life 2,SheepDip,"Oct 27, 2006","An average shooter at best. Nice graphics, good texture work and good use of physics...at the start. I'm not sure what everyone loves so much about HL2, and I am left angry and frustrated by the fact it repeatedly gets good scores. The game itself is intensely linear, the playtime is about average for a fps these days, which in my opinion is too short, especially if you're going for the ""holding your hand"" gameplay, as valve have done. At the start of the game there are some physics puzzles, but they seem to drop the idea after about an hours play. The enemy AI is practically non-existant, that includes the NPC's who ""help"" you later on. Nothing like any of the video's valve released of combat in late 2003. The weapons in the game also frustrated me. They do little or no damage to the enemies, and any powerful, or accurate weapon is restricted by the fact you can only hold 12 rounds for each (crossbow, magnum). The grenades in the game have a little red light on, and click very loudly making it painfully obvious when one is near you. I do wonder how the combine managed to take over earth using such poor weaponry. Most of the weapons left me with the feeling the player is to always be drawn into always having to engage the enemies at close range. Probably because if you encountered them at range, they'd just run at you and you'd kill them easily. There's a part later on in the game where you have to go down an alley towards a road at the end of the street, naturally there's a sniper watching the street. But, if you thought ""Ah, its ok, I'll get out my trusty scoped crossbow and take him down"" you would be suprised to find the ONLY way you can defeat this enemy is by manouvering your way up the street, and throwing a grenade into of the window. Again, an example of the ""holding your hand"" gameplay, and dictating the style of combat. The story too is non-existant, valve decided to go for the overly vague mysterious story, probably because they couldn't be bothered to think of one. My main beef with the game however, is how completely different it is, from what it was supposed to be. A 20 minute video was released at the end of 2003, showing all aspects of the source engine, and gameplay in HL2. Enemy AI ducked to cover, found alternative routes, and did not just run at the player and fire their guns. Friendly AI used cover, moved up and outflanked the enemy. And the area known as Ravenholm was filled with traps and combine, not zombies (something which I believe was introduced into the game just to offer ""a scary bit"") The whole presentation gave the impression HL2 was going to be something special. Intelligent, variable gameplay. There's nothing new about HL2, it's not realism, and it's not intelligent, in fact to an experience fps player, it's an insult. The source engine is good (even if the game has far too frequent, and too lengthy save & load times), and has enormous potential.

We waited for HOW long for this game, and this is what they come up with? Technically, it's got good graphics and a physics engine and all that stuff. Like any id game. If you're going to blast id games for being shallow, then HL2 should get blasted as well. The single player is nothing more than a tech demo. Wow, Steam is great. Now get back to work on actual games. The game is overly scripted, with little to no creativity allowed in how you decide to play the game. Games like Far Cry at least partially allowed you to explore other ways of getting your mission accomplished. The feel of the game is simply hollow. You have an environment that you can interact with, but most of the time, do nothing with except solve a few rather simpleminded puzzles. Even with the AI companions it feels lifeless. It's really like playing an unfinished alpha of a game. Games like Max Payne feel much more lifelike with a storyline (yes, storyline) woven in with the gameplay. With HL2, you're not really building up any decent plot, not meeting new characters (with any sort of frequency that break what seem to be incredibly long dry spells of unimaginative gameplay), or even building up your suit or weapons. You feel like you are, quite literally, just shuffling yourself from Point A to Point B for most of the game. There are other games that deserve a 97. Half-Life 2 isn't one of them. Not even close.

I was told to get F.E.A.R. and the Half-Life series. F.E.A.R. was an awesome recommendation, bar none. Unfortunately, I feel naive upon spending $60 for the Holiday Half-Life pack. I tried about 15mins. of the original Half-Life and couldn't stomach the graphics. Anyways, I tried Half-Life 2 and I thought the game was getting hung up during loading from escaping the civil police building. I had to do two reboots. I thought if I would re-download the game, maybe some corrupt files would be repaired or what not. Now, I haven't tried it again as of yet. The point of my low rating is this STEAM thing. Firstly, when I pay hard earned money... I do not want to install some 'third party' unknown program onto my computer(-5). Secondly, when I purchase a game... I want all files to be perverbially mine(-2). Thirdly, if I purchase a game... I want the right to have the installation on a separate machine(strickly gaming-no Internet) so I can play regardless of Internet connection or possible connection failure(-2). I am deeply upset about this set-up with STEAM, I had no idea prior and I don't like this what-so-ever(-1). I guess I'm one of many that reviewed the game upset by the STEAM installation. I thought it over and came to the conclusion that it's my right as STEAM is part of the package that I never wanted. As with many game makers, Valve could have joined with GameSpy for online extras. Not all gamers are onliners. Many of us are satisfied and prefer single player games vs dealing with petty drama and idiots over the Internet. All in all, I will not purchase any game that is inbedded with STEAM. STEAM ruined my gaming experience with Half-Life, hence the poor rating. Nice work, Valve... but, the buck stops here.

First of all everyone is pissing out things like ""wow the ai are so intelligent and realistic, and wow there is so much interactions with levels."" Bullshit, even on hard I had to laugh at the pathetic ai as they stumbled around like retards. They don't try to flank you, they don't try to circle you they just stand there shooting at you with the occasional strafe, and you can take your time killing them as their aim is terrible. As for your team mates, the most pathetic bunch I've ever seen. They do a good job at blocking you, always annoying you with stupid dialogue and always dieing as they are retarded. As for interaction with levels, I think anyone who says anything about it needs some toilet paper to wipe away the shit they are dribbling. You can pick up a box with a gravity gun, uh... so? If you want examples of interactivity with levels try stalker or maybe even crysis. As for level design, it's always the same, complete some stupid puzzle a newly born infant could solve, kill about 6000000 stalkers and shoot at some retarded ai and go through some stupid scenery and lame secrets. As for your weapon choices, the most generic array of weapony i've ever seen, I was bored to tears having to use boring guns with lame animations. As for dying, it's practically impossible to die as every metre there is a health pack or a health thingy on the wall. Another thing on level design it's just cliche move into this area kill everything there whilst using your crate of unlimited ammo and to many health packs then move on to the next area and do the exact same thing, get any more lamer or boring?? This game is overall an over-rated game that is just using all the credit from half-life 1 to make it seem like a good game. Use your damned head man, it's just another cliche to sit and rot on the benches or to be bought by stupid and gullible people who happily ride hype train to idiot vile.

The differences and lack of continuation easily outnumber the similarities. First, there was the unexpected motion sickness. I was surprised to discover, upon Google searching, that many others also were put through the same discomforting extreme nausea. In short, the game is repetitive, surprisingly linear, lacking severely in storyline, and not much really happens. You just go from point to point, without not very much explanation. I should also mention that you should expect to spend between two and three hours driving around in vehicles; which I did not appreciate in any way. I like the Combine soldiers; they are cool, but besides them, there truly aren't many interesting enemies or a good variety of them. Another letdown is that you cannot inflict damage to friendly NPCs like in the original Half-Life. This really bothered me. Also, why are Vortigaunts suddenly my friends, without any explanation whatsoever? Squad members are close to useless and have no real point in being there except for acting as decoy and getting in the way of your path. Valve decided it was a good idea to include incredibly annoying and cheap techno music at times, which disrupts the dark mood and atmosphere. There are too many situations where you are forced to shoot at the same, ever repeating, large, uninteresting targets with an RPG. The boss fights (if you can even call them that) are not creative at all. They are uneventful, uninteresting, and anti-climatic. Overall, Half-Life 2 lacks a story, depth, and creativity. It took me about 21 hours to complete. Collapse",7,0,3
78,Half-Life 2,Illuminous,"Aug 29, 2011","This review contains spoilers. I can still remember playing through the first Half-Life game and it's expanionpacks, so I bought this game without reading any reviews or such. It started good but to me it seemed that they took away the dark and gritty parts from the first game and replaced it with a much brigther version. Some of the Aliens will now actually help you and humans make up for the biggest part of enemies you'll encounter throughout the game. The graphics were good and the physics aswell, but it still didn't manage to replace the feeling one got when you played through the first one of the series. There is a story but it's weak and not very special, I actually had to play through it twice to even see that there was one. But what's also so great with Half-Life 2 is the modability and I've played the mods more than I've played the actual game itself. Collapse",8,0,2

The animated scenes that play the role of the ""cut scene"" are not true cut scenes as you stay 100% involved and able to act as the NPCs talk to you and the story plays out.

88,Half-Life 2,jesterx7769,"Jul 10, 2013","I just beat it for the first time so here is an unbiased non nostalgia review.

Overall for the time when it came out the game is outstanding. You can see that it inspired many aspects in other games and is worth playing. However taken with a grain of salt the game (like most popular historical games) is over hyped due to the mystery of half life 3 and the nostalgia it brings to many.

Gameplay: The game does a great job of incorporating puzzles without it being too obvious forcing you to think and use your mind without hand holding. The shooting is good but I admit having only a crossbow with a zoom is a bit annoying, I get that modern games make it too easy with every gun having a scope but none is a downer. Some of the difficulty also just becomes annoying at times instead of challenging, I found part of this mainly to do w/the graphics/lighting making it hard to see what you need to do.

Graphics: Stand the test of time and makes you think less of modern games that they have not improved more.

Story: This was my biggest complaint. I understand there is half life 1 and the half life 2 episodes but standing alone the story is not good. It is not clearly explained when only a little summary here and there would make it better. You do not really have a purpose in the game as you are just directed from point A to point B helping a resistance (but not with any goal or objective). You should not have to read wikis and time lines and history of things to understand the story of a game.

Gameplay: 4/5
Graphics: 5/5

89,Half-Life 2,Nostalgia,"Mar 27, 2013","Half-Life 2 is now freaking 9 years old, but still remains a hell of a classic. Back in the day it was released it featured revolutionary graphics, and even now they can keep up with most of the games.

But Half-Life series never was about the graphics. It was about new techniques, and new stories. new experiences. And Half-Life 2 truly took everything from it's predecessor and upgraded it in every way. Smooth and natural storytelling combined with an awesome FPS mechanics and the famous gravity gun give you almost the best experience a shooter can provide. And nowadays it's cheap as chips, so you can just but it and won't be disappointed for sure.

I'm giving Half-Life 2 9 out of 10. Why not 10? Unfortunately 2 days ago BioShock Infinite came out, and nothing can keep up with it. I seriously doubt it I will ever give 10/10 to any game out there after playing Infinite. Sorry fellas. Collapse",9,0,1

Yes, this is a good FPS, it will entertain you.

You will like the world where you evoluate and the alliens jumps and attack you with suprise, I was scary.
And for a lot of hours, you will like that, but take episode 1 and 2, because the end of the game isn't the ""real"" end.

I like this but, I'm amaze of the Half life 2's reward. All gamers say ""Best game of the decade"" and ultra-fanboys say ""Best game ever of all times for the centuries to the centuries"".
I love half life 2 but I didn't see something of marking.

Maybe it's me and my tastes of sh**
Maybe the game undergo the old age, the evolution of FPS, and that's not ""actual""
Maybe the game was overestimates since its sold.
Maybe the game is always overestimates.
I don't know.

For conclusion. Yes, you will enjoy for 15h hours the pleasure to control ""the Freman"" and kill ennemies, with difficulties for many times (congratulations to striders).

And maybe you will join the anothers gamers for say ""This is the most experience gaming of the world"".

Or you should can say ""What the hell No multi No openworlds A lot of sh**""

Pro´s:
Gun play: (To achieve guns u have to get to some progress points in-game.
Every new weapon is it totally worth it to play. The only bad thing here is that u have the full weapon set in the middle of the game.) The Gun play of the weapons is amazing. Never got such a good feeling with this.
Story: The Story is ok. Nothing special.
Levels: Well designed Level maps. I like the change between darker and brighter areas.

Contras:
At some points its going to get frustrating for noobs like me. Especially at the end of the game. (chapter 11 and 12) chapter 1-10 and 13 are well balanced.

I’m unsure if they've ever been updated but for a 2004 game it’s got incredible textures! The most frustrating thing about this game is when Gordon is joined by a group of soldiers and they continually trap you in rooms by clogging a doorway, minor issue but seriously annoying… Spinning more positively, the enemies were great, the majority of the environments were interesting and it was a generally good game.

There are some genuinely fun sections and the overall design of the levels feels fresh, playful, and rarely repetitive Ironically, the main reason for which this game is regarded as one of the best FPS of all time, is precisely because shooting is far from being the only scope of the game. That said, the game suffers from some serious pacing issues, where certain sections are dragged way too long to the point of annoyance. This game could have easily been 30% shorter and that would have made it that much more enjoyable. The visuals are clean and easy on the eyes yet the overall audio-visual experience is quite dull; Half-life 2 is just not a very pretty game, it has never been.

The story was interesting but I never felt invested, Alyx was an interesting character but I wish I saw more of the other characters to make me care about the world around me, the villain was a bore and had a pretty weak motivation and the ending was really anti-climatic (I know I have to play episode 1 and 2).
There are some highlights, the more scripted parts where the characters interact with one another was the most interesting part about the game but I wish I got more of that.

The gameplay was fun but it did have flaws, the level design was smart and well done and weapons like the gravity gun are fun to use...but most of the other weapons are generic and boring making the game sometimes repetitive and the driving sections are atrocious.

I'm really conflicted, the game was really innovative for it's time, it has great voice acting (most of the time), the graphics aren't great now but this game came out in 2004 so it's impressive that they still look pretty good and some weapons are great and fun to use.

18,Half-Life 2,wpatri04,"Mar 13, 2017","I am reviewing this game based on TODAY'S standards, and the date today is March 13, 2017. This is almost thirteen years from its release, and since those reading the reviews on here are likely those seeing if it is worth playing today, I will base it as if it came out today.
Half Life 2 is a game that goes on, and on, and on...and on. It's extremely rare that a game does that while avoiding repetition. One game that comes to mind that did this successfully is Resident Evil 4. I'm afraid to say Half Life 2 is no Resident Evil 4. Half Life 2 struggles to keep itself interesting after the first chapter. The game begins in a train station, in an Orwellian type world with guards, and it is immersive realistic and atmospheric. It was the best start-off to a game I've ever played. But it went downhill fast. The guns are very standard and basic, most are very boring. And there's no variety. All the handguns feel the same, the machine guns are very basic and offer an alternate firing weapon (one a grenade and the other a ricocheting energy orb) and there's one shotgun. The big draw of the game for many was the Gravity Gun, which utilizes a revolutionary (at the time) physics engine. You can gravitate large barrels or pieces of wood or, well anything you can find really, no matter how heavy, and launch at your enemies. You will use it to solve puzzles. I would recommend looking at at YouTube video at this gun in action. But, no matter how cool a gun is, if the gameplay is boring, then everything else gets affected, no matter great or innovative.
Half Life 2 is LONG, and thus variety should have been used to keep things interesting. Well, with little variety used, it isn't interesting. The story isn't interesting. The weapons aren't interesting. The combat is the most repetitive I've ever played, and it seems to never end. There are stages where you will ride a hover boat and a buggy car, but even those dragged on too long. I would have preferred Half Life 2 rely more on puzzles and story than its shooting, but Half Life 2 IS a shooter after all, first and foremost.
The sound design is very precise. Atmospheric music will be cued at really mind-hitting times to really drive the immersion. It was quite well done, but I would have preferred to have had music all the way through out like in 007 Goldeneye. It would have helped the boringness of the game.
All in all, this is an important game. It's a game everyone should play just to experience what was hailed at the time as a technological achievement. This game has and will remain in the video game history books as deeply significant, iconic, and necessary. Just don't expect to have a blast playing it in today's modern game world. While today's gaming isn't better, it does force classic games to show their age, and in this case it was bad. Collapse",6,0,1

Геймплей заебывающий, идешь и идешь идешь и идешь, спасибо хоть то что иногда есть разнообразие в плане всяких ""сложных"" головоломок и покатушек.
Первая часть намного лучше. Теперь речь пойдет о эпизодах. Не знаю почему но эпизоды ощущаются пободрее, скорее всего из-за того что там чуток поменяли движок и она ощущается по другому, графика кстати тоже поменялась. Но там больше разнообразия в плане геймплея. Поэтому эпизоды намного лучше оригинала. Но концовку реально слили, взяли рандомных личинок наспавнили и низахуя убили дедушку, идите нахуй.

26,Half-Life 2,Padre-Sirius,"Apr 10, 2019","Advantages:
1) Pretty nice graphics. Unfortunately, from 2019 it is difficult to evaluate the 2004 schedule, but it seemed decent to me and without soap.
2) Simple control. No need to think for hours on what button to put this or that action.
3) If that the author and managed to convey, so is the atmosphere of the game. The gray world in which pressure is literally felt. Although I personally did not have enough contrast. Any scene where all the protagonist and his friends get together and just chat or something.
4) Good Russian localization. Professional voice without stupid mistakes.
Disadvantages:
1) Unfortunately, I did not play the first Half-Life and therefore I cannot soberly and correctly evaluate the plot of this game. I didn’t play because I didn’t want it, but because of the devilish attitude of Valve to my fan base. Nevertheless, he seemed to me very bland and boring. A bad uncle installs totalitarianism in the city and another good uncle decided to stop him. Straight plot for the new film ""The Expendables.""
2) Characters. They are all very cliché. Faddish professor, brave, fighting girlfriend, cowardly traitor and faithful, but an old ""soldier."" Where is originality, where are great ideas?
3) The physics of shooting seemed to me unconvincing. I understand that the authors wanted to depict the future and the corresponding weapons, but the practice of shooting from the “stick” I went through in Call of Duty.
4) AI, in my opinion, is also a sore subject for this game. They do not try to bypass you, but simply go right through, taking quantity, not quality.
5) The gameplay is monotonous and boring. The authors tried to diversify it with various puzzles, but I think it did not help.
6) For me personally, the variety of weapons seemed very small. I understand that this is not Battlefield, but nevertheless, this is a shooter, whose main goal is shooting. Therefore, I would like the assortment of tools for this purpose to be larger.
7) It is a pity that the game is completely absent variability passing. Perhaps this is a niggle, since the game is quite old, but I would like to be able to go through missions in different ways, and not just running and going through. Collapse",3,0,3

Одна из величайших игр в истории. По счёту вторая игра о Гордоне Фримане.
Как обычно, сюжет в обзоре затрагивать не буду.
Графика
Начнём с движка. Он называется Source. На тот момент игра была самой красивой и оптимизированной благодаря ему. Игра шла даже на е6учих печках.
Но есть один нюанс - игра изначально выходила на дисках 4Гб и поэтому, чтобы вместить игру на него, приходилось сжимать тени. Если приглядеться, то в некоторых местах отчётливо видны лесенки. Несмотря на это, эффекты и тени были очень даже хорошими. А вода в игре до сих пор на мой взгляд самая красивая и реалистичная.
Текстурки тоже πи3датые и не мыльные.
Локации
В Халфе много интересных и разнообразных мест.
Например, заброшенный городок кишащий зомби, шоссе, лаборатории, цитадель.
Физика
Снова-таки затронем Соурс. В него внедрили физический движок Havok(Хэвок). Благодаря нему физичные обьекты реалистично ведут себя, когда на них воздействует игрок или NPC. И Valve это успешно используют, делая физические головоломки и эффектные разрушения.
Оружие
Его здесь много и каждое уникальное.
Один из главных атрибутов второй Халвы это грави-пушка. Благодаря ей можно брать и отталкивать тяжёлые предметы и хэдкрабов.
Жаль, конечно что ощущение от стрельбы из ПП самое хYёв0е. Это просто деревянная палка, испускающая пульки. Хорошо, что с другим оружием все норм.
NPC
Есть как и враги, так и союзники. Врагов конечно больше.
Союзники представляют собой людей, вартигонтов и в какой-то момент и муравьиные львы.
Враги это - синтеты и зеновские твари.
Синтетами называют органические существа, имеющие много модификаций. Комбайны это - люди. Модификаций они имеют мало, у обычного метрокопа их нет, а у элитных комбайнов разные чипы и очки ночного зрения вместо глаз.
Зеновские твари это те самые хедкрабы, зомби и барнаклы. В отличии от первой части, их здесь в разы меньше.
Итог
9/10 за хороший геймплей, графику и физику. Collapse",9,0,1
33,Half-Life 2,Koleck0LP,"Oct 1, 2020","You'll hear everywhere that Half-Life 2 is a must play game, and that's why I bough the HL2, EP1 and EP2 on steam, This game was so hard to finish, I don't mean hard in difficulty but in motivation to play it.
This games get's really boring at times. I don't mean to hate on it but it's not as good as people make it out to be.",7,0,1
34,Half-Life 2,genesisdoes,"Oct 2, 2020","The original Half-Life very well may be my favorite first person shooter of all time. I see it as the turning point between the first person shooters of yesteryear (Doom, Quake etc.) and more story driven first person shooters of today. I've played the original Half Life so much that it honestly surprises me that I never got very far in Half-Life 2. I never even got to Black Mesa East before this playthrough. I'm not exactly sure why, I didn't need any kind of walkthrough beating the game this time around.

Regardless, Half-Life 2 is without a doubt one of the best first person shooters of all time. The bleak and depressing Orwellian world that was designed here was something that I truly had never seen anything like upon my first time picking this game up when I was about 8 or 9 years old. Around that time, I'd call it the ""weird game"" because it truly is weird. It's weird, sad, ugly and bland but this world truly works with the plot around it. You're not supposed to want to be here.

My favorite chapters from HL2 were Nova Prospekt and the final chapter (the GMOD gravity gun rules.) My least favorite chapter was Follow Freeman due to it's length that overstays its welcome and its constant need to hand you NPC followers that don't know the meaning of personal space. Seriously, these guys cannot stay out of your way. You command them to walk away and they just come right back. Truly a chore to experience.

Nevertheless, this game is phenomenal. While the first one is still my favorite, I can probably acknowledge that, from a critical standpoint, this one outshines the original.

I'm currently playing through HL2 Episode 1 and I'm excited to see where this story goes.

I beat this game in December of 2019. Collapse",8,0,1

The only downside is for gamers who don't have internet (which is about 1 out of 1242567 gamers) since you can only run Steam with internet. Some reviews also complain about bugs, and I have encountered absolutely no bugs that were so bad they ruined the experience, and again, my computer is still nothing special. The multilpayer is awesome with HL2: DM and Counter-Strike and the few mods that are out (and the endless list of mods yet to come). The story is actually quite good (if you can figure out the things that were left out) and the ending, although many might disagree, I think is good. Or at least decent. It ended pretty abrubtly which was disapointing but was made up for from a mysterious speech by the G-Man. The ending, for sure, also falls under the catagory of suspenseful.

52,Half-Life 2,BernhardF,"Aug 25, 2009","I thought HL2 was a fantastic game, and that the water was especially impressive, although for some totally inexplicable reason they forgot to add any displacement physics, meaning that stuff put into the water mysteriously contains water even if its solid. I really enjoyed the Nova Prospekt level too. Ravenholm was tolerable, but after a while, the fun of beating headcrabs with a crowbar kinda wears off. Four things missing from this game: 1) Displacement physics in the Source engine 2) A dual-wield weapon/item hold system- anyone else remember the chair-pistol wield from Return to Castle Wolfenstein? I liked that. Also, wielding 2 pistols in Route Kanal would be fun. 3) The sniper rifle. There is actually code for one there somewhere, honest, but its not a usable weapon as there are no models. 4) Flyable vehicles. Okay, so we have a boat level, a car level, a foot level... why not stick a chopper on the roof of that building by the citadel and fly through C17 strafing the striders? Finally, I have had no problems with Steam, in fact, I love it. It makes it so much easier to have a combined game browser (all my non-steam games have shortcuts there), and a chat feature which shows the game you are playing and if it is a multiplayer game, a join the server feature. Finally a reliable game organisation and multiplayer co-ordination system that works. And yes, I've tried most of them. GameSpy is adequate. GameShadow is a waste of space. HyperLobby is tolerable.

Instead of ""OMG THAT WAS AN AWESOME MOMENT!"" it was ""alright- i solved your puzzle using your engine... now what?"" The most fantastic moments I had during this game had nothing to do with the engine. Commanding a group of aliens and attacking a Combine base, throwing a grenade behind a wall and watching bodies go flying just before whipping out my shotgun and blasting my way through a group of enemies.

It does nothing that endings are supposed to do (wrap the story up, answer an unanswered question or two, etc). The gameplay, while fun, is quite linear. If you're looking for something like Fallout (or even the GTA line), you won't find it here. The AI is pretty poor as well. Friendlies will pretty much either follow you, or charge the enemy, which means they are either in your way, or dead. Having worked with the mapping software a bit, I can see the enemy AI is only decent if you have a fairly linear level (you know where the player is coming from), and you take plenty of time to set up ""cover points"" and such. If you don't specify where the NPCs can find cover, they pretty much operate on the same AI level as the friendly NPCs. As for the good parts, there are a good number. As I said, the gameplay, though linear, is very fun. There are a number of weapons that will fit most players' playing styles. The graphics are the peak of current generation games, along with great implementation. The game also works fine on a wide variety of systems. It will run decent on a 5 year old computer, yet can make full use of a new powerhouse computer. As a last note, one of the best parts of the Source (and previously the Half-life) engine is its modability. Through these mods, developers can create a single or multiplayer experience that fixes all the gripes I have about the game, besides the storyline. Overall, I would recommend this game as a ""must-buy"", as what the game doesn't have out of the box, others can do for it. Collapse",9,0,0

I felt that was something all games were missing. Not only do all the characters move with the full range of emotions that almost makes the game like a movie, but you can make your own animations too! And I've seen some that kicked ass, no less. And physics...DON'T GET ME STARTED! Physics not only make all the gunshots and explosions so much cooler to watch, but it actually brings up a whole slew of new ways to attack enemies. An expert may look down at a new player and say ""You just left that splintered piece of wood BEHIND???"" Garry's Mod is a game in itself, with enough extra visuals and creative methods that bring the engine's physics to their full extent and back around again.

The physics are excellent, but, unfortunately, there isn't much the physics are used FOR. And I have heard the complaints about loading times; I have a Dell XPS 400, and the loading times do not interrupt the game badly at all, although slower computers I can understand. The graphics are good, as are the facial expressions. And everyone's problem with a linear game: what's wrong with it? I felt like I was playing in a movie. Also, the fact that one doesn't see oneself in cutscenes is great, because it makes the player seem as he is the character, rather than some random watching entity. True, the Allied AI does indeed suck. You can send your squad elsewhere, whoop-de-do. However, the enemy AI is amazing, on hard mode. There have been several times when I thought I was safe, but not even my trusty crowbar could save me. The enemy AI runs like soldiers, covering eachother while moving and throwing grenades just for the stun effect. Why can't the Allied AI be that great? Actually, there is a good reason. The Allies are just civilians with guns and stuff, they aren't trained soldiers like the Combine. Collapse",8,0,0

I'll also say that I played it on the hardest setting yet there were very few occasions when I had to scavenge for ammo or health, there always seemed to be enough if you were prepared to look for it. Yes the game is linear but its a story and I can't imagine how (or why) you would want to play it with full freedom, it would just take too long. There is one scene where you need to find two batteries in order to open a barricade. As a test I used the gravity gun to eject a battery over the cliff face - I turned around and saw another battery fall out of thin air back to its original spot...so bascially you can't just do anything you want otherwise the game wouldn't progress. Speaking of which, the gravity gun was an ingenious inclusion in the game, it just made yet another FPS a lot more interesting. Moving tables about to shield yourself, or throwing petrol drums at guards was pretty cool in my books. Not as great as the original but it was a solid game with lovely gameplay and worth every cent.

72,Half-Life 2,KDog,"Jan 5, 2005","This game is nothing short of incredible. Graphics and Physics are asounding. In terms of comparing it to Farcry, I'd say they're pretty close. HL does water manipulation far better. The only thing that ticks me off is Steam - the software required to run HL2. That program is a pain in the butt, and not having a high speed connection meant I had to spend four hours downloading Steam updates and Ads before I was allowed to touch the real game. Now, I recognize why it was done, Valve was POed that their code got stolen by hackers in mid production a year and a half ago, and they had to delay for more than a year to rewrite it. But this is taking it a bit too far. I really hope games don't begin to adopt a system of gameplay like Steam, or I won't be buying too many more games in the future. I knew about Steam before I bought it, and the only reason I actually did buy was because it was Half Life 2. Anything else I would have seriously reconsidered.

Health power ups were available at every turn, which eliminated the need for any serious kind of FPS tactics (even on hard)...simply run, gun, and heal yourself. Ammo was extremely plentiful as well. This was a shame since limiting the ammo would have forced players to use the gravity gun more. Instead the grav gun felt more like a gimmic. The vehicles were cool for the most part, however the airship level was too long. It's hard for me to say this but I was actually bored at that point.

The game isn't that much different to Doom 3 gameplay wise. Just has better scripted events, more varied enemies and slightly better AI. Why couldn't Valve spend more of their time developing superior AI? The enemy AI is below average at best, no where near as smart as the AI in Halo 1/2 or Far Cry. The graphics are great, although Doom 3 still looks better. The story needed more work, it's still all too shrouded. WIth games as linear as this the story has to be very strong, and it's just too weak and vague here. Real shame, this could have been outstanding, especially with the engine used.

84,Half-Life 2,BobI.,"Aug 1, 2005","The game is great but it is confusing at times given so little company support. I purchased the game from CompUSA and it came with no manual and a very small player Quick Reference Card. What makes it a great game is the depth of environmental control the player has. You do a lot more than shoot the enemy. You must use your environment to get out of predicaments. Whether it be using gravity and pullies to get a ramp to move into place or operating a crane to move your vehicle, there are a variety of problems that go far beyond the shoot-em up experience. Graphics are excellent and play is not bad even on my mid-level system according to game recommendations. The story line is not always clear or even presented in depth but it is there. Battles get intense and require numerous re-loads that are slow at times. The use of Internet connectivity is not clear or explained so installing this on your computer and then registering leaves one feeling anxious about what goes on in the background both when playing and when not playing.

The gravity gun was a unique weapon and really drew away from mainstream guns put in games today. However, this game also failed in a lot of aspects. While the potential and hype was driven up after years of suspense and waiting, the game just did not deliver. Though it kept my attention long enough to finish the game, I just was not impressed by it. The levels were pretty cool, though the city did get a little old after a while. The haunted city was probably the best atmosphere created in the game. But here's the biggest kicker: The weapons SUCKED. Yes, though the grav gun was unique, I ended up not using it for much of the game, because there aren't always objects to pick up and launch at people. Instead, you are stuck with a bunch of the same boring weapons as the first game - WITHOUT the aliens weapons. The only new gun I can remember besides the grav gun is the other combat rifle that also has a powerful (but generally unused) secondary fire. The random bullet pathing did not make it any better as you often waste a lot of bullets firing any of the smg/rifles from a distance any other than what you'd call short (which is a lot of the game). The boring weapons combined with a so-so story line was not exhilirating in my book.

There is no compass or map, so you can get disoriented, even though the game is very linear. However, the game does tons of stuff right. Great graphics, great sound. Firefights are varied and fun. Environments are highly detailed and the physics bring it to life like no other game can do (possible exceptions being FEAR and Far Cry). Fun vehicles. Solid characters and thought-provoking story.

Rise and shine, Mr Freeman, rise and shine. Ignore anyone who's given this game a yellow score, pour scorn on those who have given it red. This is, quite simply, the best game ever made up to this point. And I'm saying that with 512k of RAM, which makes the key responses occasionally act like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. If you thought the Aliens Vs Predator games were scary...you were right, but ten minutes in Ravenholm and you'll be begging for the chapter to end.

Then eventually i got the internet and the i still couldnt play it because the disc was already registered to another comp. and user >:( in order for me to play it i had to send it away to get checked etc.. and i just really couldn't be bothered.

63,Half-Life 2,AnonymousMC,"Jun 30, 2006","Ok first off, Half-life and Half-life 2 come from two different generations of gaming. Second, this game has awesome weapon effects, graphics, realism, and a way to create a story linking two games together coming from different backgrounds. Third, it has a short storyline only because people don't take time to know the enemy before you kill them. ""They"" are intellegent AI if you let them challenge you, that means you can mess around and not rush through the game waiting for it to throw fun at you and while its better to try and ""make fun"" of it. Fourth, Steam is hard for impatient people who blame it for ruining the game (same as taking the trash out after you pressed pause). Don't blame Steam for something that is supposed to help your game and that only time can solve, come on, you can wait, we all did, jeez I think it annoyed everyone who didn't buy it on Steam. Bugs were there because updates can later to fix them. Hardware problems are the users fault. And five Farcry puts everything in front of you because the user is scripted to do that (if you know what I mean), I know, I have that game, its fun only because I made it fun for me (Logically, something is fun if you allow it to or fun know matter what, then you know its awesome). Last but not least Doom 3 is cool and really fun to kill demons with a simple shotgun, I went through it on veteran and nightmare mode cuz its hilarious how its only a shotgun but get serious guys, you are asking for another game toooo... be like another game. Single them out and listen to yourselves. They both have great ancestors, especially Doom but in the end, they both share a common trait: Evolution and Revolution to a gaming experience that in the end challenged gamers and was fun (if they let it). Last but not least, for the people disapointed with the end of the game, two short things: 1you beat the main bad guy and that should be it, but it ends right there leaving off for another time after anymore Half-life 2 episodes all the way to another generation plus technology advances make it seem not that far off. 2its supposed to end if you gave a sh-- or not if you like it or not. Those of you who like putting down the game for reasons of they try or rip off just should realize the fact that all game companies do that but you aren't looking at the fact that products are made because fans have requested them or just want to show pride and the trademark makes money because money and passion go hand in hand. If what I am ending this is just to logical or too much for an explanation, then realize that some people are just saying stupid complaints and so this is their stupid answer(s) and a put down to them for being idiots and in every way a stupid moron for opening their slow unreasonable unthinking mind that should try to find a school that teaches advanced ways to look at morals and common sense before they embarass themselves on the internet. If you think I am doing that right now you either are one of them or are reading a message for someone else of a really low level of society (mind-wise because they don't know how to use it). In the end I will return to the real reason for this post before I dig to much into a hole that is actually a loop in human nature: point-reason-granted reason-back to first one. I will just say that his game is so awesome and I am glad I got this game which behind its awesome graphics and simple creation that some people don't realize was actually easy to make but the problem was that Valve couold have made a complex game with better whatever or stoop to easy-to-use technology and create an equally awesome game that still would have gotten the rate of 10's and 0's no matter what audience it came too. I am glad to be a Half-life fan and I am glad I spent 3 hours setting it up and go back and play it and test the physics to its limits no matter what cost game crash or pointless venture. This game gets a better rating than Halo (95) to both Half-lifes (96) (except for episode 2 because people saw that it should be that way and plus (a litle offtopic) the fans/fanatics ruined it almost like counter-strike. This game deserves a better audience just like some other games do but who can help something so natural anyway. Collapse",10,0,0

Half Life 2 has some of the most fast paced and intense fighting of any FPS, and I think some (emphasize some) of the NPCs are very intelligent. It also has some vehicle senarios (if not the best in the world) which on the whole offer a welcome, and enjoyable, change of pace. It also has a good amount of fairly trick puzzles, some of which took me quite some time and some of which were very easy. Also I think it has a quality over looked in many FPSs that makes it really stand out, a plot. The plot of Half Life 2 is quite deep complete with betrayal and lots of other fun twists. Also it is undeniably one of the most beautiful games ever; from the skylines to the textures on the walls to the wrinkles in people's faces.

You can actually see emotions on character's faces, you can watch the physics react as it would in real life. The storyline is very well done, and sure it has it's cliche's, but I think sometimes they're necessary. It has funny moments and it's ""But...but..."" moments, and basically all of Ravenholm scared the crap out of me! If you've not seen it yet, you'll understand why ""we don't go to Ravenholm"". HL2 is no longer new, but I think the graphics are aging quite well. It's supposed to look gritty and realistic, so expecting ""bloom"" lighting is a little silly despite it's appearance in almost every game since Guild Wars. Since no game is perfect and there are a couple of things about HL2 that I'd like to see improved (AI has already been mentioned, and I'd like to have seen more choice in the vehicle levels - take the boat and go the fun way or go by an alternate land route, for example) and expanded on, I'm giving HL2 a 9.

How could they improve on this? 2 excellent expansion packs, and many years later, Halflife 2 was their answer - and boy, was it worth waiting for. This time, Valve weren't content with just doing all the things you'd expect from a modern FPS, and doing them well - they reinvented them all. Each level of the game conveys a different style of playing; whether it be solo, pair or team based combat, full out battles or cunning stealth, HalfLife 2 delivers. The biggest shock to the system is how well the physics model works - far from being a gimmick as it could so easily have been, it immerses you completely with the game world, and becomes another tool to use in solving the puzzles and fighting the enemies.

34,Half-Life 2,Anonymous,"Apr 7, 2007",With me believing on rating a game as a game I`d have to say Half Life 2 is brilliant. Of the many comments involving (Half Life 2 is jerky and slow on my pc) the simple answer is : Don`t play it on a rubbish computer then. Half Life 2 is a grerat looki ng game with cracking framerates (on decent computers) and a great storyline. And the A.I. I found that the enemies on my game were constantly hiding for cover and helping each other get to me. The only downer is that the first level just slaps you in a level and leaves you to figure it out. I didn`t find Steam to be a problem as I was up and playing within 25 minuites of getting home and popping the disc in. Seriously folks you can`t say a game is bad because your PC and internet can`t handle it. Nuff Said Collapse,9,0,0

The game play is fun, the choice of weapons is good, and the game time is pretty decent. Most games I can finish in 1 day. This one takes several, even if I spend all day on it. It's still fun to play even after you've completed it several times. Some of the levels, like Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt, brought out the part of the original game that everyone loved the most.

The voice-acting for the characters was top-notch, and they were all beautifully designed. The main difference from Half-Life 1 has got to be the characters. With the new upcoming ""episodes"" you're eager to see the characters develop, to see what happens to them. I'm reading all these comments and ratings left by people that have stormed on here after getting a little frustrated with Steam, have their panties in a bunch, and simply decide to wail on this great game because of it.

And just when I thought I was finally done, had finished it for good, it called me back once again to give it another play. And to my joy, there are now many more mods out than there were last year, and I'm having a ball testing them out. My current favorite is SMOD Tactical: Delta 4. If you're like me and have bashed the shit out of the combine in every way possible, give Tactical a try, it's a definite wake-up call for all gamers. You think Half-Life 2 was hard on Hard? Please, try beating SMOD Tactical: Delta 4 on Easy, you'll be sorely mistaken if you think it'll be a walk in the park. Back to regular ol' HL2, though, I don't think there will ever be a game to best it. I've never played anything better. The graphics are stunning, and it's an absolute joy to play it maxed out. You become immersed in the story, dug into the battles, and enthralled with the characters. The sounds are resounding, I still get chills up and down my spine when I hear the howl of a leaper echo through the level. I dare you, no, I challenge you to find a game that can suck you in as much as this one can. I haven't found one, not even Halo, or Halo 2 can even come close to this.

77,Half-Life 2,AnonymousMC,"Jan 5, 2008","After reading some user comments (usually with a score of 6 and below) I noticed that many people say that this game is highly over-rated...

This forced me to play Half-Life 2 again and I had a hell of a good time. The game play is not much to complain about, although the game is somewhat very linear, but that doesn't count too much. Enemy AI is somewhat iffy but it is at least challenging. Also the friendly AI is somewhat annoying for me (they can get in your way a little bit). The story was interesting in my opinion to keep me attached to my computer to play it.
The graphics for that time were damn good-looking. The sound is impressive (especially in voice acting) and in some occasions it doesn't.

And back on the topic of over-rated games. Over-rated games are those who get advertised to much and in the end they are nothing more than just normal FPS without nothing new to show, much like the Halo series, I suspect that the people that post their low scores can be Halo fanboys or people who think that this game doesn't suit their taste, which makes me to wonder why the hell did they picked it up in the first place. Buying a game without looking it first is a terrible idea...

People are perfectly entitled to their opinions, I respect that, like the former people I mentioned (not fanboys). But the only reason I'm posting this is because people say many times that this game is highly over-rated...

People who are giving this game a low score can be a little annoying (not for me) but be fair, this game is an excellent piece of game design and manufacture.

And no, it is not perfect. No game is. It IS, however, a milestone in the development of the genre whether you like it or not.

You people (or Halo fanboys) don't like the game? Wonderful, good for you. You guys have your reasons, which are, as far as I can tell, that you don't care for the setting and production design. This doesn't make it a bad game, nor over-rated. That simply means you guys don't like it. Collapse",10,0,0

You almost never see the same thing twice, with mind bending puzzles, well placed objects, and times where you only have time to think about escaping. Just when your getting bored of something, it moves right on to another great part. The story is also very well done. Everything about Half-life 2 seems lovingly crafted, and altogether it feels like your in a movie. Its basically a game and a movie all in one. Valve managed to rekindle the orginal half-life while still adding something new. This will remain one of the greatest shooters ever for a long time.

92,Half-Life 2,Jag,"May 2, 2008",Half Life 2 is an FPS that is announced by many magazines as ''Greatest game ever made''. Personally I think that is had well balanced gameplay. You can run and gun but its not recommended. Its always good to take cover but not all the time. I've heard some talk about the A.I being so good but it really didn't seem like anything real special. The combat zones were kind of limited so enemies would come out and shoot and maybe grab some cover in the process. Normally you will kill them before you see them doing something truly eye catching. The A.I isn't bad its just not amazingly impressive. The graphics are great. Reflections on the floor move as you do and texters are high rez. Character modles may not be impressive at first but if you take the time to see the lip synchronization and facial expressions. Characters are great and well developed. One of the icons of Half-Life 2 is the gravity gun. This unique weapon lets you pick up any object man sized and under and fling it at enemies. A but what would this weapon be without wicked good physics? These physics are very good. every thing not bolted down can move with the proper amount of force applied to it. However the only thing bad that came out of these physics is the puzzles you will encounter throughout the game. There are just a little to many. I personally didn't like it because this lead to an annoying lack of combat and the ability to move on. I had no problem solving most of them and it is satisfying when you do but when you look back on it it seems like a waste of time. One every now and then is fine but they went a little overboard here. sometimes you'll end up stopping you vehicle every five minutes because of there. Speaking of the vehicles the sequences were pretty cool apart from what was mentioned in the previous sentence. Even though you will end up having to stop look around and find a path. this can be really annoying after a while especially when you are being chased by a chopper. The story was a bit disappointing at the end and was slow moving through out the game. But now for some good things. The game does a real good job of immersing you. You really feel like you want to help the people and have a pretty good idea of whats going on. The arsenal was a decent size and had some unique stuff in it. overall this game is worth picking up.

81,Half-Life 2,KeshR.,"Jan 21, 2005","I have heard complaints about two aspects in particular. Firslty, steam is a pain. Secondly, the game is too linear. So lets deal with this. On steam, its a pain, and in my opinion, for good reason. Piracy and illegal downloading is rife and while we may secretly indulge in a spot of less than legal activities when it comes to digital copyrights, we have to respect the concerns of the company. Why should they put up with people stealing their game? The system needs to be cleaned up true, but it is necessary. And personally I haven't found steam to be too troublesome. But the biggest potential criticism is the linear gameplay. Now there are two types of FPS out there really. There are those that are simply linear, and there are those that try to provide the player with freedom. Now personally I fidn that freedom of choice in games is an illusion in most cases, unless we are only talking about what type of weapon etc. In most cases your path is already determined, and only the storyline is affected. But if this is a big issue for you then you won't like HL2 And the fact is that you should already know this. The whole point of HL is to provide a movie like experience. There is a trade off between scirpting and freedom of gameplay. To make the whole thing more movie like, scritping is needed, otherwise the environment will become static. This comes at the cost of raw freedom of movement etc. Given that HL2 is full of scripting, the complaint that there isnt any freedom appears to be valid. But is it a problem? When you watch a movie, do you complain that you can't control the main character? This is how you should view HL2 for maximum enjoyment: you have the priviledge of being the main character in an amazing film. This is what HL1 did and unsurprisingly this is what HL2 does. To change it into some sort of free-roaming game would change the essense of the game, and no one would like that. The second argument against non-linear gameplay is that it increases the workload of the developers dramatically, so they have to cut down on the total length of the game. Now in my opinion HL2 is already too short, so anything less than this would reduce my score greatly. As for other smaller criticisms I have heard, most were minor gripe, but one in particular annoyed me. It seems some poeple are disappointed with the character expressions. This is incredibly unfair if you just comapre HL2's characters to what you find in other games, where developers have spent more time getting the exact way that people die right than the way people talk. I have given the game a score of 8, due to the short length, but if by the time you read this there is sufficient mod support, feel free to consider the score a 9 or even a 10, depending on the strength of the mods.

96,Half-Life 2,RichH.,"May 9, 2005","How's this for a noncommital evaluation? I understand the hype and I understand the negative reaction to the hype. No, seriously, I give it a ""10"" because it's the most immersive game I've ever played, and that state is achieved by an incredible attention to detail. It's like you're right there in the scene and I don't know of any other game that can truly make that claim (yes, I know there are some that *say* they can, but IMO they can't). I do have some reservations about the much-praised facial contortions--for the most part these are great, but there're some lapses. Dr. Breen is a good example. His facial expressions/gestures and voice don't quite synch up. Robert Culp's a great choice to voice unctuousness, though--I get such a kick listening to his oily voice on the various broadcasts and then, when I can't take it any more, using the Ggun to rip the console out of the wall and smash it. Apart from that, people have rightly faulted the so-called helpers (including the antlions, post-""Highway 17"") and their annoying habit of getting in your way. People have also complained about the ending. I admit at first I didn't care much for it (""cheesy"" was my initial reaction) but replaying ""Benefactors"" and ""Dark Energy"" together, I find the sinister atmosphere of the Citadel has kind of grown on me. The only thing about that last part I didn't like is having to rely for most of the time only on the Enhanced GravityGun. The fun of HL2 (as in HL1, only not as much) is weapon swapping, discovering to your delight that you forgot, say, that the crossbow could do so much long-range damage or that the best weapon against fast-moving zombies is sometimes the good old crowbar. In the last two levels, it's just blast, suck stuff up, and/or throw it. It gets old, quickly. All around, this game has significantly upped the standards we expect of FPSers and everyone, even those who aren't impressed with the game, should be thankful for that. Collapse",10,0,0

The ragdolls are so much fun, all of the objects follow the laws of physics(meaning no more floating cinder-blocks when they get thrown into the water). The NPCs for the enemies I find are truly amazing. They'll hop over fences, rappel down walls, and even throw stuff at you. Also, the zombies are so sweet. They're all gory and guts and stuff. And also, they'll throw stuff at you. Cons: Horrible teammate AI. Just Horrible. (Except for DOG). If you just simply love the Havok physics and ragdolls, but want to get more freedom just randomly throwing headcrabs against walls, go download Garry's Mod. It's so amazing. Collapse",10,0,0
82,Half-Life 2,AnonymousMC,"Jun 26, 2006","First of all, you're an idiot Klaus F. You're judging the game, not Steam retard. Plus, you haven't even played the game, so why are you judging it already? Steam is hard to use but this game makes up for the long installation times by rewarding you with Counter-Strike: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, Half-Life: Source, AND Half-Life: Deathmatch. I wouldn't necessarily say Steam sucks if you get 4 more freakin' games for buying one awesome FPS.
For all of you that say that the graphics are bad, then what's GOOD? The graphics are incredible in Half-Life 2, with beatiful environments, gorgeous character models, and possibly the best water and glass I've ever seen. This isn't a Pixar movie we're talking about here, it's a video game, where lag, glitches, and bugs are an issue, so graphics aren't going to be photorealistic in a fully interactive world.
The weapons are pretty good as well. The gravity gun is reather creative, and the laser-guided RPG is a great twist on a classic weapon. The signature crowbar is extremely fun to use, and who doesn't want to impale someone on a wall using a crossbow loaded with radioactive bolts. The pheropod could also be the most unique weapon I've ever seen in my entire life. The pulse rifle's secondary fire was also incredibly well done, and the shotgun was incredibly fun to use. The only weapon that didn't work for me was the grenade, since it takes too long to explode and is a different weapon (they should imply the Halo system were you don't have to switch weapons to throw grenades). Overall, the weapons were very creative and fantastic.
The story was a bit broken, but still managed to be suspenseful and immersive. There were shocking, scary (Ravenholm, I'm looking at you), exciting, emotional, and intense parts in the story. It was a mix between a horror game, action, puzzle, adventure, and there was even a little love in there (Gordon and Alyx). It fit almost every category (heck, even DRIVING was in there!) and each aspect was pulled off perfectly.
For those of you that don't think the ending was good, then you don't know what a good ending is. Half-Life 2 - an FPS - won't end with Gordon and Alyx dancing in flowers picking strawberries and singing ""It's A Small World After All."" The game ended suspensefully so that you'd buy Half-Life 3 (or in this case - Episode 1). If there were too many questions unanswered, then maybe the sequel to this game will answer them. Ever think of that?
Overall, Half-Life 2 was an incredible game, and was beautifully presented with lush graphics and gripping gameplay. This is a game that everyone with a PC and a right mind should own and enjoy. Collapse",10,0,0

98,Half-Life 2,AnonymousMC,"Jul 3, 2006","Overall awesome, Steam is what brings the game down though. Sure, it's nice to be able to get all your games in one program, but it's the bugs of Steam and absolutely horrid support for it that make me hate it.
As mentioned there were some issues with the physics engine and such, but ultimately, it's a game. It's meant for entertainment purposes, it will never be as realistic as some people want it to be unless they just go out and kick the chair themselves instead of having a 3d virtual avatar do it for them.
As for the game: I've played it on both an old (6 years now) and new (1 month) old PC. Both worked fine if you know how to tweak your visual settings. My gripe with this: At first Steam started automatically updating everything, which is where the ""gotta have the awesome PC to run it"" thing came in. Too many features being added without consent.

So really, Game = 15, but Steam's updates, support, and bugs bring it down. Collapse",9,0,0
99,Half-Life 2,AnonymousMC,"Jul 30, 2006","Ok I've been reading through some posts and ive come up with my own opinion.

For one ill start with a recomendation. This game is for die-hard fans of the HL series and FPS games, and works best with an NVIDIA graphics card in my experiance and also ppl complaining about how
""STEAM ruined the game it took too long i couldnt update it"" stop your damn whining, I mean i got this when it came out and only until a month ago could i play it and i still rate this a ten, my point here being dont let a gay ass program ruin your fun. And for those who say it gets boring try playing in sparring. And also for the marine complaining about your internet issues, its called OFFLINE MODE use it retard it got updated.
Now on to the ending complaints. You see they ended the game like that so that they could have an open horison on sequel pick ups, and the episode formate is to keep players from waiting another ten years for HL3 to come out. I for one acually love the way the game is set up.

Ok and now to you story line nerds. This game did have a story line for those who payed attention, and it all pointed to the final solution of having Gordon Freeman lead a revolt against the combine of city 17. And in my opinion "" tedious. boring"" isnt a f***ing post thats an unintelligent lazy kid putting up an excuse to be different.

Finally i would like to mention that people dont all put a ten to be with the in crowd as Hideto M put in his post, I call bullshit on his post with the "" It's human nature to simply mindlessly follow the crowd"" staement. Just beacause you dont agree with the rest of us who have taste doesnt mean you can call it human nature. Its social nature to want to fit in with a large crowd, and guess what. This is just a large FACELESS groupe of gamers we dont know each other and we dont need to worry about any reprocusions of our posting cuz there are none.

well that was my post and i hope you ppl can now see some reason to their problems. If there are any problems i can be found in mostly any G-mod servers under the screen-name ""ShadowMarshal9525"" so you can take it up with me as a gamer instead of a poster. Collapse",10,0,0

44,Half-Life 2,Mr.F.,"Nov 24, 2007","Well, first let me dispell all of the zeroes below. Number one, this is most certainly not a Quake engine modification. Even if it were, the Quake engine is a very powerful one (see games like Nexuiz). Number two, the AI is rather low scale, but nothing like the crappy AI seen in Doom or Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. The storyline is linear, yeah, but so are Portal's (clearly so), Halo's and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic's plotlines. And they are still amazing games. The Source engine is probablyone of the most complex physics engines I've ever seen. Sim S.'s turn: Mabye gat a new computer, because Half-Life 2 loaded in under a minute on mine. I have an nVidia GeForce 7300 GT that runs C-S:S, Portal and HL2 with no problem. And if you are going to use a computer for gaming, at least make sure it fits the requirements. Christopher S.: Steam is one of the greatest gaming platforms I ever saw (Microsoft's Games for Windows -- LIVE is an utter piece of crap) and since I really don't have the space for CD's, it's convenient that I can just download my games after my annual system reformat.Trust me, playing the game at minimum graphics settings is not fun. If you have a load time of upwards of 2 minutes it's time to get a new computer, or at least upgrade your old, crappy Windows 2000 and/or Windows ME boxes with 128 megs of RAM and a *gasp* Pentuim III. GNU Gamer: get WINE, Cedega or VMware Fusion. Steam is Windows-only. Windows is, so far, the best and most widely-used platform on Earth. Want to make money? Either you overprice it and market it towards the ""Alternitaves"" (Mac) or make it a reasonable price and market it towards everyone else (Windows). Lord C.: UPDATE. 'Nuff said. AI S: Mabye you should have looked at the small print :MUST HAVE INTERNET CONNECTION TO PLAY GAME. Also, Steam is very widely-known and produced by Valve. Not third-party at all. Stop whining like a pussy and just do it already. You can even load Steam up in Offline mode to play the Single Player version offline. Take a little time to actually look at the Steam software. Madeline V.: Cheating is absolutlely unpreventable. Period. Even the VAC can't help that. It's what the VAC is for. If a server admin reports the person, then they get banned from playing Steam games online (they can still play 1P, but no MP for them). Look up the server admin's contact information and let them know. Kevin T.: All I have to say is, Portal and Counter-Srike: Source have to be a couple of the best games I've ever played. And they're both HL2 mods. Thomas G.: It's an FPS. It's hard to balance action witn puzzles (see the other end of the spectrum - Portal), so give Valve a break. Republican Skillz: HL2:E1 was incredible. Don't judge a game before it's even released, it makes you look like an idiot. Yves B.: Just... utter fail right there. That review didn't even have any actual, you know, review in it. Carmine R.: COD3 can't even begin to compare with this game. Ian F.: How old are you? For the target audience (16-year-old males) this game is incredible. If you think a game with killing is boring, then you need to see a psychologist. Sean War: Doom 3 didn't have the Source engine. The Steam engine takes up more hardware requirements, and you probably lowered your Video options. HL2 has far superior graphics to Doom 3 (like Quake had to Doom 1). Jim F.: New computer. Stop trying to install it on your crappy HP Pavillion (or whatever you have, obviously it's not working). Also, what is the point in even buying a game if you're only going to play it for three days, then mabye once every few monhs for a hour? Just wrong.

64,Half-Life 2,RyukiM.,"Dec 12, 2007","My opinion on this game: Gameplay: 10- The gameplay is superb,and if you are a persistent gamer you just might get addicted. Storyline: 9- The storyline unlike other games at least has meaning. But scenes of Gman's sudden appearances aren't too understandable. And in this game Gordon is running everywhere to get here and there. Physics: 9- The physics of the game is very realistic. The only problem is that corpses in the game may pose weirdly. Injuries aren't something in this game either. Game Triggers: 10- The triggers do make sense and must be followed. Weapon Logics: 9- The weapons in the game have realistic movements and fire. But when used by A.I they reload faster: e.g although all ammo used, A.I reloads shotgun with only one bullet. Npc Body Language: 9- The npc's have very well developed movements. But they maybe be twitchy at times of pause. Game Secrets: 10- They are many hidden secrets within the game. Such as the trainyard outside Ravenholm. If you use noclip mode and go through the crashed train at the end of the trainyard, you will see Gman walking towards the back of another train and disappear around the corner. You'd do well to discover all game secrets. A.I: 7- The A.I are very cooperative and persistent, but they can be dumb sometimes. Flame Effects: 6- From front view the flame is very realistic. But if from a bird's eye, the fire is 2D. Even so..Half-Life 2 still is an entertaining game. Collapse",10,0,0

79,Half-Life 2,JBW.,"Jan 29, 2007","This is the perfect game, in every way. First, anyone who has a problem with Steam should not be downgrading half-life 2, because you are rating the game, not anything else (although I do admit that it does not make sense that you have to be on the internet to play a single player game). The graphics are amazing, better than F.E.A.R., better than PREY better than DOOM 3, better than Resistance, better than any thing I have ever seen.EVER. because the environments are beautiful, technology-wise and artistic-wise. Nothing feels over shiny, and they do not use any cheap texture tricks (DOOM 3). Everything is just as gritty or as polished as you would expect it to be. The gameplay is amazing..........absolutely amazing. It ranges from just curiosity of discovering phun with physics in City 17, to intense and gripping gameplay in Ravenholm, to running away franticly from a strider in the later levels, to OH MY GOD the gravity gun is now freaking awsome in the last chapter.The weapons are not necessarily diverse, most from the first game, but with the gravity gun, you don't really need many more diverse weapons.(although the little antlion food thing is cool too.) The enemys can be soldiers, helicopters, bugs, or even 3 story tall STRIDERS. And they all interact well with you and the environment. Few games make you feel for the characters like this one, especially with excellent voice acting. Last I would like to say that I just don't get how people could give this game a 1, i mean, we are all entitled to our opinion, but a 1, on a game like this, come on, do you have a grudge? are you a halo fan that doesn't want any game to steal its flare. i mean be fair, if you think that some movie knockoff deserves a 3 or a 4 how can you seriously say that Half-Life 2 deserves a 0?

50,Half-Life 2,OliverM.,"Aug 3, 2007","im choosing to vote 7 for this, not so much the game, but the engine. Its worth buying the game and putting up with steam jsut to have access to the various mods that have been produced. On my try of the game (after a day installing, no joke, non broadband and various problems calling for reinstillation) i was amazed by the opening sequence in the train and shortly after the station and city 17. I didnt want that bit to send, the city so lifelike, the cps bullying you, being able to peep into houses to see peoples gettin beaten up, people talking quietly about their supressors and various scanners looming the town. I carried on playing enjoying the long sojurn of the airboat, being different from the footsloggin before then. Ravenholm was impressive, the atmosphere created was nice, although over use of traps and the ability to get well and truly lost along with at one point a perminant spawning of zomibes. It was at this point where my family lost the internet... no internet, no steam, no halflife 2. So for a long time i went back to games like deus ex (deus ex being my favourite all time game). when my family got broadband i started playing hl2 again, finally realising how to get passed the respawning zombies n out of ravenholm. The mines wernt very impressive, they could have done better and the spinning blade cart at the end is... unusual to be round in a mine. The buggy part was fun being able to stop at place but antlion sandtraps wernt impressive, my pc isnt powerful, i get low fps and its hard for me to control various props, as such i noclipped passed the sandtraps. Nova prospekt fun until the point where over 50 troops attack you... the city 17 fighting was nice, i would have like dit if the citizens helped a lil more tho. The citadel at the end is stupidly easy, it seems more like a kiddys play gorund than a gran finale for such a game, being able to kill entire squads of combine elites in 1 shot isnt fun. Over all throughout the game some areas are lacking finishing touches, making them look bland and pointless (most of the blk mesa place) also throught the game you are constanly forced to comprehend wiht pointsless annoying and trivial physics puzzles, wat makes this worse is that most of them involve cinder blocks which have a habit of either a) sliding nicly off or b) knocking all the other cinder blocks then sliding off. so on my replays i often noclip past the various jumping and physics puzzles. The ai is somewhat dissapointing, from the reviews and teasers i was expecting npcs ot take cover, neil, grenade, supply covering fire and find alternate routes. For some scripted squences this does happen but youll often find in the way of self preservation and npc will stand still for a few seconds then either die of shift slightly sideways out of view, only to come bk into view to die, i mean shoot you. The city at the end was particularly nice, with the striders causing lot sof damage, it can be annoyign when you get lost in the rubble or cant find ammo crates to dispell the multiple striders on your tail. Some points are confusing wiht little differnce between them giving the impression of goign round in circles when really your on the opposite side of the building and while being fun the characters are far and few. I woudl have prefered to see more variation in the npcs behavior, more subplots woven in (like maybe jsut discovering a couple trying to escape), less physics puzzles, less steam and situatiosn where the character cna have an impact on the world instead of the same things happening everytime you play. Conclusion, amazing on first try, quickly looses freshness but some of the mods created are uttly superb (notably garrys mod and insurgency) its also worth triyng out counterstrike source. A warning to any who are interested tho you need constant inernet access better pc than mine and alot of pacience to put up with the evil steam. thnx 4 reading Collapse",7,0,0

It gave me great satisfaction to find myself in such an interesting, well-sculpted virtual world. Yeah, it was linear, but the presentation was nothing short of fantastic. Call me strange, but I was so awed when I saw my first, Nazi-like, Orwellian enforcer. As I stopped and stared, all I heard was the click-click-click of the observer drone and the constant droning of propaganda from the speakers on the wall. I was hooked. Nothing gets me more than an environment that is gripping, believable, and immersive. Not like that cluttered, illogical crap you get from Bioshock and others. HL2 just got better from there. Above average weapon selection. The gravity gun was a pleasure to work with. Interesting enemies to fight. Good story. And all of it so beautifully, visually and sonically, presented. I love the sound of that one later assault rifle (with the bouncing ball as the secondary): it was so satisfying to use (too bad it ran out of ammo so quickly!).

I always put off playing this game until now, because the original Half-Life scared me, since I was a little kid at the time. Lately, it's been because I wasn't sure if the combat would be as good as more recent FPSes. While I have to say; the combat isn't necessarily anything new, but it was still completely intense, very rewarding, and great fun. The storyline in this game is... wow. I've been a dedicated LoZ: OoT fanboy since the day I played it, and the first thing that came out of my mouth right after I beat the game was, ""Is this better than Ocarina of Time?"" Admittedly, I still prefer LoZ: OoT, but this game is definitely the best thing I've played in years. I found myself going through and playing the game, all the while saying to myself, ""NOW I understand why this is supposed to be the best PC game ever!"" and every time I meant it more, and more. This game managed to tear me from my shell, pit me in a new environment, and take every ounce of my attention until the very second it was over.

The engine hasn't been as buggy as you stated since the beta, and if objects hit you at 50 km per hour, your gonna get damaged in some way.

You must be blind...people explode into gibs in HL1. In Hl2 you cant do that, yes there's people being hanged and the ""scare"" element is more severe but...its nothing you couldn't handle surely. And its zombies you split in half not ""people"" have you even played the game properly? You think this game is violent? Try watching SAW 4 or playing F.E.A.R. you ignorant little child then you'll see. 3) You rate a game based on its level of gore? Really shows your age...GTFO. 4)Eyes bulging from their head? Now I know your making things up. 5) Its people like you who should banned and removed from ratings and reviewing games. You said your self your 13...but you cant even handle the gore in HL2? Wow your the biggest pussy I've ever seen as well...grow up ffs. Now for the review...whats is their to say short of masterpiece? Its the most engaging, most atmospheric, most well designed and most BRILLIANTLY voice acted FPS game there has EVER been. Stunning graphics and physics engine for its time, and still is after nearly 4 years! Cant believe it came out before games like Bioshock and UT3 and such. Its virtually IMPOSSIBLE to get bored of this game. There's ENDLESS easter eggs and secrets to find, messing about with the physics is just spectacular, (And with GMOD really came the extravigance! :D) setting traps with the physics, building defences and making little towers EPIC! Playing with the AI, the epic scripted sequences of the helicopter chases, on foot chas.es...and the suttle little ""scares"" which keep you on your toes...its not FEAR, but it does the job well :). The only place were you can knock it down is the Team Mate AI. There not the greatest in the world but there not the worst, a lot of the time they will just run out and get them selves killed, or just not move at all, or get stuck etc etc. They can't use a lot of weapos either, only grendages, smg's, pistols and rocket lauchers but, they provide a decent meatshield :). Best part of the game? Well for me it had to be beach and highway 17 etc...I LOVED how the game ""opened up"" here, and it seemed less linear after your exploits in Ravenholm. The ambience of the ocean waves splashing up, the crowing of the gulls, the suttle remains of car crashes and corpses laying about with there bodies smeared across the ground, or hanging from ropes on trees etc...ooh the atmosphere is unrivaled. Love everything in that sequence. As well as the bridge scene :D. Ideed...only HL1 really comes close. And with all the mods HL2 has its very hard to get bored. With EP1/2/3 out or on there way, the experience continues to grow :D. Well done Valve...keep 'em coming! Collapse",10,0,0

The story line is just perfect, and the physics engine is just outstanding. Ex: Throwing a can at a combine head is just the most realistic (and funny) thing that ever happen in my life. The game play focuses on fps, AND thinking skills. It will take you time and patience to figure out a way pass secruity measures and barnacles. The zombies are just scarrier than ever and much more eneimes from HL1. Those who played Half life 1 must play this no matter what it is. At least renting it would just be darn good than a demo.

51,Half-Life 2,Nastyguard,"Dec 5, 2009","By far the best game of 2004, and is still one of my favorite games ever! The game is great overall, it has polish through the roof! Even though VALVE today is known for amazingly polished games The gameplay is amazing! Shooting enemies is very satisfying, and since there are many enemies to shoot - you'll be neither frustrated by the combat nor will you be bored without it, since times without enemies are very rare. But when there are no enemies to fight, the game presents you with a variety of puzzles, mostly physics based. The physics of the Source Engine are one of the best out there, and considering this game is pretty old - it's kind of surprising. Although there are 2 complaints I have about the gameplay: 1) There aren't enough guns. Considering HL1 had so many of them, this one falls pretty short. The addition of the Gravity-Gun basically makes up for it. 2) The Teammate AI is pretty poor. The enemies handle great by taking cover, throwing grenades, working in teams to defeat you. Considering that, it's kind of surprising your teammates are so dumb. They rarely hit enemies, often get stuck somewhere and they do some other things, that you wouldn't want your teammates doing. The graphics are also a marvel to look at, even 5 years after its initial release. You play in huge, beautiful landscapes with great detail. Models are also beautiful, especially thanks to the incredible facial animation VALVE managed to put in their game. I have 0 complaints with the graphics. The sound is also great, featuring a pretty good soundtrack (although rarely heard), great sound effects (people who were making them probably had the hardest job ever, since the items you shoot from the gravity gun against other items make a sound varying depending on which items you shoot at which, so they had to make a hellish amount of combinations) and an amazing voice crew, with every single character talking in a very believable manner, which along with the realistic facial animation make for a pretty great atmosphere. The game is pretty long, lasting about 10 hours through your first playing, and for some reason - I keep wanting to replay it again and again over time. And I also forgot to mention the story. The story unfolds in a near flawless fashion. It's weird that Gordon never speaks (again), but it can be easily forgotten. You'll be hooked by the storytelling and drawn into the action naturally. A story that even beats HL1, in my opinion. I had very little to none complaints about this game, and I think it deserves a 10. The complaints I did have, however, are really minor and you'll barely even notice them while playing this amazing gaming experience. If you still haven't played the game - what the hell are you waiting for? BUY IT NOW! I suggest getting the Orange Box, since it comes with HL2 and both of the episodes, Portal - which is an amazing puzzle game that you'll find very unique and fun to play, and Team Fortress 2 - which is an amazing/cartoony Online MultiPlayer shooter, that'll have you hooked. Story - 10 (8 if you haven't played HL1) Gameplay - 9 Sound - 9 Graphics - 10 Lasting appeal - 10 Overall (average score) - 9.6 ~ 10. Collapse",10,0,0

Then I was browsing the internet and I found out you can hack steam (games for free). I only wanted to play hl2 with NOCLIP so I did the hack. I got the full version of HL2 and HL2 Deathmatch (also should be induced on the consoles). I played the game agin but not to beat it but to explore and spawned enemies/allies every where. Though I cant stand hammer editor (confusing) the doom 3 editor is my favorite map creator. The ""Hammer"" editor requires confusing set-up before you can even use it.

Available on STEAM now you can get HL2, which comes with CS Source(exactly the same as regular counterstrike gameplay wise, but looks sooooo much better its a different game). I have paid $60 for the silver edition which includes CS Source, HL2, DOD Source, and HL1 Source. I can already say that the $60 is worth CS source alone. every item can be interacted with realistically. you can bust up computers in the office map and see the parts spill out. the best thing is that bullet holes stay there, dont just dissapear. the game looks sooo much nicer. then there is gonna be HL1 Source, the remake of the best game ever made. If you've played HL think that with the HL2 graphics and physics. thats saying ALOT. Then DOD source. Although this is only in early development and wont be out for some time, the idea of all the DOD maps redone just make chills go down my spine. dod_forest actually looking like a real forest? yes, its true.
Oh yeah.......then there is HL2 itself. Im not gonna get into this but if you dont know about it take a look at the website and see why its the most anticipated game of all time. the fact that those 4 games are only $60 total is the most insane thing and i hereby declare HL2 the BEST GAME EVER with THE BEST VALUE TOO.

On the box it says internet connections REQUIRED, that means you need it, deal with it, if you don't like it dont buy the game.... The physics are amazing, the games storyline is linear, but thats how it should be, its not GTA nor should it be, Half-Life 2 is less than a challenge than Half-Life 1, when half-life 1 came out first person shooters weren't challenging and there werent that many good ones... if you look now there is a plethora of shooters and we have all become accustomed to them... Try playing Half-Life 1 again... I did before Half-Life 2 came out and it wasn't half the challenge that it was when i first tried it, we have just gotten too accustomed to them... Now concerning steam and the processes that we had to go through to play... Plain and simple; would you like to put six years of your life into a game, perfecting, working, develloping a game that is in all ways a master piece to have it stolen mby some college grad with a computer steal it, use it, play it without ever playing? does that sound just to you? Also as to the AI? on hard the ai is very smart, i once popped out a door, then saw four or five CP soldiers and a strider, then ran back inside and waited for them to come and attack me... one ran through the door.... shotgun to the head! I expected more to come through pop 'em off one by one, not going to happen... a nade comes through... i jumped behind a table that flew into me and hurt me... then again i waited.. the strider crouched down and looked into the doorway charged its beam and fired! its was impressive i closed the door and blocked it up with a few tables and the cps tried to break down the door they couldnt! they smashed the window and started to shoot me they lobbed grenades etc! this was NOT SCRIPTED!!! i tried it more than once... it happened differenly each time (including one time that then shot the boxes to break them and then kicked open the door,) Ok, last thing... i think people who say that the phsysics are stupid and that there are games with better graphics than Half-Life 2, Ok you are on crack... or have been hit in the head one too many times with a real crowbar...

Kinda Crazy, a little Creepy (little), pretty inventive (it's great that people will state how much they hate the orginal, but how many games have since added its elements to their own. How many heros can you name with a super suit with shields?) The gameplay is ok, but I wasn't interested in being a lame knock-off of neo from the matrix in glasses, i wanted to shoot aliens. Instead, we get the stupid ai combine, who will run from a grenade and straight into your fire. The puzzles are also just them showing off their new physics and gravity gun. By the way, the gravity gun is stupid. There. I said it. Shotgun rules ( even though it was downgraded... actually, ALL the weapons were downgraded) because this game is not much differen than the original: run forward, solve puzzles, and you'll rarely fight in large arenas, just close quarters. The dialouge scenes are annoying and way to long. Other than that, good graphics and pretty gripping gameplay, save the lack of variation amongst the enemies. Wait! There is one more bad thing. Ravenholm=not scary and pointless. This level was just an excuse for the gravity gun, but a handy crowbar, shotgun, and .357 are actually the best weapons, at least for me. Hopefully they will be more creative in the future and stop trying to make another bad post-apocalpyse-revelution-thing that we've all seen 1,000 times over. The game is very intense at points.

People are also talking about how Half Life 2 is repeatable through certain sections if you play them over and over. My friend died three times at that massive turret on that part where you are taking the airboat to Eli's and you have to explode the barrels to knock open a gate. Each time he played the section against that combine soldier, the soldier ended up in three different places when my friend crouched behind tha cart and slowly pushed it toward him. On another part when you are escaping the combine in the train tunnels my friend looked down the hallway and saw a combine soldier next to an exploding barrel that was knocked over. He went to the wall to get some health and when he went back to go kill the soldier, we saw him pushing an exploding barrel down the hall towards him. Now i haven't played doom 3 or quake but what other AI does this? What about the Zombies who through barrels and crates at you? I didn't expect that.

Bottom line is that Half Life 2 has great graphics without compromising performance and all you people need to get off of your Far Cry trip. Collapse",9,0,0

59,Half-Life 2,AnonymousMC,"May 18, 2006","It's a great game if you have the right stuff. I'm really not sure why everyone is comparing this to Far-Cry thousands of times, I have viewed textures, graphics and such: overall, if you can run Half-Life 2 without what probably 50% of the lower rated poster's computers are, preferably horrible 4200 Dells, Half-Life 2 is immense and the graphics are well made and just awesome. And since when does a shooter have to be so in particularly be a completely realistic in an environment of the jungle, or some place on Mars, or some really dumb variation of L.A? (I'm looking at you, Bloodlines.) What happened to the good old shooters like Metal Slug, hm? Sure, they weren't packed to their necks with plasma decentigration balls, dual powered shotguns, MP7's, or hoverboats, but what it the issue? Even if you count out the puzzles and map designs (Which, by the way, are practically flawless compared to some of the garbage I've seen from Halo and many other First Persons) the gameplay still heads in the correct direction. Then, complaints on the squads and commands; let me address that you don't even need squads if you're playing on normal, let alone easy. If just having some rebel guy following you and you press 'c' at the ground in front of you, he'll go. I found barely any uses of teamwork, with the exception of Grigori or Alyx, the special NPCs.
What sort of makes me mad too is the fact people continue to say 'this game is overrated', 'this game is behind its time', 'this game is crap no thanks to Steam', personally, these are whiny comments. First of all, the game would probably not be overrated, if it weren't for the 2003 hacking. Second, it would not of been behind its time. If I do recall, some companies found part of the coding and used it for their own games. Next to that, the physics engine was remarkable for what it was way back when, when it drove awe into the people who watched E3 and the beta clips. I'm not sure what's wrong with registering to Steam either: You simply install the game, which takes NOT 4 hours, it takes 10 to 15 minutes before for my old, lousy Dell. Then you register the game, which shouldn't even take that long, if 3 minutes counts as yet another sarcastic 1 hour. If it takes the person installing Half-Life 2 at least 4 hours, then your computer dates back to the days Half-Life 1 could run on those awesome Pentium 1 Windows 93 computers. And complaining of load times? Get a computer upgrade, stop whining. If you save some money for at least 3 months, you could get a gigabyte of ram and a GeForce 7300 at its cheapest.
Enough complaining, it's time to get on to Half-Life 2, and what it brought, and would of brought to this generation. I applaud Valve for simply releasing this; I was almost doubting a real release at all due to the beta hack. The guns, if I say, are awesome. The MP7 I would delightfully switch with an MP5K anyday, though. Collapse",10,0,0

I give it a 10. 9 wouldn't do it. Anything lower would be a little [okay, a lot] unjust. It isn't perfect, but for todays standards, this game left me breathless, and it left me for me. Like a game should. Similar to God of War. Gameplay kept me hooked, the storyline going somewhere, the graphics were, dare I say, orgasmic. Hats off to you Valve. And STEAM, fix yourself up. The HL series lost fans to you, but fans loyal enough stayed with it and say the same as I. Can't wait for what else you have in store.

84,Half-Life 2,SimonBlain,"Aug 16, 2006","[***SPOILERS***] I was merely 13 when I played the first Half-Life. I was a little Doom fiend back then and when I played Half-Life, I was a scared little wuss. The game didn't scare me, it was its music. But enough about that. I grew up in FPS games and I have loved just about any of them which I played. Even those with the crappy graphics from 1993. When I first set eyes on Half-Life 2. I told myself: ""My my, what a pretty little thing you are!"" I saved it from its dusty EB Games shelf and bought it for my own. It proved cold to me, as Steam itself told me I couldn't do anything with this game until I had properly let it encrypt the game's data to ensure it wasn't a copied version. I could not refuse as I am a legit gamer. After an afternoon (just about) of attempting to install the game, I was satisfied to see its update finished. Over with that and up into the game I went. I was glad to see G-Man talk to me in such a kind way as when I left him in Half-Life 1. Then he sent me on to be chased by a ravenous Combine before I met Alyx (whom was indicated to me by Barney). Only then could I properly start defending myself. And only then did the game really start. The first few minutes of the game are all nothing but showing you how the physics work and that you can interact with characters around you. That, however, is a lie. You may think that: ""Oh, I can toss items on people or make a barricade if ennemies attack me."" Que nenni, my friend. The ENTIRE game is based on pure action, where gunfight follows stabs from the crowbar on alien heads or zombie headcrabs. My all-time fear factor, the Barnacle, made its return. How pretty is that thing now, compared to the Half-Life 1 model. It looks like it was meant to be: A plant. Half-Life 1's model looked much more like a stalagmite hanging from a mountain's roof. Monsters, all-timer classics are back with some cousins. Headcrabs come with three species now... The old ones, the fast headcrabs and the black poison headcrabs. The old headcrabs are fat and dumb. The fast headcrabs are ... well, fast. However they wish, they can harrass you with absolutely no let down until you've bashed them away with the crowbar. Black Headcrabs were balanced from their horribly startling attack. They make this sort of gremlin-ish warcry before dashing towards you with their gaping mouth. Contact, wherever they hit you, will drop your life to 1 HP. As it is a poison, your HEV suit will heal you gradually to your healthstate before the attack. That implies that if you're getting shot at that a headcrab hits you, you will instantly die. That is just about the only thing I loved, about the ennemies. The rest is for you to find out, if you haven't played. The A.I is silly. What happened to the marines in HL1 ? They were fast and effective, aside from those over-confident Combine warriors that stay in place, hoping their Kevlars will help them resist a shot from your .350 magnum. The world itself is vast and wealthy in graphical details. You'll come from a victorian neighbourhood, to a port, to a beach, to an old and dusty Jailing system and to the Citadel. The game itself makes absolutely no innovations as ""physical engineering"" has been seen in previous games. Some quirks look as though they might have been stolen from Quake 2, but are tossed aside as you just take a look at it all. The game in itself -can- be hard, if you are the kind to blindly run in and blast whoever's around you. But it can also be very fun, if you use your surroundings adequately. Certainly not the best game of all times, but certainly one of the best around so far. Collapse",8,0,0

Although linear at times, the game has such a high variety of environments that it never ceased to bore me. The enemy AI, despite what some seem to say was extremely bad, I thought was pretty good. True, enemies were never really faced with complicated decisions of tactics and the like, but they did flank and use cover. And they didn't rush you blindly (unless they had a shotgun). I also liked the lack of ammo that kept you scrounging or finding new ways to make use of the gravity gun, which, by the way, is simply put the most ingenious weapon ever designed in a video-game. Lastly, the story was excellent. Without an engrossing story, even the best of games can get tedious. This was an almost cinematic story, dishing out plenty of plot twists, reslationships, character backgrounds, and was generally just a really well-implemented part of this game.

Awesome, even with a medium-high level graphics card. Although compared to current graphics technologies, it's a little rusty, but compared to 2004 graphics, it's amazing. Storyline: 8 -Great storyline, but I didn't really get sucked into it, but then again most FPS games have almost NO storyline at all. And if they do, it sucks. AI: 7 -I have to admit that this game's AI is kinda....stupid? But what would an FPS be if the AI is so smart that they do all the stuff for you? It's good enough, (at least they don't suicide) so stop whining. Gameplay: 10- I can't stress enough about the gameplay. It is absolutely amazing. Some parts are crazy, with bullets flying everywhere, complete chaos, but there are also many parts where its just you. Those parts are for you to calm down after a harrowing firefight. Many games don't have that, it's just fighting, fighting, and fighting. Too repetative. Of course, you'll need at least a mid-high level computer. If you don't, you can't fully appreciate the game.

Those have HDR technology (I think...) so if you want to play those, you'll need a good graphics card. Steam...Steam...Steam....everyone's complaining about it. To me it is one of the best ideas ever. Once you register your game, its yours forever. As always, there are hackers, but if you are smart with your account you should have no problems.

HL2 was my 1st game after a long break in PC gaming for me, I had been playing console games solo for since I got my master system. This game works so well on so many levels I just couldn't believe I had neglated PC gaming for so many years. I was never a great fan of FPS games on the console format but some how HL2 ws able to offer a much more engrossing game that I just found hard to put down.

66,Half-Life 2,PaulW,"Nov 16, 2008","How odd that people talk about being emotionally moved by a game that, whilst leaving you to your own defences like Metroid Prime in parts, doesn't have the moments of stunning beauty, accentuated by a beautiful score, such as when you walk into Phenandra Drifts. Half Life 2's best parts are Route Kanal and We don't go to Ravenholme which is a brilliant reminder of overall better games with an almost surreal film noir feel (like Max Payne 2) crossed with the survival horror of Resident Evil and Silent Hill. To its credit, this game has more moments of bleak surrealness such as disengaging from a hovercraft, after a very lonely trek, only to find yourself in a camp of headcrabs. If the game had been marketed and regarded as a surreal masterpiece rather than as just one all about AI, physics or character expressions, records that it could only hope to keep for a short time (it never had the best character expressions- the Gamecube Resident Evil remake did by far) then I would have scored it a bit higher. Apart from the sections I have mentioned, the game's graphics never seemed impressive to me on the Xbox and seem relatively prehistoric now. The hyperbole about this game is ludicrous- I had much more fun and emotional investment in playing Metroid Prime, Resident Evil (the remake), and Uncharted- Drake's Fortune. Collapse",7,0,0

72,Half-Life 2,KakHome,"Feb 11, 2008","This is an awesome game, but I think it's just a notch over-rated. The graphics are awesome from start to finish. There are many cool sequences as well. The game is generally very good in the gameplay department, and loads of fun overall, but I've found a couple of weak points in the game. For one, the first 2 chapters are all introduction chapters with no monsters, which I thought was a bit too much introduction. Most of the Ravenholm chapter seemed to be rather short on ammo, which often frustrated me, though this may have been intentional. The first half of Anticitezen One seemed to be rather empty in terms of bad guys and offered little challenge, which made me a bit bored until the escitement returned later on in that chapter. Finally, the ending is a bit weak, with not much of a truely climatic fight, and what seemed to be somewhat of an incomplete closing scene. However, the rest of the game is virtually perfect. I thought the car and boat chapters stood out even more - I had about as much fun in these chapters as I've ever had in a game, period.

3,Half-Life 2,MikeM.,"Sep 23, 2008","Gameplay: 10 The gameplay in Half-Life 2 is simply amazing. If you aren't completely used to the controls of PC First-Person Shooter controls, don't worry. This game manages to make a first level without any weapons fun! It lets you get accustom to the controls and experience the amazing physics engine this game has to offer. While I was playing through this game for the first I was simply stunned, just by the fact that you could actually pick up objects in the game. The only other time I was ever able to do this in a game was when I played a demo of Deus Ex 2 (for Xbox) at my local Play N' Trade. As for the level design, it just simply blows my mind. I actually felt as if I was Gordon Freeman (protgonist of Half-Life 2). The whole game felt like an interactive movie, mainly because of the fact that you never leave the view of the main character (this means that there were no cutscenes). Graphics: 8 The graphics in this game are nothing special, pretty much average. Although the rare polygonal shapes (such as valves or steering wheels) can tend to be an eyesore at times. There can also be annoying glitches, such as getting stuck on an object while playing. But the great thing about the graphics is that when people talk, it looks realistic, making the game even more enjoyable than before. Audio: 9 The audio in Half-Life 2 actually feels believable. I found myself looking over my shoulder from time to time when playing through Ravenholm, to make sure there were no zombies behind me. Also, when you are stuck in the middle of an ambush and are shooting blindly at you're enemies, how can you be sure that you've killed one? Half-Life 2 fixed this problem. Whenever an enemie is killed a certain sound is made, such as a squeel or beeping sound, this way you know if the coast is clear. Replay Value:9 I have completed this game at least 20 times, and enjoyed it every single time. My two favorite missions had to be Ravenholm and Highway 17. Also, if you get bored with the singleplayer campaign, why not try the multiplayer component of Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. This delivers hours of solid multiplayer fun, with the gameplay and weaponry of the original game we know and love.

60,Half-Life 2,Mera,"May 25, 2022","I know, I'm a bit late to the party, but as a level design enthusiast, I decided to give Half Life series a go for the first time along with the 2 expansions of the second one as it's often cited as a primary example of standard narrational level design. So technically, this is a review of HL1+HL2+EP01&02. From the very first moment you begin the game, the world is being introduced to you, be it through the ""non-cinematic"" presence of you, the player in this world, environmental storytelling, and sound design which are the main propellants for telling the mysterious and non-conventional plot of Half Life. Half Life was a big F U to the other FPS games of its time, like doom and quake or wolfenstein, in which the main focus was gunplay and the levels were a playground for slaying waves of enemies. However in HL, the environment and levels are filled with scripted events and purposeful art design which immerses you in its world and story, almost like the experience of reading an actual sci-fi novel. I can see HL's influence on the industry as a whole better now that I've played it, and rarely felt bored or consider it ""outdated"", maybe except in the first game's last chapters. It's influence is obvious in the existence of games such as Dishonored, BioShock, Prey and even Titanfall 2 campaign.

The shooting and gun feedback is top notch and enemy AI, especially on harder difficulties, is challenging. forcing the player to take on enemies with strategy rather than waiting behind conveniently placed shoulder high walls while your health regenerates.
The puzzles are perfectly timed to break up the action, so you aren't just shooting things until it gets boring. The addition of the gravity gun later into the game really adds depth and weight to the gameplay as you find yourself clearing hallways of debris and quickly switching to your crowbar to kill head crabs in the places you discover doing so.
There are a few annoyances though. First off Squad AI is not broken, but annoying. An example being that Team mates often block doorways or trap you in a corner.

In the original Half-Life I found climbing ladders to be a chore because you sped up them too fast as well as took a lot of fall damage when you shot off them and landed. Well in Half-Life 2 you climbed ladders at a normal speed and fall damage was much better and more in line with what I would expect. I had also criticized the difficulty curve which I would say was far improved in the sequel. I didn’t feel at any time that things got much easier or harder, it was very consistent. On top of those fixes the voice acting was far improved. As well the sound effects were fantastic as were the physics and graphics for it’s time. The game offered an incredible atmosphere and world and many ways to interact with it. The battle scenes were fantastic with parts of buildings exploding and comrades coming to join the fight. I never minded that Half-Life took place in one facility but for those who did you traverse over a varied landscape with many locations and places the story takes you. Speaking of story the game was just as good as the original with a great cast of returning and new characters. As for non technical issues there was really only one: the controls on the air boat you drive was very loose and was a pain to control at times. There was the same enemies and weapons as before as well as several new types of both.

I played Half-Life 2 on Linux. It never crashed on me. There were a few technical issues. One was texture pop in with grass. Another was the AI for comrades was just terrible. They were constantly getting in my way and blocking me in when indoors or in tight spaces which caused my death a few times. There was also one instance when driving a buggy where I had to park in a garage of a house and this proved to be impossible because the car wouldn’t fit. I got half way in which not only qualified as parking to complete the objective but I lost a bunch of health when I bumped the side of the garage going in. There were 4 AA settings; 6 AF settings; a V-Sync toggle; 9 other graphics options and an FOV slider that went from 75-90. You could change the difficulty level at any time as well as manually save at any time. Performance was fantastic which wasn’t surprising given the game’s age.

Half-Life 2 took the good parts of Half-Life and expanded on them while fixing what little warts the original had. It had a few stumbles along the way but nothing serious and in no way did they impact the fun of the game. It is a great game and worth every penny of it’s current asking price of $11.49 CAD. Just like the original it has several memorable moments and characters that stand the test of time. I finished the game in 12 hours and 56 minutes on the hard difficulty setting.

92,Half-Life 2,Metalpizza123,"Jun 14, 2019","Playing it again in 2018, I don't know how i found this so fun when I was younger. The mission structure is boring, with repetitive combat with uninteresting enemies that lack variety. Certain sections seem thrown in just to show off the engine, without considering why it's even necessary. Physics puzzles may have been interesting back when it launched but even then I found it boring and insulting to the player. More often than not they're incredibly simple and is just busywork/filler to pad out the levels. However, it is still fun to run through its expansions, which refined a lot of the game's mechanics and feel more polished as a result. The story itself is honestly pretty bland, and never reaches the highs of the original. The characters occasionally feel flat and as a result feel more like necessities to drive the game, but overall the writing is pretty good. It Still lacks a compelling reason to keep invested. It's linear structure is not helped by otherwise boring level design, perhaps due to the limits of the combat system. A pity then, as some of the weapons and tools are legitimately quite fun and unique, and provide interesting ways to interact with the environment and enemies. Ravenholm is still a highlight where the tools and level design feel consistently fun. Play it in short bursts and the combat is pretty fun. However, after certain events in the game, you're forced to face gauntlet after gauntlet of combine enemies. This is easily the most unrewarding part of the game, forcing you to battle wave after wave of enemies that rarely change their tactics and with the level design failing to bring any interesting twists to the combat.

Thankfully it's usually on sale pretty cheap on steam, and fairly regularly (with its expansions). It's still wonderful to watch people speedrun it and it's worth playing through, at least once. i would advise any modern gamer to play it more as a way to see how gaming evolved, rather than using it as a standard for games to compare to. Many games have learnt and built upon the changes made in this game. I do give it points for running wonderfully on many modern systems. I have now played it across 4 operating systems and it has run well across multiple brands of graphics cards. Graphics mean little to me in terms of gameplay but from an objective standpoint it has aged well, unlike many 3D games from the early 2000s. It won't blow anything away now, but it does look serviceable and much better than many games from its era. Sound design is good, but not memorable. Serviceable perhaps.

It does have a wealth of fan made mods but that does not affect my score, as Valve did not create them.

I guess Valve made a great game for its time, but for its time only. While other games have gone on to play well long after they have been released, Half Life 2 stands as a dated classic. If you want to play a game from this era that plays just as well as the first time it was released, I would recommend FEAR. It's almost the complete opposite. Storytelling is far better, with immersion done far better. It has aged worse, has numerous compatibility issues, and requires extensive tweaking to get working on modern operating systems. but it's fun to play, even today. Another example would be Max Payne 2. It has aged awfully, but remains fun to this day. But play half life 2. At least once. You'd be missing out otherwise. Collapse",8,0,0

Story was great and the gravity gun caused for some hell of a good time. Enjoyable tossing a saw blade through the air to slice people in half. Sadly I didn't play the original Half-Life so I was a bit confused with the story at first, a recap or something would of been nice to give the player a chance to soak in everything that happened previously. After reading a article on Half Life it made a lot more sense. For a first person shooter this game had a crap ton of jump scares and points to make me gasp. Turning around to have a headcrab naw into your face or a fast moving zombie jump at you. The amount of shotgun shells wasted in fear

The original Half-Life was a disappointing for me, it was frustrating on it's difficulty balance, combat and annoying platforming sections, those are almost non existent here and thankfully Valve solve all those issues and make a way better Half-Life experience.
Although i cannot say that Half-Life 2 is the perfect game or the best game ever made, it has its flaws, like any other game, the game includes a new mechanic that involves driving mechanics to travel long distances... the driving is pretty terrible (sorry). The voice acting is average, not bad but not great either, there are some character with a pretty calm voices over the situations occurring in the campaign, friendly squad AI is not that great, enemies like the zombies, head crabs or whatever they are called, and some little robots that fly with blades are pretty annoying and those enemies are way to often to encounter.
One of the biggest improvements was the physics, that are useful to move over other section and they respond fluently, over the failed attempt from the first game. Facial animation is really impressive for a game released back in 2004, character felt... real!!! and not like lifeless mannequins.

45,Half-Life 2,ElCucuy,"Feb 3, 2020","Скажу сразу: в этой игре - лучший геймплей в истории шутеров от первого лица, могу воспеть оду любви этому шедевру на 10 000 символов, но для объективности, решил перепройти в текущий момент, чтобы с высоты лет взглянуть на это произведение более объективно.

Что ж, игра пройдена в 15 раз, и вот что я скажу. В моём понимании, таким и должен быть идеальный шутер. Это чистый концентрированный динамичный геймплей, без каких-либо лишних примесей, таких как прокачка, крафт или исследование большого пустого мира (бич почти всех сегодняшних игр), но и не страдающий болячками шутеров начала и середины нулевых - монотонным коридорным шутингом и растягиванием геймплея засчёт поиска карточек к дверям, нет, халва уникальна в своём роде, я бы даже не сказал, что она опередила своё время (хотя и это само собой верно), она просто стоит особняком от всех остальных шутеров, так продолжается и по сей день.

Какой ещё шутер, даже сейчас, на момент 2020 года, позволяет себе подкидывать новые механики игроку каждый час?
Какой ещё шутер позволяет себе такое разнообразие в геймплее? Игрок исследует город без оружия, затем участвует в побеге на водном катере, проходит через survival-horror в ревенхолме, передвигается в полуоткрытом мире, открытом для опционального исследования, на транспорте (привет Uncharted 4), получает в своё коммандование стаю муравьиных львов, а позднее ботов-людей, для участия в кровопролитных и масштабных уличных боях на манер лучших частей Call of duty, и в финале получает совершенно уникальный опыт, когда у него забирают всё оружие, оставляя только с улучшенной гравипушкой.
Какой ещё шутер содержит в себе такую физику и интерактивность с окружением? Во второй халве закончившиеся патроны никогда не являются проблемой, ведь в вашем арсенале гравипушка, поволяющая швырять любые окружающие вас предметы, мелких врагов, отбрасывать гранаты, устраивать ловушки и многое другое, на что только хватит вашей фантазии.

Эта игры - пик развития сюжетных шутеров, да и наверное всей индустрии в целом. Очень жаль, что в какой-то момент геймдев свернул не туда, разработчики заболели агрессивной монетизацией, играми-сервисами, гигантоманией, и теперь в угоду более открытых пустых пространств с вышками, урезаются многие геймплейные элементы, в том числе физика, которая даже если и есть, никакого практического значения для геймплея не имеет. Но так как реализовывать наполненные и действительно интересные открытые миры умеют единицы, как, например, рокстар, мы и имеем ситуацию, при которой единственные шутеры для одиночной игры сегодня - это отвратительные фар край: нью даун, вольфенштейн: янгблад и рейдж 2. Мда уж, печально и грустно это всё. Ставлю второй халве максимальную оценку, в память о славных временах: 10 из 10. Collapse",10,0,0

47,Half-Life 2,POstAL_QueeN,"Nov 23, 2018","Не любить данную франшизу невозможно. Она привнесла большой вклад в игровую индустрию с разных сторон, в особенности со стороны инноваций. Я всегда считал Half-Life 2 (да и Half-Life) полноценной научной фантастикой. Такого рода игры мне по нраву и можно сказать то, что серия игр Half-Life продлила мне этот путь любви к научной фантастике.

Говоря про инновации, то да, для своего времени это было нечто. Движок, на который кстати потом перенесли оригинальный Half-Life впечатлял бесконечно. Вся эта плавность при игре была на столько заметна, что хотелось играть и играть (думаю олдфаги спокойно проходят игру за одну сессию). Сюжет держал в напряжении на протяжении всего прохождения, лично мне нравилось это чувство, оно у меня осталось ещё с Half-Life. Если говорить про геймлей, то тут ляжет в основу движок, ибо ""плавность"" (кто играл тот знает о чем я, а кто нет - то обязательно сыграйте и тоже все поймете). Я всегда считал серию игр Half-Life за полноценный одиночный сеттинг (бродить одному), но даже в таких играх персонажи впечатляют своей харизмой и как они поданы, чего только стоит Аликс Вэнс.

Хотелось бы этим отзывом сделать вклад и для последующих после Half-Life 2 двух эпизодов. Эпизод один и эпизод два - это достойное продолжение и как полноценные две игры. Можно даже сказать одна полноценная игра из трех частей (эпизод три приди, эпизод три приди, эпизод три приди).

На все времена, к прохождению обязательно и абсолютно не важно олдфаг ты или нет (хотя все олдфаги давно ее прошли). Collapse",10,0,0

50,Half-Life 2,sebastianali,"Oct 18, 2020","Half Life 2 es uno de los mejores FPS que existen. En primer lugar, vamos por los gráficos. Los gráficos. En pleno 2004, los gráficos, las físicas son de lo absolutamente mejor que he visto nunca, y si bien puede estar anticuado para estándares actuales, es la ambientación y el diseño de niveles lo que lo hace destacar a día de hoy. En cuanto a la historia, es excelente y va de la mano con la jugabilidad y la progresión e interacción de los mapas, similar al primer juego pero mejorado (aunque la inclusión de nuevos personajes que supuestamente son de antaño como Eli Vance, que si bien son carismáticos, el juego no los introduce de manera correcta y eso no me ha gustado). Sin embargo, hay algunas cosas que empeoraron con respecto a la primera entrega. La jugabilidad en parte me pareció peor: si bien alabo la inclusión de vehículos (entretenidos y con mucha adrenalina) o la arma gravitatoria (muy innovador por cierto), hay menos variedad de armas, lo que da menos estrategia a la hora de combatir y se convierte en algo genérico, ademas de carecer de modo multijugador a diferencia del primer juego (y no, el multijugador por consola con trucos o con mods no cuenta). Quitando eso, es un juegazo, ademas de marcar un antes y un después en el genero, habiendo envejecido de manera espectacular. A nivel jugable sera inferior al primer juego, pero a nivel de narrativa y ambientación le gana por mucho. Collapse",8,0,0

60,Half-Life 2,Moonman95,"Jun 12, 2019","What should have been an amazing sequel to a perfect game turns out to be a lackluster shell of it's former self. The biggest thing they neutered was the story and gameplay, let's go over the story first. HL2 and HL1 cannot and I repeat, cannot exist in the same universe, there is a very major plothole that makes for these 2 games to be impossible to exist in the same universe. In a script for HL1, the G-man was referred to as ""The Administrator"" and was very heavily implied to be running Black Mesa throughout your encounters with him. But in HL2, Dr. Breen is actually the administrator of Black Mesa. Another thing is that none of the characters in HL2 have been in Black Mesa, as the NPCs in HL1 are completely nameless, and judging off skin color alone to think ""Oh this guy's Kleiner"" or ""This guy's Eli"" isn't a very good argument. it is also never explained how the Combine invaded the earth, and what happened during that time. This is never explained in game. But what if I told you it would have been explained completely in detail, and it would have made sense within the HL canon? The HL2 cut beta featured a completely different storyline, with no Dr Breen, and no retcons of any kind, it is unknown as to why Valve scrapped the entire thing, considering they were really late into development with it, the actual retail HL2 took 6-8 months to make max. The gameplay has been reduced to a hallway simulator, with wimpy weapons and brain dead enemies. Another thing they added which nobody asked for is physics based combat, it really does not play to the game's advantage, as it doesn't have the raw strength and sound to give off the feel that you're all powerful, a small wooden door and a big ass metal crate make the exact same sound, and all weigh the same, it doesn't even matter, they all deal the same damage. The gravity gun is fun for the first time until you realize it instakills nearly all enemies with a single throw and it completely negates all difficulty you could have. Now onto an even bigger fault with the story, Alyx Vance is the most overpowered Mary Sue character in video game history, she always gets out unscathed, always overcomes anything in her path with no struggle, and she can never die. Even Kleiner was supposed to die in the original plot, but I guess you can't have death in a Half-Life game, oh wait. Overall, what this all boils down to is a lackluster attempt at milking more money from a franchise with a promising start. Collapse",6,0,0

PLOT
The plot is very interesting in the game!
We play again as Gordon Freeman, who survived a cascading resonance in the Black Mesa laboratory and was put into stasis by a mysterious man named G-Man. Freeman finds himself on Earth of the near future,
where all power belongs to the alien government by the Alliance. The Alliance drove people to cities and makes them obey, siphoning all resources from the earth and suppressing the human instinct to reproduce. Those who disagree are destroyed by the Alliance units, so the fighters against the regime switched to guerrilla warfare.

GAMEPLAY
We play first person shooter
in which you move through various levels. In addition to the standard weapon, Gordon also has a special gravity cannon, which allows him to manipulate physical objects, throwing circular saws, barrels of fuel at opponents, and solving puzzles with it. The game, to be honest, is very atmospheric to this day.

GRAPHICS
For 2004 this graphics was a breakthrough, HL2 is even better than Far Cry in terms of graphics! And now these graphics look good!

PHYSICS
Also in 2004, physics was also a breakthrough, and to be honest, I still like this kind of physics!

ENEMIES:
There are a lot of enemies in the game. here, even in the second part, several types of zombies and headcrabs brought in other new monsters
...

CHARACTERS:
In the game they are all memorable

3,Half-Life 2,PaulKorsky,"May 13, 2021","Технически игра выполнена просто превосходно. Правда, сейчас при взгляде на некоторые текстуры через зум начинает щипать глазки, но общий визуал великолен. К тому же если вспомнить, в каком году игра выходила, то из конкурентов смогу лишь отметить второго Макса; те же Doom 3 и Quake 4 спустя время выглядят на порядок хуже этих двух легенд. Движок Source чуть ли не лучшее, что было создано в индустрии, и отрицать этот факт крайне глупо. Геймплейно же игра представляет из себя стандартный шутер от первого лица первые процентов 40 игры, а потом появляется пресловутая гравипушка, которая позволит вам заигрывать с окружением и тестировать всякий мусор на тушах врагов. На это Вам, кстати, выделят небольшую, но очень атмосферную миссию в Рейвенхолме, с освящеными шотганами, отцом Григорием и его бурной паствой. Также геймплей будет разбавлятся поездками на транспорте. И здесь будет, наверное, самая неоднозначная часть игры. Нет, сама задумка крута, тут даже спорить не буду, но исполнение 40/60. 40% — это эпичнейшая глава на лодке, которая выполнена просто отлично, а вот, увы, 60 — поездка на багги. Он будет причинять боль постоянно; нет , я утрирую, конечно, но если учесть, что поездка на нем длится около часа, а без него вообще практически нельзя, то перспектива крайне сомнительная. И если лодка была приятно отлажена и с неё было легко стрелять, то тут уж нет. Эту хрень постоянно куда-то заносит, а в бою она эффективна только если давить ею врагов на полной скорости. А если Вы вдруг её загнали в воду, да поглубже — удачи, мужик, теперь выковыривай гравипушкой сие недоразумение. И создается впечатление, что ввели эту шнягу лишь бы растянуть игру на лишний час, но она и так ничерта не короткая, блин. Но все равно то, что дальше будет происходить в игре, полностью перекроет все эти негативные эмоции, ибо и грандфинал, и события, сопутствующие ему, будут иметь мегаэпичный размах, и никто не уйдет обиженным.

This is a game where you would see Source's great engine during 2004, with realistic physics mechanics, best graphics during 2004, outstanding level designs, and realistic facial muscles which makes the G-Man like a real person.

Half-Life 2's level design is amazing.
Of-course, the part where you experiment with the engine's physics and use them to get to your objective, Use those rolling blades to kill those zombies at Ravenholm; It makes you feel like your smarter than you actually are. That's what makes the game so great.

Half-Life 2's dialogue is top-notch.
Half-Life 2's dialogue actually makes sense to the story, important characters tell you what's going on, and references to Half-Life 1, to make it even more sense. Not like something that sounds cool but doesn't make sense to the story you are currently playing, and Not something that sounds boring.

Half-Life 2's modding support.
Ah yes, the modding support, which brings me to Steam. Well Steam made Half-Life 2 modding support now possible, you can now create source mods for the game, or seperate mods that you could just download for free on the Steam Store, well if you have the game of course.
If you have are a necrophiliac and enjoy this game aswell, you can download mods to fit your fetishes.
There are legendary mods like: MMod which makes Half-Life 2's gameplay even more modern, and graphical improvements. (highly suggest trying MMod.)

The story is even great.
Half-Life 2's story gives a great example of what more FPS games should create, not something that sounds too boring, or something that doesn't even make sense. Alyx, Kleiner, Barney, Eli, Mossman, and other characters in the game does an amazing job in each character's personality.

Conclusion.
The game is outstanding, it was way ahead of it's time, with very cool graphics, realistic physics and facial animations, and great dialogue into the game. The story is interesting and fun to see and learn, with endless characters making a icon into the game and definitely deserved a perfect cliffhanger for the Half-Life series. I wish I could rate this 11/10, it's just too perfect in my eyes. Collapse",10,0,0
14,Half-Life 2,geekslayer,"Aug 25, 2020","Плюсы:
- атмосфера игры держит в напряжении постоянно, не отпуская ни на секунду
- потрясающая графика на момент выхода. Заточенность под графические процессоры от ATI была новинкой в мире игр. Мимика персонажей и их лица вообще (как и модели) лучше, чем в Doom 3, а пейзажи, можно сказать, несколько выигрывают у Far Cry
- звук в игре заставляет прислушиваться ко всем мелочам
- физический движок Havoc - это нечто
Минусы:
- заскриптованная подача сюжета, всё очень линейно
- граната, брошенная в вертолет, застревает в крутящихся лопастях, а когда труп падает в воду, его кровь не растворяется в воде, окрашивая ее в розовый цвет, а пятном падает на дно
- самого главного героя (или даже часть его тела) не видно до конца игры. Если Гордон берет что-то в руки, то предмет зависает в некотором отдалении от него
В целом, отличный FPS для своего времени, но вряд ли его можно назвать революционным. Крепкая 8/10. Collapse",8,0,0

Firstly, The graphics, The graphics of this game is Good-looking maybe not the best by today standards but it's still good and the facial animations are nice to have, The level design on the other hand is more interesting, Sometimes you get stuck not knowing where to go? and sometimes you just have to stop and admire the brilliant level design, The voice acting is lower then normal only exception is G-Man his voice is just gorgeous, The story is pretty neat and the gameplay is unique, The guns are different from each other and each got Its own use case, The gravity gun is so awesome, and the vehicles that you can drive are well made, The AI is smart, For me the gameplay is the strong point in this game.

Valve clearly knows how to make a good and a bad game and this game is one of the good ones, maybe not the best but it's surely good.

Pros:
+ Neat story
+ Beautiful graphics
+ Smart AI
+ Awesome gameplay
Cons:
- Level design is sometimes confusing
- Voice acting is way less than I would expect from the company that made Portal (and any other story-based game)
- Some weird bugs overall Collapse",8,0,0

41,Half-Life 2,drcoomer,"Aug 11, 2020","Half Life 2 is truly the epitome of what an FPS should be. From start to finish, this game is a masterpiece that even exceeds a lot of recent games. Between it's way-ahead-of-its-time graphics, amazing level design, and exhilarating gameplay, Half Life 2, even 16 years after release, still sets the bar high for all future games.

Graphics: 9/10
HL2's graphics still hold up pretty well in 2020. This game is designed beautfiully, and there's an extremely unique atmosphere that you feel as soon as you step into City 17. I remember playing the Orange Box as a kid, and thinking to myself ""There's NO WAY graphics can get any better than this."" Well, I was certainly wrong there, but that doesn't take away from the timeless look that Valve gave us.

Narrative: 9/10
Gordon's journey is a blast to experience. I think the story is very well-written, creatively playing off the events of HL1, while also expanding the environment and establishing its own identity. It may have a couple sluggish moments here and there, but for the most part, the action keeps on rolling with ease.

Protagonist: 10/10
The ever-silent Gordon Freeman, never change.

Characters/Interactions: 10/10
There is a plethora of supporting characters, both good and bad, that drive this story forward. In addition, interacting with the now-friendly Vortigaunts is a nice touch. And the Alyx and Dog combo provides some of the game's most cheerful moments.

Gameplay: 10/10
I can't find one thing to complain about here. The level design in this game is insane. The horror-themed Ravenholm is one of my favorite parts of the entire story. Same with the long Highway 17 cruise through the Antlion infested coast. Per usual, Half Life utilizes some unique puzzles and platforming that are sure to test your brain power. But the real highlight here is the Gravity Gun. It is by far the most fun weapon to use, and it really elevates this game to the next level.

68,Half-Life 2,WHITESIXOMAR,"Apr 18, 2022","What a masterpiece. I considered myself as a casual gamer until half life one, I was a teen in 1998. That was the 1st time I took interest in a video game story, searched the internet for answers about XEN, black mesa, Gordon freeman and if valve was planning to continue this exciting venture.

When Half life 2 was released in 2004, the engine, gameplay mechanics & storytelling was WAY ahead of its time, I must have completed the campaign several times by then. The whole thing was mind-blowing. Then, I became a passionate gamer.

If we rate games in the context of when they were released, then we can all agree Half Life 2 is the best game ever. But, if we compare a game released in 2004 with games released almost 20 years later, there is no way to say it is the best game ever. Many modern games took the valve guidelines and created games that surpass HL2 in every way. We all valve lovers must admit to that.

I've been a Valve fan since 1998. But there is something that I will never accept from them: their communication style. After the cliffhanger at the end of EPISODE II they got us all hooked asking for more, and they promised more. I understand from what was disclosed that they tried a couple of projects and nothing worked, so they abandoned it. But instead of telling us the truth, they kept us wishing for something that they knew they were not going to release. They even got mad at the gaming press, or they got awkward when asked about EPISODE III. This was like seeing my role model do something ethically wrong. I will never accept the way they chose to manage the situation by simply acting like nothing happened. We are making tons of money with steam, so don't bother us with half life questions.

О серии Half-Life наслышаны все, как минимум из-за того, что миллионы игроков ожидают выхода третьей части. Почему же эта серия в прошлом заняла особое место в пантеоне хороших игр? Попробуем разобраться.

И сегодня речь пойдёт именно о второй части серии, т.к. она является наиболее популярной. Roleplay проекты, фанатские модификации и переиздания - всё это признак того, что игра жива и любима.

Действие сюжета происходит спустя несколько лет после событий первой части. Из-за мощного резонанса на Землю хлынули пришельцы, прозванные Альянсом. И именно борьбой с захватчиками мы будем заниматься в лице молчаливого Гордона Фримена. По пути нам встретятся как старые знакомые, так и новые союзники и враги. Сценаристы затронули тему любовных отношений между Гордоном и его подругой Аликс, которая заполучила собственную игру в VR. Сюжет всё также полон нераскрытых загадок и мелочей. Если подвести итог по этой части, то за повествованием интересно наблюдать.

Теперь игровой процесс. Подобного рода игры я описываю именно как ИГРА.

Можно проходить различные участки уровней совершенно разными способами, ровно как и вести борьбу с врагами. В наличии имеется несколько видов вооружения: от классических SMG и револьверов, до фантастических лазерных винтовок. Это всё поможет сражаться с обычными врагами и монстрами, а вот ПТУРС пригодится для уничтожения высоких шагающих живых турелей. Кроме того, можно бросаться в противников предметами, ставить мины и загораживать им путь, дабы дать себе время для отступления.

По ходу игры нам придётся побывать в разнообразных локациях. Пустынные пляжи, закрытые бункеры, заброшенные города. И вечно Гордона преследует напасть. Но это не значит, что удача покинула его. По случайности за ближайшим углом оказывается высокий ящик или взрывная бочка, а в кустах спрятан вентиль от трубы. Всё это пригодится для того, чтобы обойти препятствие. Загадки эти просты, но интересны.

Отдельно хочется сказать про музыкальное сопровождение. Оно классное, задаёт ритм, но резко обрывается в самый неподходящий момент.

По сути, это всё, из чего состоит игра. Хороший сюжет, довольно устаревшие, но в то же время бессмертные механики, красивые локации. Шедевром явно не назвать, но играть и переигрывать всегда приятно и не надоедает. Collapse",8,0,0
77,Half-Life 2,ChierHu,"Feb 8, 2021","The games from this series are first-person shooter action games in which the player traverses a virtual world that seems to be vast but which in reality is confined to a narrow path. The whole story of Half-Life is told within the game. There are no cut-scenes that take the player out of the game, all dialogue is performed by characters inside the game, and the player can choose to listen or ignore them altogether. Half-Life has perfected the art of guiding the player through the game, creating a well-structured experience for him. The practice is often referred to as railroading; in this light, it is probably no coincidence that in Half-Life and Half-Life 2 the player arrives on a train. The disadvantage of railroading is that the player’s freedom is mostly an illusion. When players go in a direction that was not intended by the game, the illusion can break down very quickly. It takes a lot of design skill to prevent players from noticing the invisible boundaries that prevent the player from exploring in other directions. Collapse",9,0,0

I think you should go out and BUY THIS GAME! No? Because you are know nothing about Half-Life story. Please, buy this game. Collapse",10,0,0

According to all known laws
of aviation,

there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

The bee, of course, flies anyway

because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

Barry! Breakfast is ready!

Ooming!

Hang on a second.

Hello?

- Barry?
- Adam?

- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

Looking sharp.

Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

Sorry. I'm excited.

Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

A perfect report card, all B's.

Very proud.

Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unl Collapse",10,0,0

There are so many things that Half-Life 2 is known for; realistic graphics, meta narrative, excellent voice acting, flawless pacing, amazing story, memorable characters and so on. But one thing that i really think was revolutionary with Half-Life 2 was it playing with different genres and styles. Half-Life 2 carries many themes and concepts that were simply too much for a video game back in 2004, and i think that's what makes this brilliant sequel so special, for example Ravenholm is a example of what other countries can do to a nation, and how horrible and terrifying it is. City 17 is the symbol of many dictator countries, the final moments of the game are saying that it does not matter how much powerful you are, you're still being controlled. The game is showing how many countries make many promises with no value to them, a society that is rotting, a hero that is being controlled, a powerful open mind that has a weak body to protect it, a girl that is too rogue to be precise, and it is showing there is always a betrayer among us. Half-Life 2 dropped our jaws until Bioshock came and completely pulled it off. Half-Life 2 just like the original was a milestone in gaming, even if you don't like it you can say it was too deep and bold for its time. Collapse",10,0,0

Half-Life 2 talks about many themes and concepts but keeps them hidden for the player to explore and find them.

42,Half-Life 2,BFG-1337,"Apr 18, 2021","Half Life 2 isn't the best game ever or the best story ever, but what it is is the best balance between those two things in a very polished and great looking package (relative to release), even tho the graphics are outdated which only makes sense, it woulnt make sense if graphics werent outdated in such an old game, the graphics still hold up in a retro kind of way, game runs in 1080p, has nice Anti aliasing which is pretty cool.

Gameplay is not Deus Ex level, but it is very easy to get into (Hard to master?), the enemy AI is really smart on Hard difficulty, they do all kinds of flanking tactics and grenade flushing, they don't spam you with grenades, they use them tactically. Id say second best AI in a game - F.E.A.R being the number uno(To this day.... how funny)

Sound is like the graphics, holds up in 2021 but some sounds are from Half-Life(1998), but they are far between and very few of them, you dont notice them until you look for them. Some of the songs are timeless like ""Triage at dawn"" - recommend you look up that song and listen to it.

Level design, like the gameplay, it is not deus ex level of complexity, it works brilliantly for what it is, there are lots of secret stashes with ammo, medkids and so on. They really help out If you take the time to look for them.

Bottom line: This is a great polished game, It has lots of great polished features, physics interaction is a great addition even tho its a bit wonky at times, but its not a crucial part to the game where id chip away points for it, in fact you barely notice the physics bugs if you don't search for them.

9/10 - One of the best PC games, not the deepest gameplay ever but it is very polished and its great at what it does.

Well, the game suffers from spending too much time in single places. While there are lots of different and interesting areas, you end up spending too long in each of them, which leads to half of the chapters feeling like a drag.

50,Half-Life 2,HarborMan3838,"May 18, 2021","This review contains spoilers. I always thought what Half-Life 2 beta could have been but after studying it, i understood that it was a mess. The retail version of Half-Life 2 is by far considered to be one of the best video games ever made, alongside other notable titles like Bioshock and Halo but why few people still doubt the greatness of this game, my friend was a big fan of Half-Life and its novel-like story-telling but after playing the award-winning sequel he said he preferred the original... But why is that? Half-Life 2 tries so many different things and overall is a completely new and fresh experience. I bet for a casual fps player Half-Life 2 can be a bit too good, i always loved studying first-person video games as they offer the most immersive experience because you are in the shoes of someone who is responsible for everything that happens surrounds him, but what made Valve change the original Half-Life 2 that was more in favor with the original game? Because the beta version lacked consistency in its art style and Narrative, it contained less-interesting characters that were more of a symbol rather than a compelling character. There was still the connection between the narrative and the concepts that they were going to put in the environments but The Final Half-Life 2 was a product of precise pacing, structured narrative, compelling characters, a more relatable world that has its own unique concepts and a better story in my opinion. Half-Life 2 is one of the best video games that inspired the whole industry to approach a more serious take on the narrative and characters they put into their video games. Collapse",10,0,0
51,Half-Life 2,SadenRedTT63,"May 20, 2021","Half-Life 2 will be a surprising experience for every first-person shooter fan out there. Half-Life 2 simply raised the bar and showed how complicated a video game can be. All the characters were compelling, they had meaningful interactions with each other, the gameplay felt so varied, the story felt different than any other video game that had been released until that point; the voice acting was beyond good and the dialog was simply unrivaled at the time. Half-Life 2 presented a perfect interactive experience that explored different genres, themes and designs all in one game. Valve made several genius decisions with the game like making your arsenal a bit smaller by adding the gravity gun, deviating from the horror genre and going into a more mature style, focusing alot on facial animations to make the characters as realistic as possible, making the gameplay as varied as possible so there will always be something new for the player, making the story-telling more complex, adding compelling characters with different personalities and attitudes that interact with each other through expertly-written dialog moments. The script felt as coherent as possible, the game had form and structure and the direction was so smart. One of the best video games of all time, Half-Life 2 surpassed the original in every aspect.

55,Half-Life 2,Politicalgamer7,"May 26, 2021","This review contains spoilers. Half-Life 2 went beyond my expectations, i always tend to keep my expectations moderate, but for a sequel with a Half-Life name on it, my expectations are definitely going to be high and Half-Life 2 surpassed those even.
Even considering today's standards, Half-Life 2 is a classic all the way, Having the most advanced story, narration and gameplay back in the day, Half-Life 2 amazed even the ones not involved in the video game industry. Half-Life 2 was ten years ahead of its time and today, it is even better than many of the shooters out there because what Half-Life 2 wanted to be was the most revolutionary video game ever made and to be honest at the time it was the most revolutionary game ever made, and today Half-Life 2 is perfection of all the elements that a video game needs to have to be called a masterpiece. In my opinion Half-Life 2 went beyond a video game and became an unforgettable work of art and you might ask how? there are some reasons:
1. Adding multiple genres and themes to one story. The story-telling aspect of Half-Life games simply makes each game a closet filled with plotlines and concepts. 2. Mature and disturbing ideas that are gut-wrenching even today.

3. A sense of Isolation and terror, always being worried that you are going to lose this war, the sun is bright but people are dying every second. 4. Dictation and considering yourself a higher mind, Breen wasn't a bad person but his idiotic mind map ruined him. The delusion that being the administrator of a secret big science team makes him the admistrator of a whole nation ruined him in his ideas and beliefs.

5. Artistic areas and level design, Valve is a completionist and purist, they tend to spend a lot of time researching around their levels and mythologies behind them and that's what makes their levels more like a playground rather than a level, their whole loading technology makes this game more like an adventure.
At the end Half-Life 2 is one of the best out there and FOR ME the best video game ever made. Collapse",10,0,0

Half-Life 2 shocked the world when it came in 2004, it demonstrated how deep and thoughtful a video game can be. From its music to gameplay to characters and setting, Half-Life 2 evoked a sense of uniqness that no other game had captured before, but if you played the game, you would still say that the game is in the same universe as the original Half-Life. Half-Life 2's level design broke new grounds in terms of how developers approached level design in video games, its influence is clearly visible in the titles that came after it. The gameplay is still simple but more complex than the original. This time instead of shoving new weapons down your throat, Valve came up with something that changed weapon design forever: THE GRAVITY GUN. Half-Life 2 played with different themes like Survival Horror, revolution, mystery, alienation, colonialism and etc. It's so fascinating how much content and detail a single video game can pack into its narrative and present all of them via groundbreaking story-telling methods. Half-Life 2 was great and surprised the whole world and showed how video game sequels should be. It set a new standard for video game sequels that hasn't been broken yet. Half-Life 2 might lack the classic charm of the original Half-Life but it certainly offers its own unique taste. My only complaint with the sequel might be the A.I, because some enemies are not as much fun to fight compared to Half-Life and your allies sometimes act a bit stupid but that's okay, Half-Life 2 definitely made up for that little mistake. The game is more complete and coherent than the original game, although the pacing might feel a bit off but the depth and charm of the story will certainly make you forget about that.

The troubled development of Half-Life 2 is known and studied alot by video game enthusiasts and it's no secret. Valve wanted to create the most ambitious video game ever sequel ever made. The different themes and styles the game went through, huge ambitions to make the best pc video game ever...
But how the shipped game turned out? We're going to find out soon.
From the start Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 proves it's a sequel to the original by putting you right in another train... But now to City 17. As you walk out of the train you hear a man talking and embracing the ridership but as people go to the city's entrance they are met by guards who abuse them, this is one of Half-Life 2's brilliance. The warm welcome contrasts with the real life, this is when you realize there's something wrong. Half-Life 2's story needs your full attention to be understood. You don't know how many years have past since the original game or what is happening.
Half-Life 2's gameplay is even more satisfying to play and Valve improved the balance between the weapons a lot. Half-Life 2's levels are genuine. They are skillfully-designed, filled with secrets and they evoke a sense of wonder. Half-Life 2 did what a sequel should do and even went beyond that and it is truly the best pc video game ever made.

Well my friends, yes, we are talking out probably the most ambitious video game sequel ever made. Half-Life 2 exactly did whatever Half-Life did for first-person shooters in the 90's but this time for modern games. Before Bioshock, The Last of Us, Dishonored and even Portal, Half-Life 2 carved a legacy that haunted video games and video game sequels for years ; it drew an standard that hasn't been broken yet. My professional review of this game might take hours to write and edit here but hear my words; Half-Life 2 will surprise you and leave wanting more for eternity, that's how much good this game this.
Like after watching The godfather Part II, we all wanted to see a proper ending to Michael's story and arc but we never did, i mean... we did but 16 years later and yet we are all still waiting for a title to wrap up the philosophical action-packed story of the legendary Half-Life saga.

64,Half-Life 2,CosmosGamer27,"Jul 17, 2021","This review contains spoilers. It's rare for a game to make me play it twice in a row because that means there's something special about it; Half-Life 2 was one of those games.
Although Half-Life 2 started really slow compared to Half-Life, its pacing and presentation makes up for it. In a matter of moments, you are introduced to an entire new world that looks and feels nothing like the Black Mesa Research Facility. There are new characters, some old ones and new npcs. Half-Life didn't have that much dialog for it to become a heavy character-driven story but Half-Life 2 changes that by introducing several layered and complex characters that have outstanding words of dialog. Half-Life 2 respects the players intelligence and let's the player himself unravels the mystery and reality behind events. Just like the previous game Half-Life 2 squeezes some very minor humor that feels real and humane alongside some very dark and serious moments and that enough shows Half-Life 2's brilliant writing.
If you thought the original title's gameplay was kickass and engaging, well, Half-Life 2 will even surpass that. By the time this game came, there were no other video game that felt as immersive and adventurous as Half-Life 2. One thing that i forgot to mention in my Half-Life review was that Marc Laidlaw (the genius writer behind the games) wrote the game in a way and shape that feels like one coherent plot. Half-Life 2's sophisticated story-telling might confuse you at first but for the people who don't care, the gameplay will certainly engage their brain in some very tight and challenging situations.
Half-Life 2's legacy can be seen at many other video games like The Last of Us, Bioshock, Counter-Strike, Red faction and even Dishonored. It's funny how Valve presented a video game that felt more real and complex than any other action adventure movie Hollywood made since 70's. Half-Life 2 was one of those video games that poked at other industries and said just take a look at this franchise and you won't look away.
The graphics and visuals aged like a fine wine if you play on a mid-range or higher computer these days, you won't even feel this game is from 2004.
I can say alot about this masterpiece but let me make it easier for you, go play the first two Half-Life games and experience probably the best first-person shooter experience that is out there or maybe some of the best video games ever made. My final score: 10/10 Collapse",10,0,0
65,Half-Life 2,EatmeApart881,"Jul 20, 2021","Although i enjoyed the first game a bit more Half-Life 2 managed to surpass its predecessor in almost every way. The only thing that Half-Life 2 might have failed at was a less impressive AI for both enemies and allies compared to the first game but everything else is done to perfection. Nothing is perfect but Half-Life 2 feels like one of those games that gets everything right. From the story to the gameplay, Half-Life 2 feels like an artistic work that benefited from a lot of dedication and care. I didn't encounter one single glitch or bug in this game.
Half-Life 2's opening sequence (just like the first game) is also one of the best video game intros ever made; from that point, you're in for a great and meaningful journey.
It's funny that while i was playing Half-Life 2 it reminded of many other games like Bioshock or The Last of Us but in reality those games were inspired by Half-Life 2. This game's legacy is so rich and well-known that doesn't need more explaining.

When Half-Life 2 came i was in college and didn't basically have enough money to buy a new computer for playing it. I had my previous desktop for 8 years and its hardware was so old for playing Half-Life 2 at the time. I asked my parents for a new computer but i got rejected. So during 2004's summer i worked my ass to get some money by the end of october i had enough money to get a new computer and with a little help from my parents i bought a new desktop for Christmas and immediately started playing Half-Life 2 during the holiday. It was staight up the best time that i had in the world. Half-Life 2 genuinely surprised me to the point that i preferred it to the original halfway through the game. The new setting, characters, story and gameplay just surpassed the original in every imaginable way. Each chapter gave me a different feeling and mood just like the original. The world of Half-Life 2 is probably the best video game world ever created because it's so realistic and has so much character and identity built into it; it feels like valve creates the whole game based on the narrative structure and story and that's what makes Half-Life 2 so good because you feel there's a sense of story in each and every part of the game.

1,Half-Life 2,KolesAdlerov,"Sep 14, 2022","Stereotypes about the ""masterpiece"" of HL2 (2004, not a modern one), like a litmus test, showed how poorly the average user thinks and how easy it is to make ""everyone recognized 10/10"" out of nothing. This is a half-baked sandbox with a lot of lazy conventions, huge empty spaces (often without a sane background) and COMPLETELY disabled enemy AI on cheap scripts. Also, Helicopter Bosses with infinite mines, oppressive one-hole gameplay in vehicle missions and hordes of useless friendly NPCs from the CallOfDuty circus.

* Manhack drones in collectors ARE EXTREMELY GOOD. Headcrab Shells on civilians ARE dramatically GOOD. The tunnels before the Citadel don't look too bad, to be honest (better - in Episode One).

Physics - just a HAVOK-engine with issues when three bricks balance the protagonist on a swing. Puzzles are squalid in most.
Graphics - good water, but FarCry1 is already there; not bad flames, but Unreal2 is already there; poor empty landscapes; awkward architecture with cheap textures; bad models and body-textures except for 2-3 faces; bad animations except for 2-3 faces.
Story - the plot is not revealed, means ""mocking_disregard""; characters are flat; feigned dialogues are just disgusting. First part of walkthrogh is boring, second part is more sickening than CallOfDuty. Look, out of a 5h30mins walktrough in total - 35mins of Airboat-mission, 35mins of Buggy-mission (and the Bridge), only 20mins of Ravenholm, 35mins of Prison_CoD_bullsh!t, 1h15mins of Urban_CoD_bullsh!t and 25mins of Citadel.

Gameplay:
combat mechanics [**] 7/10
combat logic [scripts out of logic + the Gravity Gun nonsense] 4/10
atmosphere (Ravenholm and Citadel only) 7/10

Story [*] 7/10

Graphics [*] 9/10

Sounds & music [good standalone music, but stupid annoying sounds and warnings] 8/10

It's main downside is how linear it is. It should be like the original, where you had certain liberties that can make someone's experience somewhat different that someone else's, but they wouldn't alter the game enough for it to be extremely different, for example, in the first game, you could find certain weapons earlier. In the sequel, the only thing you will get if you try to deviate from the already set path, you will get some hp back and some ammo. (also you could kill friendly npcs in the original but i don't want to seem like a psycho) Other than that, it's a game worth your time and i believe that everyone should play this game at least once.

It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard

In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter Collapse",10,0,0

38,Half-Life 2,VirtualAK,"Aug 27, 2022","This one game already deserves a 10 without me explaining why. But I am going to anyway. About 4 years ago, I finally got the chance to play Half-Life 2 after being introduced to every other major game/franchise made by Valve when I started my Steam account and the game is really good. After I played through the game, I started noticing how a lot of games take influence from not only Half-Life 2 but the game engine made for it, the Source engine. Legit, almost every single thing in modern gaming can be traced back to this game and it's influence it made back when it was released (okay, maybe not the microtransactions but everything else, yeah). I recently played through the game again and I felt the same enjoyment I felt 4 years ago. Sometimes I didn't even need to actually play the game to feel enjoyment, I could just stand around doing nothing and still feel a sense of happiness. Overall, I think this game has withstood the test of time and will continue for years to come. The game does have some issues but for a 1st attempt at a sandbox action game like this, I appreciate what the game sets out to accomplish. In terms of the DLC (or Expansions if you wanna call it that), I think they are good as well. I just wish they didn't cancel the expanded storyline they had setup. Deathmatch and Lost Coast were a bit fun to explore but nothing else to really say. Once you play 5 minutes of both, you'll know everything these two side games have to offer. And I actually went back to play the original Half-Life and that too has some good things going for it (but to be honest I prefer Black Mesa, the unofficial remake of Half-Life but you can still buy it on Steam for $19.99). So yeah, play Half-Life 2 when you get a chance as it will not only serve as a welcome introduction into Steam but also a lot of video games. Anyways, thanks for reading. Peace out. Collapse",10,0,0

I liked the story, the enemy AI is fantastic and very challenging, and the setting and places are extremely well done: you can see how much time they put into this game. But still...I hated few things. For example, the jumping parts: you can easily lose health by jumping 1 cm more higher than normal (and we talk about 10 hp or more), and so you'll sometimes HAVE TO use ladders or avoid crazy jumps which, in many games, won't harm you. Even if the AI is challenging, some enemies are just far too hard in my opinion and sometimes the game becomes very unbalanced (the soldiers were the hardest m------ers I've ever beaten, while all the other aliens were easier, even the biggest ones). Add also that the explosions are very big, meaning that you can still get hit even if you're far at times (I got hit also when I was hiding behind crates, not too far away, while I shot at some bombs attached to the wall...this still scarred me). And, if I have to be brutal, some parts looked unneccesary and to me they looked like ""add ups"" instead of real continuation.

70,Half-Life,Foam,"Jan 24, 2013","I'll never forget half life. It played a large part in defining my science fiction existence. No FPS had been anything like it before. This was largely in part due to scripted sequences. Instead of cutscenes, things actually played out infront of your eyes while you were still playing. It set the standard that nearly all games followed since then. The levels were also ingenius. Each level was its own separate level, but designed in a way to look like it was seamless. Level A would end in a hallway, a loading bar would pop up while it loaded level B, with the beginning of Level B looking just like that hallway. It gave a sense that you were never really removed from the game world.

The storytelling was great as well. Instead of just being overloaded with cheesey information, you start off simply as a regular scientist working in a secret underground research facility somewhere in the south US known as Black Mesa. While performing a landmark experiment despite safety concerns from officials, you accidentally open a portal to an alien world. This experiment causes a ""resonance cascade effect"" (whatver that means) which causes temporal rifts to open throughout the entire facility, warping in hostile alien forces. The entire game is a story about surviving against all odds. The plot thickens even further as US Special forces are sent in. When you first see them you think ""Awesome, backup!"" but soon find out they aren't there to rescue you: they're there to destroy you & all the evidence with it.

It thickens even further when you advance through the game, you hear the Special forces are pulling out because its too much for even them to handle and you get the hint they are about to nuke the entire facility into oblivion.

One of the reasons the storyline is so great is because its so plausible. The actions from the scientists to the Special forces makes sense. If Half Life actually happened, it would very likely play out something like the game. Nothing turns me off more than an implausible story.

From the scripted sequences of scientists screaming by on a falling elevator, survivors in vents scared out of their minds, half life delivers an incredible variety of experiences. Action, suspense, hopelessness, triumph, uncertainty. While playing, you really couldn't predict what would happen next which is always one of the signs of a good story.

It also used a physics engine that was the best of its time and an AI that performed far better than any other. Almost everything you could want is here: a good variety of environments, some satisfying puzzles, and some challenging combat.

This is perhaps even more fun than the game itself, if such is possible. HL2 was really cool, but HL1 was most definitely the best, most long-lasting fun I ever had. Collapse",10,1,1

5,Half-Life,DemonicAngel,"Feb 9, 2004","Just for the fact that it showed the FPS genre was capable of much more than Quake and the like were able to deliver, I award Half-Life a 7. Now let's get down to business. The game is unfortunately very uneven, and whilst the first half is excellent, I soon found myself losing interest around the middle section of the game. The pacing really starts to suffer around this point,with too many sections where it's very unclear what you're supposed to be doing. The story, for a game that recieved so much praise for its ""deep"" storyline, is not developed nearly enough - we're left with just ""experiment goes wrong, aliens appear, government soldiers arrive to cover it up, and you have to do something about it all"", and that's more or less it. Now System Shock 2, that was a game with a fully-developed backstory that you could really sink your teeth into. With Half-Life, the story was mostly irrelevant and in itself provided little incentive to continue. In addition, the final couple of stages are nothing less than ridiculous. So overall, a game that heralded a (brief) new era for the FPS genre, but didn't quite live up to its own hype. Collapse",7,1,1

Half-Life casts you as Gordon Freeman, a scientist working at Black Mesa Research Facility. When an experiment goes wrong, creating a gateway to another planet, bringing in alien creatures, you have to fight your way through a horde of monsters and soldiers to the surface and eventually to the exotic planet Xen.

The Graphics for the time were amazing, now days they aren't very special but i'd give them a 10 out of 10 like they were given back in 1998. The sound is really good for the most part, there are a few lines of dialogue from people that sound to fake, but as for alien howls and guns going off there great. 9.5 out of 10. As for the game play its very good for the most part. The wide variety of enemies from small little headcrabs to soldiers working as a team are great, a few boss fights and platforming sections later in the game bring this score down to a 9.7 out of 10. The final part for my review is the story and what a story it has. While i wont go to deep into a detail about it, here is a small rundown aliens are attacking earth and you need to escape the base black mesa.

The best thing about Half Life was it's unique atmosphere which every element of the game contributed to.,9,1,1
12,Half-Life,luminites,"Jul 24, 2013","I first bought this game because I heard so many good things about it that I HAD to see it for myself. The first thing that hit me (playing it in 2013) was the graphics (produced 1998). I laughed a bit at the graphics at the beginning, but I don't think I thought about them again after the 10 minute mark. At all. I became so immersed in the story that I didn't have any spare thoughts to give. I launched it expecting to play an hour, but was surprised when 3 o'clock rolled around and I hadn't eaten anything! The very next day, I started it up telling myself I wouldn't let that happen again. The story kept my full attention and I had to be called for dinner. At that moment I realized, after making me do nothing but game on that one game all day, two days in a row(which I try never to let happen), that Half Life was exactly what everyone told me it would be. After thinking about it for a bit, I have decided that it is one of the best single-player games I have ever played, if not for but everything other than the graphics (which doesn't even matter, after one stops obsessing over them and remember exactly when it was made).

One thing that I was really impressed about was the variety of weapons one found. For me, in different situations I liked to whip out Weapon X to confront Guy A and then switch to Weapon Y to finish off Alien B, or altogether stay back and pick them off with Weapon Z. I also impressed with the amount of ammo you get throughout the duration of the game. Half Life seems to give you just enough ammo for Favorite Gun X that you have to pick and choose when you want to use it while still allowing you to use it when you want without fear that you will be left defenseless. I leaves you with exactly enough to get by a point in the game to make you FEEL that you might run out.

My favorite thing about Half Life is its adrenaline moments. This game keeps you on your feet the entire time. Aliens can teleport in at any time, you walk around a corner and you are assaulted on all sides, an unseen headcrab jumps at your face, something completely unexpected happens. You can never take any little task for granted in this game; if something happens normally a two or three times, its a prime target for some sort of unexpected jump.

The negative reviews seem to all say the same thing: Bad graphics, how they don't understand the story, and that the character movement is difficult to manage. To enjoy the game, you have to let go of the graphics. Simple as that. If you are one of those guys that won't even touch a game that has bad graphics, you can download Source SDK Base 2007 and the free mod Black Mesa (It is basically the same story, minor changes, newer graphics, but it is not made by Valve nor does it have the end portion of the game). The story is not exactly explained to you like a storyteller is explaining it to you, but instead you have to deduce from what you are asked to do in the game and the results of those actions what exactly is happening. If you did not understand why you did a certain task, I would suggest looking up the chapter you just completed (it says whenever you save on the list of loads which chapter you are on) on the internet. I know I missed at least one thing while playing this game, and it really helps keep the game enjoyable and understandable as you progress. Now, for some reason people are complaining about how hard it is to jump across a pit of *insert miserable object here* or how they can't use ladders, falling to their death in either case. This game does have its very short and subtle moments of parkour, but it is only difficult if you make it difficult. For these moments I can only tell you to jump at the last moment or look around to see if there is another way around/another jumping point. Lastly, the WASD keys are automatically set to a ""Run"" or ""Jog"" type of action. To climb down a ladder in real life, you wouldn't RUN down the ladder, would you? There is a ""Walk"" key--normally bound to SHIFT, where you can approach the ladder as one would in real life; walking carefully and accessing it full on and not an angle.

After addressing a good 80% of the reviews, lets take a look at the numbers now. As of today, 1826 people thoroughly enjoyed this game. 34 people were pretty OK with this game, but generally had some problems with it. 108 people (80 of which I have addressed) did not like the game at all. That leaves 28 people who just didn't like the game because they were not that into it legitimately (which I can totally accept). 28 out of 1968 people on Metacritic did not like this game for reasons that are unchangeable. If that trend continues for whoever reads this and is wondering if they should get Half Life, you have a 98.577% chance(1940 people who liked the game 1968 total people) of liking this game(rating it 5 or higher) or a 92.785% chance (1826 people 1968 total people) of enjoying this game a lot(rating it a 7 or higher). I'd say those are good odds. Collapse",10,1,1

18,Half-Life,TheUnbeholden,"Apr 22, 2014","What Half-Life does well is tell a story through action
HL has no cutscenes because cutscenes are the opposite of action, they are inaction because it takes control away from the player.

One of the key features of a ""Rail Shooter"", go from point a to point b with few diversions & no backtracking.
Rail Shooter as in like a train, you always keep moving.
Valve knows that backtracking gets frustrating faster than anything else, and is the most artificial way to enhance difficulty (hell increasing the damage the player takes is a better way if only marginally).
Valve is also fond of vent crawling and puzzles which I've never seen much appeal in apart from the initial novelty of vent crawling.

Apart from being very moddable and userfriendly,
Half-Life also does something incredibly well that has helped modders improve their own skills, and thats level design. Each place in the game looks hand crafted. No copy and pasting of sections or randomization here! It also knows how to be challenging without throwing tons of enemies at you, and thats with good enemy placement as well as knowing when to give the player rewards (weapon/ammo/health placement).

21,Half-Life,MasteRR,"May 3, 2013","Half-Life is one of the best games ever made.

The action is set in the fictional Black Mesa Research Facility, where the player takes the role of Doctor Gordon Freeman, a Ph. D, MIT Theoretical Physics scientist.
So the beginning is nothing really special, but the action itself begins only after the disaster.
After being late, Gordon steps in his HEV Suit MK IV, and enters the chamber where they test a special crystal from a borderworld called Xen.

During the preparations, the scientist make a mistake by settings the Anti-Mass Spectrometer at 105% causing malfunction, and after inserting the crystal in the spectrometer, everything goes wrong.
The machine doesn't respond and in the same time numerous alien creatures enter Earth and the facility through outnumbered portals opened during the incident.

After this Gordon must fight his way outside the facility, which is a hard job after the facility goes infested with aliens, and even more, zombies.

After seeing the disaster, the Marines are called to ,,clean,, the mess, and destroy the facility. Until the end of the game, Gordon rapidly becomes the prime target for the marines, who now must eliminate him, considering that the mess is only his fault, and eventually temporary captures him.

During the game, Gordon must solve puzzles, and is also helped on his way by security guards and scientist pinned down in the facility.

Until the end, Gordon makes his way in a last refuge of the remaining science team, where he finds out that the rocket(that he previously launched) didn't make full effect, and the portals were still kept opened from the other side.

As I already gave some spoilers, I won't reveal the next parts.

The game play is just pure awesomeness.

Gordon uses many real weapons such as mp5, 9mm Glock Pistol, Spas-12 Shotguns and others, to fight his way out the facility.

The AI is really good, the enemies aren't blindly attacking the player and other suicidal things, and using their own tactics to stop the player.

The game features some scripted sequences, that makes the game feel more cinematic, but not a ridiculous amount, and just where needed.

Also the game itself is linear, so there aren't many places you can miss during the game, but there are some, and still, even so, the game feels fluent, and the story doesn't really seem to be forced.

But even so, the game has a great replay value, and has a real memorable journey.

The graphics aren't ground-breaking, but even nowadays looks kind of decent, but outdated compared to others.

The game also features an both integrated, and separate multiplayer(the separate one is called Half-Life: Deathmatch), with no kind of plot, separate from the story, just in the same universe and just for fun, by being able to nuke some maps, where you must get in time inside the protected place to not get killed, but the game can also contain and be played on coop maps, in which you must complete the map's objective, solve puzzles, but also kill enemies here and there to progress.

Also due to the very friendly engine, the game can be very easily modded, by adding new maps, re-create the original weapons, sounds and more, or even make separate mods from the original game, which led to the creation of one of the biggest modding communities, most notable mods being Sven Co-Op, Black Operations, Life's End, but many many others.

There game also inspired a re-creation, called Black Mesa, being a total Source recreation of the original game, with same levels, but better physics, and graphics.

So my final word for the game is that is a masterpiece, with very little flaws(this ones being only bugs and minor glitches), and deserves to be played numerous times. Collapse",10,1,1

It's a really old game now but honestly, the graphics will always be good enough to stand the test of time. You are alone most of the time, and the game can be a little scary at times, I was too scared to play it when I was a kid (lol), but it shouldn't be a concern for any grownup. I will admit the last few chapters don't quite hold up to everything else beforehand, but they're still decent; and the conclusion of the game doesn't disappoint, it's quite mysterious (and a cliffhanger). The game is a 10/10 for people like me, but I don't expect everyone to feel the same way, because there's not much story, it's 99% action. Regardless, it's a must-play. Collapse",10,1,1

Despite being dated (1998) the graphics are amazing for their time, and despite the textures on the original not being high-resolution, the game still scales to 1080p perfectly and remains crisp and sharp. Although the textures themselves are obviously dated, the atmosphere that the team have created for Half-Life is wonderful. The into cinematic scene is still possibly the best introductory sequence of any game ever to date. It draws you into the world that is Half-Life, and you feel right at home from the start. The characters speak with you, address you by name, involve you in conversations among themselves, and even those who are not needed for the game to proceed will acknowledge you; something even most modern titles fail to do. The story-telling is excellent, moving transitionally from chapter to chapter without the need for annoying cut-scenes or sequences or flashbacks. Because of this, you're truly immersed in the gameplay since you are never distracted or removed from the first-person view at any time. The dialogue is incredible, the story is immaculate, and the gameplay is fantastic. The puzzles, enemies, friends and allies, and sound effects, the charm; this game set the bar for almost every first person shooter. The only thing which makes this game sub-par to Half-Life 2 is two minor things; the graphical limitations (which I know is unfair, since we are comparing a 6-year technology gap) and the controls. The control system itself is fine, but the movement can at times be notoriously difficult as there is no option to move slowly. Also, targeting small enemies can be difficult with firearms weapons at times. These are so minor, that it is not enough to shave a mark off the final score, as this game is near-on perfect.

Year Of Release: 1998
Date Of Release: November 8

Introduction-When Half-Life was released in late 1998 it shocked the world, and it changed first person shooters forever. No other FPS game at the time had a decent enough story, proper voice acting and a realistic atmosphere but Half-Life did that and it became a game that would still be played to this day and was so successful it sprung a sequel. Half Life really is a brilliant game, not in its ageing graphics, not in its poor voice acting but how good it is gameplay wise.

Plot Summary: You are a scientist called Gordon Freeman you work at a top secret facility called Black Mesa Research Facility. Today you have a special experiment. You enter the test chamber, As you place the specimen into the scanning beam it all goes wrong. Aliens start teleporting all over the facility and kill anything they see Gordon takes matters into his own hands, for his own survival.

Gameplay: You have a range of weapons under you disposal all the weapons in Half-Life have a good use, unlike most FPS games. There are plenty of clever puzzles which most FPS games lacked, even now FPS games don't have proper puzzles. A useful addition is the duck jump which is used well in Half-Life. These additions were very welcoming considering the usual find a key next door and then the next door to the exit. But this was a more realistic approach.

Switching a fire chamber on to burn a giant monster, turning on a generator to electrocute a big alien this is the kind of thing FPS was hungry for and Half-Life proved that adding these environments and goals would make a realistic, puzzling atmosphere.

Music: There is not much of a musical score in Half-Life in fact there is not theme song. But when you do hear a song in game, its tense or a fast paced action song.

AI: The AI was perfect for the day and there still hold up good today but the AI really was clever in Half-Life which most FPS lacked back in the day.

Conclusion should I buy it or not?

The answer is obviously yes! Without a doubt Half-Life is truly a fantastic game. Its a must have! You will have a very nostalgic and fulfilling adventure you have ever had from a FPS game. Its a great classic that still holds up today it has everything a FPS needs you will not be disappointed.I rate it a solid...

52,Half-Life,M3R1D1U5,"May 20, 2018","Sin más ni menos, el juego de mi vida. No se engañen, mi playtime es aparentemente poco porque no fue sino hasta hace unos días que finalmente compré el juego en steam, sin embargo, tengo más de diez años jugándolo constántemente.

Podría ponerme a listar la serie de elementos que hacen a HL1 una obra maestra absoluta del pc-gaming, sin embargo este análisis se prolongaría demasiado. Para evitar dicho exceso me limitaré a mencionar los elementos que el juego graba en la memoria a través de un diseño increíblemente exquisito y elegante.

El level design es una maravilla, no sólo por las diferentes capas de verticalidad fotorrealista que dotan a Black Mesa de una sensación de plausibilidad sumamente difícil de encontrar en los videojuegos, sino por la ilusión de continuidad. Half-Life está segmentado por capítulos, dichos capítulos llevan al jugador a través de la mayoría del complejo (quedarían zonas sin explorar que serían retro-conectadas a través de las expansiones) continuas, separadas por pantallas de carga de apenas unos segundos y manteniendo el escenario tal y cómo el jugador lo había dejado tras su paso, no sólo abarcando los objetos sino los mismísimos patrones de la inteligencia artificial.

Esto me lleva al siguiente punto:

La inteligencia artificial en Half-Life ha sido galardonada a lo largo de la historia por crear escuela en cuanto a AI Design, ejemplos notables de esta filosofía de diseño siendo el primer F.E.A.R., juego con un indiscutiblemente bien conseguido feel muy similar a las interacciones emergentes propuestas por Half-Life.

Además de esta sofisticada capacidad para la interacción emergente de las distintas inteligencias artificiales, cada patrón de comportamiento tiene características similares que dotan al mundo de un realismo impresionante. Desde cucarachas atraídas a los restos por un sistema de hedor, hasta los Houndeyes utilizando un sencillo pero eficaz (e impresionante de observar) sistema de manada; me atrevería a decir que es Half-Life el shooter lineal más inmersivo de la historia precisamente por ese amor al detalle puesto a cada una de las entidades del juego.

Y finalmente, la historia.

Marc Laidlaw relata la escalofriante travesía de un físico teórico egresado del MIT con guiños al terror clásico de diferentes escuelas, pasando por el cosmohorror más lovecraftiano, hasta el worldbuilding al estilo King (Marc Laidlaw afirma haber bebido directamente de la famosa novela The Mist para la concepción intelectual de Black Mesa) y la ciencia ficción pulp de los años cincuenta. Cero cinemáticas. Cero exposición. Un buen gusto que acojona.

Qué más decir de esta obra maestra. Juégalo, regala todas las copias que puedas y paga precio completo si estás dispuesto, veinte años después el juego sigue valiéndolo.

68,Half-Life,md5fungi,"Dec 3, 2019","From the moment it starts to the moment it ends, Half-Life is a wholly immersive experience.

The game eschews the use of cutscenes or narrative text, telling an unfolding story through the eyes of the voiceless scientist Gordon Freeman. While this style of cinematic storytelling is commonplace these days, in 1998, it was revolutionary.

The game begins as you arrive to work (late) via a subway tram. It seems to be just another day on the job until the experiment you run goes horribly wrong and Earth is overrun by vicious aliens.

As Freeman, you will navigate your way through the extremely large and complex Black Mesa complex, battling a variety of enemies and obstacles. Each level has a distinctly different central mechanic and theme, and the action never cuts away: the game is one long set piece, and this makes it all seem extremely real, even to this day.

Half-Life’s pacing is nearly perfect: after overcoming a certain type of combat encounter or series of obstacles, the game makes sure to mix things up or transition before you get too bored of it, for the most part. The major exceptions to this are an extremely long outdoor combat segment (which was still exciting throughout but had me anxious for the next level) and the penultimate chapter, which honestly felt like a slog compared to the rest of the game.

The game smartly alternates between intriguing platforming sections and charged combat situations, both of which have aged very well (for the most part) and are appropriately challenging. The game is also incredibly creative with combat. You’ll have to stealthily avoid the tentacles of a cranky alien beast, lure a large, menacing creature into an electric trap, and take potshots at enemies while riding down a high-speed rail cart. Every new chapter offers something fresh and exciting.

Even in 2019, the combat in Half-Life is frantic and appetizing. The more typical weapons pack a punch and give satisfactory feedback, while you’re treated to an array of more interesting weapons such as a couple experimental science-y guns, a homing rocket launcher, an alien limb, and a disturbingly manic beetle..

Despite everything great about Half-Life, it is far from perfect, especially in the current age of video gaming. As breathtaking as most of the game is, the pacing really suffers towards the end, as mentioned above. I was glad to get to the final boss encounter, but I did find it pretty frustrating compared to everything that came before. There’s very little margin for error, here. I would not say it was a complete letdown, but it was not the most enjoyable end to the game.

On the gameplay mechanics end of things, ladders can be a little sketchy: you may be quite certain you are on a ladder when the game thinks you aren’t, causing you to plummet to your death. Crouch-jumping is also somewhat awkward (by nature, honestly). Finally, not being able to quick-switch your weapons is pretty inconvenient: you’re forced to use the mouse wheel to switch between them, and then click again to select a weapon.

Aside from these minor quibbles, Half-Life is still a near-perfect and phenomenal first-person experience. It’s mind-blowing how well it stands up today, and I felt no lack of excitement and emotion playing through it decades later. Collapse",9,1,1

Half Life ha innovado en su genero, y eso hay que reconocerlo y respetarlo. Pero se mantiene para los estandares actuales? Bueno, por lo que puedo ver, Half Life 1 en parte se baso en Quake 2, y comparandolo con este juego, jugablemente es inferior. Me explico: Half Life 1 a veces abusa excesivamente de tiroteos fijos y saltos milimetrados bastante frustrantes que requieran muchos intentos para superar; te matan de una. Es mucho ensayo y error, y el personaje no se siente tan agil, se siente algo resbaladizo, especialmente a la hora de saltar y estar esquivando ataques. Las armas tampoco tienen mucha punteria, y con esto de las armas, puedo decir que en Quake 2 es mucho mas interesante y pulido el sistema de combate, ya que tampoco cuenta con inventario. Tambien el juego cuenta con algunos extraños bugs, como que a veces los NPC se traban o dejan de hablar de repente, y tengamos que cargar la partida para solucionarlo. Graficamente se ve muy bien para su epoca, pero la verdad es que Quake 2 lo supera, ya que sus mapas son mas grandes. En cuanto a los personajes, esto si que no se ve bien para estandares actuales, pero se lo perdono. Quitando todo lo malo, la historia y la ambientacion es lo que Half Life hace bien, y hace espectacularme bien! Ir yendo por tuberias, areas militares, laboratorios destrozados, la progresion se siente muy bien y es esto precisamente lo que ha hecho que Half Life sea considerado un juego que ha envejecido bien! Sin embargo, en los puntos negativos anteriormente mencionados es lo que hace que a algunos les parezca un juego algo anticuado. Este juego salio para PS2 y considero a esta como la versión definitiva del juego, ya que cuenta con mejores gráficos, pantalla dividida, el Half Life Decay y bugs solucionados. En resumen, Half Life 1 fue y sigue siendo un gran juego. No ha envejecido bien del todo, pero si ignoras esos problemas, te la pasaras muy bien.

What to say about half life? We all know it and we all played it. It is one of the revolutionary fps's that changed the gaming industry.

One of the things I really love about half life is there are no cutscenes. You all experience it from first person and Gordon doesn't speak so it really feels like you are really there. I have no problem with cutscenes but I am glad half life doesn't have them.

Hud is very simple. You got health, ammo, weapon and flashlight. And I love this simpleness. I don't need millions of icons in my screen.

Game also doesn't tell you where to go and what to do. You figure it out yourself. No hand holding, no arrow pointing, no objective marker. It makes you think. This is how it should be, atleast in linear games.

Sfx is something special to me. Every one of them. It is iconic and memorable.

The overall black mesa atmosphere is something unique. There are not much games that are placed on research facility and that is a shame. Level design is great.

Some people may say graphics are outdated and bad but I honestly see no problem with it. They look fine to me.

There are of course some problems:

Ladders are your worst enemies. Forget everything. Ladders are the actual villain in this game.

Some enemies are bullet sponges.

Ally AI pathfinding suck ass. They always stuck at some places and you need to be in certain position to make them move.

I hate Xen levels. Game not telling you not to do in previous levels are okay because they were linear and easy to understand but Xen is big alien planet and it is hard to navigate. And don't make me start on those alien controllers.

Other than those it is still enjoyable. Collapse",9,1,1

Well, yes.
Half-Life offers an experience that you won't ever forget. Half-Life was a serious risk in the 90's because Valve's ambitions were too high for the standards in those era.

Now, they were good for their time, but the AI was poor and both had next to no story and little interaction with the enviroment the player was placed in. Then comes Half-Life, and it features good AI and a storyline, plus interaction. With it's features many overlooked the fact that all were under-developed and the game was repetitive. My point is, it's only amazing due to the timing of it's release. A good game, just overated. Collapse",7,4,6

7,Half-Life,WPCritic,"Jan 25, 2013","I actually had a lot of fun with this game. The weapons are fair and the ammo consumption is enough to deter you from using the heavy weapons on grunts.

The only things keeping me from going higher than an 8 are the minor system discrepancies and the story. It was very confusing, but that's partially my fault for not wearing headphones. It's difficult to hear dialogue without headphones and lack of a captioning system makes it impossible to know what's going on if you're not wearing headphones.
The saving system is also hard to work with. There was no autosave feature, so I had to force myself to save every 5 minutes or so.
The last thing (I think this is really important) is the developer console. If you're familiar with the Source engine and the half life commands like I am, then it's just a few keystrokes to give you mac ammo/armor/health. With no achievements to deter the usage of ""sv_cheats 1"", this option is very appealing for those having trouble in the game.

Overall, I thought this game was great. I've replayed it about 5 times for a total of 6 playthroughs just because I like some of the combat in it. I would suggest buying this game at full price if you want it because it is worth full price. Collapse",7,2,4

But I love the character development such as G-Man and Alxy but the for the all the other character i don't care for.
But I love, and i mean love! The moded story's modes, such as Nightmare house 2. And the fantastic first person shooter war game Counter Strike. And the well respected Sandbox, Garry's Mod which is one of the most funniest game that i have ever played. Overshadowing Half-Life 2 its self. Which ruined my first play-through for me!

Those parts are long, boring, and frustrating due to the horrible controls. But the vehicle part of the game was only the first thing that made me hate it.
Then on top of that you have annoying characters. If it were possible, I would have killed all of my allies within the first 5 seconds of meeting any one of them. And believe me, I tried. Alex is the worst by far. Everyone is useless and annoying. Seriously, every five minutes it's ""Oh, look, Freeman's here. He'll do all of our work for us because we're lazy/incompetent/useless."" If I was Freeman, I'd just let everyone die. Or better yet, kill them all myself. The only thing that would get me to consider playing the sequels would be if I got to go on a murderous rampage killing all of my allies.

You waste more ammo than anything. With any automatic weapon, it seems that at best 1/3 shots hit their mark. It's impossible to aim with them because instead of your spray pattern being affected by how long you hold the trigger, it follows some kind of pattern. Your first shot might hit its target. It might not. It's horribly frustrating.

I bought the Orange Box back in January after hearing how great it was. Worst $50 I've ever spent, since the only good part of the whole thing is Portal.

Even though the game is a FPS, you spend most of your time jumping (and dying because of it) as well as doing other boring monkey business. NPCs are uninteresting, usually don't help that much and you really can't do much for them either, it's a badly implemented feature overall. The worst enemy is not a creature, it's the RLOD (red ladder of death) because of the poorly implemented controls in the game.

72,Half-Life,Broyax,"Jan 29, 2019","Un jeu qui a certainement marqué son époque dans le monde foisonnant des FPS, un genre à part entière devenu une mode effrénée en quelques années depuis Doom... j'ai l'impression que ça s'est bien calmé au fil du temps mais tout de même... Mais il faut dire que ce premier Half-Life propose une véritable histoire et pose de véritables questions qui motivent sans cesse le joueur à poursuivre son ""aventure"" ; en même temps, il distille quelques réponses qui amènent d'autres interrogations et ainsi de suite jusqu'au 2 puis jusqu'aux 2 épisodes addtionnels...

Et c'est comme ça et c'est pour ça qu'on attend toujours Half-Life 3... du moins certains et certains autres qui croient encore au père Noël ou aux soucoupes volantes. Personnellement, j'ai déjà donné (non pas aux soucoupes... quoique avec le père Mulder) de mon temps au Half-Life en son temps et si j'ai été saisi immédiatement par cette maîtrise de la narration, du tempo et des évènements, j'ai aussi subi avec mauvaise humeur pas mal des tics du jeu...

C'est sans doute à la fois une qualité et un défaut par exemple que de ne jamais lâcher la pression sur le joueur -ou à peine le temps de faire une pause- puis de le faire repartir au turbin, un décidément très sale boulot où l'on ne sait jamais ce qui va nous tomber sur le coin de la gueule... Il faut aussi réfléchir un brin pour se sortir de situations délicates et jouer à saute-mouton et/ou sauter sur des plate-formes et en plus, en plus... gérer ces sauts ""longs"" très casse-burnes. Ou gérer ses munitions selon les armes, car on manque toujours de munitions dans Half-Life, car ça ""augmente la tension"" dit-on !

Or le jeu est déjà assez flippant comme ça... Comme ces crabes qui te sautent à la gueule du début à la fin du jeu, ou la fin elle-même bien pénible (qui a eu raison de mes nerfs, là je crois) ou bien les **** bâtards qui se téléportent derrière toi... ou bien les forces d'intervention qui viennent en remettre une couche (encore une !) rien que pour toi ! comme si le monde entier qui part en morceaux n'était pas déjà suffisant pour ""t'occuper""...!

Intéressant donc le Half-Life mais également énervant et stressant. Hypnotisant, addictif aussi mais très fatigant... Aujourd'hui je ne pourrais plus le refaire, ça me casserait les couilles en moins de deux. Et puis le gameplay a vieilli... on ne veut plus d'aventure linéaire aussi longue même si on salue avec le recul cette mise en scène et ces scripts si inventifs pour l'époque ! Collapse",5,0,3
73,Half-Life,mr-NachoMen,"Nov 27, 2019","I've heard wonders about Half-Life for years (specially the second game), I've heard that is the best game ever created and stuff like that and I never had the chance to play it until now, and honestly it wasn't what i was expecting it to be. (AND I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE WHO READ THIS WOULD HATE ME FOR THIS) but Half-Life was a huge disappointing game in my opinion and a really bad game.
I have to admit in a positive way that even that the story is not ground breaking or anything like that, it was a huge improvement into storytelling, all the game's plot was shown via ""scripted sequences"" and this made useless the need of use pre-rendered cutscenes or cutscenes in general, so the players don't loose the immersion that this world has build playing as one of the most iconic video game characters.
It's a shame that the gameplay in general is... well... bad. Let's begun with the combat, one of the very first weapons that the player got their hands off was the iconic crowbar, but... melee combat is awful in this game, it is good to break crates and glasses but combat totally no. Fire weapons are so inconsistent in their damage rate, like, how is it possible that a pistol is more powerful than an assault rifle? or a shotgun? the best gun is the magnum revolver, unfortunately ammunition for this gun is really scarce, this gun is literally one shot kill.
Enemies are annoying, specially those little alien things that zombies had in their heads, those things appear out of nowhere and can inflict a lot of damage, and the soldiers too, those guys are bullet sponges!!!. In this game you will die a lot, but you die in the most unfair ways possible and this end of feeling like a really cheap move to make the game feels ""challenging"".
Even that the levels are lineal, and the game's nature is lineal as well, I end being lost a lot of times wondering ""what am i suppose to do now?"" there's no objectives tab or anything like that, you have to interact with NPC's that will give hints to were to go next, a good addition from this NPC'S is that some can be useful to unlock some doors or even help you in combat, but they die quickly, even more that what you could expected.
Platforming sections are terrible and it's a good example of why platforming and First Person Shooters usually don't get along, and the game's implementation of boxes with physics... are awful (good thing this was fixed in the second game).
Half-Life is indeed an iconic game from the late 90s and calling it the worst game would be fair or perhaps it wouldn't be a very accurate statement. The game isn't entirely that bad as i made it look, it had it's moments of glory, but still, calling it a masterpiece... well, it's not masterpiece.
Half-Life is a most have game or even one of the game you should play before dying, give it a try, master game, learn it's combat pasterns and you will have a really satisfying experience. Collapse",6,0,2

2,Half-Life,Mr_Big,"Nov 8, 2011","Half-Life is truly one of the most iconic and memorable first person shooters in existence. The immersion is masterfully executed, and the moment you get on the monorail to Black Mesa, the game does all that it can do in it's power to thrust you into a dynamic and changing environment. A lack of cut-scenes prevents gameplay break, so the player is constantly on his toes in a desperate bid for survival. Graphics are solid for it's time, but have definitely aged. Shooting is fun and intuitive, and the game heaps a truckload of interesting and varied weapons for you to use. Boss fights play out like puzzles, challenging you to find their weaknesses. Sadly, the only thing that soils this game is the Xen stages at the very end, a commonly cited complaint for this game. The complete change in atmosphere and tone comes suddenly after hours in Black Mesa, a jarring experience for many. Thankfully, the last boss manages to be interesting enough in it's own right.

I really like ""sandbox"" type games and this is exactly the opposite. Quite a corridor-type game with invisible or made up walls if needed, but the AI was definitely one of the best (if not the very best) to that date of initial release.

It has an intro a person can never forget!
The graphics were very good, though really not groundbreaking. The controls were just flawless.
The NPCs made a lot of difference with their also clever AI. I mean you could technically bring other people with you who (if armed) could shoot opponents saving you ammunition.
The decision to create the Xen planet also added a depth - like playing a base game + an expansion.

The characters were good, the animations, sounds and voices remarkable.
The weapons were all and usable.

As someone who has recently beat the game you would think that the dated graphics would be an issue, but the answer is no.

If I'm honest however, I must admit that the story is fairly mediocre at best, and also you will find slightly repetitive 'room to room, wave after wave' situations throughout the game. But the fact is, the sheer genius and quality of Half Life dwarfs those issues. What is also a testament to the game is that I am simply not used to/experienced with classic/old games so the fact I can appreciate the game is surprising for me.

Of all the games I have played, Half Life has by far the best level design. You will experience that there isn't just one way of getting through a section of the game. Throughout the 15 hour campaign, I honestly felt none of the levels were repetitive which is something that should be praised as it was the first ever game made by Valve.

The enemies are varied and challenging, in fact, its one of the most difficult games I have ever played. I often watched walkthroughs to help me progess. Nevertheless, the enemies are outstanding, level design is incredible and the length of the game is very satisfying. I've also played Half Life 2 and for me, this game is a lot better.

38,Half-Life,PublicNuisance,"Jun 7, 2021","Half-Life is certainly a great game and playing through it over twenty years after it’s initial release only strengthens that for me. That being said it is far from perfect. It’s story; characters; world building and presentation are ground breaking and still worthy of praise. It was a pioneer in not having any cut scenes and keeping you in Gordon Freeman’s shoes. It also managed a great feat in that it Valve chose to communicate the story through side characters you encounter and through announcements. Having Freeman be a mute could have been a terrible choice but they pulled it off. The presentation of the game was fantastic. In that I mean things like the intro train ride setting up the facility and little things such as Gordon’s locker giving him some backstory. The characters of Barney; G-Man; and the scientists all cemented their place in gaming history. There was a good selection of weapons that had many good and memorable choices. The difficulty curve of the game felt a bit off though with some sections feeling extremely easy and others feeling almost sadistic. The enemies were varied and all had little differences that made them unique as well as have slightly different strategies for. The graphics were good for the time. I wouldn’t say they were the best of 1998 but certainly top 5. The reload sounds and animations of the guns were varied and gave them extra character. I will now get to something that brought the game down for me from possible all time great to just great: the physics. Half-Life has by far some of the worst physics I have ever seen and to top it off it is compounded by having brutal levels of fall damage. The worst part of the physics for me was interacting with ladders. Going up or down would be an exercise in patience as it was all to easy for the game to think I wanted Gordon to leap off of it. Other times I would climb up the ladder and it may shoot me up in the air a bit having me lose half of my life in fall damage when I hit the ground. The fall damage and poor physics made some of the platforming very frustrating as well. Some of the issue was timing the jumps while others were seeming to slide a bit after landing. I had these issues years ago when I first played the game and they’re still there now. There are health kits scattered about as well as medical stations scattered as well. You can’t carry any med kits with you though.

I played Half-Life on Linux. It never crashed on me. The game ran great which given the age wasn’t a surprise. There was an option for V-Sync but not any graphics options. The game seemed to be locked to 101 FPS regardless of if V-Sync was turned on. I will say that voices felt a bit muffled or with an echo at times. I also had one time where I went through a platform and got stuck making me have to reload my previous save. There were also textures that appeared black and others that would flicker. I could manually save whenever I wanted and there seemed to be no limit on number of saves. You can also just let the game auto save if you want to. You can’t change the difficulty after starting the game. Alt-Tab works.

If you haven’t played Half-Life yet you really should. Physics issues aside it is a great game that has stood the test of time. I finished the game on medium difficulty in 9 hours and 30 minutes. I beat it on hard years ago and knew that with it’s difficulty curve spikes I didn’t want to do that again. I got the game for free years ago from a friend, and also got it through the Orange Box I bought for $49.99 CAD. It is easily worth it’s current price of $11.49 CAD.

44,Half-Life,azeitona,"Dec 9, 2014","I wish I could give this game an 11. So, yeah, my favorite game of all time. This is gonna take a while... from where do I start? I guess I'll start from the bottom and work my way up to what I enjoy most in the game.

Graphics:
They were pretty amazing at the time. Even the Source engine (the follow-up of the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine) is struggling to hold up today. But for 1998 standards... there weren't many truly 3D FPSs games. And Half Life had high quality textures, polygonal models... and the NPCs moved their mouths when they were talking. Even in Max Payne 2 (from 2003) some characters didn't move their mouths.

Of course, Half Life did not age well in the graphics department, but you gotta give it a break. If you compare it with other games at the time (Quake 2, for example), Half Life looks gorgeous.

Audio:
The voice acting is nice for the time. It could have been better, though -there are only 3 voice actors in the game from what I recall, but the voices are memorable. The monsters, the guns and other sounds don't disappoint also.

The soundtrack has some memorable themes, but it is too scarce. There are some great action or exploration moments that could use some background track, but it will only play in a few (very few) moments.

Gameplay:
The action was fast paced and easy for anyone to try it, but the game didn't babysit you. The AI of the enemies was really good, and, actually, I think it holds up even for today standards. The marines you fight aren't brain-dead like many of the enemies of modern shooters. They actually fall back and heal themselves. Sometimes they act really stupid, but most of the time they provide a challenge.

The game also had a great pacing, with fast gunplay moments, small fights and exploration parts. And they all feel connected so organically that it's something I still haven't seen in any other game.

But what really sets the game apart from me are two things: the storytelling and the level design.

Story:
Actually, the story is pretty dumb. You're Gordon Freeman, a scientist that kicks alien ass. Hell yeah. But, seriously, there's nothing more to it. What is amazing is that the game doesn't take control of the camera at any time. Since you start up the campaign, you see everything by the protagonist's eye. And each room tells you a story. It's subtle, but every corner has something to add to the story if you look carefully and try to interpret what is being shown. It's nothing so much amazing, but it's awesome by the way that this is achieved.

Level design:
I don't even know what to say. The level design contributes to the storytelling, bringing the universe of the Black Mesa Research Facility alive. But it doesn't sacrifice the gameplay. In fact, it makes the whole experience more enjoyable, because each level has its own motif going on, and each one is focused in one type of gameplay. Some levels are more action packed, others have more puzzles. But they don't feel disjointed at any time. Only the last levels are kind of a bore, but they're not necessarilly bad. They just don't hold up to the other levels.

So, yeah, I talked too much and I didn't even scrape the surface of what I wanted to talk. But you should at least take a look at the game. It deserves it, as the ""uncle"" of modern titles. And if you never played the original and think that it's too old, take a look at the free mod called Black Mesa, that is a remake of the original game. It's amazing too. So, yeah, Half Life... give it a try when you can, really. Collapse",10,0,0

64,Half-Life,LoletinAlexis,"Sep 6, 2020","Half-Life, despite not being perfect, is the resolution of a study that would end up revolutionizing the world of video games directly and indirectly.

*STORY*: You are Gordon Freeman, a scientist at the Black Mesa Research Center, a subway and ultra-secret scientific complex.
The story places us at the beginning of a working day that should be like any other day. However, during the experiment something doesn't go as planned and Freeman opens an interdimensional hole that gives access to a parallel world called Xen, which is populated by extraterrestrial creatures.

I'll be straightforward: the story, despite being highly endorsed by the gaming community, has seemed to me a disaster.
Don't get me wrong, the script is very interesting and in 1998 it would be a marvel, but today I think the narrative and how you are told the story is not at a decent level. I understood almost nothing of what was happening on the screen and I had to resort to external means.
However, as I said, what they tell finally seems great to me, looking forward to the next one in the saga.
And the HEV Suit... The suit directly turns Freeman into a God or a Doom Slayer.

*GAMEPLAY*: Half-Life was the playable revolution of the late 1990s. Say no more.

*GRAPHICS*: It hasn't aged badly at all graphically (and in general), I'd even say it was pretty top of the line in its day.
Artistically, it's creaking more, but nothing serious.

*SOUND*: I don't find anything remarkable. Well, actually I do, that dubbing is horrible, but it was 1998.

*INNOVATION*: Half-Life was the revolution at a narrative level (although I'm not convinced by this section) and at a playable level of the 90s. A video game legend. Collapse",9,0,0

82,Half-Life,Bottlecaps,"Jun 17, 2019","Half-life 1 , if doom and wolfensien pioneered the fps genre Half-life redefined it but like both of those games half life shows its age but when the game is 21 years old showing a little age is not a big deal.its hard reviewing this title because i know i didn't like it as much as every one else and that probably has something to do with its age. the sheer amount of universal acclaim this game has is kinda astonishing.

Story: you're name is Gordon freeman and you are an everyday scientist thrust into a grand inter dimensional conflict and your only real goal is survival. sure the story concept sounds good but characters die or are silent, witch is where the game shows its age . sometimes silent protagonists work if you can have them emote in other ways like more recently doom guy in the doom remakes or facial reactions like in legend of zelda. still for the time the story is really good it just hasn't aged the best but even still i think world building was the games best strength not its story
Story:7.5/10

world building: creating an interesting world that your game takes place in is the actual anti ageing solution to keeping a game relevant ( star wars did it for film ) and half-life was not the first one to make an interesting world but it was the first one to do it this well. most of the story telling is environmental everything you learn about black messa is from exploring it at first the scientists seem innocent and will act innocent because they don't see them selves as having done anything wrong, all the creatures feel like they have their own spot on the food chain and having a lot of different human npcs really helps the worldbuilding as well , with different factions the world feels more than just yours and that makes it feel bigger than the black messa facility.
World building 10/10

Graphics: for its time the game looks great, hell it still looks fairly good today. the animations are slick but a little to the point. the guns look great and are rendered in a detail that makes you able to recognize what real life guns they actually are, the partical effects , and even lighting are really good for their time the only thing that' really shows its age graphically are the models they are all ridged and blocky.
Graphics:8/10

Game play: honestly this was the worst part of the game. it feels less like a game and more like a performance witch i suppose it emulates action movies, you pretty much have to traverse some parts perfectly or else you will not make it and it makes it even worst if you got in a bad save, this was frustrating at best and infuriating at worst. now i know its partially my fault but you basically have no room for error witch give this game a steep learning curve. things were easy to spot levels were designed in such a way i rarely got stuck on what to do next witch i find with old games is a something that happens a lot i did need to look up walkthroughs but mostly how am i to tackle combat encounters and not where to go.
gameplay: 8/10

Sound design: the music was good at its best and forgettable at its worst. the music is brings a mood to where you are and for most of black messa it feels like industrial rock and industrial sounds and the last few missions just sound like demonic gospel witch is fitting. guns sound snappy and crunchy and are really satisfying. explosions sound incredible. this is the earliest video game voice acting id consider good. lines are delivered really well and i didn't notice any awkward inconstancy in the acting
Sound design: 7.5/10

7.5+10+8+8+7.5=41
41/5= 8.2/10

Half life is a great game , despite its age and i think people should experience even if they don't understand its technological push there is enough world building to keep people interested. but i can see that the age is enough to keep people at bay but id like to tell peoople despite this game being 21 years old. its very much worth the less than 5 dollars i payed for it comeing with the valve complete pack that goes on sale alot witch means you can get this game and its spin offs and sequel(s) for dirt cheap.

73,Half-Life,Ali129,"May 13, 2021","This review contains spoilers. Sonunda ben de Half-Life'ı bitirdim. Oynadığıma değdi diyebilirim. Oyunda Gordon Freeman isimli bir bilim adamını kontrol ediyoruz. Oyunun hikayesi Black Mesa isimli araştırma tesisinde başlıyor. Gordon'ın tesise gelmesi ile bilim adamları tarafından kendisine bir deney yapılacağı söyleniyor. Fakat deney ters gidiyor ve tesiste bir patlama yaşanıyor. Bu patlama ile birlikte Dünya ve ""Xen"" isimli gezegen arasında bir geçit açılmış oluyor ve Xen gezegeninden uzaylılar dünyaya geliyor. Bir süre sonra askerler tesise varıyor fakat ordu, bilim adamları da dahil olmak üzere tesisteki tüm görgü tanıklarını ortadan kaldırarak olayı örtbas etmek istemektedir. Freeman, ""Lambda Kompleksi"" isimli bir yerde bu olayı düzeltme konusunda ona yardımcı olabilecek bilim adamlarının olduğunu öğrenir ve yola koyulur. Lambda Kompleksi'ne vardığında oradaki bilim adamları durumu çözmenin tek yolunun Xen gezegenine gidip geçidi oradan kapatmak olduğunu söylerler ve Gordon'ı Xen gezegine ışınlarlar. Gordon uzaylılarla savaşarak geçidi kapatır ve oyun bu şekilde biter. Oyunun hikayesi kabaca bu şekilde. Hikaye olarak oyun çok detaylı değil. Hikayenin yüzeysel anlatılması bu tür hızlı ve kesintisiz oynanan bir Birinci Şahıs Nişancı oyunu için doğru bir tercih bence, zaten bu tür oyunlarda oyuncu genellikle detaylı hikaye aramaz. Fakat ana karakterin konuşmaması ve ana karakterin hiçbir kişilik özelliğinin oyuncu tarafından bilinmemesi karakter ile bağ kurulmasını ve karakteri ciddiye almayı zorlaştırıyor. Evet Gordon oyun dünyasında sessizliği ile ünlü olup bu haliyle sevilmiştir fakat Gordon'ı kontrol etmek hiç özel hissettirmiyor bana kalırsa, bu oyunda Gordon'ı kontrol etmek sıradan bir karakteri kontrol etmekten farksızdı benim için. Oyunun kendi dönemine damga vuran özelliğine gelirsek; Half-Life resmen bir çığır açarak ara sahneleri kullanmıyor ve hikayeyi oyuncuya neredeyse hiç kesintiye uğratmadan anlatıyor. Tüm diyalogların, aksiyon sahnelerinin ve bölüm geçişlerinin kesintiye uğramadan direkt oyuncunun gözünden aktarılması o dönem için gerçekten çok güzel bir şey, bugün bile bunu yapabilen oyunların sayısı oldukça az. Oynanışa gelelim, oyunun çok yüksek tempolu ve seri olmayı gerektiren bir oynanışı var. Oyuncunun çatışmalardan galip ayrılabilmesi için sürekli hareket eden ve pozisyon değiştiren taraf olması lazım, aksi takdirde düşmana üstünlük kurmak çok zorlaşıyor. Ayrıca oyun zamanına göre düşman türleri bakımından oldukça zengin, oyuncu sürekli farklı düşman türleri ile savaşıyor ve bu da oyuncunun sıkılmasını önlüyor. Oyun boyunca askerler, özel eğitimli infazcılar ve birçok farklı çeşitte uzaylı ile savaşıyoruz, dediğim gibi oyun düşman çeşitliliği konusunda çok zengin. Çeşitlilik demişken, oyun silah türleri bakımından da oldukça çeşitli. Levye ile başladığımız oyunun sonunda elimizde roketatar, ışın silahı, altıpatlar, bomba atarı bulunan bir saldırı tüfeği ve başka birçok silah daha bulunuyor. Bu da aynı düşman çeşitliliği gibi oyuncunun sıkılmasını önleyen unsurlardan biri. Fakat oynanış ile ilgili sıkıntılar da var, bunlar kontroller ve kayıt sistemi. Günümüz şartlarında oyunun kontrolleri biraz zor ve yer yer sinir bozucu oluyor diyebilirin. Kayıt sistemi olarak da oyun manuel kayıt sistemini kullandığı için bazen kayıt edilen yer dolayısı ile karakter ölüm döngüsüne girebiliyor ve en sondaki otomatik kayıt açılmadan oyuna devam edilmiyor, bu benim başıma bir defa geldi ve çok zaman kaybetmeme sebep oldu. Manuel kayıt sistemi yerine daha çok otomatik kayıt olsa daha iyi olurdu. Bölüm tasarımı olarak oyun genel olarak iyi olsa da ""Xen"" isimli bölümde ben oldukça sıkıldım. Bu denli hızlı oynanışı olan bir oyunun sonlarına doğru oyunun temposunu düşüren bir bölüm eklemek ve bu bölümü bir yerden bir yere zamanında zıplama gibi sıkıcı oynanış konseptleri ile doldurmak bana göre kötü bir dizayn seçimi. Ek olarak ""Gonarch's Lair"" isimli bölümde bir hata var ve bu hata oyuncunun ilerlemesini engelliyor, Gonarch aşağı atlaması gerekirken olduğu yerde bekliyor ve oyuncu ilerleyemiyor, ben bu sorunu açılması gereken yere bomba atarak çözdüm fakat neredeyse 23 senelik bir oyunda bunun gibi oyuncunun ilerlemesini engelleyen bir hata nasıl oluyor da hala düzeltilmemiş anlayamadım, bu oyunda böyle bir hata ile karşılaşmayı beklemezdim. Grafik konusunda oyun doğal olarak günümüz standartlarının oldukça altında ancak performans konusunda oldukça stabil ve sorunsuz. Half-Life, her oyuncunun oynaması gereken önemli bir yapım ve oyun bazı problemleri olsa da günümüzde hala oynanabilir seviyede. Collapse",8,0,0

The gameplay was a combination of story, action, puzzle-solving, scripted sequences and platforming; Half-Life even gives away some survival horror vibes too. To be honest Half-Life felt like an interactive novel, each moment felt like i was turning the page for the next thing to surprise me, the game doesn't stop. In many other first-person shooters you are like a super human or something but in Half-Life you are just a scientist late for his work, you are a guy that was betrayed by his fellow scientists, betrayed by the military and stuck in a array of conspiracies, betrayals and horrific sequences. Horror wasn't Half-Life's main goal but Valve succeeded in that regard. The game makes you feel alone and stranded, it tests your survival instincts and challenges you through so many situations. Your arsenal in this game is phenomenal, so many weapons to choose from and so many ways to play the campaign. The game kills it with enemy variety, the enemies have fascinating lores and designs that makes each one of them more interesting. The level design in Half-Life was so revolutionary for its time, and now it is damn smooth and fun to play through. The game's art style is coherent throughout the campaign except for the xen levels (i get to that later). Each counter is memorable and challenging, the story brings so many twists and turns and the narration itself never bores you and always keeps you on your toes. Half-Life is a classic that everyone should own and play, it's a game filled with brilliant mechanics and gameplay; Half-Life broke many laws of video games in 1998 and set new standards; games like Bioshock, Halo, DOOM 3 are all products impacted by this game. I highly recommend playing the original game, the steam version is still great though. The xen levels are still challenging and fun to play, Interpoler and Gonarch's lair are some of my favorites and the final boss is so weird and unique ; it's not just another boring fight but a fight that requires all your skills. The final portion of the game was so memorable and iconic. The ending made everyone so hyped about Half-Life 2 and left a lot of room for interpretation. Half-Life isn't a game that you can breeze through, it's a game that requires all your attention. The game wants you to experience the situations and take it slow. Half-Life isn't an action game, it's a very story-driven title with portions of intense action planted into it. If you haven't played the Half-Life franchsie, or at least the first one you have to do it after reading this review. Collapse",10,0,0

4,Half-Life,Khaffy02,"Feb 24, 2021","Half-Life is a 1998 game that revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. At that time, an unknown company, Valve, licensed the Quake engine from idSoftware, in order to significantly rework it and create their own game. No one expected such a success, but HL has become a truly unique project. The game has won numerous awards, and has received high ratings from critics and was warmly welcomed by the usual players. There were many reasons for this: a well-thought-out, interesting, intriguing plot (which, however, in the second part revealed much more than in the first), graphics, which at that time was a breakthrough, advanced AI of opponents and allies, a convenient and at the same time simple interface, excellent voice acting and soundtrack. Also, the HL feature was that the plot developed inside the game space, without any video inserts. Everything that happened in the game, we watched with our own eyes in real time and it made us dive into the game much more. And of course, skeletal animation.

You, Gordon Freeman, a researcher at the Black Mesa Portal Research Laboratory, located in New Mexico, are on your way to conduct another planned experiment, but in the course of it, a large-scale disaster occurs. On the territory of the laboratory, portals from other worlds are opened, from where alien, aggressive mutants come, attacking people. The main character's goal is to make an attempt to eliminate the consequences and understand the causes of this tragedy.

In addition to the classic skirmishes with enemies and shooting monsters, part of the gameplay is involved in the use of physical puzzles. Thanks to the advanced game physics, we could perform various manipulations with objects and objects of the environment, which in other games of those years was almost absent.

Special mention should be made of the AI system and its allies. We can ask a security guard to come with us and cover us, or call a scientist who will open the door, having access to it. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the engine, AI can not pass everywhere, but even this, not the most perfect system could be proud of in 1998.

Very well designed environment, the interior of the laboratory, models of monsters and zombies. The result is a very unique and sometimes eerie atmosphere, thanks to the beautiful sound, picture and method of narration.

The game also features 32-player multiplayer, with multiple modes. The gameplay is very dynamic, interesting and addictive for a while. The servers are not empty to this day.

Among the minor disadvantages, we can mention the bots (allies in the game), which get stuck in the floor, often blunt out of the blue, can run along an incomprehensible trajectory. Or the AI of the military, who simply run out on you in the open, like cannon fodder, can sometimes ignore the player, without reacting to him in any way.

Great game, great story, good graphics (for the 98th year), interesting gameplay and great sound.

This game in my opinion should be for everyone.

7,Half-Life,Melih10712009,"Mar 7, 2021","This review contains spoilers. Half Life hakkinda düşüncelerim;
1. Hikaye: Black Mesa denen adlı bi bilim merkezi vardır. Orda da çalışan ""Gordon Freeman"" adlı bi bilim adamı vardır. Bi gün bi tane riskli bi deney yapacaklardı. Deneyi yaparken bi anda bi patlama olmuş ve değişik değişik uzaylılar ve yaratıklar çıkmış ve Black Mesa denen bilim merkezinde nerdeyse çoğu bilim adamı ölmüş. Yaşayanların arasında ki ""Gordon Freeman"" ise canavarların ve yaratıkların arasında ki yaşam mücadelesini anlatıyor Half Life. Hikaye böyle biraz ilgi çekici ama biraz daha derine inersek o kadar güzel değil.
2. Diyaloglar: Diyologlar o kadar boş ki oyunun bi yerinden sonra diyologlara bakmadım. Yani diyologlara hiç bakmazsanız bi şeyleri kaçırısınız ama oyunun ortalarına geldiğinizde diyologlara bakmazsanız bi-iki şey kaçırısınız ama o kadar bişey kaybetmezsiniz.
3. Karakterler: Oyunda doğru düzgün karakter yok amq. Herkes birbirinin klonu aq. Bide o Black Mesa'da bulunan profesör ve güvenlik görevlileri hep yanımız da geziyo ama hepsi mal. Hepsi birbirinin klonu,hepsi mal,hepsi sanki bot gibi. Ana karakterimiz belki iyidir falan dedik adam konuşmuyooo!!! Kabul ediyorum ki bazenleri ana karakteri oynarken sanki ana karaktermişim gibi hissediyorum ama bi zahmet biraz diyolog,biraz kişilik falan ekleyin. 10 dakika da bir konuşup o konuşmalarında ise kendi kişiliğini gösteren diyologlu ya da anlamlı ve mantıklı diyologlu bi karakter olsa ona ben Razıyım.
4.Grafikler: Şimdi 1998'de ki oyunun grafiklerini eleştirmek şaçmalıktır bana göre.
5. Bölüm dizaynı: Her bölüm de nerdeyse değişik yerler,değişik düşmanlar,değişik şeylerle karşılaşıyoruz. Cidden bu özelliği çok iyi. Bi de nerdeyse Gordon Freeman'ın yaşadığı herşeyi görebiliyoruz. Bu da çok güzel bi özellik.
6. Düşmanlar: Düşman çeşiti yok yani ama oyunun finalin de o kadar çeşit düşman var ki.(Zaten oyunun finalinden de bahsedeceğim.)
7. Yapay Zeka: Yapay zeka fena değil ama bazenleri mallaşabiliyorlar.
8. Bosslar: Cidden 1998'de çıkan bi oyun da boss var şaka maka. O kadar boss olmasa da yine de fena değiller. Bide son Boss... M-U-H-T-E-Ş-Ş-E-M.
9.Atmosfer: Oyunun atmosferi çok iyi.
10. Müzik: Oyunda ki müzikler beni gaza getiriyor.
11. Zorluk seviyesi: Oyun o kadar zor ki... Oyunu oynarken illa internete bakmam gerekiyor. İlk kez Half Life'ı oynayan kişiler internette bakmadan oyunu bitirdiyse ne diyim helal olsun. Bide oyun çok hızlı. Aynı speedrun yapılacak gibi. Hem zor hem de hızlı olması çok değişik.
12. Silahlar: Silah çeşitleri çok fazla ve çok iyi. Silahlarla savaşırken hiç sıkılmadım.
13. Oynanış: Oynanış da zor bi bakımdan. Çünkü nişan alırken sanki gerçekten savaşıyormuşuz gibi hissediyorum ama yine de zorlanıyorum.
14. Buglar: Oyun da o kadar bug var ki... Arada sırada oyun çöküyor. Savelerin siliniyor. Ya da bi bölümü geçemiyorum. Valve artık bu bugları düzelt bee yaw.(Tabi onun yerine yeniden yapımı ismi ""Black Mesa"" olan bi oyun çıkardılar. Onu da oynayacağım.)
15. Final: Finali o kadar güzel ki... Böyle bi anda uzaylıların mekanını basıyorsun. Sonra daha oyunda hiç görmediğin değişik yaratiklarla savaşıyorsun. Sonra o canavarları öldürdükten sonra Uzaylıların Lideri yani son boss'la kapışıyoruz. Epik bi savaş geçirdikten sonra karşına gizli bi ""G-Man"" adlı bi adam geliyor. O G-Man bize iki seçenek sunuyo ya benim tarafıma geçip çalışırsın ya da hayatin sona erir gibi bişey diyor. Dedikten sonra da bi trenle gidiyoruz değişik bi evrende. Ve trenin kapısında bi portal var. O portala atlarsak mutlu bi şekilde oyun bitiyor ama portala bi yerdem sonra atlamazsak G-Man bizi canavarların ortasına bırakıp yediriyor.

Ekstra: Oyunla alakalı o kadar önemli seyler olsa da yine de yazıyım.
1. Oyunun ilk saatlerinde güzel güzel canavarlarla,yaratıklarla savaşırlen bi anda askerler olaya karıştı. Asker ne alaka amq. Askerlere bişey yapmadık ama yine de bize saldırıyorlar o kadar saçma ki. Bide oyun bunu adam gibi anlatmıyo. Tabi bu olay o kadar sıkıntı değil ama yine de bana saçma geliyor.( Hatta o ordunun bi çavuşunun olduğu bi oyun var. Onuda oynayacağım.)
2. Oyun da çok easteregg var. Mesela oyunda arada sırada G-Man geliyor. Bi de nerdeyse hikayenin çoğunu internetten öğreniyorsun. Bu yönde biraz üzüldüm.

Sonuç: Şimdi bunları derleyip toplayınca size sunucağım. Bu yazdıklarıma bakılınca oyunun hikayesi bana göre ""BOMBOŞ"" olduğunu ama öbür yanlardan güzel olduğu anlami çıkarılıyo.

this is one of the most influential and groundbreaking FPS games.in this game you take a role of gordon freeman, the typical the oritical physicist working in the fictional black mesa re-scarch facility.
here the character begins a long journey fighting all manner of aliens and hostile soldiers along the way gordon can also be added by members of the science and security team.
the most essential feature is of unlocking security doors. its reliability is good due to its amazing 1080p resolution graphics, which has practically zero compatibility problems ,which makes a lot easy to get into and up and running.
everything they put in this game world was put in a way that felt a lot more realistic ,guns were kept in storage rooms for instance and health or battery packs found in crates or on shelves.
playing this game for hours doesn't disappoint you at all.
valve software did a pretty good job as per my view. Collapse",7,0,0
10,Half-Life,HarborMan3838,"May 17, 2021","This review contains spoilers. First Review Here. I have to say, the xen levels were a bit disappointing, interpoler was a very good level but other areas like Gonarch's lair or the first area of Xen when you have to wait and jump for 10 times were really simple and lackluster for Half-Life Standards. But the game itself is flawless. Half-Life understood the word ""First-person shooter"" and created the base of the genre for the next 20 years in 1998. The First moments of Half-Life are some of the best moments in any video game ever after the resonance cascade the game turned into a tour de force and it was non-stop action, story, mystery and puzzle-solving after that. The ending was so fitting and got me hyped for Half-Life 2. Collapse",10,0,0

Half-Life is a must-play classic that is definitely worth buying and experiencing, it made people realize that first-person shooters are more than shooting, they can have complex stories, mysterious surroundings, unique art direction and realistic combat. Half-Life built upon DOOM's unrivaled legacy and started a new era for PC gaming. Half-Life was the beginning of a new era for first-person shooters and video games in general.

From the very first moment, Half-Life will surprise you. It doesn't give you a gun, it doesn't open with badass music, and you are certainly not a badass; you are just a dude going to his work but that ominous tone and soundtrack is like a warning of something mysterious happening in the facility, a weird suited man continues looking at you as the tram moves on, there's a rocket, you see military action, scientists are running for something and so on. It shows that today something secret is happening. The voice guide feels so real and creepy and tells you about a suit. Back then the H. E. V suit was such a cool thing. Half-Life knows when to use its soundtrack to startle you and keep you on edge. The game never stops for your weaknesses, Half-Life is an intense tale of survival. The gameplay feels so real as it combines Horror, action, mystery, puzzles and exploration. The story never gets boring for it is filled with twists and turns, this game uses true old-fashioned hitchcock suspense and the sci-fi elements of the story are so balanced, Half-Life plays you like a piano. Half-Life is a TRUE classic all the way that changed the gaming industry for ever, and became an icon in the first-person shooter genre. Collapse",10,0,0
15,Half-Life,BoogieReviewer,"May 24, 2021","This review contains spoilers. Half-Life wasn't a shooting gallery unlike any other shooter at the time, you weren't some huge ass dude with tons of crazy weapons or huge muscles surrounded with girls... No no Valve didn't want to blend in with the ecosystem of first-person shooters in 1996, instead they created a mysterious rich world that offers tons of complexity.
Half-Life changed the way many people looked at the games back in the late 90's, it revolutionized PC gaming and with 50 goty awards Half-Life proved video games can be as complex or as interesting as novels or movies. The story has enough surprises for you to keep you going for the whole game and the narrative is told flawlessly, Marc Laidlaw used the old ways of story-telling brilliantly and offered an old-fashioned story which is being told through the most modern ways of narration. The level design is unforgettable, the levels will stick with you even after you're done with a certain level. Half-Life never leaves you, the monsters are always lurking somewhere, the soldiers are always coming for you and the intelligent scientist friends of yours betrayed you and made YOU make a mess and you aren't some badass dude with a cigarette in his mouth; you are just some random scientist stuck in a long loop of conspiracies and betrayals. Many other games after Half-Life used this story-telling method to keep you on edge or surprise you like Halo 1, so yeah as i was saying Half-Life is a lonely game; a game that requires all your brains and brawn to get by. There are a lot of puzzle sections in the game that you need to solve to progress, the whole concept of solving puzzles to overcome the problems was established with this game.
In conclusion Half-Life may be the most important shooter ever made, It balanced and revolutionized many things in the genre and introduced tons of new innovations as well. Half-Life will definitely be a surprising experience with anyone accustomed to the 90's action games because Half-Life has been and always will be the most important shooter of all time. God bless Valve and gabe newell for giving us this masterpiece and they shall burn in hell for not giving us Half-Life 3 (just joking!?) but anyway thank you for reading this post if you made it till the end. Play this piece of gold if you haven't already, i'm sure you'll have a great time at least :) Collapse",10,0,0

17,Half-Life,Goodbadcritic45,"Jun 26, 2021","This review contains spoilers. What can i say about Half-Life? The game pulled me into the world of video games. The whole idea to experience a story in this way made me realize how immersive video games are. Half-Life puts you in the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who works in Black Mesa Research Facility. As the game's famous ominous soundtrack, Black Mesa Inbound, starts playing, it contrasts with the smooth robotic voice that is going through the facilities rules, creating a sense of dread and insecurity. Everything turns upside down when an experiment goes wrong and opens up a portal into a mysterious dimension. It's now up to you to escape from the facility and unravel the mystery behind the experiment. Black Mesa is a weird place, as you're going from place to place to survive and fight back against the enemies, there's a mysterious man following you and watching you, suddenly soldiers start attacking the scientists that they were supposed to rescue, huge weird monsters appear in the facility that seem to have specific behaviors. Half-Life presents the story like opening a box. Its slow yet fascinating; your objectives change, your allies change, with each step that you take, the world around you changes as well. There are no cinematics or cutscenes. Half-Life is a work of art that combines traditional story-telling methods with innovative aspects. It pioneered the idea that a video game's story can be as complex as a novel.
Half-Life's gameplay is simple yet so fun. The game's main focus is story and environments but the gameplay doesn't have anything annoying that ruins the experience. I didn't encounter any bugs in the game and it ran as smooth as possible.
The final episodes of Half-Life which take place in Xen are a bit weak in the gameplay department yet still having strong story-telling.
Half-Life pacing is also something so brilliantly-balanced; The game knows how to manage the fun without sacrificing either gameplay or story. Half-Life may feel a bit overlong due to its dated graphics but you will get accustomed to them after some time or you can play the fan-made remake BLACK MESA which i will play in a few days myself. Don't miss the Steam Summer sale. Have Fun! Collapse",10,0,0
18,Half-Life,Correspond76,"Jun 27, 2021","My video game journey started with Half-Life (1998). From the very start, Half-Life felt like a tour de force. Half-Life will challenge you with its complex story-telling, heart-pounding action, horror themed elements and a world that is hard to gasp. Half-Life used the elements that the previous icons, like doom and wolfenstei, n established and created its own art. The game didn't use any cutscenes instead it presented its story with maximum coherence. If you think you will be disappointed by a 23-year-old video game, you're wrong. Even if the graphics annoy you and you can't play with them, i still recommend going through the game because Half-Life delivers a real first-person shooting experience.

The dated visuals might be distracting at first but as you go; the game shapes an immersive world. Half-Life's launch in 1998 simply shifted the industry, making the previous shooting galleries look dated in comparison, everything in Half-Life was meaningful and important to the story, from npc dialogs to a simple crowbar, Half-Life depicted a dark and mysterious reality that was serious and gruesome, so much that sometimes i felt Half-Life plunged itself into the survival horror genre.
Half-Life's level design isn't something revolutionary or new these days but back in 1998 Half-Life's closed and open areas felt more real and natural than any other first-person shooter that came after and before it.

24,Half-Life,CosmosGamer27,"Jul 17, 2021","This review contains spoilers. Half-Life's sophisticated narration and moral ambiguity really fascinated me. I had to play the game for like five times to fully understand the story. Half-Life is a demanding game; it constantly throws new gameplay mechanics and story elements at you. Half-Life always keep you on your toes because the world around you changes as fast as you run through the Black Mesa Research Facility. You are Gordon Freeman, a 27-year-old scientist with a PhD in Theoretical physics from MIT, who is going to his work on a normal day, or is he?
From the very first scene, Half-Life shows you what the game will be about:
1. You see military action in the facility. 2. You see A rocket ready to be launched. 3. You can see scientists running for something and they're in hurry. It doesn't sound like a normal day, does it?
From the start, Half-Life establishes an ominous tone that will carry on within the game; it's not obvious who's right or who's wrong... Are we really the guy who started this mess or thy tricked us into doing it?
Half-Life plays with simple narrative structures like no other video game title or even movie. It's one of the most interactive stories ever made because it demands your full attention and care. Half-Life isn't perfect though; the final few levels that happen in Xen are weak from several aspects: sloppy level design, not so satisfying visuals and lack of enemy variety; but Half-Life makes up for it with the ending which leaves you wanting more from this dark and mysterious world.
I highly recommend playing the original Half-Life for Black Mesa ruins the charm of the original. Whether you like it or not, Half-Life's impact on video games and gaming is undeniable and we should all praise Valve software for taking such huge risks back in 1998. Half-Life's visuals might be old but as everyone says: it's an old dog with new tricks. Even if you have played all the first-person shooter games in the modern day; Half-Life will have something for you because it's a game like no other. My final score: 9.6/10 Collapse",10,0,0
25,Half-Life,EatmeApart881,"Jul 20, 2021","It's mind-boggling that Half-Life is still a solid first-person shooter experience 20 years after its initial launch.
The graphics and gameplay can be a bit tricky to get used to but after that you realize why Half-Life is so praised. I loved the sophisticated story and the different ways the game tried to tells its plot. The opening sequence, for example, was one of them. The gameplay is so fun and for a 1998 game, so realistic too.
There are puzzle-solving and platforming sections in the game as well, making the survival aspect of Half-Life more realistic and paced.
In Half-Life you aren't a super soldier or a special person but a normal scientist that gets stuck in a deep mess that will haunt humanity until its end. The silence protagonist aspect of Half-Life made the game a lot more immersive as i was thinking that i was going through this all the time. The visuals might have aged but the world's interactivity with the player is still there, showing how much Half-Life was ahead of its time.
I love Half-Life and in my opinion is one of the best first-person shooters you can play as of now. Collapse",10,0,0

La historia no se lleva ningún premio al mejor guión, es una invasión extraterrestre producto de un accidente científico, pero no es lo que cuenta lo interesante, sino como lo cuenta, pura narrativa en tiempo real (que luego se perfeccionó al 200% en Half Life 2). La IA de los enemigos es aceptable, los combates son frenéticos contra los militares y los alienígenas. Tiene fallos mínimos como la carga de mapas abruptas e inesperadas, pero al lado de todas sus virtudes no le prestas ni atención.

The narrative structure of Half-Life is so strong and well-paced that no other story-driven game could top Half-Life at the time. The attention to detail and world building that Valve put into Half-Life is astonishing, you might say what if gordon freeman gets hungry or thirsty during his survival run... Well, there are several vending machines throughout the game that he could use for his basic needs. The few characters that inhabit Half-Life's world have so much character and personality built into them making this world very realistic... They are funny, scared, smart and even terrified during the game and that's exactly how human nature answers to real life catastrophes.

Where do I even start, I don’t even need to start, it’s Half-Life, for god’s sake!
I suppose I should start with HOW GOOD THIS GAME FEELS TO PLAY! Valve has mastered the art of making the player’s controls natural, and the maps help with it, sure, there were a few too many jumping puzzles, but otherwise, this game controls great! The shooting is somehow the most satisfying thing I’ve ever felt, and a lot of shooters can feel disappointing when it comes to gunplay, but Half-Life has guns with as many upsides as there are downsides.
Now for some complaints,
Graphics are a bit primitive, and the Steam version uses the uglier HD models as the default, and the challenge can be a bit much in places, but **** man, this game really pulls itself through, and even in the slopfest that is Xen, you can still have a ton of fun.

Graphics are very good for a 1998 game. It has its quirks such as the game bugging sometimes when loading between levels, how easily you can take damage from grunts, and ""think fast"" moments where you will get a grenade launched or thrown at you or a rocket shot at you. However, this shows that Half-Life isn't a game that is meant to be rushed, but rather taken slow and cautiously. Multiplayer can be fun too, taking their modern spin on the classic deathmatch.

Оценка 7.8

Сюжет, даже сравнивая с играми 2000-2022 замечательный. Прекрасный стори-тейл тематики: научной фантастики и утопии, стилестически грамотно построенный рассказ не даст заскучать почти всем игрокам, которым нравятся такие тематики.

Графика сравнивая с современными играми конечно не очень, хотя главный минус за маленькое доступное разрешение.

Саундтрек очень бодренький и задаёт темп игре. Музыкальный бум в стиле научной фантастики приследует вас почти весь сюжет и как показуют другие обзоры: игрокам очень нравятся такие ""дорожки"".

Геймплей, не считая замечательный и интересный сюжет, весьма прямолинеен: от точки А в точку Б, хотя и разбавлен музыкой и интереснымм стычками с мобами.

Визуальное оформление воссоздано очень хорошо! Попадая в Black Mesa игрок сразу чувствуется антураж крутой секретной лаборатории: новые технологии, загадки в стенах базы и другие вещи, которые создают отличное ощущение, из-за чего ты ненароком начинаешь чувствовать себя частью команды Black Mesa.

Мой комментарий: До того как я не прошёл игру Half-Life, мне казалось, что это творение не достойно звания лучшей игры до 2000 годов и подальших. Будучи типичним грофоманом, я не понимал сути таких сюжетных игр, ведь в них было невозможно играть. Но сейчас я поистине всем советую пройти эту игру. Она перезапускает ваш мозг, из-за чего ВЫ сможете полюбить другие стори-тейл игры. Не зря Half-Life называют легендарной игрой, ведь тайны таких проектов таятся в сюжетных мелочах и тайнах а не в гравике и геймплее. Collapse",8,0,0

Come to Black Mesa, you can kill stuff and we won’t ask too many questions.

That’s exactly what you get to in this spin-off / sequel to the amazing Half-Life. Just how amazing Half-Life was is being lost over time but it was really the big push for modern FPS games. This spin-off is a bit more of the same that was in Half-Life. But this cop adventure preys more on nostalgia of Half-Life. It’s billed as a new adventure, when much of the game is just re-used from the original.

You play as Barney, the loveable cop who makes an appearance later in Half-Life 2. This is his story, how he came to be. Well, not really. If you took just the action scenes from Half-Life and threw away the story and cut-scenes this is what you get. It’s a short adventure that allows you much faster to start shooting things. It’s an alternate perspective on how the start of the main games story unfolds. Seeing things from a different character and the cameos are really the highlights.

It’s a fun romp for a few hours, but much like security guards it’s not as prestigious or exciting as the real deal. Still beats watching re-runs of Cops on late night TV. Stay safe out their gamers. And remember swatting is a serious yet hilarious crime. Collapse",8,0,1
23,Half-Life: Blue Shift,eva3si0n,"Jan 16, 2021","Half-Life: Blue Shift is the shortest game in the series and does not have any gameplay changes relative to the original. But here there is a completed plot and it does not break off like a cliffhanger. And also only 1 meeting with G-Man, apparently to him in general, a joke at Barney. Half-Life: Blue Shift may seem the most boring and unnecessary part, but it is very important. It is she who connects the first and second parts.

The puzzles in the game are pretty neat to, they actually require you to think; not just waste everything. The HD pack is a nice bonous too, it enhances character models so every security guard isn't some old guy with a gun. It smoothes out the environmental graphics. And enhances the gameplay with improved weapon graphics. The new shotgun model kicks the old one's ass. I admit the game is a bit short, but it's the quality not the quantity.

4,Half-Life: Blue Shift,npc_barney,"Oct 18, 2016","I think Blue Shift is better than Opposing Force. Yes, I'm serious. OK, first of all, Blue Shift has a much better level design than Opposing Force and Half-Life 1. The facility feels actually alive this time, you know, basketball courts, laundry rooms with arcade machines, cafeterias... Also, Blue Shift feels more like ""Half-Life"" than Opposing Force. Opposing Force feels like an another military shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Blue Shift's protagonist, Barney Calhoun, is better than Opposing Force's protagonist, Adrian Shephard, because Barney was just an ordinary security guard whose been trying to escape from the facility as soon is he can, after the incident, of course. But Adrian is a trained H.E.C.U. Marine whose been sent to the Black Mesa for a military coverup. Blue Shift's ending was very different compared to the other Half-Life games, while the Opposing Force's ending was almost exactly same as Half-Life 1's ending. Sure, Blue Shift was short, and there wasn't a ""final boss"", and it didn't add some new cool stuff like new weapons, enemies etc. like Opposing Force did. I mean, both of them are awesome, but I personally enjoyed Blue Shift more than Opposing Force. Collapse",10,0,0

In this short campaign... an it is very short... with a length of 2 hrs max, we play as a blue shift security guard as he fights his way through black mesa to escape.
Somehow this game is a little less a pain in the ass like the original game, and the difficulty is a little bit more balance, making encounters less painful. Death is inevitable, but fells less frustrating. Even that most of the time you will be in sewers and closed areas, the level design stills pretty solid with amazing lighting and shadowing, unfortunately... the game is pretty dark, you will be walking in pitch darkness most of the time this due that most of the environments takes places in air docks and sewers and the flash light is not that great. Platformed sections are still pretty bad and annoying, but at least those are not that often.
Combat feels more fluent than in the first game... and... well... i feel blue shift more ""lineal"" in it's design but... well... it was a good experience. I was a little skeptical about playing this one, because i didn't like that much Half-Life 1, but... i did like this entry, now, i just have to find out how opposing forces works and then how Half-Life 2 works.

21,Half-Life: Blue Shift,Ali129,"May 24, 2021","This review contains spoilers. Half-Life'ı ve Half-Life'ın ilk eklentisi Opposing Force'u keyifle oynamış biri olarak söyleyebilirim ki; Half-Life: Blue Shift tam anlamıyla bir hayal kırıklığı. Opposing Force'u çok keyif alarak bitirdikten sonra hemen bu eklentiyi de oynamak istedim fakat hevesim kursağımda kaldı. Bu eklenti oyuna kısa ve sıkıcı bir hikaye eklemekten başka hiçbir şey yapmıyor. Hiçbir şey yapmadığı gibi önceki eklentide oyuna eklenen yeni silah ve düşman çeşitlerini kaldırıyor, hatta Half-Life'ta bulunan bazı küçük yaratıkları silah olarak kullanma özelliği bile çıkarılmış. Hikayeden kısaca bahsetmek gerekirse; Black Mesa'da güvenlik görevlisi olarak çalışan Barney Calhoun her zamanki gibi işe gelir ve göreve koyulur. Her şey sıradan ilerlerken Black Mesa faciası gerçekleşir ve Barney diğer güvenlik görevlileri ve bilim adamları gibi Black Mesa'da mahsur kalır. Kaçmak için uzaylılarla savaşan Barney'nin önündeki engellerden biri de Black Mesa'ya oradaki tüm görgü tanıklarını ortadan kaldırmaya gelen HECU askerleridir. Barney kaçmaya çalışırken rastladığı bir bilim adamı, onu buradan ancak Dr. Rosenberg'ün çıkarabileceğini ve onu bulması gerektiğini söyler. Çok geçmeden Barney, Rosenberg'ü bulur. Rosenberg, Barney'ye onları dışarı ışınlayabilecek bir makinenin olduğunu ve eğer bu makineyi çalıştırabilecek malzemeleri bulabilirlerse kurtulabileceklerini söyler. Barney gerekli malzemeleri bulur ve Rosenberg makineyi çalıştırır. Açılan portala önce Rosenberg sonra da Barney girer. Ardından Barney kendini Black Mesa'nın dışında Rosenberg ve diğer iki bilim adamının yanında bulur. Ancak Barney birden Xen gezegenine ışınlanır. Xen gezegeninde biraz yürüdükten sonra tekrar Rosenberg'ün yanına ışınlanır ve hikaye bu şekilde biter. Hikaye Half-Life ve Opposing Force'ta da detaylı değildi ancak Blue Shift'in hikayesi bana tamamı ile baştan savma geldi. Ayrıca Opposing Force'ta geliştirilen hikaye sunumu bu oyunda yerini tekrar zayıf ve özensiz hikaye sunumuna bırakmış. Half-Life ve Opposing Force'un aksine Blue Shift'te G-Man yalnızca 1-2 defa görünüyor ve hikayeye hiçbir etkisi bulunmuyor, ayrıca yine Half-Life ve Opposing Force'un aksine Blue Shift'te bölüm sonu canavarı yok. En azından hikayenin sonunda bölüm sonu canavarı ile karşılaşsak güzel olabilirdi fakat maalesef oyuna koyulmamış. Oynanış kısmında daha önce de bahsettiğim gibi silah ve düşman çeşitliliği azaltılmış. Half-Life'ta ve Opposing Force'ta bulunan özel eğitimli infazcılar bu eklentide kaldırılmış, Opposing Force'ta bulunan yeni uzaylı düşman çeşitleri de Blue Shift'te bulunmuyor. Eklenti boyunca yalnızca birkaç çeşit uzaylı ve HECU askerleri ile savaşıyoruz, bu da tahmin edilebileceği üzere bir yerden sonra çok sıkıcı oluyor çünkü çeşitlilik yok. Silah çeşitliliği konusunda da önceden söylediğim gibi eksiklikler var, Opposing Force'ta bulunan ağır makineli tüfek, portal atan silah ve keskin nişancı tüfeği bu eklentide bulunmuyor. Hem Half-Life hem de Opposing Force'ta bulunan uzaylı ve enerji silahları da bu eklentide yok. Ancak Half-Life'ta bulunup Opposing Force'ta olmayan altıpatlar Blue Shift'e eklenmiş. Bölüm tasarımı olarak Blue Shift kendini zaman zaman tekrar ediyor, ancak güzel tasarlanmış bölümler de var. Half-Life'ta bulunan ve oynarken çok sıkıldığım, oynanışı yavaşlatan dizaynı ile kötü tasarlanmış platformdan platforma zıplama kısımlarının bulunduğu Xen gezegeninde geçen bir bölüm Blue Shift'te de bulunuyor, neyse ki çok uzun değil ve beni oyundan soğutmadı. Yani bölüm tasarımı ne iyi ne de kötü denilebilir, ortalama düzeyde. Grafiksel olarak bir iyileştirme yapılmamış, performans konusunda ise Half-Life ve Opposing Force'ta olduğu gibi Blue Shift de oldukça stabil. Oyunu oynarken bir hata ile karşılaştım, oyunun sonunda Rosenberg'ün yanından Xen gezegenine ışınlandığımda oyunu kayıt etmek istedim fakat oyun çöktü, tekrar tekrar kayıt etmeyi denememe rağmen her defasında oyun çökmeye devam etti. O bölüm çok kısa sürdüğü için bu hata bana büyük bir problem yaşatmadı ancak 20 senelik bir eklentide bu hatanın çoktan düzeltilmesi gerekirdi. Eklentinin oynanış süresinin çok kısa olduğunu da belirteyim, yaklaşık 1.5 saatte bitirilmesi mümkün, hatta internette 1 saatte bitirenler bile var. Bunun bir eklenti olduğunun farkındayım fakat 1.5 saat çok kısa bir süre, en azından 3-4 saat olmalıydı diye düşünüyorum. Half-Life: Blue Shift kısa oynanış süresi, çeşitli olmayan ve sıkıcı oynanışı ile benim için başarısız bir eklenti. Collapse",6,0,0
22,Half-Life: Blue Shift,zaratti,"Aug 15, 2022","The Half-Life franchise is actually a lot simpler than others because it has 2 games and some DLC. However, I'd say the Gearbox expansion packs are less regarded as part of the core Half-Life experience because they aren't really that important in the story. Despite this, I'd say Gearbox did a damn good job with these games. Blue Shift is very cool because it offers you a different perspective of Black Mesa from security guard Barney's eyes. You get to see the security offices and explore around different areas than you would as Gordon. There are some cute ties to Half-Life too. The gameplay is largely the same but without the HEV suit. You can't charge your vest using the HEV chargers but they are still around for some reason. I guess it adds cohesion. The overall story is pretty short but fun. There are some cool puzzles and interactions. The levels are designed pretty well. The combat encounters are fun. Overall what you'd expect from a Half-Life game. Collapse",8,0,0

What was amazing was how being caught in a mission created a huge car chase that I didn't quite make it out of. I then replayed the mission and got through stealthily and things changed massively.

8,Sid Meier's Civilization V,WereBearPig,"Dec 14, 2020","This review contains spoilers. I enjoyed the game, but it's not at all what was advertised. We were told it was going to be a deep RPG with immersion as good as RDR2, well that obviously didn't happen.

It's buggy and glitchy, yes, and it doesn't run well for most people unless you have a NASA computer, but those things can be fixed and actually don't factor into my review of the game in the slightest.

My biggest issue with the game is that it's entirely superficial, the world is big and looks beautiful but where are the things to do besides shooting people? I was expecting mini games, something like Gwent, or brain dances, hell, Wakako has a pachinko parlor, why can't we use it? Cutting hair, getting piercings, tattoos? None of it.

Then there is the AI, and I can't believe a game released in 2020 with an AI system like this. The police outright spawn behind you, there is no chase system, no wanted system, no corrupt rich and powerful to send the police as their own personal hitmen, all things that were promised. Run away from the police after gaining a star? It's like they've never seen you before. But if you stand too close to them? They shoot you.

There really isn't much things to do except things involving combat, and while combat is fun, it's not really all that fun to do it over and over again. I wanted to enjoy the city, not just the combat. Hacking is okay, but a little boring. Same with stealth.

Personal story also has very little impact on the game, I remember they were planning to add in a whole ""traumatic life experiences"", ""childhood hero"" etc, but all of that got scrapped. It makes your beginning of nomad, corpo or street kid feel hollow except for the occasional dialogue option that honestly doesn't change much. And what was with the montage at the beginning? Why couldn't we experience those times with Jackie? Would've made him and events of the story surrounding him much more compelling since, ya know, we'd actually have time to get to know him. You could've showed us, not told us.

Something I can say about the game though is that the characters are very well written. Honestly it's the cast that really drive this game, their growth and depth are really well done and CDPR did a great job of making me hate, then love, then love-hate, then love again a certain character.

But I'm a little pissed extra special attention was given to Judy and Panam, while Kerry and River took the backseat by being entirely easy to miss by being tied to side quests, unlike our ladies. Give a little love to our homies, CDPR.

Which also brings me to the point of why the heck did they censor all the dongs in the game? It was there in the tech demo. Full frontal nudity is okay for women, but not for men? Give me a break, this is a bleak as heck world, a scrapper wouldn't have the courtesy to leave a man's underwear on if they only viewed them as meat and valuable tech.

I also want to bring up the endings, I won't spoil anything but I can say I don't particularly like any of them, and again, they favor the girl romances in certain endings. I really, really hate open ended endings that tease things ""oo, maybe a dlc? maybe not? maybe a 2nd title?"". It's lazy, annoying, and doesn't really give me a sense of closure. And anyone saying ""happy endings, in a cyberpunk setting?"" yes, happy endings. Things that reward the player. I'm sick of games lately adding numerous endings but they're all just different variations of bad ends. It ruins the journey in my opinion. Collapse",7,0,0
