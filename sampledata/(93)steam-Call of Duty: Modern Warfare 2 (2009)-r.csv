0,Awesome - Both on PC & XBOX.
1,this game is fun if you want to do the campaign but the multiplayer is infested with hackers if there is anyone online.
2,Its COD
3,hahahha gun go brrr
4,Iconic
5,its good thats it
6,"8/10
One of the best COD games ever made. A lot of good memories for me in this game, probably some repressed ones as well from hearing what people would say in the multiplayer lobbies."
7,"This is a review of the campaign portion of the game. I have finally had the opportunity to play this masterpiece of a game and it is worth every penny that you pay of your hard earned money. I have been so disappointed with recent games, but this game has kept me engaged, entertained, engrossed/invested in the story. This game has what few games possess these days, fun."
8,It's Call of Duty
9,certified hood classic
10,"yes
"
11,fire
12,one of the best call of duty's would recommend to any COD fan
13,good
14,"The player base is filled to the brim with max prestige's and widely not that many hackers, if you're here for a slow easy breeze multiplayer experience, welcome to cancerville. The campaign is and will always be banging"
15,very good campaign and multiplayer is also good
16,SIR! CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER?

tutorial how to enjoy the multiplayer

1. enjoy the multiplayer and dont rage, or be toxic.


2 if u rage, dont write on the chat toxic things


and step 3: you can test iw4x. i tested it and it gives you mucth more fps then before."
23,modern warfare 2 before modern warfare II and modern warfare II (2) and modern warfare II (2) [2] came out
24,wallah
25,"Even to this day (2022) with the reboot of Modern Warfare (2019) I consider this to be the best Call of Duty game. It really build on what it did before (Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare) in both the SP story and the MP and only improved upon it. I know it had it faults regarding the MP with the terrible OP one man army, the OP shotguns and dead man switch I think its called (the suicide grenade/c4) but I still had the most fun in this game. I also love the story. It added really cool moments and new characters and of course the story twists that followed."

27,why couldnt they add *(2022)* to the new modern warfare and keep this one the same smh
28,"Campaign is great, spec ops is great fun with a friend. Holds up well."
29,"muito bom
üëç"
30,back when cod cared
31,good game
32,buggy to the point of being unplayable
33,W .
34,classic original... developers knew what they were doing back then now ttey dont... too many micro-transactions these days to try to show how big your ego is
35,hey man this games is so fun. i remeber playing this when i was 6 years old
36,Good
37,IMO The best campaign out of all the COD's and one of the best Single Player experiences ever.
38,"sick but very short,i recommend and at the same time don't,the story line and gameplay is very good but the campaign is very short,other stuff like those small missions (don't remember the name) feels like a side quest in a modern Ubisoft game. The multiplayer is flooded with cheaters and toxic kids,i did not enter it after i saw 2 clips.+the price is pretty large. but if your father is Joe bidden and you like first person shooters get this game with Call Of Duty Modern Warfare and Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3 (Tbh really recommend)"
39,"If you have not played this game, I would like to exchange my brain with yours"
40,"(+) points
1. Damn Good Story , Just Mind Blowing.
2. Very Good Action
3. Iconic Villains
4. Spec Ops are just Awesome.
5. Optimized for Low Specs PC
6. Game Graphics are Too Good according to game release date time.

(-) Points
1. Multiplayer is Dead. If any chance get to play a match , Full of Hackers.

Verdict : This Game is totally awesome action packed FPS game. Don't miss this game. Don't need to play multiplayer.

Rating : 10 / 10"
41,"Fully understand how people see this as the best COD campaign. Every mission is fantastic back to the back, I highly recommend it."
42,"Fun game, but they didn't need to do my man Ghost dirty like that near the end. I want my 14 hours of life back"
43,"10/10

This game is without a doubt my favorite Call of Duty campaign. So many ICONIC moments, it feels like you are playing a fucking blockbuster movie. I've just finished playing this game for probably the 7th time and it seriously never gets old. This is the perfect Call of Duty campaign."
44,"Best game of the CoD MW Series. 
Totally recommend!"
45,"the story is not good as modern warfare 1, but is okay tho and the graphic is fire"
46,me likey
47,good
48,"Rip ghost :""("
49,Hitmarker
50,Its fun and has alot of nostalgia
51,the best dank game
52,Very Good.
53,Classic
54,looks bad as shit but only way I can play multiplayer so
55,Good
56,"Even though this is an old game I would still pick it up when on sale, ¬£19,99 for a 12-year-old game is too much, even though I bought a friend it so we can play spec ops for the memories and achievement as I decided to go back through old games and get the achievements to make the money spent on them worth it. 
would rate it 6/10 in 2022 just for it being an old game and the price of it, max would spend ¬£8.99 for it when on sale"
57,RAMIREZ!!!
58,super fun i recommend to buy cod 4 first then play it then buy this and play it then
59,no russian
60,Second best COD of all time. 'Nuff said
61,yes
62,It is good.
63,"I was playing multiplayer when I joined a server and the host was saying the n-word over and over again. Then, he unlocked every item somehow boosting my account from level 4 or 5 to level 70 taking literally all the fun out of progressing. Terrible game."
64,Very good game
65,I love call of duty modern warfare so much!!!!!
66,"Just played the campaign for the first time all the way through in one sitting. It was my first CoD, ever. Holy shit."

69,best game ever :')
70,Ramirez! Take Point!
71,Great game with solid gameplay and great story as well 10/10
72,"Very good, unrealistic tho, shooter game ever. Better then 1st part, and all recommendations!"
73,Sooo meny Memories
74,"There is a reason the game is regarded as one of the best in the series.

"
75,gaming
76,"One of the best shooters of its time , sadly outdated and the cod series is just a shell of its former self.
Only has like a 100 players left 
remaining playable modes : TDM FFA and if you are lucky a single lobby of S&D / Domination
Plagued with hackers and modded lobby (usually the host turns on godmode or just kicks you out if you are better then him)
if you still have the game check it for a little bit of nostalgya but defnetly do not buy this anymore !"
77,good game nice campaign and multiplayer.
78,10/10
79,very god game other than slurs. lots and lots of slurs.
80,yes
81,"This is by far the most broken PC port of a game I've ever witnessed. 
Yes, even Red Dead Redemption 2 and Bully Scholarship Edition. Because RDR2 eventually got fixed and Bully has fan patches. 

This game has no controller support. The whole thing runs at 1 frame per second. Changing the resolution causes the game to stop responding, and worse, lock up your screen, meaning you need to go to another desktop, open task manager, and end the task from there. 

Tried looking up fixes. Nothing. It's all old posts about the multiplayer or about the remaster. Do not buy this."
82,"Graphics are so cool, love it!"
83,x
84,please come back to multiplayer
85,One of the classic call of duty games. Still a lot of fun today!
86,good game
87,gun

93,"[h1] Hi gamers today i'll be rating Cod MW2. [/h1]

This game is a classic Call of duty game and for me this game is the best cod game you can play. (second is mw 2019)
I firstly played this game back in 2013 in my Playstaton 3 i guess and also this game is the first Call of Duty game i played.
This game's graphics are meh for 2022 but its still fun too play mechanics are good i recommend you to play this game if you have a low end pc setup. (Have a great day!)

Makarov why you killed me ):<"
94,good
95,the game is sick
96,y e s
97,"Brings me back to the old days with my cousins.

115,"iw4x for multiplayer
good times for spec ops and campaign"
116,"I do recommend this as the older call of duty games are more fun, especially better than vanguard, but if your worried about hackers as i heard this does have some issues where they can access your pc I suggest trying IW4X its a modded client that allows you to play the game without this worry."
117,"Awesome, remind me of the good old days when dad was screaming at mom in the kitchen and little me sitting in my room scared to death with my headphones over my ears playing awesome modern warfare slaying DUDES :D"

121,Good Game
122,911 was a national tragedy.
123,Classic
124,"At first had some issues with constant black screens and the game freezing up a couple of hours of playing. I was able to fix the problem after re-installing. However, all my progress for special ops and campaign had been erased. A bit frustrating to get to the last few missions only to have that progress reset after a re-install.

The only things I enjoyed about mw2 were the special ops, multiplayer (if there are no cheaters), and the soundtrack. The campaign was just mediocre. I was able to beat the story on veteran in less than 5hrs. One of those 5hrs was just doing the final boat mission ""Endgame""."
125,Great Game!
126,A classic bro! This one. Not whatever Activision is naming their games now.
127,9.5 of 10.
128,GREAT GAME LOTS OF FUN.
129,The Best FPS Trilogy Of All Time. (Part Two)
130,"While playing you need to be afraid of your data getting stolen, or your pc getting compromised."
131,"Awesome game, best CoD imo"
132,"replayed it since i preordered the new one, good"
133,the best call of duty by far this made my childhood
134,"2 best call of duty game

138,along with mw 3 and 4 these games are the best ive played within cod
139,I got this for my grandson and a week later I heard him yelling words I didn't even know were legal to say. It's safe to say that he will be getting Peggle for Christmas next year.

190,"Amazing classic game, the game has great story and its super fun the only problem is that in multiplayer there is a ton of hackers but in general great game play!"
191,"The campaign for this games makes no sense. It's narrative is contrived, full of holes and is over in four hours. Core gameplay is fine but it's spoiled by spammy enemies and poor sigh due to the most obnoxious ""blood on screen"" effect so far. Cod and WaW were better"
192,Good game
193,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is one of my favorite FPS games ever. I have to mention at the outset that I'm a fan of the COD series, so you may not share the joy of the game with me like I do, but I'll try to tell you why I think Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best parts of the series. If you are not interested in multiplayer, then I can calm you down, because the campaign is amazing here. One of the best locations we've ever seen in COD and a great story that builds on the previous Modern Warfare.

Yes. Soap is back and it's even crazier than before. But it must be said that this is also perhaps the only minus of the game. The biggest change in this work compared to the previous ones is the action. The game won't let you breathe and it just has a fast pace that doesn't stop. You won't find such a slow mission here and each is full of exploding objects. It's a great change and after finishing it, you can simply that it was a ride. I recommend."

201,i cant believe they made a sequal to black ops 2...
202,"10/10 Back when COD was amazing.

Do not play MP on Steam, there is an exploit called RAT that can give hackers full access to your PC. 
Download a program called i w 4 x (without the spaces) and use that to find your Steam version files and then you can play using their dedicated servers with enhanced security."
203,I'm still worthy!
204,awesome
205,"CALL OF DUTY STEAM VETERAN JOURNEY
doing all cods on veteran in order. Spoilers below. Modern Warfare 2 was an absolute blast to play through even on Veteran. Besides a few solo sections early on this game wasn't too challenging and the difficulty felt perfect. Not to mention this game has the best story to date imo (ive always been more of a modern warfare kid over Treyarch in terms of story at least). Cant get better than General Sheppard and his 200 IQ plan of getting his own people killed. Love how it connects to the previous instalment with the nuke as well. This was the best purchase so far, i highly recommend. I will try to give whatever tips i can but this is fairly easy.

Tips:
- Use predator missles whenever possible, hit fire then fire again to launch as many as you can quickly
- Also use targeting lasers whenever they are available to you
- On the oil rig level, when the smokescreens start, grab a thermal weapon right by the first boxes.
- On the last level with the boat stay on the left most path
- The solo section in the villa will be trial and error, there are plenty of checkpoints if the area is cleared out tho. hide in buildings when possible
- In the Makerov safe house level hide upstairs while defening, easy. was worried about this level but it was fine

Thoughts:
- Felt like reliving my childhood, i previously beat this game on veteran before.
- Price storyline is why he is my favourite character ever in any COD game. Russians would of had their way if he didnt ignore sheperd and nuke above the battlefield. brilliant strategy to emp all forces.
- Foley and the crew never show again (probably for the better) i hope they are okay in this original timeline. What an effective team, no losses.
- They better put good use to Ghost in the remakes.

On to the black ops series, very excited."
206,"Idk how i got 743 hours

207,As most of us have all experienced this game from our beloved childhood i dont have to say much. but cpt price never dies.

The campaign is a lot of fun and can be played on Veteran for players who know at least a little shooter.

Unfortunately, the multiplayer is almost unplayable on the computer because of all the cheaters in the multiplayer.

10/10 would recommend it to everyone just to play the story, maybe there will be better times for the MP."

310,They can illegally commander your computer and call you racist slurs. Story is one of the best
311,yes very fun used to play long time ago very fun game cool
312,"The COD: MW2 (2009) is one the best, most infamous, meme'd, CoD campaigns, and that is almost fact. I'm not saying it's the '#1 best cod campaign ever', but in my opinion it is one of the best. It has decent graphics, and satisfying weapons. The story is good and fairly interesting. It has a great plot, with the perfect amount of twists, which aren't harmful to the structure/story integrity. The story and it's gripping plot is also what MW2 is known for. 

Besides the campaign, special ops has plenty of missions and co-op to play after, some are based off the campaign.

In multiplayer, all of the maps are amazing, and a few are well-known in CoD history. Multiplayer is very satisfying, and not too difficult. 

You can equip 1 attachment to your primary weapon, and 2 attachments if you use the perk 'Bling'. All of the perks you use will eventually upgrade to pro and their ability will become better. For example, if I use the perk 'Bling' long enough, I will unlock 'Bling Pro' which now allows me to equip 2 ATTACHMENTS to my PRIMARY, but ALSO 1 ATTACHMENT to my SECONDARY because it is the Pro perk. 

Some people can hack your account's level and max it out, so then you have unlocked all the weapons. This isn't really bad in my opinion, it just means free weapons. You probably won't be hacked with this unless you anger a hacker, so just try not to aggravate anyone."
313,"the buttons like Esc 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0 and G doesnt even work in multiplayer mode, in singeplayer they do... bad."
314,great game for campaign and multiplayer
315,"Best cod game in my opinion, story is really good. I never really played online but ive heard it was good."
316,The OG modern warfare is still the best.
317,"One of the best games out there and probably the best COD game ever considering when it was created. Pulls out the big guns in terms of graphics, story and interaction. Guns are great, missions are great, everything just keeps on giving. Improved from the previous part of the trilogy, is just a marvel, a must play for any gamer that enjoys FPS.

Solid 10/10

322,"Game is excellent, arguably the best Call of Duty of all time. Playing as the Army Rangers just amazes me. The adaption of the ACR made this game great as well. I would recommend this game because of its combination of basic and advanced military fighting."

328,"An excellent, but slightly flawed follow up to the perfect FPS. Story had some great twists and turns. The music was phenomenal, even better than the first game. The character development was excellent and the voice acting really shines in this game. My only critique is that the level design didn't quite hit the mark set by the first Modern Warfare for several missions (particularly Takedown), but on a whole it was still leagues better than most FPS titles."
329,"love it

330,"Multiplayer is kinda overrated, campaign is really good tho"

382,"To be fair, I played this game when it came out on xbox, so right off the bat i already have love for the game, it is certainly a gem for its time and always will be, It was one of those games that were legendary in my childhood, and when activision still cared about making good games, Would i recommend this to someone? Yes, without hesitation, if your wanting to get into COD id start here, well more accurately with the first ones and make your way to MW3 then the first and second black ops, past that its where it gets patchy. ANYWAY, those are my thoughts, take it from someone who's been playing the game on and off since release and flipped out about 360 no scopes back in the day"
383,"Tried it for a bit, kinda meh."
384,very fun
385,I absolutely love this game. Definitely my favorite call of duty of all time. Something about the snipers in this game was just amazing. Everything is op so basically that means nothing is haha. This game is a game you should own on steam. Beware of the hackers though!! It is an old game. But still none the less private matches with friends are fun asf.
386,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
387,altough this game made many people cry on the shepard betrayl still very fun and amazing mp. by far the 2nd best CoD campaign
388,airport
389,"Buy this game before it gets removed from the store, like the GTA games!

10/10 Game, still awesome game!"
390,This Game Is Fun And Nostalgic
391,one of the most fun campaign i have played
392,Best COD Campaign here at the moment + best multiplayer.
393,"the best, good story, good graphics, good characters"
394, really good
395,my childhood right here
396,"the classic cod
"
397,"If I could go back and tell my younger self to try the multiplayer before it died, I would. The campaign, though, boyos and gorls, isn't as iconic as I remember. If you read my review for MW3, my mind basically replaced part of that story with this one, so I remember some of the amazing moments from MW3 happening in this game. Don't get me wrong, the story isn't bad. I'd give it at least a B-tier alongside futanari hentai, but some of the missions become a drag when you're basically just sitting there holding your position in, like, half of them. Shepard's betrayal, though, still gets me to this day. It was a huge turning point in this series, and as a connoisseur of Call of Duty, and a hype man for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022), I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to replay the story."
398,Best game ever!
399,shoot gun yes
400,good game
401,"I mean.. its a classic. Hands down one of the absolute best Call of Duty games out there. The campaign is incredible. MW2 and MW3 will ALWAYS be my favorite COD's. If you are into FPS.. this is certainly a must. I do NOT regret revisiting and will continue to do so. Now the achievement hunt shall begin. Seriously tho, buy this and play the campaign through. you will not be disappointed"
402,The Best game of the COD
403,"Big And Not Gay
"
404,Just a classic game that needs to be replayed every once in awhile. The nostalgia is real with this one.
405,Shephard deserved to die.
406,Good. That's one less loose end.
407,"good game, run wack on linux, but the pc port is broken in general, good story, decent spec ops, try ur best to find a lobby without hackers in mp"
408,"Great game, Sad story, I really enjoyed it though very nostalgic for me since I was playing call of duty at five years old, im now 14 soon to be 15 :skull: I HATE MYSELF PLEASE HELP ME"
409,"The game used to be great, now the host regularly crashes in the game, there are more and more hackers who use wh or aim and you can't stop them and none of them does anything, the servers are a disaster, you exit the lobby and go to a lobby again and connect that you were on and that one is full of hackers. In short, don't buy this garbage of a game."
410,"Bro, Dude, Man. This is one of best games I ever played Bro please buy this game it is good  yea good buy it the price of"
411,"good but ghost dies :(

me sad :(

9/10 kinda short but epic"
412,Call of Duty was a mistake
413,"Amazing storyline, Fuel to my childhood, 10/10"
414,good game good war crimes
415,"Since you can get this masterpiece for just 20 bucks or less now, i recommend just playing it.
If you never heard about it or never played a Call of Duty what so ever, just play the singleplayer first.
The multiplayer can be quite frustrating because of the so called ""Noobtubers"". Expect to die a lot by quite unbalanced explosions. But as soon as you get your first nuke you will forget about all the bad things you experienced in the multiplayer."
416, -
417,I had a graphics problem at first but than I fixed it and now I can recommend this perfect game but they should fully remaster the entire game
418,"mt bom adorei  mas tem mt trihard

420,400 hours on multiplayer.
421,RAMIREZ!
422,"i would only recomend it for campaign or to play SpecOps with your friends, both are great and fun, but multiplayer has an exploit where people can enter your PC, so dont try mp and play the other modes,"
423,"good campaign

multiplayer is fun if you can find matches

spec ops is cool, even more so if you play with a friend"
424,very gud game

Only thing that‚Äôs caught my eye so far, keep up the great work!"

Not words in Russian."
441,"this game was released in 2009, but it's worth to play and buy in 2022. The story is amazing tho."
442,"Singleplayer wise,  this game is really great;   The campaign is fun, brutal and exciting through and through.   The cast of characters, new and returning, are really memorable and you start to feel a connection to them though the story telling.   Lot's of twists, turns and unexpected thrilling action in this COD."
443,"im a huge war fan and this fits it perfectly
"
444,The Best in call of Duty
445,"Pretty fun Game overall, Had a good 9-10 hours with Campaign, and then Tried Multiplayer, Made it to Level 7, then a modder made me level 70, so now I'm going to go and spend more money on a Call of Duty Game that I will probably play for 20 hours then move on to another game"
446,hi
447,one of the best cods ever
448,e
449,Have to trust someone to be betrayed...I never did
450,"C'mon it's MW2 from 2009 if you didn't play this back then on PC, Xbox 360 or PS3 you missed out but servers are quite alive on PC and the campaign is STILL as fun and good as I remember. 10/10 love reliving young memories of accidentally being like 7 and playing No Russian lol"

455,On its time was the GOTY. thank you Infinity Ward!
456,"Legendary game. This was the first online game I got addicted to back on the Xbox 360 years ago and it still holds up really well.

Btw if you wanna play mulitolayer download the I W 4 X mod (Steam censors I W 4 X) since it protects you from annoying weird hackers

480,bEST campaign ever i was so sad at the end
481,"To this day this game holds its amazing title with its vastly large timeline of nostalgia, the campaign is a ride of movie like action sequences never leaving you out of the action! Multiplayer is as broken as it always was making it a fun experience for everyone new and old! Spec ops includes friends on the fun of some of the multiplayer objectives! This game is a nostalgic joy ride for fans new and old!"
482,Simply the best.

THE BEST COD and also THE BEST SHOOTER GAME in history. There is nothing better than this game. As Multiplayer, as single player, as spec ops this game is best of all times.

Even with them this game is the best. And I am still suck :)"

561,I don't like the cost of this game but It's still fucking great
562,"Pre-woke COD campaigns are the best COD campaigns, and this is the very best of those IMO. What a ride! 

MW2 stands up even today in 2022, and I enjoyed it so much this second time around that I will probably buy the remaster soon, and then the new MW2 as well.

The only thing I didn't love was the weapon sounds, which were extremely weak in these early CODs. Despite that, this is a hell of a good time anyway!"

564,Short campaign but still very fun
565,"I didn't want to pay for xBox Live for my 360 so I bought MW2 on PC and it sucked balls so I refunded it
Then I rebought the game because IW4X exists and adds native 360 Controller support and more performance options ¬∞-¬∞"
566,The classic
567,it has alot of story and the bad guys are the best villains out of all call of duty games

572,"DO NOT BUY GAME AS SERIOUS SECURITY ISSUES SAME WITH ALL CODS PRE WWII
"
573,"
Another game I played to death on console, albeit with no PSN or XBL access, splitscreen FTW baby.

I don't really have anything major to say about the singleplayer or spec ops, the game still runs fine on windows and dying old toasters. Game was good back in the day and it's still good now.

There aren't as many people playing official MW2 multiplayer as there is for MW1/COD4, but its still better than the ZERO people playing MW3. You'll find maybe 300 odd people max, and only in TDM lobbies, as MW2's progression system locks playlists behind rank advancement. IE: wanna play S&D? guess what, nobody's on it, even IF you rank up, lol.

I'd imagine there's (maybe) more folks on third party launchers, but then you'd have to contend with servers and all the BS rules their admins enforce. So pick your poison.

There are hackers as other users have reported, I've been in plenty of lobbies with 'em, there's also some modded dedicated servers you will occasionally get dropped into. Some of these fellas are alright, they'll either help you with unlocks and XP boosts or just screw around most of the time. (change the TDM match to domination for example, maybe disable your grenades / noob tube.) Play at your own risk I suppose. Same as any other old COD title.

Game's still fun, the novelty of being able to get into some matches still is alright, don't pay full price for this game regardless, don't buy the DLC map-pack, nobody's on it and its still full price.

...One last thing, ""Modern Warfare 2 (2009)"" huh? Should've called the new one Modern Warfare 5 you unoriginal hacks.

And your new ""ghost"" looks like a muppet with that half metal halloween balaclava. You go for ""ultra tactical realism"" and somehow make a guy who looks dumber and goofy compared to OG Ghost, at least his wool mask was cool looking and subdued. You could imagine a special forces guy wearing one for giggles and grins. I can't imagine anyone in their right mind wearing that bulky plastic thing MW4/5 has plastered all over the marketing, gotta make flashy skins to chase that $ right? lmao.

584,"This game moved me from console to PC gaming when it came out.. we built a clan, won clan battles, recorded hackers for YouTube, had t-shirts made and became lifelong friends. Now I'm installing it while waiting for MW2 (2022) to come out as it will continue this story and I want to go into the new game 'ready' for the new chapter."
585,"this game is amazing, great story telling, great campaign, great multiplayer.
very nostalgic and is worth the money.

599,MW2. MW2. MW2 ties with World At War and Black Ops and Black Ops II as my favorite COD
600,i love fish
601,poggers
602,I bought this game just to play the story which is kinda weird because most people buy a call of duty game for both the story and the multiplayer but this game has such a good story that somehow make you feel so much for such a little story its that good
603,it is good but after 7 missions so my game becomes blank so i give it 3/5
604,graphics on max still look amazing for a 2009 game

616,10/10 3/>
617,Only the best COD game
618,"This is easily one of the best entry in the Call of Duty franchise at least in terms of campaign. It's an action-packed cinematic experience that makes you feel like an unstoppable force. The story is interesting, its characters are iconic and the gameplay is solid. It takes around 8 hours to complete and there wasn't a dull moment as the variety of scenarios keep things interesting. Despite being from 2009, it performs well and without technical issues or bugs at least to my personal experience. I can't say I've experienced the multiplayer in the recent years as I've done so in the past but obviously buying the game now for the multiplayer is generally considered folly. However for the single-player fps experience it is still worth playing for the first time for some mindless fun at the very least."
619,FUN
620,good
621,Great action!
622,"Hey Nick,

I know you see this in your activity feed.

Get fucked."
623,Very nostalgic
624,"""Good that's one less loose end"""
625,"Still has its charm. The mechanics are still smooth as ever. 

Don‚Äôt play online through steam though. Download I-W-4x or XLabs for a better multiplayer experience that won‚Äôt lead to your PC getting hacked."
626,"Wait for a sale, this game isn't worth how much I paid for it. I regret this buy honestly, if you like the COD series then definitely get it because you'll need it to understand the series I guess."
627,"good game
"
628,"the only good call of duty is the one on the wii, Ds, and Gameboy Advance all others suck"
629,yes
630,good game but play it on xlabs aka iw4x
631,"Game play wise its pretty solid? But overall the game gets repetitive. I'm aware what type of series COD is and knew to expect a very ""action movie you can play"" type experience. The issue is that it follows that too closely. Very few times can you really take on a situation how you want. Most levels are shooting galleries with infinitely spawning enemies, that don't stop until you start moving forward. It's the type of game you play when you just want to shoot at stuff. But there are still much better games for that. Story wise it's a generic war hero tale that you forget about in week or so. Again the game play is fine but all-in-all I can't recommend this game with how ""meh"" it is."
632,Remember. No russian.
633,just play the game - easily top 3 cod games
634,Game won't start up says servers are down. What should i do
635,This game is outstanding.
636,good
637,Filled with action but also who like those tactical missions you can play that way if you wanted too
638,the enemy ac from above got me killed
639,"the best .. 
"
640,xtgfchvy b
641,"CoD: MW2 is a really good older FPS game. I don't play for the multiplayer but I enjoyed the campaign a lot. For a 2009 game the graphics are really good. The soundtrack is fantastic (Hans Zimmer is famous for movies like Gladiator etc). I found no bugs and the story was reasonably interesting, if a bit confusing. 

For the initial asking of $60 I'd say the campaign is way too short. Playing on moderate difficulty you could probably go through it in a few hours. For the modern price of $20, it's not too bad. Playing on Veteran difficulty will take a lot longer as it's an exercise in patience and frustration. They take one shot kills seriously in that mode."
642,GHOST turns into thanksgiving turkey
643,"best game ever
"
644,One of the best COD campaigns of all time.

649,"Just insane, the best MW game"
650,No idea how many times I have played this game from start to finish. It's such a great game and well worth it. Highly recommended.
651,yes
652,Undoubtedly the best COD
653,:(
654,"Old Gold, nothing more to tell..."
655,The campaign alone is worth the twenty dollars
656,nice
657,"Five years after the events of the last part, it's bad again with the world and especially with America. New fighters have risen, one would say, so that after the killed arch-terrorist Imran Zakhaev, whom the Russians now bless as a hero, perhaps even worse villain Vladimir Makarov is taking over. He wants to settle accounts with the hated superpower once and for all and avenge his fallen predecessor.

Remember SAS Sergeant John MacTavish? He has been promoted to captain and will now be your partner. Like another veteran, Captain Price. With these cheerful guys, in 18 missions divided into 3 acts, which is practically the same number of levels as last time, you will look mainly at the post-Soviet republics. That is, to the aforementioned Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, to the slums under the statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro and to the Arctic oil rig. You will also visit Petropavlovsk, the Georgian-Russian border or a secret prison in a remote Russian monastery, aptly named Gulag.
And, of course, not a bit of that pathos can be missing, so you repel the surprise invasion at home in Virginia, and the finale will offer the Washington Capitol neighborhood, total ruins at the time.
You will once again take on the roles of several elite soldiers whose task is to intervene against current terrorist threats around the world.

COD again relies on a dramatic atmosphere and adrenaline experience, which is sometimes too chaotic and sometimes kitschy. Yet no one else can do it better. [b] 90% [/b]"

692,"It's a challenging game. Very fun to play. I played Campaign on Single Player mode. Played using the K & M, not a hand controller & it was pretty interesting. This is the first game I've ever played using K & M. The story line is easy to follow and entertaining. I really like the artistry work on this game as well; it's life like & realistic looking. There a good variety of weapons to choose from in the game so it doesn't become too stagnant on weapon selections. You don't get to customize but the weapons they start you off with in every scenario is sufficient. I've not played online co-op but I can imagine that it would be fun. Hope you guys enjoy it!!!"

If you're getting it for Singleplayer or Spec Ops then I suppose its fine, but the core experience of the game is its Multiplayer. Also Singleplayer can be played in a much more enjoyable way with the remaster, so really this is only if you want to play Spec Ops."
721,"price is back, just with more power! Also, the game is very good, but i recommend to play first Modern warfare"

Do NOT play in Steam multiplayer! Download a 3rd parrty program called Xlabs or Plutonium for ALL your older CoD's that you play on PC!

734,good and fun classic
735,"Great continuation of the first revolutional CoD series. The game focuses on effects: more, more and more scripted events that gives this sweet as honey cinematic experience. The story had to be bigger and jaw-opening, but I for me the scenario is a bit too exaggerated at the moments.

Mechanics has been improved, pushing forward doesn't work anymore, your bot friends won't clear the map for you just because you rushed ahead. Now you've got to actually eliminate your enemies. Anyway, the missions are now more various so your approach would differ chapter to chapter.

There was a lot more on my mind to mention, but I played those Spec Ops missions for so long I forgot what did I want to say about the actual main game. Anyway, it's the game that doesn't need to be reviewed. It's a great 'a must' position you've got to play and that's it."

[b]Why[/b]: Playing Modern Warfare 2 right after Modern Warfare Remastered let me pay more attention to the story and be more invested in it. It was also great to get all the achievements one after the other. The story is still great following Roach in the newly formed Task Force 141. While still keeping up with our favorite characters Soap and Price, we also follow James Ramirez and Joseph Allen in the Rangers. Through and through this game is fun, the story is engaging and has some good twists which was surprising when I played it as a kid. There is only one mission that I wasn‚Äôt crazy about which was Team Player but besides that I loved every mission, especially every mission in DC. I can‚Äôt say this enough that every mission in DC needs to be experienced, Call of Duty fan or not these missions are beautiful and have such a good ending. The Spec Ops is fun and brings some replayability if you don‚Äôt want to do multiplayer. All the missions are different and fun but 2 missions I didn‚Äôt like which are both co-op missions. If you don‚Äôt have anyone to play with and you can‚Äôt find anyone to play with then you won‚Äôt be able to get all the achievements, which I hate because I don‚Äôt want to be limited in an older game that many people aren‚Äôt playing anymore. Besides that, the music is great just like the first Modern Warfare, the only songs of note are the main menu and the credits which are cool to listen to and the graphics are updated and look really good compared to the first game. This game is a great pickup so if you‚Äôre looking for a new game to play then I would get this but I would also wait for a sale since this game is still dated, better than the remastered version though."
768,"Cool game, con: if you dont have it"

770,its a classic

772,Very good CoD Game for its publishing time
773,"La campa√±a es una maravilla, sin embargo si no vienes por la campa√±a, pon tus ojos en otro juego, para empezar si quieres jugar directamente por steam se dice que los hackers te pueden hasta meter virus en la computadora, sinceramente no estoy seguro pero igual  esta infestado de wallhacks, por otro lado si quieres probar el multijugador, puedes probar usando 
i - w - 4 - x(quita los guiones) que es un software para incluir el juego y abrir servidores creados por la comunidad, la conexion va bien y todo eso, pero esta lleno de pura tryhard, yo no juego tanto y no suelo adivinar por donde vienen los enemigos asi que se me hace en vez de ser divertido frustrante, desde el killstreak de helicoptero en el cual tantito apareces y ya volviste a morir y el vato que adivina donde reaparecen los enemigos.

Es una pena por que el juego esta muy bien."

Excellent missions, campaigns and CO-OP.

863,Classic.
864,Reminds me of when I loved games enough to not care about the plot holes
865,"Just completed the campaign, and all I've gotta say is this game is a work of art. Bit of a backstory, I've played Call of Duty Warzone before this game. Seeing places like the gulag for example in it's first form was exciting. I played through the entire story on Veteran difficulty, and it was a real challenge. It really made you feel like you were in the moment. If I had to play this campaign over again, only thing I'd be disappointed about is not being able to experience it for the first time again. I was just flabbergasted during the fight between Price and Shepherd, and that feeling is something I'd never be able to experience again. One of my favorite jaw-dropping parts was the city power outage, because once you reach the roof you feel a huge sense of relief. 
Either way, fucking love this game. Recommend 100%."

874,"Steam version of this game isn't great. P2P matchmaking, no community servers, and most of the player base is cheaters. Play the IW¬≠4x client instead."
875," I'm not much of a CoD person, in fact this was only my third entry into the series. And, I must say, this game deserves the hype. The sheer, wild originality and mayhem of the campaign is at once a magnificent thrill ride into modern warfare and a chaotic blockbluster clusterf**k. But MW2 wears its frantic and wild presentation with pride and doesn't shirk the more tender aspects of warfare, though not to the perfect degree of World at War. Through the entirety of its short six hour campaign MW2 does not once slip up or cease to impress; one set piece after another, each more bombastic and awe inspiring than the last, makes every mission a unique adventure on its own. The game's overarching story elements aren't half bad, either, with moments of the game's plot beats managing to elicit a fair emotional response. It is certainly no masterpiece in the direction of storytelling, but for Call of Duty is stands as a monumental achievement of video game design. The musical score, the environments, the characters, every single piece of the game's puzzle falls into place. I must say for someone disengaged with the CoD franchise, someone who had, for all his life, been weary of it, found this game to be one hell of a ride. Where CoD 4 slipped and fell short, MW2 proved its better: the enemy encounters don't stagnant nearly as much, the gameplay is much more fast-paced and enjoyable; everything from the music, the level design, and the story is better than before. This is a fantastic game and an excellent shooter to boot. 8.5/10. What a game."
876,"Still the best COD Campaign!

Personally, I had a lot of fun with this campaign. So many interesting missions and locations, featuring some of the best COD characters in the series. The main villain in this game is a good example of how you subvert expectations."

918,"An excellent followup to the original Modern Warfare, with music by one of my favorite composer duos (Hans Zimmer/Lorne Balfe) and one of the most controversial, yet pivotal missions in the franchise that veritably puts you in the deep end of the complexities of war. Still holds up well as of this review (13 years, right? Whoa!)"

951,"glitch made me restart the whole campaign, but this is an overall good game"
952,"2nd mission when you go undercover is super fun
100/1 KD"
953,masterpiece
954,I cried for 3 hours because of 1 mission in the campaign
955,"yeah dude
"
956,This game was so good back in the days. Today you can pretty much only play Team Deathmatch. Too many hackers and Domination maybe works once in a while. The DLC's doesn't work anymore. I can't believe this game even costs money today. Consider that the game's barely playable today the price is just way too much even when it's on sale.
957,fun
958,No controller support = garbage. Uninstalled right away.
959,Now I see what everyone has been talking about...
960,"i feel like this MW is the least enjoyable for some people, but for me its very good. without this, the trilogy would have looked way different, both to good or bad. multiplayer is really good, storyline also, sometimes you get across missions that are way too fucky and RNG."
961,"Great game, Fun if you have nothing to do"
962,"Superb when I was 19, superb now that I'm 32. I think this is the best campaign CoD has overall, alongside MW1 and MW3. Call it nostalgia goggles but I've always played this at least once a year since it came out, super fun to return to it once in a while."
963,i cannot express how much i love this game
964,good. thats one less loose end.
965,Special Ops missions are very nice

980,"Ok I'm an Old COD Player, playing COD since I was like 10 !! Won 2 Championship in my country so kinda can say Me and COD are bound together <3


But Here is my review about this game which I refunded it minutes after buying it :


The Game; Call Of Duty MW2 is a masterpiece, who ever is real COD Player already knew that this COD game is one of the best COD ever made, it's a game which is still alive and after 13 of being released gamers are still enjoying it! BUT :


Of boy we always had problems with COD Anti-Cheat system which mostly I can there isn't any Anti-cheat at all! Literally first game of multi-player got hacked on which is a disappointment!!

Anti-cheat has always been a big gap and problem in ""Activision"" games which even today In New released game we still have this problem ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm voting up this game only for the fact that it's a masterpiece and on the bottom of my heart I really wanna this multimillionaire company to do something for Anti-cheat"
981,It's MW2
982,"Multiplayer: 6/10.
Positives of Multiplayer: Brings back the old nostalgic memories of mw2 on Xbox 360 and the good old days they brang.
Negatives of Multiplayer: Due to the game's age, the lobbies are completely dead. Only lobbies I can find are team deathmatch and even in those lobbies there's barely any people. Another negative is the amount of hackers there are in public matches, just terrible.

Special Ops: 8/10
Not much to say except for that it's simply great. Although a lot of the stuff that you do is based off what happens in the campaign, it's fun to play and challenging sometimes, especially when trying to get the three stars.

Campaign: 10/10
Absolutely brilliant game mode, and definitely the best aspect of this game. It's a true masterpiece, the story, graphics and everything is so well done. It's probably one of the best cod campaigns ever made. (P.S I played through the full cod campaign first before making this review)

Overall: 9/10
This is one of the best Cod games ever made, and brings back the good old memories of Xbox 360 and the infamous Cod lobbies. The graphics are outstanding even though the game is 13 years old, it was truly ahead of it's time. What's also great is that this game can run on a potato at 60fps, at 1080p. Only negative would be the price tag, 27 dollars is quite a high price tag for a game that's 13 years old. I'm also kind of sad that zombies isn't in this game, but it's fine.

I highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy this, it's an outstanding game."
983,Masterpiece.
984,"Basically its typical ea, activision, ubisoft you name it, copy paste and do nothing good."
985,"Spent my childhood playing this masterpiece and acquired my first VAC ban on this game. with love and peace i still regret loading it with mods, DONT DO IT its been 2600 days and im still haunted by being labelled a hacker."

991,This game is a fucking masterpiece. Get it.

I played this game just after playing cod4mw1 so it was getting repetitive. My motivation to play was the wonder for the final. Last acts and final was really good. Still playable in 2022. You feel it is old but still good.
Edit: I thought that Ghost was a important character for story but then I learnt that he is not."

1025,"This is one of my favorite games of all time (along with COD4) and remember playing this when it first came out.  There is still a strong online multiplayer base so you can easily hop online and find multiplayer games to join.   This game has aged well, the graphics are still excellent even by modern standards, and is just as enjoyable to play now as it was 13 years ago.   It's also very light on system requirements, so you can play it on an old PC, laptop, etc and it runs great."
1026,"i dont think mw2 is the best game in the franchise. The campaign is really solid, even tho it has some annoying moments in veteran, like the favela levels or the safe house from loose ends. 
Spec ops was the most frustrating. Like all old cods, the PC port is absolute garbage so there's no lan or splitscreen coop, only solo and online play. No remote play together, of course. So you are locked out of a few spec ops achievements unless you buy a friend the game, which isnt that easy because this game is still hella expensive for a 10yo game.
Though only two missions are coop exclusive, most of the veteran versions feel impossible in solo. Juggernauts have to be the most annoying enemy in the entire game and devs just paste them into every veteran difficulty they can find. The Echo set of missions is simply ridiculous.

Then there's the multiplayer. Its an instant classic? yeah. It has some pretty obvious balancing issues that never got fixed, the dlc's split the playerbase, there's no crossplay and the matchmaking is just awful. No dedicated servers, bad anticheat, etc etc.
and without dedicated servers, that also means the maps are totally random. and some maps are absolute bangers, but most are trash. like, hot garbage.

recomended? yeah, i guess, but dont expect a lot from it."

I'm not very good at it, but it is an AMAZING game, and I can see why people love it so much, I'm only 14(got the game when i was ALMOST 13, so not quite 2 years ago but about a year and a quarter ago) and I've never seen myself as an FPS gamer, but now that I've played this, I can see myself getting into them in the future.

1080,A must try. Back when COD was good. Pure classic
1081,"While my total playtime on Steam may look short, believe me when I say I've put in hundreds of hours into this ABSOLUTE BEAST of a game back in my early teenage years from 2010-2013 on my Xbox 360 and PS3, or as I like to call it ""The Golden Age of Gaming.""

Where do I even start with Modern Warfare 2, this game, along with Black Ops 1 were GIGANTIC to the gaming industry back in a time when flip phones were still relevant, midnight releases for games at a local Gamestop had long lines that stretched to the end of their shopping centers, and YouTube was a place to watch prerecorded videos of people playing MW2, Halo 3, or Battlefield Bad Company 2 on ole' Machinima (Seananners, Hutch, ONLYUSEmeBLADE, WoodysGamertag etc.). Back when all the kids in school wouldn't shut up for days about their KDs and quickscope trickshots and everybody wanting to be like Ghost.

Fast forward to present day 2022, MW2 may be a shell of its old self online with all the hackers on all platforms and the infamous RCE exploit on PC that LITERALLY LETS PEOPLE BACKDOOR HACK INTO YOUR PC (DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ONLINE WITHOUT USING A CERTAIN PROGRAM WITH A ""4"" IN ITS NAME OR YOUR PC IS IN HUGE DANGER). Campaign and Spec Ops wise though, MW2 is very much playable, and still as good as it was almost 13 years ago.

The campaign holds up beautifully, continuing 5 years after the events of Call of Duty 4 and throwing you into a world even more riddled with terrorists and traitors at every corner than in CoD 4. Now you've got the added bonus of a war between Russia and America over a massacre at a Moscow airport perpetrated by the main villain of Modern Warfare, Makarov who made it look like it was an attack by Americans. The whole game revolves around Soap MacTavish and later Captain Price, returning faces from CoD 4, to find and kill Makarov and end the war, all while also experiencing the game from the perspective of American troops fighting for their lives in a Washington D.C. mid Russian invasion. It's a short campaign compared to other Call of Dutys, but it's a campaign that's so memorable people still remember moments like General Shepherds betrayal, storming the White House, the No Russian mission, and RAMIREZ WE HAVE TO DEFEND THE BURGER TOWN!!!!! to this day.

Spec ops is an entertaining bunch of missions that can be done solo or coop with a friend, that have you completing objectives during certain moments from the campaign. For each mission you do well on you get 1-3 stars that let you unlock more missions until you reach the max of 69 (noice) stars. While it was a welcome addition to Call of Duty, and MW2 developer Infinity Wards response to Treyarchs World at Wars zombies mode and the MASSIVE success that was, it still pales in comparison to Zombies in my opinion, but Infinity Ward would go on to perfect spec ops in Modern Warfare 3.

Now comes MW2s main attraction, the multiplayer, back in MW2s heyday the game had thousands of lobbies littered with its infamous mic chats (you can see some of them on Youtube) where dudes with names like XxeL1TePu55ySlayXx, 420SnipezZz, or Goldbrain/Goldbrain2000 (my old PSN and XBL gamertags) would go release our pent up stress of the day by insulting each other nonstop through our cheap mics while flexing our ability to quickscope and ""not"" use noob tubes and commando knives. God forbid you were considered a noob or had a high pitched voice because dudes with deeper voices in middle of nowhere Michigan would have an open season on your ass in the lobbies. If you had beef with someone you would settle your differences in a 1v1 match on Rust snipers only. It was a place where a 12 year old and a 33 year old could insult each other in a lobby by claiming they banged the others mom or had a family member working for Microsoft or whatever. It was toxic, it was aggressive, it would make a Twitter users head explode these days, but it was our favorite pastime in America during a time when many of us were struggling during the great recession, and I wish I could relive those days again T_T

Today MW2 multiplayer on consoles is a hacker infested mess that's no longer updated or monitored by Activision (a future Microsoft developer who knows). On PC the game is also a hacked broken mess, but with the added RCE problem I mentioned earlier. Don't bother getting the DLC for this game if you haven't already, you wont find anyone to play with and you'll just get your PC hacked. If you do wish to experience MW2 multiplayer on PC with some level of ACTUAL security go find the lovely mod with the ""4"" in its name online and install that (No, you wont get VAC banned for playing that, quit saying it will those of you who know what it's called). Playing with that will allow you to play MW2 multiplayer in a more PC friendly way by allowing you to customize your FOV and other settings that you couldn't before all while giving you custom maps and weapons for your classes. Sometimes you may run into a hacked lobby, but you wont run the risk of getting you PC hacked if using the mod. When you find a good game (not hard to find) you're treated to the closest thing you could get to the old MW2 multiplayer experience from back in the day.

Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is one of those games where the saying ""You just had to be there"" can be easily applied to. If you were there in its glory days then you'll probably cry tears of nostalgia like I did seeing this game and any videos about it on YouTube or even hearing the background music from the main menu on an endless loop. No battle royale, no lootboxes, no microtransactions, no always online, no goofy dances, no silly camos or attachments, no season passes. The only game to make a night owl like me become an early bird and wake up at 7am on a Saturday in 2011 to grind xp for another prestige level. To those of you who remember all this, I salute you.

Oh, and one more thing...

QUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1082,Unfucking balanced. All you do is die on the last misssion. Waste of my nerves who ever made this go die

1101,Great game
1102,9000+ hours. No Nuke :(
1103,one of the best...
1104,Buy for story mode
1105,Amazing campaign. amazing game-play with a variety of environments/atmosphere and mission types. just so fucking good I wish I never missed out on this gem in 2009
1106,It good game
1107,No russian ?
1108,I found the campaign could have been longer but still enjoyed it. The multiplayer was also really fun to play.
1109,"very gud coll of doty recommend 
"
1110,shits dank as hell
1111,"Good game, not as good as MW1 imo, but it is pretty good."
1112,"Favorite CoD in the whole franchise. Shit never lost it's charm, makes modern CoDs and other FPS titles look like a joke."
1113,g
1114,Do I really need to tell you why you need to play this game?
1115,Es bastante divertido...
1116,Just like I remember it‚Äôs kinda active but it‚Äôs manly modded lobby‚Äôs
1117,classic cod lobby
1118,"Noobtubers ruined the game in the past when they were teens, and now that they're all old men - they continue to ruin the game by tubing. It's a mental disease and is NOT tolerable. Your money is better spent on another shooter. Minecraft, for example, is better than this mess of a game"
1119,"Such a fun game. I had to buy it after over 8 years of not touching it on my Xbox 360. Something to have fun with and play with old friends, just overall one of the best COD's they ever produced :)"
1120,xgfsf
1121,this game on a giant curved monitor is a whole different game than on a 360 on the living room tv its so weird
1122,Zamn
1123,Just play and practice. no story play or NPC battles
1124,better than every cod game that came after it lulw
1125,"My game is crashing while loading in... I do not understand. I uninstalled and reinstalled. I even restarted my computer, and still nothing. If anyone could help I would appreciate it because I know its a good game but I would like to play what I payed for."
1126,wait until hank get home
1127,great game the campaign is awesome and the multiplayer too
1128,"The only complaint I have is the player being unable to eat a burger from Burger Town. 0/10 there Infinity Ward.

The rest are good btw"
1129,The level of playability achieved here is rarely matched even among the other Call of Duty games. If you were to only get one it would be either this or Ghosts.
1130,"What an golden era of gaming. Thank you this game, thank you so much. I can only look to fond memories."
1131,Reminds me of Call of Duty¬Æ Black Ops ‚Ñ¢
1132,"No Russian?

1133,Definitely the best COD in the series
1134,"Let me tell you I am not a fan of Call of Duty series, they offer far less freedom for players than other games that don't try to be so cinematic - a good example would be old Medal of Honor games. Nevertheless, I had a blast playing this game, mainly because of the amazing story, characters and those iconic moments this game is known for. I recommend this game for every FPS fan, even if you're not into CoD, the Modern Warfare trilogy is quite good, I am not gonna lie. I just wish it was longer, it took me only 5 and a half hours to finish it. And I was playing on Hardened as well. Normally, this would take even less to finish."
1135,This game is the knee of the bee.

1180,old but gold
1181,"What.A.Great.Game. I played it back in 2019 or early 2020 not sure. I just forgot that i can write a review :)
Recomended.Also one of the best Call Of Duty-s out there."
1182,bosh
1183,this is a brilliant game but there are WAAAY too many hackers to be able to enjoy it anymore
1184,Probably one of the best games from the entire Modern Warfare series! The story is much better than modern day Call of Duty.
1185,yes
1186,good
1187,remember no russian
1188,ywssssssssssssssss
1189,good game in general iv found nothing wrong with this product
1190,"Absolute blast to the past. Amazing gameplay for a 2007 game. Graphics are still stunning in 2022 and its outstanding base, a true masterpeice"
1191,"just awesome
"
1192,pew pew game. nice.
1193,Why aren't playing MW2 right now? Get on it ASAP!
1194,One of my favourite call of duties
1195,Storymode is really really good
1196,Gameplay is extremely mediocre but the story and constantly changing environment carry it up to a 3/5. Definitely just play on Regular difficulty because its still decently challenging an anything higher you're just getting instakilled by things you can't even see. And definitely not the masterpiece that people being blinded by nostalgia claim it to be.
1197,It's good.
1198,certified
1199,"Very good game, i will probably say this is the best COD i ever play"
1200,"Be weary when purchasing this. I've done about everything that is thinkable and looked up every single fix I could find and I cannot get this game to run properly. If you want to take a gamble and take a risk of looking at a black screen forever, feel free."
1201,"yes so cool play now

1210,"Iconic, not much else to say. I think the game wouldn't be nearly as good without the amazing score by Hans Zimmer, major highlight of the campaign."
1211,RIP ghost and roach
1212,nice
1213,"still one of the best shooters i've played
especially sniping got me harddddd"
1214,Easily my favorite and in my opinion the Best call of duty game its campaign and story telling is next level and the multiplayer was just as fun buts its kinda dead now cause of the age of them game but no matter how many times i play the story it never gets boring and always excites me to play it again 10/10 my 3rd favorite game ever
1215,"A true nostalgia trip that only OG's will remember. With actions that'll leave you on the edge of your seat, sensational underlying themes, and a kickass soundtrack by the man himself Hans Zimmer, CoD Modern Warfare 2 will leave you breathless at the end of the ride."
1216,"i like
"
1217,"Gameplay is great, but the opportunities to play are managed by mod's and code hacks that make most of the matches unplayable....Hate, since i have over 15d of actual game time, do not waste your money on this game as no one, Steam, Activision, etc., are managing the game for the enjoyment of general playership..."
1218,best game
1219,Duh
1220,I love this game ngl
1221,awesome since it first came out
1222,good game

I cant tell you how much fun ive had running across a street to capture a predator missile control rig while bopping to California Dreamin'"
1224,"great game
"
1225,"This is the best game to ever be made in human existence and its might suck for some but ima going to give it to you blunt.  
There will never be a better game made just accept it... :) have a good life nerd"
1226,shortly after purchasing the online didnt work... and that was back when the game first came out

1233,i LoVe this game
1234,call of duty games are fun
1235,Hackers in multiplayer were able to disable my keyboard. Have to assume this game is a security risk at this point. Should not even be available for sale.
1236,"Most unrealistic thing in this game is the suggestion Russia could successfully invade a country, 10/10"
1237,The gold standard for what Call of Duty should be.
1238,ABSOLUTE CLASSIC.

1244,"This is a great Call of Duty game! I very much enjoyed the first Modern Warfare and this sequel did not let me down. Because I didn't play it when it first came out I first heard the voice actor who plays the Ranger SGT as the President on Rick and Morty. I couldn't help, but laugh going to objectives and taking orders from a Rick and Morty character. This is a great shooter and a great addition to my Call of Duty collection."
1245,Awesome single player campaign
1246,"GOOD GAME <3
"
1247,Easily one of the best CODs. Does it have flaws? Yes. Is it still amazing? Also yes
1248,you must play this game
1249,No Russians
1250,pogrz
1251,An old classic that's still better than all modern COD games
1252,.
1253,Old MW2. Good Campaign. Hard Though.
1254,"good gam

1255,Campaign and SpecOps are solid. Multiplayer sucks because there's no server browser.

other than that its good  ."
1281,good
1282,.
1283,Possibly the best modern Call of Duty experience. I've been playing this game since it's release. Highly recommended!
1284,THis is a very fun game to play and I love the challange in spec ops
1285,"Cathartic in late February 2022. COD games from this era onwards have a bit of a bad reputation, and deservedly so, but the campaigns are way too well thought out for the dudebros occupying the multiplayer, which is why they don't play them. However, despite the prevailing logic being that people only buy COD games for the multiplayer, I admit that the campaigns are a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. (At least, when the prices come down several years later and they go on sale)

MW2 is an excellent critique on the causes of war, leadership and groupthink. It's a good game too... controversial opinion here but I think it's better than MW1 for having a story which affects everyone directly, rather than the series of covert ops that the first game was, despite the message of the story being the same. Both games show the grey in the war that you're fighting, and seeing your soldier buddies cheer as a skyscraper collapses in a civilian-occupied area during the first level kinda sets the tone.

Play on Veteran or not at all. This was designed to potentially be someone's first videogame, so medium is pretty chill. On Veteran you will die a lot but it forces you to think tactically and change your approach rather than just shoot. On lesser difficulties you can pretty much just walk through it spraying bullets at the Russians and the American deep state... but then maybe that's what some people need right now."
1286,fucking brilliant
1287,back when everyone's dad worked for microsoft and everyone fucked my mom
1288,yes yes pro buy now it super good in multiplayer spec ops delta so good yayayayay
1289,"Best call of duty game ever made, my childhood"

1436,"[h1] 9.5/10 [/h1]

Despite being a game released in 2009, the game is still considered the pinnacle of the Call Of Duty franchise to this day. And even if this game is played now, its performance does not live up to its reputation.

There weren't many first-person shooters describing modern warfare at the time. Under the aura of Modern Warfare's success in the previous game, Modern Warfare 2 goes a step further and tells a more wonderful story, and even now, its story is very excellent too. 

The grand battlefield, the magnificent plot, the exciting battlefield performance, and the passionate music. All of this makes for Call of Duty 6: Modern Warfare 2, a shooter that has never been seen before or since, and a game that will never let you down.

At the same time, this game is also the first attempt to add a special operation mode to the Call of Duty series. Fast, unique multiple challenges allow players to invest the time at their leisure for quick play. Even in 2022, Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer servers still have a certain base of players, and now you can still try the multiplayer experience of Modern Warfare 2 that year.

For shooter fans and fans of the Call of Duty franchise, I believe that I don't need to say more, they all know this game is a must-try masterpiece. But given that this is a 2009 game, it's inevitable that there will be some bugs or glitches."
1437,some kid fuckin got 360 noscoped shrekt on rust and starting screaming slurs at me 10/10 great game

1447,[b] No Russian [/b] language.
1448,"A nice strait forward fps game multiplayer is infested with hackers and wired dedicated lobby host bot things but for singleplayer, challenge mode / coop ,and custom game multiplayer with the boys totally worth it"
1449,is good
1450,"Honestly, I liked it a lot. Starting with the campaign, it's a good 8/10. I think the game play plus story line is pretty solid for 2009. Would recommend."
1451,Ô∏ª„Éá‚ïê‰∏Ä
1452,you gotta need nword pass for play this game
1453,Oyunu bitirdim ger√ßekten zordu ama √ßook g√ºzel oyundu tavsiye ederim
1454,by far one of the best games of all time I always love revisiting it
1455,"GOOD!
"
1456,"IT'S MW2! How could you hate it? 

The game is an absolute blast from the past and is everything you know and love about the game. Obviously its a bit outdated on the engine side of things but still very fun to hop on and mess around with in groups or mess with some mods and enjoy the game even more... On that note be careful with the mod side of things, I found myself getting VAC banned after messing with some mods in a private match, and 3,000 days later, here we are... still on my account xD

10/10 Game since 2012... and still is but bring friends because those servers are dead."
1457,"excellient
"
1458,rate 9 noob tubers out of 10
1459,"Pros:

- One of the best COD campaigns ever made
- Graphics still look great
- Good price
- You can play split- screen with external controller.



Cons:

- Multiplayer is sadly dead
- Campaign is very short



Overall: 9/10"
1460,hi
1461,great game
1462,good
1463,"Play on IW4X instead, vanilla has been destroyed by hackers and isn't worth playing."

1465,10/10
1466,Good old classic
1467,I still miss Ghost and Roach
1468,very good game
1469,COD 4 on a week long cocaine binge. Still recommend 13 years later.
1470,fun
1471,"ITS FUN TO PLAY 
"
1472,easily one of the best cods ever
1473,"Despite having a story that at best I could describe as ""dumb as f*ck"" and a level trying too hard to be controversial, I still really enjoyed this game. It's great level design, outstanding spec ops mode, the best multiplayer in the entire series, and the very vibrant color palette make it one of Call of Duty's best.

8.5/10 Third or fourth best Call of Duty depending on my mood and if I can play it with friends."
1474,I liked the easy fundamentals of the Game.
1475,still grate game
1476,best cod
1477, Game Working and finding game online you can play but Nat type  is on strict and it stuck  on strict because  I no my other call of duty are on open Nat part from is game. You  have problems on is game with Nat type not open. Steam please fix nat on is game so can find game faster move around on game faster. Can you put  right port number on guide page four is game.
1478,Childhood game really good the mechanics are the greatest but since it has just like 7-8 missions the fun is limited.
1479,One of the best put together campaigns that I have played in a while.
1480,"Just for Spec Ops alone is worth the buy, but even then the campaing is awesome and graphics are still good to this day"
1481,Amazing
1482,"uHHH Well, its about a war.

Sometimes i looked at price, and i thought he was a hunk, not until i realized he has an only fanz

Other than that tis a gud game"
1483,yes
1484,its good need an anti cheat or revived by famous people.
1485,A men's game
1486,great game

1489,Nostalgia!ü•Ç
1490,e
1491,cool i love the game
1492,if ur a true cod fan and love cod series and u r an OG then this is for u
1493,"So I bought the game not too long ago, since the new games kinda eh (or so I heard) I decided to buy the CoD from 2009.
This is one of the best games I've ever played honestly. The multiplayer is fun and the campaign is entertaining. Even 12 years later the people still play it, which is nice! I really enjoy this game!"
1494,"Chaotic fun. There is so much that this game seems like an interactive action movie. Lots of explosions but it makes Modern Warfare 2 unique before franchise fatigue set in. There are plenty of fun moments in the campaign along with the occasional stealth mission. The ACR is overpowered therefore it does not appear in that many missions. The spec ops is a good thing if you want quick bursts of fun.

The multiplayer on the other hand is really chaotic but in a bad way. You have people camping, no scoping, and a bunch of other stupid stuff. There is also modded lobbies. ALL I WANT IS TO ENJOY A GAME OF TEAM DEATHMATCH BUT NO!!! THOSE MODDED LOBBIES PUT ME IN DOMINATION!!!

Other information:
Works amazing with Proton on Linux
High framerates on fairly old hardware
Console commands for singleplayer
Intel provides something to work for

I would rate this 9/10 thumbs. Amazing game, you should totally buy."
1495,"vere fun 
dont play for to long
try and play for 1-2h
"
1496,"Bruv......    This game is probably the best COD EVER. Other than WAW and COD 4, but other than those it is just so fun, you can get memories for life out of it and it is like an action movie. I Kinda like the action movie part of it. But overall just great game."
1497,i didnt play this as a kid and its kinda boring
1498,knife goes stab
1499,"great game with great graphics, i can get 700 fps on lowest settings and in 1600x900"
1500,This game has the best campaign of call of duty and the only game in the franchise that crosses into must-play territory. 10/10 amazing

1510,"I bought this game for 5 bucks, played the single player campaign, and honestly even 5 bucks is too much for this game, should cost just only one bucks. If you don't have played COD games, don't worry, you haven't missed anything all, plus your money is still in your pocket.

And single player game should cost more than 5 bucks anyway."

1524,"13 Years late to review this, but I must say. This game is legendary and it's a relic in gaming that nobody can replace. It will forever be remembered as one of the best CoD's to date."
1525,One less loose end.
1526,"This game is worth getting for the campaign since it's over a decade old. If you played this as a kid the nostalgia can hit pretty hard. The game pushed boundaries and crossed lines that very few others have, although, it isn't glorified in any way. In my opinion, the story mode and spec-ops mode (2 player) makes this one of the best Call of Duty games of all time. The price of this game is $20 which is a little high and sometimes goes on sale for $15."
1527,very good
1528,Masterpiece.
1529,Addictive....
1530,"i compleated the game in 6 hours 

fun"
1531,"This game is amazing

If you are talking about the campaign.

After completing the game on recruit the first time, hardened in the remastered, and veteran here, i can say this game does have its flaws

If you are wanting to play multiplayer... too bad.
Steam multiplayer is pretty dead and if you get into a game its only about 2-5 other people.
If you do want to play multiplayer just install iw4x.

Multiplayer aside, the story of this game is just amazing and infinity ward really put their all into this game (unlike some of their newer games) and its story. This campaign would definitely be my top 1 for Call of Duty storys.

4/5"

1555,Quite nostalgic
1556,haha intervention go boom
1557,Best COD
1558,Love this game
1559,love the story
1560,game is really fun but there are no servers in it so i don't recommend it if your looking for campaign its best just to get the remastered campaign.
1561,he ho shoot gun
1562,"Still fun after all those years.
Multiplier is still one of the bests in my opinion, although lobbies are now mostly hacked.."
1563,
1564,good
1565,BIG LIKE
1566,guys i finally got the dsm cant wait to give it to shepherd
1567,BEST call od duty EVER love the story
1568,A short game but one of the best call of duty games I've ever played
1569,Da best yo!
1570,"good
"
1571,"Back in the day, before hackers were so ubiquitous in multiplayer, this game was the cat's pajamas. I have never had so much fun in a video game as playing this game's multiplayer maps. Now, it's full of aim bots and hackers. But you know, the campaign is still one of the best of the best. MW2 is a good, old reliable favorite."
1572,"Game keeps crashing at level one and sends me back to the pit. i love this game but does anyone know how to fix this?
"
1573,Yeah its alright
1574,ok
1575,"Very Fun campaign and a very nostalgic experience if you have played before
"
1576,"This is a great game. One of the if not the best in the series, great story line memorable characters.
A well spent $20"
1577,:)
1578,Yes
1579,Straightforward story of betrayal and vengeance but a pivotal moment in the Call of Duty brand as a whole. Amazing game.
1580,"This feels like such a step down from the last game. The controls feel mechanical, the missions all over the place. I may just be bad at fps games but its all really hard to follow."
1581,"I've ended MW2 and MW3 and now i'm sad because i realised we've lost that many good men like:
Ghost, Roach, Soap, Sandman, Grinch, Frost, Truck, Yuri, etc."
1582,really good
1583,GREAT
1584,it is amazeing it is fun pls try it for your selfs
1585,i yeeted a knife into some old mans head 10/10
1586,Campaign and Specs Ops are absolutely legendary!
1587,its mw2
1588,pretty good 7.5 out of 10
1589,"One of the best games ever made. Got like 50 days played on console.

The IW4X mod makes the game better on PC by adding custom maps, guns etc. Hopefully soon the fan made SM2 will release (for which you need MW2) and make COD mp fun again. The only thing that would make MW2 on PC better is proper controller support (with aim assist) which should be coming on IW4X and SM2"
1590,RECOMMEND
1591,"It is a great fps game you should buy it, it is really."
1592,Yep
1593,"Dude, this game is just amazing.

Multiplayer is still alive 'till today and for sure one of the best and most nostalgic cod engines... Campaign by far the most famous of the entire franchise with the Makarov airport mission: ""Remember, no Russian.""

Not gonna lie, it's a 2009 game which is really already outdated in all aspects, but if you're gonna buy it just to play the campaign, I strongly recommend you to buy its remaster on the other blue symbol platform where Call of Duty migrated since Black Ops 4. 

DISCLAIMER: THE REMASTER NOT WORTH THE FULL U$20 PRICE, BUY IT ON SALE.

Finally, the coop principle of cod's franchise (special ops), gives you a chance to have a little fun, specially with friends (rushing missions and doing achievements).

Is it worth the full price? Probably not. But it's still a masterpiece of cod's franchise specially Modern Warfare world."
1594,"Despite Multiplayer not being as active as it used to be for obvious reasons, the game still has a great campaign and very enjoyable Spec Ops missions. In my opinion for single player content this game is the best of the ""Modern Warfare"" games (although I haven't played the newest one). 

It often goes on sale for the big sales so would highly recommend it for the single player alone if you've never played it."
1595," I really Modern Warfare series! I can easily say that this game is one of the best cod games ever made, I enjoy it so much, bring a lot of memories back from childhood. Quality wise the campaign remaster is better but this is fine for it's time."
1596,"an awesome game, story will replace your life"
1597,Just like old times‚Ä¶I wish more people would start playing this again. Still the best CoD game to date!
1598,"one of the best games ever, hood classic"
1599,my audio may not work and if you can tell me how to fix it ill apreciate it but still a good game
1600,:]
1601,You have to sit through 5 minutes of dull intro cutscenes and credits before you can change the damn resolution from 1024x768 and you can't change FOV without running a smelly 3rd party executable some guy wrote.
1602,"The peak of what COD MW has to offer, highly recommend, 10/10!!!"
1603,yessir
1604,"Best cod of all time hands down, wish they would remaster the multiplayer"
1605,"Forever young, I want to be Forever young!"
1606,fun shoot shoot
1607,mlg moutaindew burrito
1608,Pretty Garbage.
1609,"Classic Call of Duty game! Great Campaign, Great Spec-op missions that can also be played w/ friends online. Although, try to get this game on sale, as most of the old Call of Duty games aren't worth their present prices."

1611,"I wasted hundreds of hours playing this game on Consoles with a VR headset and home made VGA adapter.  

This is one of the few games that truly raised the bar in terms of quality campaign, rewarding multiplayer, and visuals that stand up very well over time.

Grab it if you're a fan of the FPS genre, you won't be disappointed."
1612,"bussing bussing
"
1613,"if you're going to play this game then do not look at the community posts, as there are unblocked spoilers of the end of the game.
great game"
1614,amazing
1615,"A classic with 'THAT' mission to remember. It was the best at the time and still carries some weight, especially if you're new or easing back into FPS after a long hiatus. Recommended for non-flake gamers."
1616,a hole in your life you never knew existed will be filled and you will become an infinitely better person after finishing campaign on veteran. multiplayer makes me want to punt a baby though.

1619,"Old School, Baby"
1620,"Amazing Campaign that would be a blast to play and spec ops mission done correctly!
 (i cant recommend multiplayer, since i don't play multiplayer)

For those who want to play multiplayer, i would recommended I.W.4.X and SM2 (in the future). 
If you want offline bots, get I.W.4.X Bot warfare bot mod. However, If that doesn't work, get rse bot mod instead. Just note that it will disable achievement for the campaign and spec ops mission! RSE and I.W.4.X  works with the 2 dlc map pack as well, if you want to know.

Good luck! and have a nice day :)
"
1621,Last good MW made
1622,"good game rate it 9/10
only problem is that u have to go through a bunch of bs to get attachments for ur guns in multiplayer
"
1623,"I created my own account on Steam in 2009 due to this game.

This game means a lot to me.

Thank you CoD:MW2.
Thank you Steam."
1624,Haha terminal go brrr
1625,Modern Warfare 2 still proves itself to be the best COD Campaign besides Advanced Warfare.

1627,"ghost is hot
"
1628,One of the best Call of Duty games that would ever exist Modern Warfare 2 has one of the best story lines and best graphics i have seen for a game at  its time. I recommend it to everyone who wants to play a great Call of Duty game
1629,re living the memories

However with multiplayer, you wanna use the client called iw4x unless you want players to hack your pc hehe."
1635,"Modern Warfare 2, has iconic characters. And a few missions that are also iconic to this day, whether it's a remaster or not it's popular for it's ending.

VERY COOL GAME"
1643,"Sadly spec-ops doesn't have and has never had dedicated servers for it, but here's a plus for anyone reading -- MW3 HAS DEDICATED SERVERS FOR SPEC-OPS -- If you get this game the multiplayer is still active, and the game is just as fun, only problem is you cannot get all 69 (nice) stars in Spec-Ops, so I'd say get it for the nostalgia if you want, don't get it to try and play with one of your friends..I tried..I failed"

1647,I recommend
1648,Amazing campaign
1649,do NOT set your game to 4:3 on 50hz worst mistake ive ever made
1650,"It's great!
"
1651,Great game
1652,good
1653,perfect game. and also ghost dies
1654,"No game brings me as much joy and nostalgia as this one, nothing will ever taint the image I have of this game and I'll continue to play it for as long as possible.

(ghost best character in the whole franchise disagree and youre wrong)"
1655,Best COD of all time!
1656,"just finished the game
very nice game
sephard is a bitch tho"
1657,"One of the best>
"
1658,"Campaign is hype and very good.
You could easily play the campaign in one day.
It is worth a replay every once and a while.
Multiplayer is alright; it's kinda hard to enjoy sometimes and is hard to get into.
It sucks when you have hackers in multiplayer."
1659,"Great Game! Multiplayer works now. Spec ops is WAY better than MW 2019's Spec Ops. Campaign Is good, as always. Infinity Ward really knocked it out the park on this one. 11 years later, Still an Amazying game"
1660,good game
1661,classic babe
1662,Remember. No Russian
1663,10/10
1664,is good
1665,i would recommend this game because it has a great story
1666,"good
"
1667,"*Hehehe...there he is... Simon Riley*

*There is no picture*

*Never*"
1668,"Good game,amazing story and mission, definitely worth every penny and I recommend to everyone!"
1669,Takes me back to when I used to play the story mode on my xbox 360.
1670,"This is by far one of my top favourite CoD games, I've always really enjoyed the Spec Ops and wish they would have incorporated this game mode into the newer CoD games. I know the new version of Modern Warfare includes Spec Ops but they aren't nearly as fun as these ones. I like how with MW2 you can just play solo for a lot of them and try and get as many stars as possible and then eventually unlock the really difficult ones (like the one where you're on the Oil Rig and there are Juggernauts waddling around that are nearly impossible to kill - I almost had to call someone from Activision and bribe them so they would just give me the 3 stars, that's how frustrating this Op is).

Overall, this game is definitely worth purchasing (was worth purchasing even back in the day when it was around $60) and even though I don't think the servers are active anymore for online Multiplayer, the Campaign and Spec Ops are well worth it!"
1671,the best
1672,"One of the best, if not THE best CoD ever released.

Amazing multi-player, amazing campaign, amazing coop. 

Great customization amd progression system, new CoDs and new shooters. Take some notes.

Nostalgic and amazing. I recommend with a 9.7/10."
1673,yes I like the part where you get to shoot some one
1674,GERMAN VERSION SUCKS
1675,yes
1676,"This game is good, great music with action game. 8/10"
1677,"the multiplayer is plagued with hackers fighting hackers to see who's the better hacker, but they're using the same hacks. i got 10th prestige in 0.7 hours by telling a hacker he sucked at hacking.

one of the best games in history that easily got destroyed by developers not caring."
1678,Me and my dad used to play this game all the time on the Xbox 360 when I was younger. He passed away a few months ago and I saw this on sale. Playing this made memories flood back like a river during a hurricane.....10/10 would recommend revisiting
1679,"imo best cod, great campaign until you know what happens"
1680,"I really love cod games and I can easily say that this game is one of the best cod games ever made, I enjoy it so much, bring a lot of memories. They really do a great job with graphics for that year. Cod campaigns never disappoints!!"
1681,I play COD for the story and this one has the best story. Just as good now as it was back in 2009.
1682,its a good game but getting killed by 100s of bots that cant even see you seems a bit off
1683,Better than cold war
1684,"I've loved this game for as far as I can remember. I used to play this after school in computer shops. But as you can see in other reviews, the game is full of hackers. For that it is not worth it."
1685,Does steam or the computer not save progress or something? played for 5 and a half hours and it was as if I started a brand new game when I logged back on. This is kind of a joke if that's the case.
1686,extraordinary
1687,"Semi-dated graphics is a minor bump in the gripping story and challenging, fun gameplay."
1688,Oldie but a goodie

Step 2. Go to the airport with your Russian buddies and gun down thousands of civilians

1701,I got nostalgic so I got this game to play the campaign which is amazing but the multiplayer is full of hackers.
1702,"very fun to play and time consuming,would play more if i had the time but a great game overall"
1703,LOVE this game. Played the multiplayer version for years.
1704,"i've played this game when i was 27 back in 2009, i loved this game, i highly recommend this for everyone, i let my son play this! it's worth it!"

1710,Best campaign in the franchise to this day. I miss almost every multiplayer map. Imagine Zombies mode on MW2 maps...You'd never need another CoD ever lol
1711,best story on call of duty what i have.
1712,G.O.A.T
1713,"A top tier COD, they remastered the campaign but didn't release it on steam, Campaign and Spec ops are the two playable things nowadays, MP is full of cheaters as there are ways with this COD to bypass the VAC Ban so they don't even need to swap accounts to blatantly aimbot you from the other side of Terminal, SM2 looks promising though"
1714,good game
1715,cool game
1716,the best games in its series
1717,The graphics and the gameplay are great for the year it was made in. Story is alright. Definitely recommend if you like Spec Ops type of operations.
1718,IT'S BLAZZING
1719,very swag and awesome i likes it.  best one.
1720,"never played a cod game until this one, really good!"
1721,"""Yah"""
1722,Thank you X labs. Thank you community who still loves this game.
1723,"This is a good game. fun campaign, fun multiplayer, good spec-ops"
1724,NIGGA
1725,"Awesome campaign, and has a good soundtrack. I would recommend anyone this game except for snowflakes, since the No Russian mission."
1726,best game
1727,A good all round game
1728,"Good game,amazing story and mission,definitely worth every penny and I recommend to everyone!"
1729,To much cheaters in multi player
1730,"Team Deathmatch!

1733,"met faze bivens, best day ever"
1734,Very Good
1735,Good Cod I dunno
1736,perfect game to play when you are bored
1737,One of the best Call of Duty games ever.
1738,just beautiful
1739,"It's An amazing game overall the optimisations are great it's not cpu or gpu heavy
"
1740,"I got all 50 achievements on this, and I don't usually get all the achievements in a game. (Probably because most involve me to do some over the top task.) But this is definitely one of the games I worked to get 100% achievements, so maybe that says something.
If my dad played it and liked it, maybe you will too. Though the campaign is a bit short, and spec-ops can be done quickly if you know what you're doing, it's still an experience worth trying.
P.S. Play CoD4 before touching this, campaign spoilers wise."
1741,"Fairly fun, full of hackers, not the worst.

5/10. It's alright."
1742,GREAT GAME!!!!
1743,"Best Call of Duty of all time, sadly MW 1 remastered seems to have killed the multiplayer off completely :(
Maybe they will get around to remastering MW  multiplayer 2 at some point.

edit: the madmen did it"
1744,"if gun shoot,i like"
1745,flat out amazing!!! Call Of Duty Modern warfare 2 is relic of a game that will always hold a place in my heart! From flat out suspence to pure action is makes this game an amazing title!
1746,campaign in 4.9 hours lolol
1747,I highly recommend the mission called no russian
1748,cool gamesa
1749,"CoD 4 was an ideal game but since then, year by year, the quality of the series has been dropping.

While MW 2 is still a decent game, it is in every way inferior to the first MW.

Campaign 8/10.

Coop 6/10.

MP 4/10, since Activision has no intention to tackle cheaters on old installments, despite still charging a lot for them."
1750,i didnt work normaly
1751,"good game and the gameplays is good 
"
1752,yes
1753,My childhood...
1754,"fun nostalgia Michael Bay campaign. 
As for multiplayer, just install the mp part and then search on the internet for iw4x. Click the official site and download it. Makes the mp much better"
1755,Made with love. This is a great stuff. You gotta play until you finish the whole story.
1756,"LISTEN UP SOLDIERRRRRRR
MY NAME IS COLONEL COMMANDER SARGENT MASTER EXTREME SHOOTER ARMY GUN MAN AND YOURE GONNA DROP DOWN AND GIVE ME 53002!!!! COME ONN SOLDIERRRRRR I WANNA HEAR THEM ASS CHEEKS SLAPPING CLAPING AND QUAKING OOOOOOOORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!"

1760,It's pretty neat.
1761,"one less loose end

100000000/10 for funny airport mission
-1000000/10 for a near 13 year old game to cost full price
-1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 for making me install a 3rd party client to torrent a game i paid full price for just for the multiplayer

1762,Hello Zuckerberg here with my review of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 which is the 6th Call of Duty game. In this game you play as Paul Walker and Sgt Ramiriez plus the character Papa Roach. The game has returning characters Like John Bodywash Mactavish and  SPOILER ALERT Captain Fisher Price. The game has the voices of Keith David who played the KGB Director in the film Agent Malcom in the middle east and it also has corporal dunkin donuts who voiced by blueberry peppermint in EAs film battlefield earth which has Nicolas Cage who plays as poppycock in the film stan directed by Pauly Shore and has Denzel Washington grandson of george washington custard III who plays as Mace Windu in the film Spaceballs by Whoopi Goldberg the wrestler who is also in the show the Donnie and the goldbergers. It also has a new Villian. Vladimir Makarov is the best COD villian and was the first villian besides of course the villian in COD 2 Big Red One. this game has a AR15 and AC130 and is the best COD game but wait Keith David Being in it makes me have to give it a 7/10. Its still good but Davids Performance is just bad and is not good. I did like Ghost but he got busted by General Jason Shepard from the film LIAR LIAR starring Dana Carvey who is also in the film Little Momma Directed Dylan Sprout so for that reason alone I give it a 20/1000000
1763,"Overall, this game is easy and fun to pick up and play. It seemed to fix all the problems in Modern Warfare 1. As a PC port, it's fine. But it ain't good as the Xbox 360 port. Story and shit, gameplay is a masterpiece. Overall, It's better than MW1, this game is a 10/10 masterpiece. No parts that make you rage, well kinda. Overall, the main game is easy and fun, Seeing how a great game got a great second game. The details are upgraded. Ending credits are even better! Gameplay is amazing. The story is WAY better than Mw1, Mw3, or any cod game out there. 10/10 one of the best story mode FPS game i've ever played!"
1764,"Great game, you will even become braindead while playing it because you switch characters in the campaign and now I don't even know who I am, 10/10 would recommend"
1765,
1766,ea
1767,"‚ÄúWe are the most powerful military force in the history of man. Every fight is our fight. Because what happens over here, matters over there. We don't get to sit one out. Learning to use the tools of modern warfare is the difference between the prospering of your people, and utter destruction. We can't give you freedom. But we can give you the know-how to acquire it. And that, my friends, is worth more than a whole army base of steel. Sure it matters who's got the biggest stick, but it matters a helluva lot more who's swinging it. This is a time for heroes. A time for legends. History is written by the victors. Let's get to work.‚Äù

1781,FUCKING BUSSIN
1782,"The strongest node in the story, a true masterpiece."
1783,"Multiplayer is still good and people are still playing
"
1784,"Buy this game on sale and play one of the most iconic, fun, and bad ass shooter campaigns out there. The plot doesn't make sense when you start to scrutinize it, but the story and characters are gripping with lots of fantastic set pieces and unique missions. The entirety of the MW series is peak COD to me. The original MW is the game that made COD what it is today, (along with World at War) and MW3 managed to wrap up the series with a satisfying finish, but this game IS COD."
1785,"For everyone reading this do a full playthrough of modern warfare 1-3 if you haven't already.

9/10 -1 For one of the soldiers dabbing on ghost when he got shot."
1786,"Great game,  I really only play the special ops, but they're great fun."

1795,WHAT.  A.  CAMPAIGN.
1796,Nostalgia hitting different
1797,I have loved this game ever since it released in 2009!! The Spec Ops is simply amazing in my opinion!
1798,If you haven't played this... don't consider your self a gamer...
1799,fun
1800,"This....this CoD and Black Ops in my opinion were just the most creative and fun multiplayer/campaign experiences ever. Can we please get a Halo: Infinite for CoD? Hell, I'd even be okay with 343 doing it if the gameplay is good."

1842,"Don't get it wrong, I purchased this game back in 2009 and absolutely loved it since then. I'm not even a proper CoD fan due to their confusing storyline and recently heavily disappointed by Activision's MW2 remastered since you can't play spec ops. OK back to the point, I recently purchased the game feeling nostalgic and to play one of the best games I've ever played in my life however, this thing has either a huge internal error or bug going on which it won't let you play at your screen resolution, which if you try to change the setting it will crash the game and the entire computer to the point you have to restart the whole system, then it goes back to 800x600 resolution and does the same. Tried figuring out how to solve the problem and what's on google or youtube are all outdated and inaccurate latest one being around 2018. I just can't use my 1440p computer to play a game that stops at lowest resolution keep crashing the game."
1843,"An actual masterpiece, this game made FPS into what it is today.
A very memorable campaign and a very addicting fast paced multiplayer with satisfying progression.

It was usually Battlefield vs CoD, but now I say 

Battlefield and CoD Vs *rEaLiStiC OpEn MaP PVP sHoOteRs*


(By realistic open map shooters i mean games like Squad, Rising Storm Vietnam, and stuff of same sort)"
1844,This is the greates COD game that exists.
1845,i was not an xbox or play station gaming gamer at the time of this game's release and it's popularity but mmm yes i must say this story is something to be remembered for centuries
1846,"Servers still active on PC in 2021, haven't came across any hackers so far, or hackers that cheat in the game. I highly recommend if you're an OG COD player. WORTH IT IN 2021!!!!!!"
1847,nic gem
1848,"Great game, classic that never gets old."
1849,The first call of duty I played! 10/10

1860,üëç
1861,"[h1]Terrible.[/h1] 

I played COD2 and Modern Warfare [1] back to back before this installment and I have to say that there was hardly any significant upgrade to the series as this one progressed. It seemed to at first but once the story fell back into a mediocre childish way of portraying itself and it ironically digressed: completely salvageable. This is another one, remembered for simply being remembered and rode the coattails of COD2 and the WW2 craze at the time, eventually devolving into this mess. This game is one big edgy teenage wet dream with zero appreciation for anyone who played COD2 or any WW2 game Infinity Ward made before it.
The story sucks, the level design is short and repetitive almost knowing that if it doesn't catch your attention within the next literal millisecond that you will lose interest making the game feel forcibly fast paced. A level shouldn't start with you walking literally 1 meter and engaging enemies as if you just did a long jaunt. This is something I would expect from a very limited engine or a game made five to six years prior to this installment. 
The cliffhanger sucks because the villain is shoehorned. We didn't get the 'guy' we wanted so tune in next time. Sounds like an excuse to start milking the fandom, a modern commonality of this franchise today...
No."

Germans are once again too *ladidah* for the original version. So its german voiceover only."
1894,"Remember, no N word"
1895,i played this 4 years ago
1896,"After 10 years this game is still enjoyable. The campaign has replay ability and to this day I still find new ways of doing certain missions. 

Although the multiplayer is full of hackers and bad lobbies sometimes you can get fun legit games. 

At this point I mostly play for nostalgia and enjoying old games. 

Def worth buying just for the campaign when its on sale if you haven't plaid it before."

1911,"If you want a good MW2 experience. Get, IW. The steam version is so poorly optimized its not even worth trying. Constant Crashes, 144hz is not supported although it says it is in settings. Don't even bother."
1912,"is good
"
1913,fal does more damage if you equip the holo sight
1914,No one today would survive the lobbies from this game. They'd probably use riot shields every game lmfao.
1915,"This was the game that started the decline of the series. Good but really left a bad taste in my mouth with all the slowmo sections, constant near miss stunts and more cookie cutter level design. The loss of dedicated servers and balancing issues didnt help the mp side."
1916,fire
1917,"yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes and yes
also yes"
1918,"It's funny they think their trashas, games are still worth more than $10"
1919,"This is by far the pinnacle of the entire Call of Duty franchise and it's not hard to see why. This game has honestly outdone my long lasting love for Modern Warfare and compared to that game, this is a massive improvement on almost every level. I absolutely think the pacing here is far better than the original game, it's a constant straight arrow that isn't being interrupted by frustrating filler (Stealth Missions, Overlong Parts of no movement) so you're always on the ground fighting enemies and the only vehicle level in the entire game is huge amounts of fun. The graphics are a massive step up from the original game, areas are more vibrant and colourful while the original had lots of drab grey and orange environments that got samey. The challenge here is much better and more fair. Playing on Regular Difficulty, I felt that any death I had was not due to random BS or cheap annoyances, but it was my fault alone and needed to do better. 

The gunplay is more snappier and there are still plenty of guns to choose from to take down enemies. It's cathartic to mow down enemies with Dual Mini Uzis and use a grenade launcher on a M4A1 to take down multiple targets. But what makes this game are the characters and story. Soap and Captain Price are some of my all time favourite video game characters and how they are more fleshed out in just a couple of sentences compared to many long RPGs is incredible. The voice acting has a bunch of talent from Battlefield Earth's Barry Pepper, to Saints Row's Keith David and they give great performances. 

The story, to put it mildly, is awesome. This was the start of the more bombastic blockbuster approach to these games and it does it super well. The big twist near the end of the game is genuinely upsetting and I'm not lying when I say I was almost in tears. How could you not be upset at that?! Finally, the music is masterful. With main themes from Hans Zimmer it makes many scenes of big revelations and major moments work.

Absolutely the best of the best when it comes to Call of Duty. I love it. I don't have many negatives at all with it, if I have any at all. It's one of the best games I have ever experienced and I will be coming back to it more and more. A masterpiece without a doubt. Can't wait to finish the story with Modern Warfare 3."
1920,This game never gets old and never dies.
1921,This game is really good the campaign is amazing the multiplayer is pretty difficult but still not that bad the game still runs good and looks really good. It controls good. It is just one of the best Call of Duty games you should really play it. 8/10
1922,"yes but....
"
1923,Very nice gun sounds
1924,"In my opinion, Modern Warfare 2 was the pinnacle of fps multiplayer fun. The story was great as well. Unfortunately, most people have moved on to newer renditions and left this CoD to collect dust. Multiplayer servers are dead, but if you search ""mw2 bots mod"", you will find the bot warfare mod. Bot warfare has allowed me to relive my high school years of playing online. It allows you to play against bots of various difficulties, while also allowing you to rank up and unlock titles, emblems, and guns, as if you were playing online. This mod is the reason I keep coming back to this game and refuse to give it up. I still can't get over the nostalgia this game brings me. Wake up bro, it's 2009!"
1925,"After beating MW1 for nostalgia, I figured I would just play through the whole trilogy again. MW2 has some good campaign missions and some bad ones, depending on your taste. I started to really like it later on in the missions. Now the multiplayer is full of hackers, so no point in buying for the multiplayer experience sadly. Overall I'd give this game an 8/10."
1926,in this game it is perfectly possible to fall off of a bed and black out for 4 hours

1931,"Great nostalgia. The remake has better everything really. The lightning, the shadows, the polygons, animations and gestures, everything is improved including the AI for the NPCs (not by much on that point though, when has AI not sucked for your NPC buddies?) Can't believe it's been so long since the original came out. Fuck time flies."
1932,"remember, no Russian."
1933,one of the best CODs in terms of fun. it certainly isn't balanced but goddamn is it fun
1934,this game is poppin'
1935,"games like this don't exist anymore-the campaign is packed with action and adrenaline, not a moment of it felt tedious or boring. It tried out many new mechanics for the sake of making the story more interesting and none of them were ever frustrating or overstayed their welcome-It has been an extremely long time if ever since I have been this immersed in a video game, this engrossed in a story, and everyone who calls themself a gamer should give this a try-I give modern warfare 2's campaign a 10/10, I LOVED it!"

1960,true classic
1961,very noice campaign
1962,Haven;t played since 2009 when it came out. Today kids can not handle a mw2 lobby lol. By far one of the greatest games of all time! Would greatly recommend. The campaign is one of the greatest campaigns in COD History.

1964,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 - 8/10. The pinnacle of Infinity Ward talent. Nearly every mission is a masterpiece of storytelling and level design within the franchise. How cool it was to sabotage a Russian base during a snowstorm, and then get out on snowmobiles. How cool it was to liberate the American town from the Russian soldiers parachuting from all sides, to escape from helicopters falling after the EMP, to receive a bullet from Shepard, and then to deal with it pathetically."
1965,YES.
1966,"[h1]THE GAME IS BRILLIANT BUT THE GAME PRETTY MUCH HAS NOTHING BUT HACKERS NOTHING BUT HACKERS ON MULTIPLAYER AND IT MAKES THE GAME SO IT‚ÄôS NOT ENJOYABLE LIKE IT USED TO BE.[/h1]

THE GAME ITSELF IS GOOD THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MULTIPLAYER AND SINGLEPLAYER FPS GAMES OF ALL TIME! BUT DO NOT JOIN A MULTIPLAYER MATCH! AS I‚ÄôM SURE YOU HEARD, THERE IS A PATCH THAT CAUSES HACKERS TO NOT ONLY CHEAT IN THE GAME, BUT CAN HACK INTO YOUR COMPUTER, PUTTING VIRUSES SPYWARE THAT COMPLETELY TAKE OVER YOUR COMPUTER. AND STEAL ANY DATA YOU HAVE ON IT, AND INSTALL ANYTHING THEY WANT AND A LOT MORE! PLEASE LIKE THIS REVIEW SO IT CAN BE SEEN. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WILL MOST LIKELY HAPPEN TO ANY OF YOU IF YOU PLAY THE MULTIPLAYER NOW ACTIVISION NEEDS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM ON THIS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER BEING RUINED BY ONE PATCH VULNERABILITY! I HOPE THIS GETS ATTENTION SOON.

TO BE HONEST I WANTED TO GIVE THIS A POSITIVE REVIEW BECAUSE OF WHAT THE GAME USED TO BE BUT I CAN‚ÄôT RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN IT‚ÄôS CURRENT STATE THE MULTIPLAYER IS COMPLETELY BROKEN ON STEAM BY HACKERS TO THE POINT WHERE ANY GAME I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT THE GAME ON MULTIPLAYER IS RUINED BY HACKERS AND HACKERS FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER USING THE SAME HACKS.

IT‚ÄôS A SHAME WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS GAME BECAUSE IN MY OPINION THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST CALL OF DUTY EVER MADE."

2001,"This game was fine in 2009 but today it is a super arcade casual no-brain fairy tale about the US power rangers.

SCRIPTS SCRIPTS SCRIPTS!

Here's what this game is.
Dumb shooting tons of enemies along the whole game over and over again: You ride a car, you trigger the script. 10-15 enemies spawn and run towards every direction. You waste your time killing them, move on foot 20 meters forward and everything repeats.

Tired of no-brain fizzy propaganda patriotism and nationalistic concept in radio communications and in storyline in general.

No ragdoll, no gore.
Guns are the same, no recoil control, no skill needed, super-arcade.
Get ready for tons of dust and smoke to be in front of your face every fight.

Once you're being hit, your camera turns red and flies into space and you can't shoot back.
While being injured there is a tip to take cover and you can't hide it.

The game saves literally every 15 seconds so you don't care about dying and so it forces no-brain non-strategic gameplay.

Co-Op is broken. Most likely you'll have to open your ports or switch from dynamic IP. The game will try to lead you to an official forum which is already deleted because it is too old. Good luck finding the way to solve these issues yourself!

Operations are kinda OK but only as a challenge for the Veteran difficulty.

The music is great though and there are a few great scenes.
It's not a complete garbage but you definetely should be super-nostalgic to play this thing."
2002,THIS GAME WONTR TURN THE FUCK OFF!

2039,"finished the campaign in 8 hours, probably playing the game for 80 more"
2040,"Almost 40 days played on the 360's multiplayer, and happy to relive the campaign in the glorious PC. Campaign has a real macho-man type of deal you'd expect from most shooters, but the story is fetching and has a great cast. A bunch of action with a little touch of emotion tossed in, and it's not too difficult or too easy. Overall a very solid entry for something with such a massively neglected multiplayer (which still manages to be pretty fun)."

2067,"I've just started playing the older Call Of Duty games and wow, this is the best one so far.
To sum my experience up? [spoiler] I'm glad I got to kill that Shepard bastard. [/spoiler]
The story of this game takes a departure from Modern Warfare's ""yeah we're shooting russians and terrorists woohoo"" to a really sobering tone. Walking through the familiar streets of America and especially Washington D.C. was very impactful.
Now that I've played CoD 4, 5, and 6? (I believe this is 6), I see where the CoD hype comes from.
It's unfortunate that I knew how this game ended."
2068,"really brings back memories playing this in 2021 its still has it, would recommend playing this"
2069,"The story is great, The gameplay is good. In fact, i actually have beaten the story in veteran difficulty! It took me 2 weeks counting the breaks.

Only the problem is the mulitplayer is inactive."

2075,"While I would, in fact, love to recommend this game, I can't for one simple reason.....controller issues. Unlike its prequel counterpart, there is no official config by the devs, and the self made recommended configs by the community don't work very well. To top it all off, because it has no native controller interface, the snap-aim feature, which made the Call of Duty Modern warfare series, due to increased accuracy and efficiency of ammo, DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. If these issues were to be fixed, I would readily give it a 10 out of 10."

2079,"This version really does play like the classic Tycoon series. 
I spend less time landscaping - trees are automatically removed when adding a ride or stall. There is a old bug that occurs occasionally - install a new stall and it's floating in the air."

2101,"The Multiplayer is fine I guess. Nothing special in my eyes.

Where this games shines is the story. It is great.
You are 2 or 3 people in a special team. However, it feels realistic and logical. No heists, but grounded senseable missions.

Theere are bunch of side characters and everyone has their own voice and cahracter.
There are no cutscenes, everything is experienced through first person.
It makes it very easy to conect with the characters.
The tone is fantastic. It feels justified. Nothing and nobody seems be out of character.
This game has many location and they look and feel great.

There is this ONE scene that justifies the entire game. It is great with a lot emotional impact.
Judging this game by its story telling, writing, presentation, tone and gameplay, it is safe to say it is truly one of the best games out there. Despite it beeing a popular franchise, it is still an underdog compared with some very mediocre games that get/got a shit ton amount of media coverage."

2153,"The campaign of MW2 is one of the best in the series, it's still worth playing.

Spec Ops is really fun if you play with a friend, maybe you can buy with your friend when it's on sale, I'd recommend it.

The multiplayer of the game is also one of the best in the series, and even with a low a ammount of players you can still find lobbies for TDM, DOM, FFA and SND, but you may wait some depending on your location and time. Of course there's a few hackers, but you can just leave the match and search for another one if you find one.

I think this game, even tho it's old, still worth buying when it's on sale."

You Cant lie, This game was our childhood. If you played from 2020 it still is a childhood game if you are a child. This game makes dreams. It has such a twist to it. The intervention. [b] WE ALL LOVED IT[/b] no mater who you were. This game it just a perfect one. Also, YOU cant forget spec ops. Younger self be hitting the favelas in the head with claymores.

[h1] Campaign of a century [/h1]

How can you not forget the campaign. It was so good. With the emotional scenes e.g [spoiler] Ghost and roaches death R.I.P [/spoiler] and also those action packed scenes. The graphics may be bad but the cut - scenes like when it says 75th Rangers, its just awesome.

[h1] If you weren't, you'll d wish you were [/h1]

Lets get it right. Who doesn't like interventions? Its like that 'Gun of childhood' No - scoping and quick - scoping were due to this gun. The reactions of the trick-shots were insane. E.g

[h1] conclusion of the topic [/h1]

Overall if you have ¬£20.00 or dollars. GO FOR IT! I swear to god, you are missing out. You may think the multiplayer is dead but it is not! You can find a full lobby from times up to 10 seconds - 3 minutes max. If you can buy the game and you end up buying some weird Naruto game. god forgives. BUT I DONT!"

2171,"*DISCLAIMER THIS A REVIEW OF THE CAMPAIGN*

Suffice to say, the original Modern Warfare is a very important game. Not only for Call of Duty but for gaming as a whole. With its great campaign, revolutionary multiplayer design and bold new direction for the series, it set the franchise on fire and led it into new heights of popularity. One would think that topping the original Modern Warfare with a sequel would be impossible, however you would be wrong.

Modern Warfare 2 is almost as legendary at its predecessor, if not, it is even more beloved. It continues the series with a much more daring story line in its singleplayer whilst keeping its fan favourite characters. It also set the stage for Call of Duty's multiplayer format for all future COD titles. Many hardcore fans consider this game to be the peak of the series, so just how good is it?

Initially when I was playing the campaign, I was intrigued, but not really blown away. Initially I felt as if the game was simply going the be a retread of old ground. However, every mission past ""No Russian"" only got better and better. The game has the perfect mix of insane over the top action and serious moments to keep you invested. It can get pretty ridiculous on occasions, but the plot twists and surprises presented here are really damn well done.

Despite some minor plot holes, the story is more compelling and interesting overall when compared to the previous title. The game essentially revolves around a fictional World War 3, with an American implicated terrorist attack in Russia leading to all out war between Russia and the United States. In true Modern Warfare fashion, you follow two different perspectives within the conflict. On one hand, you play as ""Roach"" engaged in covert operations alongside ""Soap"" from MW1. On the other end, you play Ramirez, a US Army Ranger fighting the Russian forces in war torn America. It is for the most part, a standard plot, but it is held up by multiple unique plot elements which I cannot mention without spoilers.

On a technical level, the game isn't massively improved on MW1. Characters still look good, the environments are still dense, large in scale and packed with detail. I'd say the main difference lies in the games use of set pieces and the weapon designs. Modern Warfare 2 is packed with huge set pieces with a lot going on at once. These are the action sections which ultimately have made the series campaigns so famous. There are a lot of them, but it feels like just the right amount. You still spend plenty of time with the actual shooting mechanics themselves which still feel great. Soundwise, the game is a good step up from MW1, which already had great sound design to begin with. Voice acting is better across the board and no single person gives a weak performance. The gun sound effects are far more punchy and effective when compared to MW1 and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is fantastic.

When it comes to gameplay, there really isn't that much to say. The gunplay still feels smooth and satisfying. The level design is still linear, but feels cohesive and well put together. The game has a good variety of objectives and missions and rarely does a mission go on for too long. It is much of the same quality design from MW1. If you enjoyed MW1, you will either enjoy this game just as much, or even more.

It took me just over 4 hours to beat, which is pretty standard for a COD campaign and I felt truly satisfied by the end. Its a high quality campaign with a lot of stellar moments and I can see why it is a fan favourite. It has everything you could want in a COD campaign and more."

Or u can try your luck and buy all damn DLCs and hope that you'll have enough players for 2 teams, this game needs one really good update to be something new so players maybe would download or buy it and start playing more than now. 27. Sep. 2021. player record on steam charts is around 700 players and it all depends is is world wide or by the region, but one thing is clear. Do not buy it, noting than waist of money..."

I would not buy any old COD game for the multiplayer though. Very often you will encounter cheaters. The devs do nothing about it. It helps them sell games - the players sick of hackers buy the new game. Eventually it gets hacked too, rinse and repeat."

Came back to 100% the game on steam and wasn't disappointed. 10/10."
2311,"For nostalgia purposes only. While this game enjoys the praise of kids and teens who grew up with it, an honest look at MW2 reveals its weaknesses. After the original modern warfare, infinity ward struggled to improve the formula which was so successful in 2007:

-Despite a budget second to none, there are no dedicated servers.
-Proper weapon and Killstreak balance wasn't achieved. 
-The campaign, albeit well produced, fails to deliver the novelty of its predecessor.
-The difficulty system lets you choose between a walk in the park or a painful cover&regen game.

The Spec Ops mode was a welcome addition, but not a worthy opponent to Treyarch's Zombie mode."
2312,good.
2313,poop fart man sex
2314,pretty fun no russian was my favorite mission
2315,"oh yea yea

2316,Classic Game! Wish there was aim assist for controller players though :(
2317,Same 2011 Nostalgia per usual. If only we could remove the amount of camping nerds spamming heartbeat sensors and guys with TAR-21 Noob Tubes who spam One Man Army and a toxic voice chat then this would be a bit better. But I still love it all the same.
2318,this game is very fun and i am playing in 2021
2319,"10/10
The best game ever.

I can shoot guns, shoot more guns, blow stuff up, and lastly, shoot some more guns.
Michael Bay would be proud, and this game is a masterpiece."
2320,I CANT PLAY THE MULTIPLAYER MODE! IT SUCKS!!!!!!
2321,"Amazing gameplay and really good story, not like a ""good story"" as in emotional or something but more as a carry to play the whole game, in that way.
It's not like you're watching a fucking movie, you  can feel like the protagonists if you try or instead just go shooting around without a care in the world
8/10 recommend, special ops wasn't yet online and a friend of yours MUST have the game on steam"

2334,"Vintage chocolate chip cookies

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
¬Ω tsp bicarbonate of soda
¬º tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ¬Ω tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¬º tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8‚Äì10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you‚Äôve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don‚Äôt leave them too long or they‚Äôll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking 

and btw- cod mw 2 is still alive- even multiplayer finds lobbies so fast"

2337,"Only played the campaign. Don't care for the multiplayer.

Gunplay is tragically boring and monotonous. At least the game is significantly less frustrating than the first Modern Warfare and it's not nearly as offensive, but it's only not offensive cause the whole game feels like it was made for children."

This is the most overrated pile of shit on the market.

2353,one of the only good call of duty games on the planet
2354,"It's a genuinely good FPS experience. No single individual aspect is the greatest compared to its contemporaries of yesteryear (2009); Wolfenstein has cooler guns, Left 4 Dead 2 has more depth and complexity than most of Spec Ops, Borderlands is bigger and has way more depth in terms of combat customization, Fear 2 has a wider variety of gameplay experience in its campaign, Killzone has a way more interesting pertinent and culturally relevant story, Halo ODST is... Halo, Assault on Dark Athena has way better stealth, Battlefield 1943 has better graphics, Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising is way more realistic, Painkiller Resurrection has better music... wow 2009 was a great year for FPS games... but that doesn't matter. This game doesn't NEED to have the coolest guns because the guns it has work well, are tight and responsive, and all fill their individual roles [although let's be honest, the L86 LSW and M14 EBR are the best, we all know it]. Spec Ops doesn't NEED Valve's AI director and 4-person co-op. There doesn't NEED to be mech battles and horror levels. It doesn't NEED a script written by Tolstoy, or a story bigger than 3 people's perspectives need to see [4 if you count Allen, rip], or the greatest stealth, or the sharpest picture, or an insane commitment to realistic immersion, or a soundtrack that punches you in the ears (Hans Zimmer did an amazing job, this is one of many reasons why he's one of my favorite modern composers). It doesn't need any of this to be a genuinely fun experience that's worth playing once or twice (or ten times) in your life.

Of course there are flaws. Bad AI. Bad Collision. Bad (at times) Level Design. But given that all we had recently before this was the bad goldeneye remake, the bad turok reboot, the bad stalker game, battlefield bad company (which was funny but not amazing), resistance fall of man 2 [ratchet & clank + gore], far cry 2 (divisive), and fallout 3 (atrociously bad fps), none of them are even remotely noticeable in the grand scheme of things.

And when you look at what followed: Black Ops, Halo Reach, Metro 2033, Far Cry 3, Bioshock Infinite, Titanfall, Wolfenstein, Fallout 4... and Doom. The FPS genre isn't nearly what it once was, at the peak of its popularity, the height of its power. It hasn't been for five years, for ten years, and I doubt it ever will again. But that thought doesn't sadden me because we'll always have these to look back on fondly.

If you like FPS games, you will like this game; this, arguably the quintessential FPS. Just pure unadulterated aim the gun and shoot the bad guy FUN, without extra bells & whistles & ""rpg mechanics""."

Standard COD campaign - more like a movie on rails. Extremely linear but great level design. Story is solid, probably one of the better ones imo. Favorite level is probably Exodus, fighting through an American suburban neighborhood is super fun - wish there were more games where you could fight house to house like this a bit."
2362,"This game has the most remembered campaign by the CoD community, which is very well done and when playing it you feel like in 2010, regarding multiplayer there are currently many hackers, if you have no problems with that then I also recommend it. 10/10"
2363,"use console commands like ""timescale 0.5"" to have a ton of fun with this. Remove flinch too, very important as there is way too much! (message for the console command)

*salute*

O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, 
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming, 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight 
O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming? 
And the rocket's red glare, the bomb bursting in air, 
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there, 
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep 
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, 
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, 
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? 
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, 
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream, 
'Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! 
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore, 
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion 
A home and a Country should leave us no more? 
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution. 
No refuge could save the hireling and slave 
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, 
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. 
O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand 
Between their lov'd home and the war's desolation! 
Blest with vict'ry and peace may the heav'n rescued land 
Praise the power that hath made and preserv'd us a nation! 
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, 
And this be our motto - ""In God is our trust,"" 
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."
2377,"Are you from Australia/New Zealand, if so, pick this game up as soon as possible, there are dedicated servers available at dedigamer.com for you to all use. This game is still alive and well 11 years strong due to these servers.

Classic CoD, low ping, active players, the perfect sit back and relax game, or sweat if that's your thing.

Highly recommend if you need to scratch that classic CoD itch, as the rest of the games have very few Australian/NZ players still."
2378,"Always a fan of COD and ACTIVISION since 9 or 11 (I guess, forgot my age anyway XD), this game's been an evergreen memory since the last few years. Great gameplay, awesome mechanics and really good parkour, still remember those mountains and cliffs parkour, also has firefight and brutal animation of gunfight, perfect FPS game. Would recommend it."
2379,"[b] Favourite CODs in general now[/b]
1. MW3 (Big battle levels in campaign, Addictive Spec Ops Survival, Missions, Chaos, MP a bit better than MW2, Great SFX)
2. WaW (Gritty Campaign, Nazi Zombies, Easy 7 kill max killstreak MP (no nukes, giant dominating gunships))
3. BO1 (New Zombies, Better MP balance than MW2, Bot matches in MP for practice, Good campaign)
4. ---MW1 (Great campaign, simpler gameplay before MW2 changed things, GOOD SIMPLE MP; 3 streaks)
5. ---MW2 (Movie-like Campaign, Amazing Guns and SFX, Spec Ops missions, Obnoxious Kill-streak MP)
6. ---BO2 (Stupid Sci-Fi setting BUT AMAZING MP LOADOUT CUSTOMIZATION)
7. ------COD2 (Simple and good WW2 story gameplay; COD's roots)
8. ------COD3 (Loved the characters in the Campaign as the Allies pushed into France during the Nazi invasion)


[b] Best CODS by category (Now): [/b]
Campaigns:       WaW > MW2 > MW3 > BO1 > BO2(sci fi doesnt fit COD tbh though)
Other Modes:    BO1, WaW(Nazi Zombies) > MW3, MW2(Spec Ops)
MP:                   WaW > MW1 > BO1 > ....... > BO2 > MW3 > MW2 
                             (Simpler streaks > Larger more chaotic streaks = fairer this way for anyone to enjoy mp)

CoDs I don't acknowledge:
Infinite Warfare, Advanced Warfare, BO3, BO4: Wall sliding, Sci-Fi, Exo-suit randomness... meh, felt wrong

MW 2019, Black Ops: Cold War, MW2(probably): TOO SWEATY, NOT CASUAL ANYMORE, NOT FUN, TOO COMPLICATED

Warzone: Too big of a file-size, Barrier for people to download(commit to), Sweatiest BR out there besides Apex

2382,"I remember when I called Call Of Duty 4 the most complete and most definitive game in the franchise. Now, I don't mean to dismantle that, but Modern Warfare 2 is just a huge improvement over that.
The graphics of course, but even more so, the gameplay. The guns handle amazingly, weirdly satisfying and snappy in your hand, I'm a bit cheeky that they have removed the lean-right/left feature but I guess it was too OP in multiplayer anyway.

The introduction of Spec Ops was a yet welcomed addition to the game although I must say, those missions are quite the rage-quitters on Veteran difficulty.
The campaign dare I say is more memorable than what was offered in CoD 4 (Except for All Ghillied Up), it has its share of controversial missions as well (No Russian) and man are the characters more fleshed out and expanded upon this time around.

Without a doubt, CoD 4 might have been a game changer for the franchise and gaming in general, but Modern Warfare 2 feels like the peak of the series."

2386,"Call of Duty MW2 is an awesome experience to play and the campaign hooks you up until the end of the story, multiplayer is quite dead right now, and spec ops is a fun mode to play if you are bored. If you are willing to buy this game just for the campaign, then just get MW2 Remastered for the same price for $20. Otherwise it is not worth the price at all."
2387,The Best Story Line Game EVER! Awesome Missions And Guns!
2388,Great game with suprises around every corner
2389,fun
2390,"Currently playing through all the campaigns to get into the cod series! Unfortunately I knew some spoilers since the internet likes doing that but I was looking forward to playing this one! Overall it's nice to go back to the modern setting after playing world at war, and I really enjoyed this one as well!

Okay! starting with the campaign, Out of all I played so far I think the missions overall are the best so far! I think a key difference between this and what came previously was that this game seemed to have a lot more levels with more open space. A lot of the missions you are running across the field while a bunch of guys are shooting at you and you gotta find cover to avoid them. I also liked that there were more stealthy missions in this one as well as the museum mode that shows at the end, it's very unique! Lots of memorable missions for this one overall! Played on normal difficulty cause I'm still bad at fps games but hey I used to play on easy for cod 1 and 2 so that's progress! Also didn't bother with spec ops because from what I gathered it's just the same maps with extended objectives so I figured that wasn't necessary to play.

As for multiplayer, I tried to join a lobby before modding it and I was not able to find any lobbies, but then I found a mod called IW4x and was able to join a bunch of games! I only played a few games of team deathmatch so I can't really judge how good it was but I could say it felt very similar to cod4: really fast and dying very quickly. So all I could gather from it is that it's more cod, which is good, but I don't feel like playing this compared to newer titles with better graphics!

Overall this was my favorite cod campaign so far! Up next is black ops and I'm looking forward to see how different it will be to the modern warfare series!"

There are many negative reviews I've read up on saying that the hackers in this don't only cheat in game but with how the servers were made they have access to your PC. They can steal data, install ransomware or essentially anything they want. I'm making this review to try and get the message across so hopefully it will get fixed (even though it most likely will not)"
2447,"The single player modes are honestly worth getting this game while it's on sale.

The story is done really well and continues in mw3. I completed all the spec ops and campaign on vet and honestly. If you want a game for it's story alone I would say this is a pretty good choice although, many more games are out with much longer campaigns for the price of this game so, get this during a sale if you want it. Also if you go the 100% god help you gl"

2481,"It was pretty good until one day I went to play multiplayer and got the ""no or bad challenge for address"" Error message, ever since i haven't been able to play it."
2482,How can you leave a bad review on this game?
2483,i love play this game it fun meetin new people all over
2484,literly mw2
2485,Back on xbox 360 I used to love this game as I would come home from school and play this all day. After revisiting this game on pc in 2021 it has its ups and downs. 1st the multiplayer is terrible as its filled with cheaters. 2nd the dlcs are not worth it in my opinion. Overall I would give this game around a 8.5/10. It was really fun to grind all the steam achievements for this game and revisit the campaign and spec ops.
2486,this game is reaslly good and the campaine is very fun
2487,I love the game
2488,"that's one less lose end

better than 1
10/10 would defend a crippled america again"
2489,"One of the few, if not the only, really really good, like jaw-dropping, butt-clenching, high-octane, shit my pants good, COD game worth playing and recommending purely cause of how insanely fun the single player campaign was."
2490,"Graphic -awesome
Sound -realistic
Missions -not boring
"
2491,"Unfortunately, the hackers make the multiplayer almost unplayable but other than that campaign is still fun to go back to and spec ops is spec ops"

Its got a campaign that keeps you hooked to the story until the very end, spec ops that keep you busy and grinding in veteran or any difficulty you choose to complete, and the multiplayer has been a fun addiction in the past, sadly nowadays, its hard to find multiplayer matches however, if you are looking for a good story/missions I recommend this game for sure!"

"
2599,"Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them. I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this.

CAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):

The campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3

SPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):

The Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.

MULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):

The Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this.


Conclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision.

Things to be aware of -

There is no direct controller support for this game.

If you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there.

MW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you.

This game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.

At the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.

If you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.

Servers were captured by hackers, running full pack of cheats. Publisher not willing to do a thing. When you connect to their sessions, it opens some deride video in browser. Probably they can take control over players PCs.
Considering the high price of pretty old game, as well as the lack of any actions on the part of the publisher, I cannot recommend it for the safery of others."
2605,Euphoric to get to play this game again!
2606,CALL OF DUTY
2607,"F*ck Call of Duty. All Call of Dooty is f*****g shit. First, of all, they still haven't fixed their sprinting mechanic where you press and hold the sprint button and then you randomly stop sprinting for no reason even though you're still holding down the sprint button. And no, it's not my keyboard's fault, I continuously sprint without stopping for other games like Apex Legends, Valorant, and Star Wars Battlefront. I am not the only one with this issue. Lots of COD players have had this issue in the past and the devs have never f*****g fixed it because they are blessed with an overrated-ass game that guarantees their iron rice bowl. Also, the gun glitches now and then and just stops shooting completely. For no F*****G REASON. I am so done with this game. Going back to playing Minecraft, Fortnite, and other better games than this shit show. And yes, I said what I said, I literally am so fed up with this game that I am willing to play with 5 year old REE kids on Fortnite than play Call of Dooty. Finally, the main character is always weak as f***. I am on hardened mode to give myself a challenge but I did not guess for a sec that that meant a character that can't sprint, can't shoot, and has 2 HP. Mr. Fatty McTavvy here (my apparent character) dies within two shots while I see Ghost or Makarov take like 500,000,000 and be like ""Tis a scratch."""

Spec-Ops you can play as the ever so famous Grassman once again with suppressed weapons but Spec-Ops also means you can play it with a friend so that means 2 Grassmen hunting down Grass enemies BUT the snowman mission is also in Spec Ops so that's 2 snowmen hunting down snow people while being stealthy. Multiplayer aswell you can be a Grassman and Snowman too! 

i approve this support towards camouflaged people.

Before the main review starts i just wanna warn people DO NOT play multiplayer online only with friends. IT IS UNSAFE there are exploits where people can take control of your PC. Multiplayer is also full of hackers who ruin the game and DOX PEOPLE. This is not Infinity Wards fault though because this game hasn't been updated for years. so DO NOT play with randoms but play private games with your friends if you wanna play multiplayer. Anyway now that that is out of the way now to the review.


Overview:
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a very action packed first person shooter released in 2009 it has 3 main modes to play. The Campaign, a very intense story about what is basically world war 30 happening. It is riddled with memorable and monumental moments and one of the best cod campaign stories. With great level design and greatly executed gimmicks. Special Ops, a new mode to the call of duty series. featuring areas from the mw2 and cod 4 campaigns but with extra challenges added to the mix. some examples include completing areas in a certain amount of time, fighting waves of enemies and snowmobile racing. and finally multiplayer, a mode where you can fight random people from around the world in deathmatches like team deathmatch, free for all, capture the flag, kill confirmed and much more. with crazy killstreaks and weapons.

Now i'm gonna go to the checklist!

2661,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 easily the best one of the series  its a 2009 first person shooter game made by infinity ward and published by  Activision Its the sixth call of duty game this is the follow up game to call of duty 4 you play threw the campaign as a soldier Sergeant Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson working with your team to fight the Russians in multiple battles when you reach the end of the game you will unlock the museum that shows all the battles you have fought all the people you have met all the guns you have used  Modern Warfare 2 is truly a masterpiece."
2662,uu
2663,"This is an amazing game, just in the 2000's this was probably amazing for an call of duty game. Really recommand playing it."
2664,Im 66 years old so I can say I really enjoyed playing this. Still do. Grew up playing war with plastic toy guns and this takes me back. I haven't tried the advanced veteran level yet cause my reflexes aren't what they used to be. It's fun.
2665,I love this game even tho this is a old game it has some good lookin' graphics !
2666,this my fovorite :)
2667,"""Mission Failed. We'll gettem next time."""
2668,Awesome
2669,every modern warfare is nice
2670,A very entertaining game!
2671,"This game is so fucking bad. Little babies played this and said the n word 12 years ago and think of it so fondly. If this game came out today they would all bitch and complain about made up things like ""SBMM"" and ""broken things"" which they cry for every year. D tier game only better than like COD WW2. Nobody would like this game if they remade it. Black ops 2 if 15x better than this sad excuse for a game. upvotes to the left."
2672,"honestly the best cod
"
2673,"I used to play this game on my big brothers pc and it was fun for me
After finishing this game any time and on different platforms i want to play it again
If you have blizzard account go play remastered edition its rly not "" dont buy it on russian regoin cuz you wont have no russian mission """
2674,yes
2675,good game the game is listed at a good price
2676,shit is beast bro even after years
2677,"Multiplyer is alpha and omega od this game, and i must say in previos MW was better."
2678,Obra maestra
2679,"The campaign is iconic.  They should make a survival shooter ARPG based on the level after the EMP, but in an alternate timeline, where no one is coming to save the world, and it takes a lot longer to fix everything Makarov did."
2680,fun
2681,i love the graphics and overall its a really cool game
2682,Childhood game.
2683,"""Take no prisoners comrades."""

2686,e de smecheri dal in pula mea de joc
2687,"its very fun! i would 100% recommend!!!
"
2688,"Despite its age the game is still kicking.
The pompous, over-the-top campaign with all those dramatic scenes, plot twists and as a cherry top arguably the most controversial moment in video games' history, supported by a top-tier soundtrack made by Hans Zimmer- for all of this it's worth its Price.
Remastered or 2009 version, just buy it."
2689,HEYOO hyoo heoyy SO GOOD AS FUCK CAMPAIGN SHEESH HARD BUR FUN. OH SHIT GTG TO DIE

2698,"try to get it for lower than 20$ if 10 bucks or lower I would get it just for the SP content alone, ( the MP is unsafe to play according to some people ) the game ran great and I had no crashes or random FPS drops or anything like that."
2699,"campaigns good, spec ops is a nice challenge but like every old cod the multiplayer is now dead on official servers but there are servers hosted on iw4x which allow you to enjoy multiplayer without the hackers. i think ¬£19 is the most reasonable price i have seen for the older cod games its got an amazing story and there's still spec ops that you can play. just multiplayer you need iw4x which is free"
2700,i love it

I thought that it might've just been rare, but recently I found out it simply did not exist on the Wii. I still don't know why, since this game is a pretty decent addition to the franchise.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is when all the problems that can be in multiplayer are gathered in one place."
2725,"Awesome, awesome, awesome. This game's campaign is short, even on veteran, so if 20 dollars for 5 hours is too much for you that's that but personally I think it was worth the 4$ an hour the campaign costs to play. You cannot get such a good experience elswhere with such memorable missions."

I played this as a stand alone game on PlayStation first and then on Steam. One of the few games I gave 400+ hours playing. I enjoyed replaying it several times over. 
Most of my time was spent in the online multiplayer mode. Which is dynamic and fun!

2815,"WARNING if you are getting this game for the multiplayer you WILL encounter hackers, and there's nothing you can do about it. There are literally tons, and it's gotten to the point where every lobby I join is a hacked one. 

ADDTIONALLY: One hacker was able to direct me to a website without my permission. This is can be very dangerous depending on the website they choose. I would recommend people stay away from this game for your computer's sake unless you know how to block certain IPs and avoid servers. I'm too lazy to do it, but there are guides available."
2816,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a masterpiece. The campaign is thrilling, invigorating, and a ton of fun. The story is awesome and seeing the catastrophic events of the game unfold as you play is extremely memorable. Most importantly, this game conveys a very crucial thing. War is hell."
2817,i have aids
2818,"i like campaign alot but there alot of things that wold be better if they changed, 1. ghost and roach wont have to die 2. royce and meat would be with you throught take down and hornet's nest 3. that you could save wounded allies on the field like once when you try to get white house back and soldiers when they were evacing i saw one soldier wounded just crawling and then dying and i couldnt do anything to save him"

2863,no problem ghost
2864,one of my favourite games.
2865,Better then the remastered
2866,BEST COD GAME
2867,"This in my opinion is by far the best Call of Duty game ever made. I played this on release day on XBOX 360 in 2009, and I have never grown bored of playing. Multiplayer is infested with modders which is a shame, but the Campaign is amazing and is very re playable."
2868,"best story hands down but DONT GO INTO MULTYPLAYER there are people who gain control of your pc and get all info TRUST ME
"
2869,Just a classic COD nothing to complain abaut I would really recomend this game.But it still loses agianst gta 5
2870,"TL;DR -- You'll mostly buy this for the multiplayer. It's still alive and still fun, but it costs $15 at the minimum on sale. Is it still worth it today with all the choices available? You decide.

the GOOD:
--Fun, addictive multiplayer that expands upon COD 4's system in many ways
--Large arsenal of weapons that are all fun to use, and look extremely realistic
--Top-notch graphics and impressive engine (but with its massive budget this is expected)
--Excellent sound design (with exception of shotguns and pistols could be a bit beefier)
--Memorable, creative, and iconic set pieces in campaign that are just awesome to go through
--A great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer that makes emotional moments all the more powerful.
--Great casting/voice acting (Again to be expected with its budget)
--Great scripting (as in, scripted events in the levels). IW are known for this, but take it again to the next level in MW2
--Spec Ops missions add some more replayability and slight variations on campaign missions (as well as a couple maps exclusive to the mode). It is also intended to be played CO-OP, so you can have fun with a buddy, though most missions are still available to play solo. Beating them all on Veteran difficulty for the 3 stars will be a challenge!
--Lower player count in online maps compared to CoD 4, which is a good thing because now the player count is actually balanced for the size of the maps (before maps were too crowded). They will still feel full at 16 players, but the size is just right now.
--Overall, it takes everything that made previous Call of Duty's so great, but it is way more OVER THE TOP in every department, from the incredible movie set pieces to the multiplayer guns and killstreak rewards. It is a little sillier and tonally speaking less grounded in reality than previous entries, which may be a bit of a shock coming from MW1, but the tradeoff is it is definitely more fun for it!


the BAD:
--Plot doesn't always make sense. There's a big plot hole early in the game, which makes it a little hard to take seriously the tragedy/inciting action responsible for the rest of the game's events. However, once the war breaks out in Act 2, the game gets better, and the final Act of the game is really good. The primary antagonist also has very questionable motivations. Suffice it to say, this is a high-octane blockbuster of Michael Bay proportions. It's not a masterclass in writing to be looked at too closely.

--A.I. aren't great, but they do their job. On the higher difficulties the limitations of the a.i. are really apparent, but even on regular they aren't the greatest. (This is most easily noticed in the stealth sections.)

--Arcadey, On-Rails, Linear level design. This is the staple formula of the Call of Duty series. If you don't mind and accept it for what it is, then this isn't a problem. But if you go in wanting any choice over how you attack targets/complete objectives beyond pressing E to use or pointing and clicking, you will be disappointed.

--Some PC port-related issues: Options can't be configured till you go to spec ops or start campaign; removal of the in-game console; changing FOV requires a 3rd party program (but easy to download and use); server browser and dedicated servers replaced by ""IWNet"" aka matchmaking with very poor anti-cheat. Thankfully, today you can bypass the IWNet and use a standard server browser via a mod called IW4X. The mod also has much better anti-cheat (I have never had an issue with hackers) and patches some of the more dangerous Remote Control Exploits vulnerabilities

--Overpriced. It's $20 regular, and barely $5 less on sale. By today's Steam Sale standards it's ridiculous, considering most games today go less than that after 2 years. What's even more outrageous is that up until very recently, it used to be $10 on sale. Yeah, Activision have actually been quietly RAISING the prices, and are now doing the same for World At War and Call of Duty 2."

2922,"Disclaimer: this review will focus on what I played in the story mode and special ops only as I did not experience the multiplayer.

This sequel takes place 5 years after the first modern warfare. The story is amazing from the new villain and plot twists all around. I have played this before on the Xbox 360 and PS3 a long time ago as I experienced special ops, it is quite tough and challenging.

Overall, the game is still loved by many people as this game competes against Black Ops in terms of both story and multiplayer"

2975,"Call of Duty 4 was like a good game that was given a powerful shot of energy to make a great and compelling campaign that had one special moment that came to a viewer like a hard smack in the face, the one thing that turns a great game into a classic game--- the mission ""Shock and Awe"", from start to end. This needs no explanation here.

The sequel aims heavily for upping its predecessor as much as possible, with a story far more complex and action-adventure laden, going bigger and faster as well as darker and edgier.

Where Call of Duty 4 was a gritty smack to the face, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is like a kick to the back of the head. And a curb stomp.

Call of Duty 4 stuck out to me for its ""stinger"" moment---which not only succeeded beautifully in being shockingly realistic, but in playing off my very real and the very real fears of billions of people---nuclear destruction. ""Shock and Awe"" gave us all of that, and turned an average campaign into a monstrous creature that blew us away (much the way Paul Jackson was?) Modern Warfare 2 doesn't use these moments very sparingly, and in fact indulges in them at a brisk, satisfying pace. The opening mission is a very realistic journey into a war in Afghanistan, where your force has to hunt and kill many OpFor terrorists, and has an early sequence in which the Marines are riding in their big armored vehicles down completely barren and deserted streets. An occasional civilian comes out and runs away in fear. At one point, you see three men glaring nastily at you from a balcony, all but screaming ""bad guy"" about them, and yet you can do nothing. Some time later, you're attacked.

The rest of the story leaps immediately after this ""cold open"", and where it took half the campaign to kill off the American character in COD4, the American character is dead by the third mission here, in a mission called ""No Russian"", which itself is the most terrifying, gutwrenching, brutally offensive missions ever. Just ever.

Without spoiling it, there is a very good, and very mindblowing reason the terrorist Makarov tells his fellow terrorists ""No Russian"" in the mission's start. The first half of the mission then involves you---an American spy, forced to go to any means to maintain your masquerade with Makarov---and the rest, murdering HUNDREDS of innocent civilians in a Russian airport.

That was something I simply couldn't take in and register, and had to restart the level some time later to get over it. I then realized then that they were very, very serious about the pre-game warning about the game's very extremely graphic content, and giving me a one-time only offer to turn off the graphic portions of the game.

From there, the game keeps delivering ""HOLY SH!!"" moments again and again, but without spoiling you into expecting them every level. However, a very similar ending to ""Shock and Awe"" appears this time around, spread across three whole missions and a cutscene (IN SPACE!) And yes, the game DOES give us more of the same---more stuff and junk. More multiplayer options, more single player options, more weapons, etcetera. It keeps the multiplayer system intact with great new options and fun.

Another big improvement: the graphics. These are by far some of the most realistic graphics I've seen in any game ever. People's faces actually look human (though obviously 3D), and their mouths move correctly to their speech. Details everywhere are given great attention, as random computer systems have every crease, button, hole, and screw in clear detail. A box of mints shows in clear detail on the dashboard of a military vehicle. Wads of gore stick to where they land, and boxes of paper for printing are in perfect detail and fully labeled all around.

Then, the drawbacks. None of these are enough to bring down the game even half a star: - The blood-on-the-screen look is probably more realistic than just shades of red, but it's incredibly distracting, and fills up far too much of the screen that it becomes almost impossible to see anything.

The story indulges a lot more in a fantastical action-packed nature of real, open war not just on terrorist organizations, but on an equal footing. Part of what made Call of Duty 4 so great and shocking was that it essentially was based on reality and stuck to that---Americans were waging a ""war on terror"", surgically striking OpFor locations while hunting down the OpFor leader Al-Asad, the Bin Laden of this world, while SAS agents sneak around working against Russian (and perhaps Chechnyian) terrorists, in which both story lines overlap and become one towards the end.


This time around, it stays to that storyline universe, while taking greater and greater departures from reality. For me, there seems to be a genuine concern that the game that was so appealing for its realism may end up going just a bit too far into the fantastical, and while still be a great experience, not be as impactful as COD4 because it went beyond the realm of speculative realistic fiction, and into the realm of fantasy war stories, like ""Turning Point"", ""Command & Conquer/Red Alert"", ""Rainbow Six"", ""24"", and all the other modern-ish war stories that become fantasy on their own terms.

Perhaps that's a good thing for this game, though it has more than enough features to make it an epic experience."

2991,"Great Story, Good game play, and Awesome Music by Hans Zimmer."
2992,Best Call of Duty Game ever!! Has one of the best storyline i have ever played. Strongly recommended Game
2993,"Great sequel from CoD 4 Modern Warfare. Great campaign missions as usual, and some memorable moments for sure. Multiplayer still alive, just like CoD4, still has a lot of active players.
Finished this game 1 time on Normal Difficulty, and finished it again on Veteran Difficulty for 7 hours.
1 thing that bugged me is that there is no lean option, which is kinda sad.
But overall, 10/10, absolutely."
2994,This game is an absalute blast of a  time. Really had fun with it the betrayl was really unexpected one of if not the best CoD i've ever played. The only thing that is a  bit bothering is the stealh mission felt a little bit boring but that's it. if you're looking for a  fun story and the other modes are a  blast too!
2995,Good game worth the $40 would avoid multiplayer with randoms
2996,the worst servers known to man
2997,THE multiplayer is very uh empty and the campaign is better than anything i have played you should get it
2998,"Campaign is a masterpiece, multiplayer will forever bring back great memories (yes you Skidrow), and the spec ops is a mode I can enjoy, and do, to this very day!"
2999,Best story on CoD series....
3000,Best Call of Duty¬Æ hands down. Please put it on sale more often

3011,"Decent campaign, a similar length (~6hrs) but far less polished than the first MW. The story is nowhere near as strong, and it lurches all over the place. Some great levels, though. Some interesting weapons included, though there was never as much choice as I would've liked, or any truly interesting options that would've allowed for radically different play styles. 

Odd thing that really irks me: Why would Russian paratroopers and security forces be carrying FAMAS or FALs? Or old AK-47s for that matter. For a game that seems so preoccupied with the weaponry, this seems like a weird thing to ignore. There are lots of interesting Russian weapons that could've been included. 


SPOILERS - if anyone else is actually new to this in 2021:

The player character death device that was used to such powerful effect in the first MW is frankly abused in this sequel. The infamous ""No Russian"" level is something I'd heard about and imagined would be very powerful in context, but it's basically irrelevant. With no lead-up and no development of the characters involved, it comes across as a cheap attempt to shock. It's a very boring level to play, too. Could've been amazing, but was utterly wasted. 

The bits I enjoyed most were the early airbase infiltration and subsequent snowmobile chase, the frantic scramble through Washington and the raid on the dacha towards the end. 

The post-game ""arcade mode"" (I forget what it's called) offers some fun challenges, too - it uses maps from the game and sets specific challenges like getting a certain number of kills, disarming bombs, defending against waves of attackers and the like. Neat

I don't care about multiplayer, haven't played it so have no opinion."

3027,"The very first Call of Duty game i've ever played. I still remember playing cod mw2 in an internet cafe and now that i own the game, my money has been spent well because cod mw2 has aged PERFECTLY. The campaign, plot twists, deaths, tips and tricks, it all came back and it still holds up today.... although, yes everything may be perfect BUT what i dont like is the map design. Sure we have classics like rust and etc. but there are just some maps that are so hard to go through and they may be too big to even play in. But over all its a great game and theres no doubt about it. though its sad that they removed the mods section cause the mods was one of the things that made cod mw1 great. Over all its a great game and a must buy."
3028,game good
3029,very fantastic game
3030,im only talking about the caighmpain. an amazing game the plot twist is amazing and in my opinon the best of the og trilogy. And lets be real here it has the best villian ever
3031,"Iconic and probably the best campaign ever. Super fun Special Ops mode, great nostalgic game overall."
3032,"Really well made,although I think everyone knows that.Love the action and the ending is so good! Recommend buying!"

(my only complaint is that MW2 isn't controller compatible, so I had to learn mouse and keyboard on the fly.) Other then that, it was great. Stay frosty."
3039,The good days!
3040,"this is the same as the first series, yes this is a form of redemption for playing pirated."

3050,Amazing game from 2009.
3051,"if you  like first person shooter game this game is for you

3052,Still remains one of the best FPS games ever made. This game is from 2009 and the graphics still look splendid to this day. Not much to say as everyone knows the reputation this game has. It's up there with the best.

3066,"Great Game,Awsome Game play"
3067,Best of the series as far as I know. I don't buy any of the newer ones because Activision doesn't offer much in terms of sales since BO2 or MW3.
3068,no virus hindi download
3069,"Good game, sadly i'm giving a thumbs down because all CODs are hugely overpriced in steam (the old ones).
This nonsense led by activision is ruining the franchise life, i hope people don't buy older COD games at least until ACTIVISON changes the prices because this is an insult to intelligence.
This was written by someone who played all the games of the franchise until black ops 3."

3073,"Amazing Game, Totally friendly and i had no racial slurs yelled at me when i used akimbo model 1887s"
3074,All I have to say about MW2 is its just perfection from its multiplayer to its campaign and its spec ops mode. Playing the game now after many years reminds me of the good old days of Call of Duty before corporations started milking players out of their money and gaming companies trying so hard to jump on the latest trends of video games to make more money and forgetting about their fans and player base. But MW2 stands as a reminder that video games are not just a way for companies to make as much money as they possibly can while forgetting to make their games fun. But with rumours of MW2 multiplayer being remastered it gives me nightmares thinking that the game might have the same fate as Call of Duty 4's remaster that just became a micro transaction hell.
3075,good

3102,"Bought this game to relive the good ole days of cod and was not disappointed. Lobbies are still running however there is the chance of running into hackers... not always but there have been a few I've encountered. Overall though it's been very fun to play and I would recommend this game to anyone who's looking to get some nostalgia or just simply have fun playing an older type shooter game. 
"
3103,"Very fun game, but still not as good as Modern Warfare 3. 6/10"
3104,even on sale this game is just too much. The most i'd pay for this is like 10 dollars. c'mon.
3105,"I have 500 hours on this games multiplayer, it‚Äôs okay I guess"

3107,The best COD ever
3108,"""Why does this game still cost __ $$$ after it's been out for __ years?""

You can ask this same question for almost any Call of Duty game. Meanwhile you can purchase a physical CD of many of these games for $10 or less off Amazon. These are great games ruined by corporate greed. Cutting all of their baseline prices by 50% and keeping the same sale %discount would be an instant purchase for me."
3109,It's a good game but online is unplayable because of all the hackers lmao
3110,Good story and fun game at all.
3111,yes
3112,this game is just the peak of anything that has ever happened pls remake with continuation of story
3113,I don't have much to say about this game. Fun but difficult at stages.
3114,
3115,Aha... what if we kissed... on the Special Ops mission Hidden...? Haha jk... unless...?
3116,"make sure to replay the ""No Russian"" at least 10 times"

"
3118,"It's been 13 years since game was released.Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is still the greatest, most intense, anticipated, breathtaking Call Of Duty game of all time. Everything about this game is incredible, not a single fault not a single problem. The story is even better than before, packed with so many good and memorable moments, well crafted and constructed throwing many curve balls at the player and leaving you shocked and surprised at the end of it all, an amazing incredible campaign that is the best one out of the whole series. The Gameplay is incredible and exciting, there are so many weapons, new equipment, new things, it's truly amazing. The characters are so well made and done, really interesting personalities and great trademarks. The environment and maps are so well detailed and designed creating a dramatic and really good atmosphere and feel. The audio quality is fantastic and the game as a whole is really addictive and fun to play with. The Multiplayer is so much better than what has come before and is fun to play with friends, new weapons, new maps with the combination of the old favourite ones really gives the multiplayer a joyful fun feel to it(but it can suck sometimes because of modders). Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the best of the best and is still undefeated till this day, this game is a masterpiece a triumph and a worldwide success, the best Call Of Duty game there really is.Overall this game deserves to be 10/10."
3119,"E P I C

9/10"
3120,Pretty fun single player
3121,multiplayer is ded lol
3122,My first game
3123,141
3124,"Yes, it got released in 2009. But this COD is my favorite out of all call of duty games and will always be. I highly recommend playing this game and trying it out if u didn‚Äôt get the chance to.

( use WX4‚Äô and other servers to play now in 2020/2021 ) gl gamers."
3125,"This game is excellent, it made my childhood, I have not played CoD warfare 4 yet, which they say is the best, but until this very moment, in my opinion, this IS the best CoD warfare you have, I can remember phase by phase when I played about 7 years ago, it marked me a lot, the online? For me, revolutionized. Final Conclusions: With an exciting and interesting campaign since the first moment, MW2 brings a high level multiplayer with incredible and revolutionary ideas of modern warfare.

With increasingly absurd scenarios, with simple graphics, the game began to ignore the demands of realism. The multiplayer became more accessible. For some, this game, in my opinion was one of the responsible for making the franchise famous. Presenting an incredible campaign, great story, amazing characters, impeccable soundtrack and revolutionary multiplayer. 

Note: 9/10, if the graphics were better, even I think the graphics are some of the best for the time, if he was prettier, I think it would be 10/10 without a doubt, if you want a very remarkable game and very good, but at the same time short, with 8 hours of gameplay, I fully recommend"
3126,"To sum it up in one sentence, This is my favorite Call of duty Campaign ever. Play the first one before this though. :>"
3127,love it. i love killing people this game is good practice for real shootings.
3128,"Oh my the nostalgia. ""Get shit on kid, your bad, nobody loves you"". Despite the slightly agitating people on multiplayer this was the best Modern Warfare campaign made. It constantly wants to make me play on. I recommend getting the new remastered version actually (It's on blizzard but I hope it comes to steam one day). But If you hate using Blizzard like me you will find this very fun. Multiplayer might be dead by now but I still enjoy playing the campaign."
3129,gooood
3130,1v1 rust m8
3131,"f$$$in enjoyed after 12 years ,i think best cod ever in story  and multi player"
3132,Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
3133,The best war game inside the same kind other games. And there is a captain price. Just reason enough to buy this game.
3134,campaign is pretty ok
3135,Its a good game
3136,"best mw; not even close. some problems with frame timings so don't expect a perfect high refresh rate experience, but the mechanics are good, almost everything past act 1 is amazing, multiplayer has potential, but is overrun by hackers."
3137,"Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is such a great game. Never got a chance to experience it when it first came out. But Im happy to say, it still holds up to date. Its not a masterpiece, but is just a joy to play. 

Multiplayer is surprisingly good. ""I can't say the same for everyone"", just from my time with it, the only gamemode still up is team deathmatch, but really is still lots of fun. 

The biggest gripe I have is to do with the technical side of the game (Sound, Graphics, animations, options, controls) are and feel really outdated, but can be seen through really easily.

I think why I returned to this specific game is im just over Activision shoving microtransactions in every new Call of Duty, personally im just sick of it. This game just takes you back to a simpler time when the only paid content is optional map packs (don't buy by the way), and if you want to get upgrades or new weapons you just play the game and unlock them over time, you don't have to complete stupid Fortnite challenges to get them.

Overall, Modern Warfare 2 is simply a fun game without making itself more complicated, this is a game in a yearly franchise that has forgotten what made itself good in the first place.

""This review is my personal thoughts and opinions."""
3138,"Fun, but somehow managed to crash my pc. A game from 2009 crashed a pc i bought last year. wtf."
3139,Good
3140,Nostalgic stuff
3141,it ok
3142,"The game of my childhood.As a child, I played it for probably more than 1000 hours.One of the best creations of infinity ward.In most shooters, the plot is made for show. But call of duty modern warfare 2 is an exception.You will worry about the main characters.The plot of the game is very interesting.Multiplayer is also quite normal for 2020. Also in the game there are special operations, in which the player will have to shoot crowds of enemies at different points. You can also play with a friend in a special operation. The game has a lot of achievements, because of which the game will drag you more and more. There are also laptops with intelligence scattered on almost all levels,if you collect them all, you can get an achievement. Bottom line: call of duty modern warfare 2 is worth the money and you will not regret buying this game.

3167,"Campaign: Alot of cocain was snorted while making this campaign, but really enjoyable nonetheless

Spec ops: Wonderful Co-op mode to play with your friends, or to play alone

Multiplayer: One of the best, if not the best, cod multiplayer of all time

overall rating: 9/10"
3168,This is a certified hood classic
3169,AMAZING!! ENJOYED IT AND HOPE FOR IT TO HAVE A REMASTERED VERSION!
3170,"At this point, with the existence of the remastered campaign over on Battle-net, I find it hard to recommend the Steam release.

The multiplayer is pretty much dead, populated only by people who are either cheating or know how to spawn trap you on the game's base maps. If you must experience that for yourself, look up IW-4X and consider playing it there. It is a more enjoyable experience than the game's normal peer-to-peer host network. Even still, all of the players there are likely to know exactly what they're doing, so I don't recommend it if you are new to the game.

I recommend purchasing the remastered campaign on Battle-net for the same price, and then pirating MW2's game files in order to play IW-4X online afterwards. Activision does not need your money for a cheater-riddled, twelve year old video game."

3190,"it's k
"
3191,"Do not buy this game in the current year. It has been completely abandoned by Activision and, as a result of that, Infinity Ward. This game has multiple exploits that allow for lobby hosts to RCE and potentially plant RATs into your computer, on top of a near indefinite amount of cheaters & forced lobbies.

You and I both know you want this for the multiplayer, so do yourself a favor and install ùêº ùëä 4 ùë• instead. As much as I hate ùêº ùëä 4 ùë•, it's ultimately a much better experience than steam P2P MW2 will ever be in the current year & years going forward. Plus, it runs off of servers instead of P2P connections."

3240,"Played on veteran, the only difficulty was the AI infinite placement. Tip for future dev¬¥s of any type of game, note down on a piece of paper, a plausable number of soldiers, either ally or foe.

who dafuq gets shoot and points the gun sky high!? Your gun isnt light weight, the logical thing to do is point it down or away from you, but no ... Sky hight the gun goes! Who dafuq gets shoot and decides to have a seizure poiting the barrel up? Youre a soldier, you either kill or die trying, stop being a bitch and point that shit towards the enemy for fuck sake!

You manage to kill every dude in the room, and you die by the last guy, which makes you restart the whole mission, because the checkpoint was 2 hours ago. If you wanna fuck me, do it right, make me start from the beggining of the game, getting awaked by Shepherd, better yet, refund the game and make me buy it again from zero ... Or even better! put me back at my dads nut sack and let me get born, that way i can do everything again

Rip fire sucks, for no fucking reason, seemly theres only one hole the bullet can go out, why the bullet is going all over the place is a mistery, 20 cm difference, 40 is acceptable, but a whole meter apart is a fuking joke

The friendly AI reminds you of your friends in a team deathmatch, theyre useless ... They are the embodiment of ""scenery"" ""filler"", they just pretend to shoot, nothing more ...

Always someone screams ""Watch your fire"" even tho theres no civ or ally in the position youre shooting, i always hated that shit when i was young, because i kept searching which friend or civ i shoot, instead of killing the enemies that were shooting at me.

And who dafuq cares about these quotes that much?

How much money Makarov has? On the DSC module mission, theres a hundred man inside the house, a hundred more coming from the woods, more hundred men when youre trying to leave, more hundred men if you decide that you want to hold the perimeter in the house, Makarov is a multi billionare, no one has this amount of money to hire a entire army!!? Not even Elon Musk has the money to buy a entire private army. The spawn rate is so fucked up!"

3251,Legendary game
3252,"I'm probably gonna get sent to the gulag for this, but I don't understand why this was one of the most popular CoD games. Its just a standard Call of Duty. I think part of the reason it was so popular is because a lot of people played this growing up and everybody has stories about the Xbox Live messages. I, however, did not grow up playing real video games until about third grade, and I wasn't allowed to play anything past T-rated stuff until I was 12. So I totally get the childhood nostalgia, but I didn't have it so that's just me.

The plot wasn't anything super special honestly. Its just shoot this shoot that, defend this, blah blah blah. Not at all bad, but nothing out of the ordinary. It was also only about five hours long, which did kind of suck. And as I've said in the past, nobody plays CoD for the story. I know. But I still like to play campaign stuff when multiplayer doesn't sound good. The ""scene"" (Y'all probably know what I'm talking about) was ruined for me because I'd seen too many memes about it already. So I missed out on that moment I guess. I do think one thing they did right in the story was the mission where you have to help Makarov gun down everyone in an airport. ""No Russian."" That did kinda hurt to do. I think that was the goal. So if it was, good job Infinity ward, that's the most innovative thing you've done in a long time. 

Graphics are pretty standard for the time, but I think they still look good. I don't really care that much about 4K or 8K resolution as long as it looks good as is and is fun to play. And it is. So no complaints there. I did have a frequent issue where everything would go dark in my vision and I was only able to see certain things around me. I don't know for sure if that is a universal problem for people, or if its because I'm playing on Mac. 

I can't really compare gunplay from MW2 to MW, because the multiplayer on MW didn't work for me. i'm sure they're pretty similar, I don't think you could change gunplay too much i na span of a year.

Multiplayer works just fine on here. It might take a minute for you to find a lobby, which is understandable since this game is around 12 years old. But I was pleasantly surprised with how active the servers were. Of course, the hackers were all there like I expected. Some of the lobbies wouldn't let me switch weapons or use equipment cause they were hacked. Which is pretty stupid. The online community seems as toxic as ever. Lot of N-words being dropped in chat. Haven't come across anyone with a mic and frankly I'm okay with that.

The Spec Ops missions are fun to play as well. I was disappointed that MW didn't have them, so this definitely picked up the slack there. I still think MW3 spec ops were the best, but these are definitely a close second. Some of them require two players, but the majority can be played solo.

Overall, this was a good step up from MW1. Multiplayer is fun, spec ops are fun, gunplay works well, and that's about all you can ask for from CoD these days. So I'll give it an 8.5/10, and 20 bucks seems like a fair price. If you are looking to buy this, just keep in mind that the story isn't a s heart pounding and schlong throbbing as people make it sound, but it is still a ton of fun. Great buy, must have."
3253,One of the better story lines in the gaming industry. Really innovative graphics for its time and definently a recommendation for anyone that wants a few hours of good story
3254,"What a hidden gem. Highly recommended especially for those playing on a potato pc- smoothest gameplay ever without having to tweak the settings to the lowest (like always smh). For the price, I'd say GET IT. You won't regret it at all."

3277,eh its ok
3278,MW2 is a fantastic shooter with great gameplay and gunplay mechanics. Has an intense story-driven campaign. The spec-ops missions are a wonderful addition to Call of Duty that adds extra flavor to the game. The single-player modes interest me more than multiplayer. I highly recommend this game to long time Call of Duty fans and shooter fans.

3293,"The best Call of Duty to ever exist. This is what inspired many FPS games that came after it and for good reason. The maps are perfect, the weapons are so fun to use and you can even use many perk combinations that impact your class setup a lot. Each killstreak is fun to use but sometimes it can get too much, like constantly spawning and being mowed down by the enemy chopper gunner to the point that you don't even play the game anymore. Although this may seem like a bad thing, the game is certainly chaotic, but everything can work well and you can outplay everything thrown at you (except cheaters, but sometimes even them because they are still so bad). This game did everything right and it aged pretty well. If it had a dedicated server list it would massively improve the experience but it is what it is. Don't miss out on this if you have some friends to play with."

3306,"We must follow Shepherd‚Äôs plan,
Or else the shit will hit the fan.
Makarov must be found before
He can light the fuse of a Third World War.

Five years ago, lost thirty thousand men
In the blink of an eye.
The world just fucking watched like they were zen while my troops all burned and died.
Every fight is our fight,
What happens over here matters over there.
So many layers to what is right,
There‚Äôs no such thing as fair.

Remember, no Russian,
My elaborate scheme‚Äôs not up for discussion.
Sending a message is the start of my plan
By spilling Russian blood by America‚Äôs hand.
Revenge is like a ghost,
Takes over every man it touches.
Its thirst will not be quenched by its hosts,
Until everyone‚Äôs dead, freed from its clutches.

Now because of Shepherd‚Äôs plan,
The shit‚Äôs really hit the fan.
Makarov must be found before,
He can profit from this Third World War.

Ramirez! Let‚Äôs kick some ass!
Gather up some ammo and start to blast.
Hammer Down is in effect,
Pop flares on the roof then hit the deck.

On tour in Brazil to find intel,
Til our mission is changed, the world goes to hell.
Search the Gulag for 641,
Turns out it‚Äôs Price, already holding a gun.

I haven‚Äôt seen the sun in 5 years,
But I haven‚Äôt gone mad, so don‚Äôt fear.
The silo doors were opened by me,
To launch a nuke to space to cause an EMP.
The healthy human mind doesn‚Äôt wake up thinking it‚Äôs its last day on Earth.
But on a suicide mission, I think of it as a luxury, not a curse.

Now we‚Äôre fighting through the streets of the USA,
Russian paratroopers are all over the place.
Rescue VIPs as bombs hit our homeland,
At the White House, make our last stand.

Ghost! Come in, this is Price. Do not trust Shepherd! I repeat, do not trust Shepherd!

Because of Shepherd‚Äôs plan,
The shit‚Äôs really hit the fan.
Fooled us once, but won‚Äôt be fooled twice,
Shepherd dropped the soap, now he‚Äôll pay the price."

3309,"This game is one of the greatest games i've ever played on my life.
Up to this day, I still love the way this game was made. The graphics... Ohhh the graphics... THEY. ARE. FUCKING. AMAZING.
Standart config with 1920x1080 resolution and OH BOY WAS THIS THE BEST 7 HOURS OF MY FUCKING LIFE.
It feels old, but in a good way. Y'know when you play a really old game you played as a kid and didnt understand anything but still liked it? Yeah, thats the vibes this game gave me. The first missions felt a little confusing, but good, but then, Brazil hit me. Oh boy oh boy, those missions were fucking genious. THEY TALK IN PORTUGUESE. THEY TELL JOKES, THEY MAKE FUN OF AMERICANS, THEY KNOW HOW TO SHOOT MY FUCKING HEAD.
ALL MISSIONS, and I repeat, ALL DONT REACH THE DIFFICULTY OF BRAZIL. One big chunk of my time playing this game were trying to speedrun this level.
Then, I went to the part of the game where you try to kill Sheperd. What I said about Brazil was all a joke, 
[h1] This is the real shit. [/h1]
First, you go through the guards which is really easy, then you go to the stairs witch the bridge, after that, you enter the cave, kill some soilders(which is EXTREME in my opinion), AND THEN, The hardest part of the game, The fight against the guards inside the cave. It's fucking impossible. I don't even know how I did it, but somehow, I got it."

3319,"Why is this, forgive me the movie analogy, a Michael Bay type of schlock?

1. It cost $50 000 000 to produce.
2. Its marketing budget was $200 000 000.
3. The script is both pretentious and ridiculous.
4. It's absolutely unrealistic (just a few annoying examples ‚Äî you don't hold a handgun the way you'd hold a f√ºck1ng banana; even though there is no bullet drop, all the weapons feel like airsoft toys ‚Äî they have next to non-existent recoil and almost endless ammo). (See p. 3).
5. The dialogue is cheesy (see p. 3).
6. There are next to zero characters. Just looks and faces.
7. In its pathetic (and failed) attempt to look neutral on the ""nationalism vs. cosmopolitanism"" debate, it's filled with ""wisdom"" a.k.a. random pretentious quotes, but the premises behind the statements are never neither subjected to an analysis, nor even mentioned in any context (yeah, go on, accuse me of ""my unrealistic expectations"" with the counterargument ""dude, it's just a gAEm"" (yeah, ""just a game"" with a budget of ""just $250 million"") and then tell me how ""a game story is, if not more important, then at least equally important to the actual gameplay"").
8. The gameplay is nothing new ‚Äî very arcadey FPS (the highest ""difficulty"" is simply unfair to the player).
9. It looks good (though it was not a surprise for me, IdTech 3 (a.k.a. the Quake III engine) is quite powerful, despite its age; modifications (at a certain cost, which isn't an issue here (see p.1)) can obviously make it very capable).
10. The music is original and is of high quality (see p. 1). The main theme is composed by Hans Zimmer (see p. 1).
11. From the (mainly, cinematic deaths') animations, one can infer that they really put a lot of work (high quality motion capture n' all that $#it).
12. It's got the obligatory vehicle chase sequence.
13. Other people attempted to emulate the experience (e.g. Specs Ops: The Line and Max Payne 3's levels in the favelas).
14. It's popular (see p. 2).
15. It's overrated (see p. 2 and p. 14).
16. It's overpriced (see p.1 and p.2).
17. It's overpriced in 2021 (even during a sale).

A few positives I could say (far from enough for a recommendation at even a discounted price in 2021):
a) At least it doesn't have microtransactions (they weren't so ubiquitous in 2009; but there would be, if they were).
b) I had some fun with the coop."

3367,"After having completed 100% of this games achievements, I can confidently say that this is my favorite call of duty experience I have ever had. For $20, you get hours of a fun and immersive campaign, another couple hours of very difficult spec op missions and an infinite amount of multiplayer fun. Getting through the campaign and getting 69 stars was the perfect mix between easily achievable and dark souls difficulty. I had lots of fun playing this game and I think it is one of the best optimized call of duty's because the sniping and movement in this game feels incomparable to any other call of duty game. 10/10, I most certainly would advise to anyone who has played call of duty before or just wants a new first person shooter game to get this game."

3408,"Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, or MW2 if you prefer

A classic, one of the best COD ever released, sitting at the same table as B01, B02

A storyline reminding the good old war movies, and a soundtrack going with it, composed by Hans Zimmer, known for his work for a lot of famous movies such as Interstellar, Pearl Harbor, The Dark Knight Rises and many more 

The PC version is still looking good nowadays, and there's still people playing so you can join a quick TDM and enjoy the game. 

[What i dislike about the PC Version]

‚Ä¢ Activision still sells the game 20‚Ç¨ on Steam WITHOUT the DLCs
This is the same for BO2 which is still sold 60‚Ç¨ damnit, and MW3 which is sold 40‚Ç¨
I'm a little bit confused, so yeah, if you want the full game don't buy it on Steam

‚Ä¢ The multiplayer mode needs you to quit the game and launch another MW2 which is specificaly made to play online
I don't know if it's because the MP mode needs a specific launch for the ""Anti-Cheat"" system or if it's because of the maps and DLC which are installed in there or whatever, but it's kinda annoying cause you need to install two times the game and have to quit and restart MW2 everytime you want to play online when you're playing the story mode or special ops

Anyway, this is a really good game, there's even achievements if you want to add some challenges. 
You can play with your friends in private matches to do 1vs1 Sniper like on Xbox 360 back then.
I really loved the game and now that i have it on PC i can play it again but with another perspective"
3409,a nice game.

3459,"This game is a great throwback for anybody that's bored. The campaign is great and always keeps me hooked. It's fast paced and has a great story, great characters, and great AI. Multiplayer is also great. I can almost always find a match, and as always, it's unbalanced. But that's the charm! It really made me realize how different modern COD's are compared to this."
3460,"I bought the game for 5 dollars. And for 5 dollars, the campaign was very well worth it, a pretty fun arcadey experience with an interesting Action Movie like story.

I dare say that its worth it for even 10-15 dollars to this day. I also played a little bit of the multiplayer but unfortunately you either won't find players for most modes or might get put into hacked servers randomly. I was able to get some fair games in which was a super fun experience but It really is one of those multiplayers that you can see why it was so great back in the day, but can't properly experience anymore.

Even with all this, a fun experience!"
3461,this happened to my buddy eric
3462,"Woah, what an amazing game. Played for the first time in 2021, without having played MW1, wish I picked it up years ago."
3463,"This is much worse than CoD 4. Went from grounded, believable combat and engagements to whatever the hell this is. Captain Price is a super hero now, the entire US Army and special forces are under one dude, apparently. Russia can just invade the US with no naval support by flying 8 million planes across the ocean and nobody sees this I guess? I have a gun pointed at big terrorist #1 but my guy decides to mow down an airport for some reason? Oh god it's so stupid"
3464,if you are a carbon based life form you probably already own 2.4 copies of this game so i dont know why im even typing this

3467,Just really fun.
3468,pew pew pew pew
3469,"As far as I'm concerned, this is where Call of Duty peaked as a series. Infinity Ward took what worked in the original Modern Warfare and gave it a few touch-ups, granted some of them not as welcome as others (*cough* deathstreaks *cough*), but mostly stuck to the formula that was working.

Past aside, Modern Warfare 2 is still a worthwhile purchase even today, especially from a deal, if you are a fan of the Call of Duty gameplay loop. The singleplayer campaign and Spec Ops missions are good in their own right, and the multiplayer suite still has it's loyal playerbase. There are also mods available that add server browsers with their own dedicated playerbases."
3470,"This game.......
Heartbreak...Loss...Pain
This game is the most emotional game ever

3471,"Meh, campaign is way to short, I won't be purchasing future CoD games. When the Original CoD was first released the campaign was very difficult. The newer versions are like watching a movie, way to many cut scenes that you cannot skip, waste of my time."

The multiplayer is still relatively active, though it feels a bit too chaotic to be an enjoyable experience. Most fights boil down to who shoots first, and there's little time to think. It can still be a bit fun in small doses."

3523,Good game probably one of the best COD campaigns ever.
3524,"Don't buy this game if you plan on playing the campaign.

There's this bug on a level where you have to go to a submarine in order to advance. Level 12 Contingency to be exact. I was able to kill all of the russians no problem, but the game is bugged since price refuses to move past a certain point, rendering the level unbeatable since he has to be there to get to the submarine. 

I've tried pushing him, shooting him, throwing grenades at him, everything I could. But Price just won't budge.

It's a shame I can't refund this game, if I had known this before I bought it I would've saved my money. But up until that level the game was pretty fine. Too bad the devs won't fix this. But if anyone knows how to fix this I would love to hear it. 

Don't make the same mistake I did, just watch MW2 videos on youtube if you want to experience the full story. 

I can't comment on the multiplayer cause I've never played it (and don't plan to), but I wouldn't be surprised if every lobby was filled with hackers who could have your account VAC banned quicker than you can say Steam Support."

3542,This is a continuation of the original COD: MW. This has nostalgia written all over it. Fun Campaign and awesome Spec Ops missions. I really enjoyed this game when it first came out as I do today. Well worth the purchase.

3552,I've only played the campain and have done the missions. this is a fun game and a good first person shooter game that has a great story. by the time i started playing the multiplayer is unavalible so... i was never able to exspriance that most proplr had when they plaued this but other then that it is a fun game to just sitdown and play

3554,"[h1]Baby's First COD[/h1]
It's been 12 years since MW2... Oh boyy! Having played the demo of MW on PC to death way back, I had never actually gotten a chance to play through it's entire campaign through and through - until way later on! Thus MW2 had the distinction of being my first official COD game... and boy did it NUKE my whole world upside down! 

With the campaign following on from the end of MW, I was a little lost at the beginning but quickly caught on with the whole Makarov affair and him wanting to cause a third WW and yada yada. Classic Russia v USA stuff at this point but chyeah, who cares cuz the action set pieces and classic COD style gunplay hooked me in like no other shooter at the time. It was extremely fun to play and get past enemy set-piece after set-piece. Truly felt as if I lived in some sort of blockbuster movie! The adrenaline rush was nuts! Especially on that snow level - to this day it's gotta be one of the best missions in the franchise cuz wow! You got stealth, espionage, action, snowmobile getaway , ice climbing, working with Soap fuckin' MacTavish! BTW , who can forget how the title introduced us to the oh so iconic [i]Ghost[/i]! Just legendary stuff all around. 

Of course along with the stellar campaign , I had to dip into the multiplayer here - and just as modern day memes have recounted... the lobbies were just as.. uhm... interesting as ever. Nothing quite like getting ripped open a new ***hole by some guy from across the ocean who also wants to f*ck my mother - but yeah, one helluva time that was. I spent hours upon hours back on the 360 honing my skills in  the lobbies and whilst the servers are certainly no longer the same as they once were you can still catch some sick matches going on with IW4, and modded stuff if you just search a little on the web. 

I didn't mess around much with the Spec Ops mode in this title , so I don't have much to say on that end however it just goes to show how much content was available to the player at the time - unharmed by modern day lootbox and season pass tactics. This title will always hold a special place in my heart for being my gateway into the CODsphere and just FPS casual gaming in general - I truly appreciate it and definitely recommend you give it a try!"
3555,"ok game, too pricey"
3556,"REVIEW : COD : MODERN WARFARE 2 
ACHIEVEMENTS : 50 / 50 (100%)
SCORE :[spoiler]Of the times - 9/10 nowadays... - 8/10[/spoiler]

[b] The game that truly brought the spirit of many fans to the series, one of the golden age era  gems that still hold up to this day (in 2021). Despite the brand name it holds, it‚Äôs a relic of the times when they cared about their work.... to another whole level than what it is today. [/b]


**MULTIPLAYER IS ILL-ADVISED UNLESS YOU HAVE PEOPLE. I DIDN‚ÄôT**[spoiler]mhm‚Ä¶[/spoiler]
[b] ‚Ä¶ Why should I even get this? Is it even worth giving them more money?[/b]
[spoiler]I know, this is a COD game. But understand there is truly something good here in store when you buy this.[/spoiler] if you‚Äôre down for a good FPS, simple but a very fun and enjoyable experience. Sometimes mindless, tbh. 
But this is where the series was booming. Where the writing and intention was good, the multiplayer was ballistic. [b]It‚Äôs Something Memorable.[/b]

Now, let's get on with this shall we?

[b] GAMEPLAY LOOP [/b]

So, first your content. 
A 17 mission / 4 Act long campaign going over the events leading to all out WW3.
A Spec Ops mode, totalling in 23 varied and some challenging missions. (21 for solo)
^^ All can be done in co-op with one buddy :D

From that, the gameplay is very simple. You shoot guys / do objectives, Do a thing, run somewhere, kill more stuff maybe and mission is done. It all depends on what you‚Äôre thrown into but overall you‚Äôre a seriously skilled soldier with some insane aim and strength. 

[b] How does it feel on Veteran? <<Hardest difficulty>> [/b]

Really not that bad compared to others. Sometimes you have ‚Äòthe bullsh`t‚Äô that veteran does with its checkpoints and spawn traps sometimes. [u] Just be careful.[/u] You have to slow down your typical gameplay to pick off targets and have to be efficient at it sometimes. 
Single Player Missions to be wary of hard times ahead; 
Takedown 
Hornets Nest
Exodus 
Of Their Own Accord 
Contingency 
Loose Ends

Spec Ops Missions to be wary of REALLY hard times ahead.
Overwatch
Homeland Security
Snatch & Grab
Wardriving
Terminal
High Explosive [spoiler] spam the wall‚Ä¶ i‚Äôll never forget it.[/spoiler]


There is 45 total intel in the simple player that sadly doesn't further add depth to the game unlike others, no cheats, no lore nothing. Just another ‚Äúhey you got it‚Äù collectable of sorts.

[b] PERSONALITY OF THE WORLD [/b] 

At the time, this was an amazing feat in how detailed things were getting! The Budget for this game was enormous for one factor being - the engine used for making most if not all the assets of making the guns feel as tight and crisper than most models / animations being made today. How they‚Äôve made a timeless classic, almost to the alikes to VALVE standards in some regards to how they made their weapons and environments of engagement.

When it comes to the personality of your comrades in your single player campaign, it is what makes you be in the moment. They‚Äôre the reason you keep on fighting, being the voice of the player to keep going, to finalize / initiate the reason that is ordering you to do something. And they do this almost so naturally in a way where the player is always involved. But not totally being the savior of the world. You just do badass sh`t.

The soundtrack still holds a lot of pieces up, my favorite being the one in ‚ÄúThe Enemy of my Enemy. ‚Äù and making most of the moments feel right and hits the right notes for me personally. 

The story? Not going to bother. It‚Äôs either I give it all in or not. I‚Äôm choosing not to, I'm sorry. Understand it is amazing and if you decide to get this it is definitely worth your time. Plus this review is long enough as it is. 

Overall, a beautiful job on showing a real care on how things feel, look, etc. they do it all right here in my eyes for what is a call of duty game. 

[b] SYSTEMS CHECK [/b] 

This isn't hard to run at all. Maybe your graphics could blunt most of the enhanced visuals but overall it is a good looking game still with still up to date resolutions scaling, rebinding keys, and advanced options to tweak particular graphic options. Compared to older cod games, this is one of the better ones in that regard. Only in a lot of smoke did I really come across any huge lag spikes at any time or had a lot of explosions shortly together. 

Overall though it shouldn't be terribly hard to run by any means. But it can eat your graphics card if it wants too tbh. 

TIP - There are methods to increase your FOV in the game. Either from downloading CoD SCZ FOV changer (what i use) or something else. Maybe in the files directly even? Idk. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far;
[b]Thank you for reading my review, I hope this has helped you decide or have entertained you with your time reading this review.  [/b]

[spoiler] This is where it all started for me. I was in these lobbies back in the day long ago...
My first online game I‚Äôve officially played on the PS3. 2010. 
And I feel in love. Hours turned into days, 
Now I wasn't addicted, I just really enjoyed myself with it at the time. 
Until I joined a clan, I began to learn quickscoping. 
The drives to now 1 v 1 
The laughs i‚Äôve had, The friends i made outside of school,
Oh how I still remember the names even to this day...
And to go from a trash 9 year old kid who sucked, 
To a 20 year old, writing this review on something I deeply care about. 
And I wouldn't have probably met any of the people I would‚Äôve never met if it weren't for this game. That‚Äôs why it was hard for me to put it down fully. 
For that, you have my thanks. 
No matter what anyone thinks of what this is. 
I will keep this here in remembrance to everyone I've known in this game. 
As, it is something only my childhood holds dearly. One of the few that I deeply cherish. 
Only so few of you would understand.
Right?

I am right-dominant, but I trained myself to use the mouse with my left hand, so I could use keep my right hand on the numeric keyboard. It really improved my speed, but made a game like this tricky at first. I have been continually updating the controls on my keyboard and my game play has improved. I'm also enjoying the different cultures. It's incredible to move through a favela in Brazil, a place you would not want to travel to. Lastly, I liked that you have the option to skip levels with a certain type of violence. See you out there!"

This game is amazing for its time, in fact, COD MW2 has more player active than COD MW3.

I love the campaign of the game, its COD, what do you expect?

But seriously, other than the campaign, i also like The Spec Ops And Multiplayer

Multiplayer Team Deathmatch, kill them all, so satisfaying, kill everyone in an airplane

And Spec Ops, waves of stupid bots running to the wall (jk, haven't seen a bot run into the wall in spec ops)

3627,"This game right here is a big piece of my childhood and of many others too. Meanwhile a remastered version has been released, it will never compare to this game's crazy big multiplayer experience. Diving into a story full of action and excitement, MW2 would be the foundation of the franchise's more Hollywood-like action shooting. And a COD game back then wouldn't be complete without some infamous media attention. No russian.

If you want a piece of the good ol' COD then you should definitely try it just for the campaign alone! And if you're lucky maybe there'll be a multiplayer server half filled with people, too bad you wouldn't be able to experience the *toxic* chaoticness of the matches.

3629,Really good

Multiplayer is really fun if there arent any noobtubers or hackers. I haven't really had too many run ins with hackers so no need to worry about that. 
Campaign is great theres just one plot hole thats kinda annoying.
Spec ops is really fun as well."

3633,"It's a good game in my opinion and also very nostalgic for me because i used to play it a lot.

It has a good campaign, still has players playing it in multiplayer and is also cheap compared to other CoD games.

i suggest buying this game and rate it a 10/10."
3634,its fun
3635,gtame with fastswap intervention go brrrrr
3636,"The BEST call of duty hands down from the campaign to the multiplayer, to spec ops."
3637,"In my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198275281641/recommended/7940] Modern Warfare 1 [/url] review, I talked about how it does not have much value to revisit unless for nostalgia, mainly because of some issues with the level design resulting in a very chaotic experience. For Modern Warfare 2, I think aside from nostalgia, it is actually worth revisiting if you want, because its campaign is pretty solid.

The issue with Modern Warfare 1 campaign is there are too many enemies shooting at you in every direction and you have no idea what these shots come from. In this game, the dev cleaned up this mess by making levels more ‚Äúlinear‚Äù, figuratively speaking. Space feels relatively narrower as you have a general idea that enemies are in your front (unless of course, you rush too fast). Knowing the whereabouts helps you get the grid of situations and you can feel good for being a good shooter instead of being shot at. The first few levels at the beginning are more linear, especially the Brazil level, therefore I think they are more enjoyable than the last few levels which happen in more open space. 

Modern Warfare 2 has a typical blockbuster story. It is believable and good for what it is. I remember back then the infamous ‚ÄúNo Russian‚Äù level drew a lot of attention and later it became a norm for the franchise to put some controversial stuff in every title for the sake of marketing. I got no problem with that and you can even say it helps build the character of Makarov. But was it necessary? Probably not.

The cinematic narrative is also better. You got some good soundtrack, clean cinematic cut and stunning looking visual to build an intense war atmosphere, like a Michael Bay movie or something like that. And the graphics are fully upgraded from the previous gloomy visual. It is brighter and more colorful and generally good looking for that time. It still has some low polygon models and low-resolution textures, but I am willing to let it slide.

It is a little tiring and overwhelming to play the whole game, like pumping adrenaline into your vein all the time. It has a good variety of levels, but they are all fast-paced. Even the infiltration level where you think it is a change of pace soon becomes full-on gun blazing. Anyway, it just a 6 to 7 hours campaign. Since it is a good shooter and you have so many different guns to play with, I don‚Äôt think many people mind that."

3650,"The game is good, but if you want replay ability, you should prob go for either the Black Ops games for zombies, or the other Modern Warfare game imo. CoD4 MW/MWR contains cheats which allows you to play around with meme weapons more which I recommend over MW2. MW3 has from what I see, a larger sandbox, while MW2 is more untamed if you like that. Black Ops speaks for itself zombies and stuff. MW2 for its price is alright, but you could get the entire Nekopara bundle for better bang for your buck."

3659,"The best call of duty, totally worth the money for the nostalgia alone."
3660,"Installed this game just to speedrun the training. Amazing. 10/MW2
"
3661,üëç
3662,"it‚Äòs early 2021. MW2 is more than 11 years old at this point. Every CoD fan knows the singleplayer campaign by heart by know, its multiplayer basically died more than half a decade ago and there were 11 subsequent main CoD games released since MW2 hit the scene, not counting the remastered re-release of its very own singleplayer portion early last year.  So, what‚Äòs left to say about this fps dinosaur? 

Well, pretty much only that it is still the second-best CoD ever made and is still sucessfully defending this title a wooping 135 months after its initial release.

The game was divisive in 2009/2010 and rightfully so. It‚Äôs controversial singleplayer campaign dumped every last bit of pseudo-realism present in the series up to this point in favor of going completely michael bay plus a fair amount of scandalizing shock value (‚Äûno russian‚Äú), and the amazing multiplayer-standards set by it‚Äòs predecessor were hampered again through restrictive design choices like match-making rather than being refined and improved upon.

In retrospect however, the only thing that mw2 failed at was surpassing it‚Äòs own revolutionary predecessor. if it wasn‚Äôt for the flaws mentioned above, mw2 might have even managed to achieve this. despite being the starting point for the whole series to completely kick the bucket in terms of realism and plausibility, the singleplayer was and still is a breathtaking rollercoaster-ride and remains among the best campaigns in the whole franchise. and no matter how consolized, restrictive and stale its multiplayer felt at times, it is still one of the games with the longest total playtime in my steam-account (325 hours on the muliplayer, over 60 hours on the singleplayer), despite me basically NEVER EVER playing multiplayer games. If to this day the multiplayer portion of a game has that much playtime on the steam account of a guy who is purely singleplayer focused, that‚Äòs really saying a lot about that game‚Äòs excellence. Together with the first MW this is basically the pinnacle of the whole CoD franchise and the last title before the series started to stagnate and finally plunged into the deep black hole of mediocrity for almost half a decade, from that it managed to emerge only recently.

the probality that you never played this game is next to nil i guess, but let it be known to the very few people that might still be looking for a good starting point into one of gaming‚Äòs most notorious franchises: CoD will never ever be as good and relevant again as it was here. More than 11 years later, mw2 is still among my personal Top 20 games of all time, and it doesn‚Äôt look like it will leave there soon.

Be aware that if you are looking for the multiplayer experience, i‚Äòd strongly recommend you to look at the later entries in the series, because as mentioned above, the mw2 multiplayer has been dead for years. The singleplayer on the other hand is what i‚Äòd call a timeless classic of the fps genre, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if you play the remaster or the original version, as long as you play this awesome game at all.

3679,Classic.
3680,"Considering this game is from 2009, I thought there would be a fair amount of hackers on the multiplayer and that the experience would be abysmal. However, it was quite the opposite and was very pleasant to play. :steamthumbsup:

Also, unlike the most recently released CoD games, where I find myself bashing the mouse or controller against the floor (or myself :steamfacepalm:) and swearing at every Tom Dick and Harriett, I actually wanted to carry on playing.... and I shall! :steamhappy:

It's impressive how the lack of customisable content and stupidly ever-expanding cosmetic items, seen in recent games, actually makes the experience much more pleasant. Has to be one of my top three CoD games tbh. :steamthumbsup:"
3681,"just get it
"
3682,Best CoD Game in The MW Series
3683,Good game but 20$ is not fair price for 13 year old game
3684,Totally Epic!
3685,12 years later this game is still making me break things
3686,poob
3687,yes
3688,I have been called every slur known to man. I love this game.
3689,"I said ""no russian"" at my airport, I am now writing this in prison."
3690,its just so good
3691,"I can't even say anything badi Finished the game under 7 hours in one day. I also own the ps3 version and trust me after going back to this game i have realized how good this game still was. I only felt bad when i saw only veterans playing multiplayer which causes for new players to insta die. But if you have a friend owning the game spec ops missions are really fun. About the story mode if you are mentally okay please dont play hardened or veteran cause theese mods are very hard.
In general its very good"
3692,"Fun game, if you like first person shooters this is the game for you. If you also don't like the more future games then this game is also for you."
3693,big pp game
3694,"üëé I don't want to write a review for this game, but I do want to give this game a thumbs down to help the games ratings because I did not enjoy my experience with it üëé

Dang, this game is definitely not as great as I remember.

The production value in this game is fantastic however. Still wonderful animations, great sound design, pretty neat guns, etc.

But good lord this game was just... *sigh * annoying to play. When getting shot at your view shoots all over the place making it very hard to 1.) discern where you're being attacked from (especially since the enemy marker is the same color as the strawberry jam that gets painted all over your screen???) | 2.) Reactively fire upon the enemies shooting you.
Those two elements alone honestly ruin a lot of the experience to the point i'd never play this game on anything higher than regular. There's so many times where the game feels like an absolute confused mess of unearned deaths and bewilderment because of the players inability to properly access where enemy targets are. Especially because of how easily enemies blend into the set-dressing of the levels.

I didn't realize how remarkably short and quick every level was until I replayed this. It almost feels like a quick cough and a blink and boom, the level is over. It gave me essentially no time to get invested in the struggle, setting, or story of any character. Especially them having you jumping from character to character to character all the time.

And the spec ops levels feel less like fun and more like an exercise in frustration tolerance. The game just asks you to play in the most boring way possible to win. And enemies can very easily take you out. It's so boring and annoying. I remember this one time I was like, just very much so having fun, tactically snooping around the favelas carefully hunting down enemy targets. Only for these stupid, cheap dog missles to essentially bite you and instakill you because the quick time event is so goddamn short and precise.

Playing the game off the back of call of duty 2 is such a shock. I was expecting this to be the real stuff, that really good stuff I remembered. But it turns out that cod2 was an absolute gas and this game was just a frustrating use of my time. There's so many times where I was getting into it only to get taken out of it. Times I tried to have fun, the game said ""No. THIS is how you have to play"" making various strategies not viable. It was really annoying and upsetting. It was also really upsetting to see how poor the level design is. Like graphically they're beautiful, but to play on a lot of them I found to be really aggravating and annoying. So many options and ways the enemy can always get the drop on you and just immediately down you because you weren't looking their way for a few seconds.

Iunno, for me at least this game was just a disappointment. Child me loved this game, but adult me really doesn't. And I don't see myself playing this for another decade for whenever I want to revisit it just because."
3695,nostalgia in 15 GB or less
3696,"Very good and classic game is very fun and dope
"
3697,"Meh. Something to pass the time during covid if you like shooters / fps games. I can't say it was anything super special in terms of the single player campaign which is all I am interested in ever. I don't really enjoy multiplayer. If you get it cheap enough then go for it. Just don't expect much in the way of ethics or morality ie you get to go killing things and people in the favelas, that's so bleeding hart. Oorah and all that, eh wot?"
3698,DA BEST
3699,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is action-egoshooter in which you as different american soldiers have to complete various  missions. I think MW2 is a bit better than MW1, but if you first play MW1 and then number 2 the allusions make it even more fun. I love MW2 because of the brilliant story and the nice atmosphere in  ever mission. I love some levels, mostly the creeping missions through bushes, mountains or fields. But all in all, every mission is a masterpiece. I recommend you to play first MW1 and then MW2.Have fun

9/10"
3700,"awesome graphics, just everything.. does seem like their could be a few more levels but cant make endless levels.."
3701,nice story line.lots of action and great objectives. playing this game agian.
3702,"It's modern warfare 2, what else is there to talk about"
3703,"I know it says that I have 36 hours on this game, but I have put a great chunk of my life into COD through PS3, PS4, XboX 360 and my old computer which had a CD entrance. In total, I probably have around 500 hours on MW2 and I can easily tell you it is the best game ever made. The graphics are great, the storyline is amazing, the gunplay is pretty good and even after the insane amount of time that passed since its release, the multiplayer is still full. Most new people into COD haven't played some of the classics, the best, like BO1 or MW2 which is annoying considering they pass their whole day on warzone. Everyone should play this game once and at least complete its campaign."
3704,20$ not worth better pirate it
3705,Great game one of the best COD campaign
3706,its gud if ya play spec ops with a buddy
3707,fucking amazing

3709,Played this back on the xbox 360 and this game was my life i 10/10 recommend this game. This game was my childhood :)
3710, VERY GOOD GAME
3711,"It was a really long time since I played it but the game is pretty old as well. 

Pros:
- the game has really innovative mechanics for it's time with heartbeat sensors, thermal optics, semtex grenades and a lot more
- staggering amount of game modes people could really enjoy
- huge amount of maps, mostly well balanced and designed
- campaign has a lot of emotional and surprising plot twists, mechanics and locations
- coop missions are really well made and make you think, they are hard on veteran difficulty, I did 68/69 stars 

Cons:
- as I said I did 68/69 stars, never finished because my progress disapeared -.-
- at the time I played, the cheaters where everywhere to a point that developers didn't know what to do with it, so they banned random accounts and a lot of innocent players got perma banned
- game never had any good community, most people where just shouting through voice comms at each other claiming you are cheating
- there are maps you need to pay money to get, and you only get 5 maps per package (quite expensive at that)
- most people got their unlocks via cheat engines and had maxed prestige, no one cared
- the FFA mode got disabled because people abused it to get nukes with flare spawn
- some weapons are plain useless compared to others, akimbo glocks and shotguns being op on deatchmatch modes, you don't really need to aim

Overall the game is not bad, it really has been polished quite nicely, but devs kinda destroyed it with the random bans which didn't really resolve the excessive cheating problem
This is a reason I can't give this game a positive review, even if I had fun while I played"

3759,Most nostalgia I felt In a long time
3760,"The story of Modern Warfare 2 picks up straight from where Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare left off. 
The campaign is chock-full of intense action and dramatic moments, and though it is more muddled than its predecessor, it's still an absolute blast. The new Special Ops mode allows you to experience some campaign-inspired thrills with a friend and it's an engaging challenge to coordinate your manoeuvres and tackle the varied objectives. Last but not least, the competitive multiplayer that took the online shooter community by storm two years ago is back and better than ever. Though the addictive action remains the same at its core, there are a host of new elements that make it more accessible, more strategic, and more rewarding. This all adds up to a thoroughly excellent package that is sure to thrill shooter fans and deprive them of sleep for months to come. 
An impressive amount were available with the games release but as per usual, more are available if you're willing to cough up extra cash for a couple of extra downloadable content packs that contains a few extra online maps as well."
3761,Old but still good.
3762,Probably the best COD ever made.
3763,Call of Duty but it makes you emotionally attached to each character.
3764,godly
3765,"I remember this game in the PS3, it still looks the same. MW2 real did run 30 FPS both in PS3 and PC lmao"

3775,This is a very good game. I will also recomend other players to play this game.
3776,"Modern Warfare 2, in my opinion, one of the best CoD made ever. This game got remastered and it deserved. Take a look on this:

Graphics - 9/10
Story - 10/10
Game's length - 10/10
Gameplay - 10/10
Variety of weapons - 8/10
General world design - 10/10
Fun factor - 9/10 (buy online is dead because cheaters)

How many times i have finished it - 5++

Is worth it to buy the game? For sure!"

3781,Pure Classic! <3
3782,Just got called the n-word fourteen different time 10/10 would play again
3783,"kekw
"
3784,"Definitely a classic story game with one of the best co-op challenges (getting all 69 spec ops starts). The multiplayer is somewhat fun but infuriating at times as noob tubes exist (MW3 being the better option for multiplayer). Lastly, what is with the price gouging of old Call of Duty games? Activision."
3785,alright
3786,yes
3787,"For me is this game one of best cod games.

+ Story
+ Maps
+ gameplay
+  Achievements are not hard and not so easy+
+ Multiplayer is still good with many players"
3788,call of duty modern warfare 2 is amazing spec ops mode of mod 2 is the best mode ever being able to play with another person and just being able to do missions together is what makes this one stand out theirs survival and zombies in the other call of duty games but this one is so much better when it comes to things like spec ops and multiplayer.
3789,poggers
3790,it was my childhood and the most fun cod i ever played... sadly its destroyed by mod Lobbys and hackers. There is also no VAC Anti cheat anymore so ppl can just hack how they want... you dont even need the steam version you can literally play multiplayer with a cracked version and hack online... wish they would make a multiplayer remaster instead of cold war garbage
3791,"its fun to rage and break stuff when i die

3804,"One of my personal favorite cod games in the Modern Warfare series, price should be lower though tbh."
3805,My favorite part about this game is that there are kids who went into the army thinking this is what it was gunna be like.

3819,epic game
3820,I dislike that I have to leave a text review.
3821,There is a cool mission where you go undercover as a bad guy and help him do stuff early in the game. Id recommend that mission to anyone looking for a good time and some innocent fun. If you don't like gun violence its a good mission to play.

3830,"Pros:
Nostalgia.
The Amazing Multiplayer
The Fucking GREAT Campaign.

Cons:
Hacked Lobbys.
Hackers In General (but you can find them everywhere)

The Only Thing That Draws You To This Version is the Multiplayer, Just Get The Remaster or a Newer COD /Shooter Game."
3831,"Overpriced game DLC, blatant wall and aim hacking is common and you can't play anything besides TDM and sometimes dom. Go play on IW4X instead (you can get the game and DLC for free this way + dedicated servers).

Edit: Steam is censoring I W 4 X"
3832,"Yes.
"
3833,"Honestly, I don't play the steam version of MW2 that much, I just use there files for IW4x so I can trickshot and shizz with friends. Great game ngl, still play on my PS3 system with cheats enabled trickshotting bots in private match."
3834,"holy shit they predicted january 6th, 2021 lmao"

3839,"Single Player Campaign of MW2 is great and short. If you're not experienced you'll finish it in 6-7 hours. 
Multiplayer is well developed and doesn't need any description due to the success it had. Weapons and maps were improved from its predecessors, CoD4 (not considering WaW ofc).
As I played tons of CoD4 Promod back in the day I'd say that there's no point on buying this game anymore. There is AlterIWNet for free. Also, the decision of not making dedicated servers available damaged the PC community and slowly started to kill the great eSport scene that was growing in CoD4 with XFire and all that.
In this game all those 360 no scope bullshit started to spread so I don't have the best feeling about this game.
It is technically brilliant and already a classic."
3840,e
3841,dogs
3842,"INSEDIBULL! i purposly spelt that wrong... THE MULTIPLAYER IS FULL OF COMPETITIVE PEOPLE THE CAMPAIGN IS OK!
"
3843,"p
tgggggggggggggggggggggggggg"
3844,Keeps my adrenaline pumped. More weapons compared to COD4. Also accompanied with varied weapon sights.
3845,"Evidently, Ghost and Roach did not heed Price's advice about not trusting General Shepherd. F."
3846,"Hackers, fake playercounts, only tdm and domination, archaic peer to peer. Better left in the past, but a true wonder of the world in its prime. Sadly MW3 is more enjoyable today than MW2 on PC due to a server admin tool ""MW3sa"" allowing you to block IPs of hackers from joining a game where you're host."
3847,its amazing download it now!!
3848,"loved the action of individual missions., No online for me, thanks!"
3849,good
3850,BRILLIANCE
3851,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 a FPS game, which is the 6th COD in the series and it continues COD:MW stories, after 5 years.

Visuals and sound / music is better than ever. Really tops the first MW's in these parts. Soundtrack is really fit for the gameplay and it's remarkable. Visuals in general indeed better, however there are some skybox and few elements, which is low resulotion, but in general it's really good looking, even 11 years after it's release.

Gameplay is didn't changed much, except you can't look out from covers, but attachments are easier to use them imo. It's pretty much the same, however the AI feels all right, and actually the Veteran difficulty is not as cancer here, not as bad then it was in COD4. I will add the story here, which feels bit silly here or there, but it's actually fun and exciting. Multiplayer is something which I shouldn't talk, because it's legendary. Either you play with Spec Ops or MP, it works really good still, nowadays, however I suggest you to try out fan made launchers for a better experience.

I really can't talk to much about this game, but in my opinion, this is the best MW games from the original 3 games. I really enjoyed it for the first time, it was challanging on higher difficulty, it wasn't boring either. Multiplayer is also damn fun! For 20‚Ç¨, I even consider to buy the game for that, if it would be still a supported game by Infinity Ward. I definetly can recommend it to try out."

3858,very cool karlson better smash wishlist now gfamers
3859,Probably my favorite of the original trilogy. I only bought them for the campaigns which are fun to run through back to back to back. very much recommend
3860,"Great gameplay, fluid dynamics, well-produced cut scenes. Still looks fantastic. Interesting storylines with some surprising twists and turns. Well worth the money."
3861,pew pew

AND

it's op lol"
3870,Go play it
3871,Classic. i can't say much else
3872,"Great game always has been. I consider it the best one of the first 3 MW. 
it really needs Xbox 360 controller support!! But you can program your own. 
So heads up. Peace an chicken grease. Boo-ya."
3873,I like this game because it follows the rest of the world.
3874,"I LOVE THE GAME IF U DIDNT PLAYET YET PLS DO IT NOW 
"
3875,A classic.
3876,"If you enjoy just playing the Singleplayer campaign then you can have a fun experience...
But with the recent development there has been nothing but cheaters every game in multiplayer sniping you through every wall and crevice upon spawning, this is not the MW2 multiplayer you would want to remember and it's a shame that cheaters has ruined such a gem from the past.
RIP MW2 Multiplayer."
3877,"much nice, a lot of tubers"
3878,the story keeps me coming back
3879,da shiz nit
3880,"it is fucking impossible to pass even ONE mission with hardened difficulty within 2 hours, fuck you"
3881,very epic game
3882,"GOOD
"
3883,"the best COD game.HANDS DOWN
"
3884,"Game is great, but I am still banned cus some guy had a modded lobby that got mixed in with the steam VAC servers. This was back in 2013.

10/10 would play again"
3885,Classic game. Story is like being on crack 24/7 but fun and epic nonetheless with fantastic soundtrack. Multiplayer is one of the best and iconic in the whole franchise but sadly now plagued by hackers
3886,It has senarioes that I play more than the game.
3887,"i have always and will probably forever say that the only good call of duty games are WAW, MW1 + MW2, BO1 + BO2. The multiplayer in this game is the ultimate clusterfuck but in a good way, its completely broken and there are killstreaks happening every second but its still amazing fun. The campaign kicks so much ass and is just rly good as well and i think im the only person alive who likes spec ops more than zombies.
Overall: 8/10 would recommend"
3888,"good. thats one less loose end.
*proceeds to be a snake and shoot ghost and roach*

*then proceeds to get a knife thrown at his head*"
3889,"Still very fun. I now know all the COD memes.
"
3890,its been my favorite cod since i was little
3891,VERY GOOD YES
3892,"IW4x has a free version, unless you want the campaign don't buy it.

Campaign is good tho."
3893,good gamw
3894,fuck yeah play this game\
3895,game froze on old computer i have like 4 hours max
3896,"A classic game. Resolution can be a trouble to change, but great game. Still brings tears to my eyes near the end of the campaign. 11 years old and going strong."
3897,i like the cod games there always fun to play
3898,just play iw4x if you want to do multiplayer. campaign and spec ops are cool though
3899,A sequel to the first modern warfare with equally amazing gameplay
3900,It's so awesome!!
3901,"Amazing masterpiece by Infinity Ward, Great campaign, great multiplayer, amazing and addictive spec-ops. The best FPS Game of 2009 change my mind."
3902,"Modern days, modern solutions"
3903,english
3904, i love this game
3905,Yes.
3906,ok
3907,ieeets good
3908,very fun low priced game probably the best COD
3909,One of the best if not the best COD game
3910,"Stellar story, Spiecal ops is alright. Defenatly worth playing on story alone"
3911,"Warning: This is a 2020 review of an FPS made in 2009.

For single player play in 2020, there are many better choices than this game.  The single player campaign is short.  The graphics are passable, though only barely so.  I would not recommend this game because I thought the military game play was [i]much[/i] worse than games like Sniper Elite 4, The Division 2, or MGSV:TPP.  The weapons are boring with no choices.  It practically feels like a rails shooter.

Accusations of ""you just played an arcade game and complained it wasn't a sim game"" may be valid.

I did not try multiplayer.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's mostly dead."
3912,good
3913,its still lit af
3914,"Back in the day, this was the first Call of Duty game I played on Xbox 360. I loved it then and I still love it now, even if the multiplayer is no longer the main draw for this game."
3915,"""Remember, no Russian."""
3916,Great game
3917,"I had a blast with my mates on multiplayer! It was good, cheers."
3918,It's modern warfare... but 2
3919,itzgud
3920,"Best call of duty part ever! Even in 2020 it brings pleasure while u r playing it! 100% must have if u like shooting games! üíñüíñüíñ

Pros:
‚ûï great story line
‚ûï cool characters which make u feel their thoughts and emotions
‚ûï impressive cutscenes (unlike cod bo3 the train goes boom lol)
‚ûï this game ain't feel like fool shooting range 
‚ûï THE BEST COOP EVER FEELING. SPEC OPS ARE AMAZING (MUST BE PLAYED WITH A FRIEND ON VETERAN DIFFICULTY). IT'S LIKE A REAL WAR MISSIONS. AMAZING üíñüíñüíñ
‚ûï still alive multiplayer

 Cons:
‚ûñ NO cons"
3921,l
3922,Fantastic action
3923,games fun really fun LIKE REALLY FUNNNN
3924,haha gun go pew
3925,"This is an o.g games that i played when i was 6 years old in 2015 and its fun and probly for my opinion they couldve made graphic's better 
"
3926,Good.
3927,"MW2 Singleplayer & Spec Ops:

The most iconic singleplayer in COD history, no matter what your reasons are for buying this game (nostalgia or picking up for the first time) you will LOVE the single player on this game. The character development is perfect, despite the campaign being approx 8 hours long. I still found myself getting attached to the characters in this game. Absolute perfection.

The spec ops is great too, a great change from zombies and a really fun  and challenging experience.


MW2 Multiplayer:

Probably the most fun on multiplayer I have had on any call of duty game, the nostalgia this brings me from being 10 years old again coming home from school to turn on the xbox and play mw2.

Believe it or not it's still very possible to find games now, despite my VAC ban on  this from 6 years ago for accidentally joining a modded lobby, my bad.

I would really recommend this game, but the people going to buy this game are more than likely doing it out of nostalgia purposes like I did, if you're looking at picking this up for the first time; I am sure you'll love it!"
3928,The very best CoD has to offer.

3933,best game ever 10/10 recommend
3934,"Overall, a great game. The campaign is great, adding new aspects from MW 1, and creating new ways of gaming. Although the multiplayer aren't plentiful as it once was, it's a moderate number for an 11 year old game. Bummer there is still toobers and tryhard ninja snipers."

3951,"remember, no russian"
3952,fun
3953,Classic
3954,"This easily has one of the most solid campaigns I've ever played up there with Titanfall 2 and Half Life. The narrative follows Roach but as you'll soon realize it follows other people too! Like Alexei the CIA agent in No Russian and sparks WWIII and becomes a scapegoat, because he was ordered to do so. Ramirez is for special ops, Captain Mactavish. You really get a feel for why WWIII was started to promote patriotism in a commercialized way that was spun by propoganda. The question that really sticks with mew is if the villain had succeeded would the world become a better place, if so would the end justify his means of doing so? Love him or hate him he feels a lot like the Comedian from Watchmen but if he was Ozymandius instead. the Multiplayer is great! Playing this game feels as good as it did back in the day when it had first come out is what I hear. I have no nostalgia towards this game being completely new to it but it surprised me with a lot of the themes in the campaign. And I feel it allowed me to find out just how bad the  tension during the cold war was or could turn out to be with the bombing of the ""Whine House"" to the assault on ""Burger Town"" the massive emp that causes airplanes and helicopters to fly out of the sky. This is no ordinary game it plays to it's strengths and it does so greatly, so if you think you even subtly want this game and have the money I must recommend that you play the campaign through at-least once in your life."

3956,Best game i ever played
3957,Surely one of the best CoD
3958,"Got this game in the summer of 2019. These older cod games are fun but the servers are buggy and there aren't many players left. If you were to buy an old cod to mod or mess around on with friends I would recommend either World at War or Black Ops 1 because they have zombies. Overall this game is super fun and if you are here because you want to relive the multiplayer experience from when you used to play it, go for it. But I can't reccomend it to younger people because the only reason to play at all is for the multiplayer. If you want to play it's great campaign, I reccomend the remasterd edition. So overall there are better old cods to mess around on but if you specifically want to play this one, have fun."
3959,Enjoyed Mission haven't tried Multiplayer yet.
3960,best cod
3961,Pretty fun not as good of a storyline as the first game
3962,why did i pay $20 for this in 2020?

3964,cool
3965,"It all went downhill from here on forward for this franchise. This is the last COD game that looks intriguing and I bought. I like it, it had some really well made single player and the multiplayer was really fun too."
3966,"We've come a long way boys
we've grown up and yet our hearts remain the same.

3970,i dont like the favela on veteran
3971,A pretty solid storyline
3972,Very Great Game.
3973,"I do not know where to even begin. Within just 10 hours of gameplay, this game delivers possibly one of the best characters, story, and especially soundtrack of all time. The story is head to to toe just brilliant where you switch perspectives and get a chance to play in different type of environments and settings. This helps make the combat never dull. I have played the whole soundtrack over and over again at least a 100 times. This game easily enters into my top 5 list, and it is a must play."
3974,"its a good game but when it turned to a blackscreen and the credits started going 
my mouth was wide open

if it werent a five hour singleplayer campaign then it would honestly be a 10/10

but overall its a 9.7/10"

3979,"2nd best COD campaign, only better was the original MW."
3980,what else is there to say about this game 10/10
3981,Would fail university and never gain the skills needed to cope in life again. 11/10

4039,If you're A gamer 1 game you need to get is this game mw2
4040,i finish it DO GOOD!!!
4041,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the last game of the CoD franchise where I personally enjoyed all of its core parts: Campaign, extra Singleplayer content and Multiplayer. The graphics look pretty decent even today and the gameplay experience is very solid and enjoyable.

The Campaign was very well done and well paced, definitely a step up from the previous games (CoD 4 and World at War). The Multiplayer was built upon the core of CoD 4 and added a lot of features and longevity to the progression system. It is still fun to play and holds up rather well, capturing the good bits of both older and newer FPS styles.

As far as standard First Person Shooters go, CoD: MW2 has been one of the best out there for a long time. Even if you've missed it back when it was current, it is still worth playing and a lot of people still prefer this version of CoD over many other ones that came after it.

Definitely a thumbs up!"
4042,Overrated
4043,"This is amazingly fun, the game runs pretty smooth, and its overall a great game. There's 1 thing that's bothering me tho,

The spawn points, i have spawned right infront of the whole team once, or somebody just spawns right behind me after I walk 2 feet. Or i spawned behind people and got easy kills on them, with is not to fair for a TDM mulitplayer game. Other than that its fun and a amazing game!"

4050,"Absolutely one of the best multiplayer games of all time. MW2's multiplayer is the perfect representation of what call of duty used to be. Fast paced gameplay with tons of class customization that allows you to good with virtually whatever you wanna run (but you probably wanna be using the UMP). Perfect mix of absolute bull shit and potential to outplay your opponents. Plenty of amazing and memorable maps and killstreaks, and who can forget about the legendary shit talking that is mandatory with MW2"
4051,best game 10/10 :csgoct:
4052,"literally wiped all my spec op data
"
4053,"I want to like this game, The set pieces, the action, its a modern warfare game after all and what you would expect from the franchise. (story mode)

I got this game when it was new and stopped playing it because something drove me away. All these years later i thought that i would install it again and get my moneys worth. However i am once again having difficulty playing this game... why?

The Damage hit mechanic... The blood covered screen... The disorientation by design...

ITS INFURIATING!!! 

When ever you get hit by a bullet in this game the screen gets covered in Strawberry jam, you are blinded by blur mechanics and your control over the character is disrupted. No doubt as an attempt to make you feel disorientated in combat and a feeble mechanic at trying to create a sense of immersion. Except that it has the very opposite effect, I have to wait 5 to 6 seconds for this ridiculous and interfering mechanic to fade away before i can get back into the action only to then be hit again by another bullet (because why wouldn't i) and once again the game is blocked off and hidden from me. Even the sound effects fade out. The sum result is me waiting essentially in time out more than actually enjoying the game. Because i can't see or do much else.

Putting all of this aside, it is essentially an extremely irksome and obnoxious mechanic which just annoys the living FK out of you. 

People actually sat around a table during the design phase of this game, come up with this idea, agreed upon it, gave it the green light, implemented it into the game and then tested it for themselves thinking that it was GOOD, then went gold with the game for global sale.

--

In a nut shell, i cant finish this game because my eyes are bloodshot with rage and i'm tired... hungry and tired.

Bad Design."

4075,"You know a game is good when it's over and you're sad it's over. 6 hours of pure epic gameplay. Modern Warfare 2 has a really exciting campaign that CoD will probably never be able to replicate.

First of all, the game is actually in color. Why these ""serious"" triple A games de-saturate the color in their games is beyond me, but MW2 doesn't. The enemy's pop out and locations you are in are nicely colored. I'm glad MW2 dared to use brighter colors, it makes the game look better.

But who cares about colors????? Fuck that, all the matters is if the game is fun. Graphics and Palette mean nothing compared to Gameplay.. The campaign is fun from start to finish. The enemy's are fun to eliminate while still being challenging enough to risk failure if you're not smart. The few stealth missions make you feel like a badass, the NPC's in your regiment are PERFECT, the guns are fun to use. I really like this game.

Give it a play, it's worth the $20.

P.S. I hear that the multiplayer sucks. I'm speaking strictly about the campaign.  :)"
4076,"Only buy this is you plan on replaying the campaign and spec ops. If you only care about the campaign, just get the remastered version. 

If you want to play multiplayer, just download IW4X. You can get the game for free there."

4128,"One of the best in the CoD series, great storyline."
4129,"As one of the most critically acclaimed shooters of all time, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a prime example of a tough act to follow. Yet, amidst a raging storm of anticipation and expectation, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has done it. The new campaign is chock-full of intense action and dramatic moments, and though it is more muddled than its predecessor (in more ways than one), it's still an absolute blast. The new Special Ops mode allows you to experience some campaign-inspired thrills with a friend and it's an engaging challenge to coordinate your maneuvers and tackle the varied objectives. Last but not least, the competitive multiplayer that took the online shooter community by storm two years ago is back. Though the addictive action remains the same at its core, there are a host of new elements that make matches more accessible, more strategic, and more rewarding. Unfortunately, these improvements are marred by limited online flexibility that may leave the PC shooter community out in the cold."

4134,"Reviewing games I played a long time ago:

I... I'll be honest, I don't even remember how I got this here in Steam since I was never really a fan of the Call of Duty franchise. Still, I remember playing it pirated at the time and although it was ok as a Michael Bay-ish blockbuster experience, it was clearly inferior to it's predecessor. But overall these kind of american military masturbatoric experiences are not really my kind of game."
4135,"CoD MW2 is a classic- However, DO NOT BUY IF YOU RUN WIN10, it is not starting properly anymore (Noember 2020). If you are ready for some cfg modding, you may have luck, but it is not always the case. So basically, Steam is now selling a product with huge compatibility issues."
4136,"Nice game, there aren't as much hackers I would expect and if there are they don't do much damage, they only have made the game fun so far."
4137,"During this time of Covid-19 Stay at home and play MW2 you cant go wrong, Plenty of action. If it gets to easy. increase the difficulty level. One thing I really like is that  the many if not all battles geographicaly and historically correct,"
4138,nice!
4139,A classic.
4140,"It is AWESOME, the campaign is great and i'm sure the multiplayer will be amazing.

Great for an old game!"

"
4155,"Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them. I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this.

CAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):

The campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3

SPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):

The Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.

MULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):

The Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this.


Conclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision.

Things to be aware of -

There is no direct controller support for this game.

If you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there.

MW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you.

This game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.

At the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.

If you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.

4199,"This game is the best game in the modern warfare series. I think the reason for playing this game is the story, I highly recommend it."
4200,I just found  the game interesting and addictive
4201,I personally would Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 3 above this game but I still think that the it had a decent campaign and also introduced spec ops. This game gets a 7/10.
4202,Best Of COD series ! Old but Gold .
4203,"you see for its time it was a good game and it still is the story telling is awesome and even the characters we would meet for the first time like Simon Riley (Ghost) or Gary Sanderson (Roach)... Even if it is the first time you form a sort of attachment to those 2. (for me it was especially towards Ghost because of his cool look) Their Death scene was really sad not gonna lie but the worst thing of all is that this game is short... BUT that is no problem!

Overall awesome game i would recommend to buy it in the 2009 or Remastered mode (even if they are about to release a sort of Rework of it. just to get the Nostalgia for the old ones! and a cool experience for the younger ones!)"
4204,"best game ever
"
4205,"This is by far the best Call of Duty Campaign hands down. If you haven't played it then you really haven't played a Call of Duty campaign before. Spec Ops is still fun and amazing to play with friends today. I highly recommend this game if you have never played it, or if you just haven't played in a while."

4263,GOOD NICE
4264,When this game released i've had times where i spent 40h/week playing. Afterwards MW3 came around and i started fooling around there. But it didn't have the feeling that MW2 gave me. I can safely say none of the COD games that came after MW2 have been better.
4265,Im so LOVE it Hyungsss

4267,"Love it! So nostalgic, still one of the best COD games!"

4274,"Best FPS game, period."
4275,I remember back on the Xbox360 everyday i would come home from school having so much excitement to play this game. Playing it now brings back a lot of amazing memories. It has an amazing story line with amazing characters that all Modern Warfare games depend on. I recommend playing this game for nostalgia. But if you have never played this game i recommend it for everyone that loves first person shooter games but also likes good story lines with important characters.
4276,i need a refund i thought this was the remastard game but bought it and found out it wasn't when i played it i'd be happy with a refund
4277,awesome
4278,Great combat and action but it is letdown by the lack of controller support. These games are just more comfortable to play with a controller than a keyboard and mouse.

4302,Best shooter ever. Even better with friends on co-op. I simply cannot explain how good this is.
4303,I like this game so much coz itz one of my fav genre in a videogame. There's nothing i dislike about this game as it is perfect 10/10. I will definitely recommend this game to any FPS lovers out there.

It does have it's problems, but they are overshadowed by the awesome gameplay. Buy it simply for the story or for the memories. If you have never played this before, then buy it now. This game is a gem and should be played by all gamers so that they can see what a good game is. What a game can deliver. truly, an adventure worth going through."
4312,Classic MW2. This is what started it all for me.
4313,good game
4314,"Welcome to the game that's responsible for 99.99% of the VAC bans on Steam

Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is a thematic and immersive masterpiece. Journey through an incredible story of twists, turns and betrayal............ It's been meme'd pretty hard but you all know you were on the ground sobbing when you know who did the you know what to the other you know who(s) back in 2009.

Campaign 
- Starts were COD4 finished
- play as multiple soldiers and special operators 
- visit cool atmospheric places like Iraq, an icy mountain base in Kazakhstan, a Moscow airport, favellas in Brazil, the Russian Steppe, A Russian prison fortress, an arctic oil rig, and so much more
- Contains the most controversial mission in a video game (the iconic 'No Russian')
- RAMIREZ DEFEND BURGER TOWN!!!!!!

Special Ops (Fun single player or co-op challenges you can do)
- Ties in with campaign missions and in universe lore 
- Thematic and immersive 
- The campaign isn't co-op but these get the feel just right
- Unlock stars for completing on higher difficulty, thus unlocking for Spec ops missions

Multiplayer
- People are still playing in 2020
- I'm not sure but I think steam no longer gives out VAC bans to everyone that just comes across a modded lobby 
- Some modes are empty but the main popular ones like team death match, search and destroy, free for all and domination are typically full.
- Create a class, level up and get PRESTIGE 

Overall this is an incredible game.... But you probably already know that. Odds are you were playing this back in the old Xbox 360 days and are looking at it for nostalgia. Times are tough right now with Covid and honestly there's worse ways to spend your money. So go, take that trip down memory lane, I won't judge you.

4331,"Easily one of the most popular games not just in the Call of Duty franchise but of all first person shooters. Even though if you compare it to a modern graphically stunning game such as the new Modern Warfare it still doesn't make you look down at them. The story was compelling and just as enticing as the first (COD 4).

While the Campaign is unforgettable the multiplayer is one of the most fun as well, newer multiplayers in games get more and more needlessly complex but MW2 has maintained an enjoyable simplicity since it was launched and even today offers fun matches that you can play for hours, trying to get a tactical nuke."

Umps, G18s, Barretts, Interventions, knifing, explosives, heart beats, not to mention killstreak exploits, I mean everyone can have an advantage in this game and in a lot of ways.

But yeah, even if you stay super straight in your game-play style, your team makes or breaks it--which if you are playing with the right people makes game play a treat. The maps are the best in the series IMO, the combinations of classes keep it varied depending on your objective, and... yeah. Best game in the series."

I have only really played Call of Duty for the zombie survival, so I haven‚Äôt played many of the other games like Modern Warfare and the classic Call of Duties. I decided with my time off, due to COVID and having to self-isolate, that I would play through the Call of Duties I have never touched. This is my fourth game so far. MW2 and its campaign are very engaging, great acting, thrilling action and many more things you would expect from a blockbuster action film. I definitely recommend the campaign for anyone wanting to burn 5-6 hours and have fun while doing so. I enjoyed it that much that I immediately purchased MW3 to play its campaign (just started today). Pick this up on sale though. As good as the campaign is, it is not worth the retail price. Plus, the game is 11 years old! Should be ¬£10 at the most."

Not much else to say about it, it was great. It along with MW3 and Battlefield 4 will forever live on in my memory as the golden age of FPS games. 9/10"

4426,this game is a trap. after beating it on veteran i can definitely say that this game is absolute garbage and deserves to rot in hell.
4427,"(500+ hours in PC multiplayer, 5000+ on console)
Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
Trying to forget you is just a waste of time
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
All day long, wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up the smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
Now that I put it all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart
Nothing left for me, ain't there nothing left for me
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, listen, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

4454,"Definitely still alive and thriving during the day, however throughout the night this game is a ghosttown. if you're still into the same old MW2 style of gameplay, ""snipers, noob tubers, campers, boosters, and commando lunges"" then its all here and definitely worth the money, however if you're not into it you can get an add-on called IW4X which adds dedicated serves to counter act a lot of those problems and adds a very stable anti-cheat (not like there were many cheaters to begin with) to the game. Overall, this a massive nostalgia trip for me and in my opinion, definitely worth the money especially with that 3rd party add-on."

4520,ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg

4522,Best game to ever exist. Spec ops is banger.
4523,"(Hours don't reflect the multiplayer section [530 on steam alone] or the amount I played on PS3 and Xbox)Honestly, I really enjoy the game but I mostly play multiplayer so let me break it down. Is it worth $19.99? Eh, I would say yes.Campaign: Incredible and really fun.Spec-Ops: Fun and a nice co-op. Not incredibly lengthy thoughDLC: Absolutely useless. So little people have it. It still costs the same price it did 11 years ago. Never goes on sale. Waste of money. It has some nice maps, but it so not worth the price. Not 11 years ago... even less now.Multiplayer: I really enjoy it a lot. Generally there are 3-10 lobbies running at a time (Team Deathmatch) even til now. But it's so frustrating how many hackers play and ruin the game. I keep trying to beat them, you can't beat them. You won't find them everyday necessarily, but many days you will... and sometimes you keep running into them. Some times you join awful modded lobbies that force you to use a certain weapon or one that just kicks you for playing well or for no reason at at all. It's so frustrating and I'm not even getting into noob tubing... It's still fun, but it's just so spread out now that lobbies just frankly suck frequently.So do I recommend it? Yes, but just be cautious about multiplayer. It's become a lot more frustrating than it should be. The campaign itself though should justify the price. Even better if its on sale."
4524,Best cod!
4525,full of hax and u cant do any think.you cant banne him or report him or even kick him..at less add report systemshit gameplay didnt even enjoy any one of them in conclusion its just trash and dead game exepte the story mod and wath left was shit and who say the opposte was big manic and idiot TY for u attention
4526,It is Mw2 come on
4527,Great game
4528,"The second of the original trilogy, an absolutely amazing campaign.

Graphics: Much better than I remember, and although not up to todays standards, still hold up very well.

Sound: The sounds are good, good music, and immersive sounds.

Overall: A wonderful game, fun campaign, that you can get immersed into, and feel for the characters in it."
4529,yes play
4530,"Easily one of if not the greatest Call of Duty campaigns of all time. The multiplayer is well past its prime sadly but still enjoyable. If you're interested in getting into the Modern Warfare series, it's very much worth it for this game alone."
4531,"Really miss the old COD games. Surprisingly, there is still an online community supporting the game and servers are still populated."
4532,a fast paced fps thats gonna sting
4533,"man, fck shepherd
enuff said"
4534,"amazing game but
too many hackers in multiplayer
and in some hacked servers
they make it so you can't exit the game 
and not even alt+f4 works
so you have to wait till match ends

4552,I like the solo missions.   You can play them in 3 different difficulty levels and they are very challenging.  I like this version of COD the best because it is the only one I know of with the solo missions.

It said 'Couldn't load image ""falloff_linear""' on PC and I decided to reinstall the game... After reinstalling the game all of my progress was gone. Spec Ops - 0%; Campaign - 0%; Multiplayer - 0%. I had all of them fully completed and THOSE WERE YEARS OF PROGRESS AND HARD WORK AND THEY JUST FUCKING DISAPPEARED IN A BLINK OF AN EYE! I swear to God I'm never playing this game ever again."

4574,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is packed with action and memorable warzones. I was always impressed with the atmosphere created through the many background characters and diverse locations. I remember trying to sit in the empty chair just to watch the two soldiers play basketball for a minute or two before I began training in The Pit. Small details like this add so much immersion to a story that is already full of controversy and chaos. The heartbeat sensor adds a new layer to stealth missions and the vehicle missions are some of the best in the franchise. If you are looking for more thrilling adventures with Captain Price and the squad, then stay frosty. Game on."

4578,One of the best multiplayer games for our generation. Returned after 8 years. MW2 maps and mechanics are always different.

4580,"No Russian Very Good Mission and Runs On My Pentium 
"
4581,"Best Call of Duty game. The story is great, And the multiplayer is good too. I played this game on another console, But when you play it on PC its GREAT! You should get this game, And when i'm posting this, This game is on a lower price. You should get it. Great game!"
4582,A game way ahead of its time. Looks like a game that's been released in 2013.
4583,"One of the greatest sequels and best FPS games of all time! I highly recommend it! Full of political themes and shocking and impactful moments and great anti war themes! Also great political commentary on US foreign policy and US imperialis! General Shepherd was a great example of how the US government and military will create false flags to justify wars. Go buy and play this amazing FPS and stop reading as I will be spoiling events in the plot of the campaign! Modern Warfare 2 improves the gunplay and adds so many new features and gameplay mechanics from Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. There are a lot more set pieces and intense moments and many more firefights and large scale battles. The missions in the US where you're fighting the Russians who are invading are the highlights especially the battle of Washington DC where you've storming the white house. This is the first Call of Duty to stray away from the grounded semi ""realistic"" nature of the previous Call of Duty's to a more bombastic and action oriented game with insane set pieces and action sequences but in Modern Warfare 2 they're done so well compared to Black Ops which feels like an insane Hollywood Michael Bay film. In Modern Warfare 2 I've always felt immersed despite some sections feeling out of place in this military shooter. The Snowmobile escape and Boat chase sequences felt straight out of action movies rather than actual military operations lol. But bringing Captain Price back was perfect and he's as badass here as he was in the first game. Soap who was the faceless silent protagonist in the first Modern Warfare here talks and you can see what he looks like is so amazing! The new characters they introduce to fight alongside you such as Ghosts, Sgt. Foley, Cpl. Dunn, and others are great additions. The new faceless silent protagonists you play as such as Roach and Ramirez serve their purpose and are great new playable characters. Pvt. Allen was useless and dies early in the game in the infamous mission ""No Russian"" where Allen goes from a US Army Ranger to a CIA operative undercover as an Ultranationalist Terrorist and aiding the new antagonist Makarov and his comrades in shooting up an airport in Moscow. This Massacre in Moscow is what makes Russia invade the US Western Coast and starts the Russo American War. The reveal of Shepherd being the mastermind being behind the massacre and starting the war between America and Russia was amazing and Shepherd shoots and murders Roach and Ghosts to tie up loose ends and prevent them from discovering Shepherd's plots. All in all the campaign is amazing and the story was wrapped up beautifully in the third and final conclusion. Spec Ops is fun as hell and is way better than Zombies. Each Spec Ops missions was different from eachother and this game introduced Juggernauts who are a pain to kill. My favorite Spec Ops mission was the Coop AC 130 missions where one player travels to the objective on foot while the other player covers him as the AC 130 gunner. It was a great throwback to the AC 130 mission in the first Modern Warfare. The multiplayer was and still is amazing and made so many innovations and improvements from the first and added so much content! Although there were exploits that hackers and cheaters exploited. There are still servers that don't have hackers but they're hard to find. This is the game that really brought Call of Duty into the mainstream and made the franchise so popular and brought many people both the good and bad into Call of Duty. Thank God the PC community isn't as toxic as the consoles communities because I despise screaming annoying kids who for some reason make their parents buy them Call of Duty games. Modern Warfare 2 is one of the greatest FPS games ever made and is severely underrated!"
4584,"yes.
"
4585,"Well, one of the best CoD, maybe THE best CoD."
4586,"A classic, what more is there to say."
4587,good shooting game
4588,"Still a wonderful game, without the remaster."
4589,One of the best games I've ever played in my LIFE. You should buy this game right now.
4590,Back when the Campaign was fun and had memorable characters. Multiplayer is dead. Defo worth for the Campaign and Spec Ops

4594,Yes
4595,"This is for the record. History is written by the victor. History is filled with liars. If he lives and we die, his truth becomes written - and ours is lost. Shepherd will a hero, 'cause all you need to change the world is one good lie and a river of blood. He's about to complete the greatest trick a liar ever played on history. His truth will be the truth. But only if he lives, and we die."

4601,I can't believe I'm still playing this 11 years later. This game is a hit!
4602,dis good gam
4603,Great Classsic
4604,"This game is a hard no for three reasons: One, no native controller support so it's wonky as hell to use if you prefer a controller. Two, this game punishes you for ""friendly fire"" when it's a video game and I killed Marines in Halo just for more ammo. Three, it actually has a warning at the beginning about a ""disturbing"" mission. They seriously think ANYONE playing this game gives a shit about killing civilians in a game? Has any employee working on this series played Grand Theft Auto at any point?
So this game is a hard pass on PC. Was pretty good on console when my standards were much lower. As a fourth reason, $20 is far too expensive for the four hours it takes to complete the campaign mode as I have zero interest in playing against toxic children online."
4605,"Cool
Remember, no russian"

Not my type of gameplay, however, it can be fun if you're looking to just relax and do something else than multiplayer.

4632,"All warfare is based on deception. For years, the West hypocrisy has made the world a battlefield. The corrupt talk while our brothers and sons spill their own blood. But deceit cuts both ways. The bigger the lie, the more likely people will believe it, and when a nation cries for vengeance, the lie spreads like a wildfire. The fire builds, devouring everything in its path. Our enemies believe that they alone dictate the course of history, and all it takes is the will of a single man."

4652,"Toxic Community. All servers are hosted by people who can mod the game or kick/troll you if they want. Once a great game, now just a piece of garbage ruined by toxic people. On late hours you can wait even 10 to 20 minutes to find a deathmatch game, so its nearly dead after 11 years."
4653,11 years later and this game is still an absolute masterpiece. Online is still a tumor but its a tumor I like having and the campaign is as great as the day I first played it.
4654,its okay.
4655,Worth playing 11 years later. Fuck multiplayer hackers.
4656,"best cod ever made, hands down.

the multiplayer is sorta dead in 2020, but there is always Iw4x."

4658,"If, like me, you love this game and CoD hasn't quite felt the same since 2010, and if, also like me, you wish you could find consistent lobbies that aren't filled with hackers, then I have the solution for you: !W4x (IMPORTANT: the ""!"" is actually an ""I"" but it gets censored if I use the actual name). Please disregard the fact that this review may read more like an advertisement than an objective analysis but i digress. Please google !W4x MW2 and install it, it's free. What is !W4x you might ask? It's a modded version of MW2 to establish dedicated servers (just like Cod4). There are so many things great about it so I will name a few here:

1) Dedicated servers (I know, I said this already but it's very important)
2) You can unlock all the weapons, attachments and callsigns by going into the Barracks, so you don't have to play the game all over again. However, if you like the personal achievement of unlocking everything, you can reset and level up for fun
3) Some of the servers ban irritating things in the game like noobtubes or change all deathstreaks to be Copycat. In my opinion, this is a good thing, as it balances out the playing field a little more. However, if you miss that good ol grenade launcher, you can definitely find a server that allows them. 
4) Dedicated servers
5) Game modes that aren't available in MW2 Vanilla, like Gun Game, and maps from other COD games like Nuketown. 
6) More guns that aren't available in MW2 Vanilla, like the AK74u. 
7) Dedicated servers

Once again, google !W4x and follow the instructions to download. You can also add it to Steam and use the overlay just like regular MW2. If anyone has any issues installing, post in the comments and I'll try to link some fixes or guides that worked for me. It also has dedicated servers, not sure if I mentioned that yet or not."
4659,yes

4675,"A good worth of your money, especially the boat and vehicle missions."
4676,"I just realized I haven't reviewed this yet. It is by far one of the most iconic Call of Duties. Every level of the campaign is fantastic. The multiplayer can be repetitive as Infinity Ward lags behind Treyarch in that aspect. The campaign becomes unforgettable when you witness an EMP rocket from space, detonating over DC and sending aircrafts hurdling to the ground - as a soldier, defending the suburbs and the historic DC areas from invaders in the dark. Also, as an aside, ""no Russian"".

amazing campaign, multiplayer is pretty good, so yeah"
4705,"The follow-up of COD: MW. It follows the story started in the previous game. There aren't many significant changes during the gameplay (maybe a couple of them), but still a good game. I recommend it if you played the previous one."
4706,great
4707,A game to remember forever. one of the cod games that got me hooked on the franchise. i don't think any cod could top this game
4708,its good
4709,"A game i played throughout my entire childhood, Is arguably the best part in the amazing trilogy of MW with the best spec ops, campaign, and arguably the best multiplayer maps and weapons, Nowadays you have a near impossible time to find a multiplayer lobby that is not TDM, but hackers have made it arguably better, No OMA nubetube spam, games start instantly, Its fast paced adrenaline filled fun."
4710,"not bad for a old calll of duty
"
4711,I love MW2
4712,why are you looking at reviews just buy the game
4713,"I bought this game so I don't have to feel bad for using IW4 x, (I already owned it on Xbox so I know it's a good purchase). Even if you don't want to install a simple mod, the servers are still populated somehow, and the player counter actually works here IIRC, plus all of the good, old fashioned mods that only change the single player and aren't a pain to install. Overall, great game, my favorite CoD, and it gets some extra points for all of the features of the PC version.

(PS GET IW4 x, YOU CAN STILL DOWNLOAD IT WITHOUT THE BASE GAME https://iw4 x.org/downloads.html, [remove the space] also it says I have only 5 minutes because it counts the SP and MP as different games.)"
4714,good
4715,"One of the last truly great CoD's (and my personal favorite), MW2 continues the saga of Price, Soap, Roach etc. The campaign is iconic, the Special Operations are a blast (and the last of the unique ones), and if you're into that kind of thing, had great MP too (nothing like getting spanked by a bunch of kids, yay! 8/). I love this game, I always have and always will."
4716,Great game i bought it for the campaign and it was bloody on my end
4717,nice game
4718,its the best
4719,"I finished this game for like 20 times when I was younger, then I decided to buy it...really I bought the game because I really love it, not because there are some ' special features' including in the Steam version. It's kinda the opposite."
4720,"Good sequel story with more interesting characters.
Insane multiplayer.
Spec Ops mode for extra coop content.
No official mod support anymore."

The first game was pretty good and set a pretty damn high bar but man this one definitely hit and exceeded that bar. The gameplay felt a bit more clean and polished, the story picked up and kept up from beginning to end keeping me interested and immersed through and through and, everyones favorite for some reason, it had pretty clean graphics. Overall an experience I definitely recommend if you've played the first and have interest in the franchise."

4800,"Best campaign, memorable multiplayer and thrilling spec-ops mode. Cod mw2 was THE game at the time of release. No other title came close including battlefield nor crisis.

My best experience on the game: Playing free for all on rust, getting an AC-130, freeing captain price in campaign and playing spec-ops with friends.

The graphics were amazing at the time, the story was well-written and the gameplay brought new changes like choosing kill streaks. 

I would recommend this game. Play the modern warfare 2 remastered."

4806,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 continues the story of John ‚ÄúSoap‚Äù MacTavish as well as many others during the fight against Russia. The main story takes you through a vast number of sceneries and allows modes of transportation the Call of Duty franchise hasn‚Äôt seen up until this point. Outside of the campaign you can play Spec Ops mode, in which you fight waves of different enemies on over 25 different missions. This is especially fun if you have a friend to do it with. Arguably the most popular mode would be the multiplayer. Many see this game as their favorite in the franchise solely due to the multiplayer. Unfortunately now that it‚Äôs been well over a decade since this game was released on Steam, the multiplayer is relatively dead. You are still able to find games in Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardcore Team Deathmatch with the exception of more than likely getting terrible ping. In conclusion if you're looking for an active multiplayer scene, the game most likely isn‚Äôt for you, but if you're looking for a great story, then I highly suggest you purchase this when on sale."
4807,trill for fps but you got to get the story first to understand what's happening.
4808,"very strong singleplayer story and amazing gameplay/gunplay, i played this game on the hardest difficulty and it is unforgiving but very fun. its a true test of your accuracy, patience and survivability.  besides the single player campain there is specops wich basically are a bunch of missions that are very challenging. i dont feel much for multiplayer (in any game) but it is well put together with good designed maps and a good/addictive progression mechanic.
I can tell why people praise this game so much. still in 2020 a 10/10.

It also has a completely memorable cliffhanger ending sequence."

4884,"[h1]Triumph of CoD series[/h1] 
One of the best single-player campaign in a shooter even for the present day, one of the best multiplayer for its time. This campaign brought us outstanding blockbuster experience, however, it also created a negative tendency to the future CoD games and other titles apart from CoD. Overall it is a great game, that can bring joy even in the modern gaming world. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at CoD‚Äôs best times. Please note that you should buy this game only for single-player and maybe coop purposes. 
[h1]What was good in MW 2 Single Player?[/h1]

[*]Like in a previous title, you see the war from two sides - regular soldier and super special force guy. In the first sections you face large battles and encounter full-scale enemy groups, the second section is oriented more on cover operations of spec ops. The core gameplay is the same, but some features and objectives differ, which mixes gameplay in a good way. 
It is a perfect solution if you want to relax after an office working routine. On low difficulties, you can simply play this shooting range without real brain activity. 
[*]Guns, tons of them.
[*]The story is interesting, even though some large parts were copied from famous movies (I mean you, Red Dawn). The plot is intense, has a great twist in the end, cinematic moments are great - makes you hold your breath each playtime. I would also add that the plot was quite brave for 2009, it was rare for AAA titles to make such moves, I mean No Russian mission. Finally, the story feels fluid and the player has an understanding of what he or she is doing and why is that happening.
[*]The gameplay. It just doesn‚Äôt let you get bored at least they are trying to do so. In every mission, there is something special and beyond standard FPS, e.g. Predator rocket, AC-130, motorboat rides. 
[*]Hans Zimmer, his soundtrack is so good, that this game has the greatest OST from all Call of Duty franchise, sound editors know their job. I still listen to some compositions. 

[h1]What was and is bad in MW 2 Single Player?[/h1]
[b]Forward note:[/b]huge minuses of the game could be uncovered on Veteran difficulty. I would also judge this game from a modern perspective: 
[li]
[*]Enemies, their spawn is endless, they end once you get to a certain point on the map, in other words, trigger script. This is messy as you simply could not understand when it is safe to move. The enemy can spawn right at the corner, right behind you, even though you have already cleared the room. Enemies all the time react only at you, so even when you flank they will know where are you. At some point, it is so ridiculous that enemies can completely ignore your allies and start shooting at you. While playing on Veteran the game looks like roulette where you either able to run to a safe space or die from a horde of bullets. 
[*]Allies. They are more like a decoration than helpful soldiers who actually kill enemies. Taking into account mentioned about enemies logic, you could face a completely silly situation. For example, you see your allies at some point, ‚Äúokay that area seems to be safe‚Äù that‚Äôs what you would think probably, but nom you could discover that enemies are behind your allies, around your allies. Moreover, the enemy doesn‚Äôt react on your bots, once they see you, they will immediately fire at you. The allies‚Äô damage is also quite strange, as you kill foes from 2-4 bullets, however, teammates could fire bursts after bursts and that poor terrorist/soldier cannot die. This is annoying since you realize that you are fighting alone most of the time.
[*]Rails. In those times it was cool to see the action all the time, everything blows up, you need to perform some important stuff all the time like riding the motorboat, run away from the angry militia. However, once you stop for a minute and analyze what‚Äôs happening, you would understand that you have little control over the game. It just tells you what to do all the time, sometimes I want to investigate locations or just to check what is in that house, but the game says - no, man, you have to run, we are in a hurry, cmon! In some cases, if you hesitate you die from explosion or enemies overrun you. Today I wish I had more control over the game. 

[h1]MW 2 Multiplayer[/h1]
Back then it was fantastic, they have added various killstreaks, that you can switch, an option to upgrade your perks, grind camos, etc. The gunplay was good and there had been always something that kept you in the game. Of course, MW 2 had serious balance issues like overpowered last chance perk, UMP 45 that can compete even with sniper rifles, noob tubes, and other stuff. Actually, you can safely disregard that, as it is really hard to find a normal match because MW 2 was pirated long ago, so the game is crawling with cheaters and the support for the game had ended long ago.  

[h1]MW 2 Coop[/h1]
Well, this game had second-best coop after MW 3, it is really fun and can keep the interest. Maps and objectives are different and some of them are quite creative like riding a snow bike together or one player controls AC-130 and other is on the ground.  So it is worth grabbing your buddy and putting a couple of hours in that coop. 
[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I would recommend buying this game only during a sale period as the price for the single-player and somewhat coop is too high and take into account that MW 2 was released almost a decade ago. Still, if you are looking for a nice blockbuster for a couple of nights - give Modern Warfare 2 a try. Personal rating: 8/10."
4885,$15 is too much. I bought the game when it first came out and it is a good game but today the game is more than 10 years old so the price is too high.
4886,best game ever made!!

4893,"Brilliant game and always will be. This was my childhood right here and has a special place in my heart.
Beats any of the today's cod which over complicate everything and rinse and repeat from previous great cods.
This game still has a decently sized community and definitely worth a play."
4894,"this is a good combat mission game , must play."
4895,"I have tried to play this game for weeks but this game is terrible for visually impaired players. My PC setup is optimal but this game is still unplayable to a large degree for me. Options to mitigate this problem would be welcome even though they may reduce the ""realism"" in the game. a game unplayable is useless regardless of its ""realistic"" appearance. This game is not for visually impaired persons as it stands now.

Works cannot express my personal frustration with this game."
4896,best call of duty game 10 out of 10
4897,The Gameplay is very exciting
4898,i shit myself when there is an AC130 in the air a lot of hackers tho but still one if my favourite cod games
4899,"Bad game, there wasn't any female feminist soldier..."
4900,best cod
4901,good game
4902,"*WARNING: This review is based on the single player campaign. Online players discretion is advised.*

A fun mindless high production value shooter hindered by questionable game design decision...

THE GOOD:
+ High production value (presentation, soundtrack, voice acting, etc.)
+ Impressive set pieces
+ Over the top action
+ Exciting snowmobile chasing sequence
+ Controversial terrorist mission
+ Believable urban settings featuring Burger shop, parking lot, residential areas
+ The White House siege scenery
+ Gameplay variety featuring drones, airstrikes, mounted miniguns and armored vehicules
+ Story being a subtle criticism (or kind of...) of patriotism

THE BAD:
- Very linear missions leaving ZERO player agency
- Convoluted plot hindered by constant perspective shifts
- Emotional moments not working really well in a blockbuster action setting
- Cheap enemy placement resulting in the player being constantly shot at from every angles
- Enemies keep spawning until the player has passed an invisible threshold
- Useless AI teammates waiting for the player to do all the job before moving on
- Laughable finale featuring an inflatable boat catching up a helicopter
- Only 5 hours

Not a masterpiece like its predecessor but at least an entertaining follow up!

4945,"[h1] Story [/h1]
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision also it has the biggest budget for a game to this day.MW2 continuous the storyline of Modern Warfare 1.After the events from MW1, Ultranationalists seize control of the Russian Federation, even with best efforts of US Marine Corps and SAS to stop them, and make Imran Zakhaev (villain from previous COD) a martyr, which also ruins the diplomatic relations with USA. Vladimir Makarov, Zakhaev's right hand man, starts a campaign of revenge against the West, and five years later, commits a mass murder and leaves American body on the scene, sparking a war between Russian and USA.
You will follow the story from 2 perspectives of a Task Force 141, special forces unit that is hunting down Makarov, and United States Army Rangers, who try to defend their country from invasion.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
It has the most fluid gameplay of fps games, guided the fps games that came after it it still is a linear shooter with interactive and action sequences, from vehicle combat, to slow mo door breaching a room filled with enemies. You will jump, sprint, crouch, and kill baddies like in every other Call Of Duty, while trying to stay behind a cover if shot, to regenerate your health. If you die, you get a lovely quote and you start from a checkpoint. To complete the level, just follow and do your objectives! Pretty self explanatory, not much to discuss. On the start of each level you get two weapons, but you can always switch them if they don't fit your style. Game, just like previous entry, has a wide variety of weapons and attachments to choose from. From obvious different type of crosshair, to more fancy ones, such as weapons with heartbeat sensors, or attached weapon under a weapon! Because there is no such thing as enough weapons. Some levels will even give you special equipment, like night vision goggles, or a laser designator. Normal equipment involves grenades, flashbangs, C4 and claymore mines. And as always, a combat knife if in real need to kill an enemy, yet with no ammo or time to reload.

[h1] Music [/h1]
Best soundtrack from COD's, that's for sure. Main theme composed by Hans Zimmer himself, while rest of the score was crafted by Lorne Bafle. It's just fantastic and there is nothing else to say about it. Voice actors also did a great job, both newly introduced ones, and the ones that simply changed a character they voice over.

[h1] Summary [/h1]
Simple yet action and variety packed gameplay, super storyline with well written characters combined with fantastic soundtrack plus two additional gamemodes, Modern Warfare 2 has everything you need from a FPS, and continuous great story on MW1.

4977,"Kinda, reminds me of a good old days. Campaign is great, but the spec ops mode is even better. I'm remembering now when we've tryharding for the all 15 3 stars there and gosh it was worth it. But the MP is sadly even in the old days was already filled with a bunch of cheaters, now even more so. Don't get me wrong, it's great and gunplay is the most enjoying one i've had considering any other mp shooter, but the cheaters are annoying and you just can't do anything about it. (Played around 700 hours in mp, still enjoying it once in a while)."
4978,good
4979,cool.
4980,Spec ops is the best CoD mode ever. Modern Warfare (2019) completely ruined it.
4981,"A great sequel to the first one, Modern Warfare 2 gives you more diverse locations and missions than the previous game.
The price tag is high for an 11 year old game even on discount.
I recommend it for the story but know that MW2 is connected to MW3 to be concluded, unlike going from MW1 to MW2."

4999,"if this was stars i would Rate it 10/10 THIS IS THE BEST COD OF ALL TIME

its been 11 years since this masterpiece came out and let me tell you the campaign is probaly one of the best storys in gaming history it takes place after 5 years from cod 4 and it has a great story and probaly the most convirstol mission of all time ""No Russian"" where you are with Makarov and Shoot down a Airport. story mode is worth getting this
 and then you got spec ops which is another amazing mode where it has a story but you can play with anyone and do a ""co op campaign"" 
now here are some cons 

Multiplayer: Modders have taken over the servers and theres not much playable games as modders come in over and also be aware of this problem. there has been reports that they might be able to somewhat hack into your pc while your playing it so if you see anything werid when your playing like your moving but you arent doing anything BACK OUT Immdietaly and do a virus scan and check on task manager to see if theres any unknown apps

It doesnt automcailly go into a window tab: so this isnt a huge con but thought worth mentioning if you see your screen being small put your resolution the highest it can go then once it loads do alt += enter then you get full screen"

5003,Good
5004,Best call of duty game yet ! Still wish the remake had the MP !
5005,"When I just want to check out I play me some FPS. I have been playing this for sometime. Nothing beats noob tubing on Nuketown. The Game is great the only drawback which can be serious is the community. Alot of hacking. Annoying players that have to be silence.

I have not played the single player campaign. I have to do that someday. 




Other FPS I own and play 
Call of duty black ops       80%
Call of duty black ops II    90%

Day of infamy.                   89%
Left for Dead 2                  98% perfect

I would give this game around a 68%. At times I can really really enjoy it and then other times the community just ruins it"
5006,"its a great game but it keeps on crashing, i dont know why. (only crashes when there's a loading screen)"
5007,it‚Äôs alright
5008,"This game is still amazing, even tho it was made in 2009, oh God the memories! Multiplayer is still active and there are no hackers, but some modders can be found. Situation on PC is way better than on consoles. Aiming feels super smooth and graphics are good for 2009 game. Campaign is one of the best in Call of Duty series and this is worth to get alongside with COD 4 and MW3. Of course there is still this bullshit thing called OMA Danger Zone Grenade Launchers. Spec Ops gives you something else to do after the campaign or if you don¬¥t want to play MP. Try to get all 69 stars and beat Infinity Ward¬¥s record on every mission! Glad to have this game, I recommend it if you want to play this masterpiece again on PC. I wish Remastered version was in Steam too :("

5058,"This game brought me back into Multiplayer FPS and spit me right back out. My kids could hear me screaming late into the night as yet another crafty little bugger knifed me in the back or sniped me from God knows where. Fast and fun MP the Single player game was fun too, if a bit forgettable. I'd recommend for nostalgia reasons, the game play has been surpassed by other games at this point."
5059,the game is a bit aged. but it's still good.
5060,theres a sad moment in the game :'(
5061,"Love game was pretty good, if you like CoD, its gonna CoD. Never played Multiplayer, just beat the campaign and I'm working towards those achievements."

5064,"Owing to the lockdown in the UK I decided to replay all of my COD games, I had forgotten just how good MW2 is, okay it won't run in ultrawide but the graphics are so amazing for 2009 game I'll put up with the black bars on my Z35p."

5072,"WARNING DO NOT PLAY THE MULTIPLAYER I have not experienced this myself but I have heard that the hackers not only cheat at the game(I don't care about that) but can HACK INTO YOUR COMPUTER people need to know this
but the campaign is well worth $20 and is really good"
5073,"Don't buy it for MP, too many hackers. You'll either be aimbotted, or kicked for being in the lead."
5074,great game 5 star
5075,Best COD ever made 11/10

5077,"And remember, no Russian..."
5078,"Amazing story, Fun Multiplayer, Crazy spec ops. Surprisingly modders haven't taken over this game so its playable and fun 
Other than that i'd give this game a 8/10 the price is a little too crazy, I think it should be atleast 10$ so i'd recommend to get it when its on sale"
5079,There better be a remasterd i want noobtubed in hd 4k
5080,2020 Game of the Year
5081,"fun but a bit more money then i would like

5082,a classic with a great story this game needs no introduction
5083,play this game
5084,this game is a classic and it has great mechanics plus a great story just and all around great game
5085,A lot of fun to play.

looks fun"
5089,its cool
5090,"Today, 06/11/2020 was my first time playing this game and i love it, the story is so good and tragic. Very well written, and the OST is so GOOD 11/10"
5091,"Now with about 160 hours in the multiplayer, i can tell you, this game is just as good. The memories and flashbacks that came to me while playing the campaign hit me strong, even if you haven't played it before, both the campaign and multiplayer are great! Multiplayer is surprisingly, but sadly very quiet when it comes to communcation, luckily its very active though, and i'm recommending this to EVERYONE, even people with low-end rigs, something i grew up with, and to this day i still have. Strongly Recommend!"
5092,"Fucking better than the remaster, at least this one has spec ops and multiplayer
Fuck activision"
5093,"I think that most people who is getting this game has played it or seen people played it and know that this game is good. However if you never played any call of duty before then i recommend this game to you but i also recommend that you get cod 4 since this is the sequel to cod 4. The reason why i love this game is well the characters are really important to the story and have qualities to them to make you have attachments to the characters as well as hating the villains with a passion, This game also isn't afraid to take risks which i'll not spoil why, You will never get confused when you switch to different characters cause you will have information of why you are there and where you are, it's a challenging game but that's part of the fun cause satisfaction after beating a hard mission after trial and error is always worth it and lastly the guns are just fun to use as you'll never get bored from the guns which my personal favorite is the Kalashnikov aka the AK47. Well i hope this review helps you when you decide to buy this game if you are new to call of duty"
5094,"CAMPAIGN
The campaign of the game is like a 9/10
COD campaigns are actually so short, they make me think they are not worth the whole game price, but the campaign is soo good, if you've played all Modern Warfare campaigns you know what I mean. Nothing more to say.

MULTIPLAYER
I really don't know what to say about the MP, because it's a really good MP game, it really is and I love it so much.
But the game is full of hacks, actually full. You queue for TDM and you end up playing domination 9v9 in highrise getting killed through walls by a hacker, not being able to open the menu and quiting the match, forcing you to close the game via windows task manager.
But the next match, it's a completely official TDM game, where you enjoy the game
It is so hard for me to enjoy the game with so much cheat on it, and I know it's an old game etc etc, but idk man...

Should you buy this game?
For the multiplayer: read the MP part because I really don't know
For the campaing: It's up to you
I'm recommending the game ONLY if you buy it on sale."
5095,In my opinion I think this is the best campaign in any COD game.
5096,i
5097,good but over priced
5098,"Could be better, but overall solid port of MW2"
5099,The perfect blend of Hollywood and action-shooter. My personal favorite COD to date and has some of the most iconic moment of the series. 100% recommend
5100,General hates good characters
5101,"good
"
5102,"Played the call of duty franchise since i was young, i was never as keen on this one as i was on cod 4 or MW3 but its still a fun game and i know a lot of people who say this is their favourite, the developers did a great job and i would still give it a 10/10"
5103,worth it
5104,"Loved this game growing up so I figured to pick it up again 11 years later and I am very disappointed. From the screen tearing to the awful aiming.  There are no hit markers in the singleplayer and it gets impossible to see when you have blood droplets all over your screen symbolizing you dying. 

I'm by no means saying that MW2 is a crappy game. No, it is amazing, if you have a console. On PC, it's not even worth it in my opinion."
5105,"great game, reminds me of Modern Warfare (2019)"
5106,I finished the campaign on veteran and only had 1 bug during that time! I tabbed out during a cut-scene and that caused a fatal error with directx11. Gameplay is still fun X years later!
5107,great campaign and even better multiplayer
5108,like

5110,Best COD campaign to date.
5111,nice

Lovely campaign that is famed for good reason. If you're into shooters, this one is no-brainer!"
5113,"These games are a guilty pleasure of mine. It's worth it for me to get them while they're on sale, ignore all the multiplayer BS, and just enjoy the single player campaigns for the interactive action movies that they are."
5114,very fun
5115,gt
5116,yes
5117,funny
5118,"I bought this game on sale for 15.00 in May. Here in 2020, the campaign and spec-ops are both still incredibly fun. I've spent a big part of my later quarantine replaying both cod4 and mw2 on veteran and both campaigns hold on incredibly well, especially considering some of the other cod campaigns we've gotten recently. Playing the spec-ops trying to get a all 69 stars has been amazing so far. Although, all of this comes with one problem:
The multiplayer, which most people remember this game for, is incredibly broken. There a TON of hackers ruining the experience for everyone. So if you buy this game looking for a nostalgia trip in the multiplayer, don't expect to have a lot of playtime as you'll probably just end up quitting because of the hackers."
5119,nice game!
5120,greatest game ever made better than the remaster
5121,"why the modern warfare 2 call of duty game isn't playing, please improve the game"
5122,A good story mixed with fps gameplay in between that gets highlighted with music. A great experience that comes with the greatest multiplayer experience known to man. no reason not to buy

5132,"It's fun a game to look back on, I remember playing this on my Xbox 360 back when it came out but I sold it and all it's games when PS4 came out so my only option was to buy this game on steam because I couldn't be bothered to spend $100 on a Xbox 360 that doesn't work. So overall great game to look back on."

5177,"I wish steam had a middle option because this game is so painfully mediocre its boring, yeah theres spectacle to the story but it soon wares off"
5178,Horrible optimization. Runs like doo doo feces on modern hardware.
5179,"Main story is ok, but the special ops missions just a piece of sh*ts. Most of them scripted and the f/*king dogs ruin everything. Taking those down is pure gamble and depends on luck. When the E appaers even if u press it u die. You have to press a nanosecond before that and then hope it works becasue half of the down it wont anyway. The stealth mission is bs too, i did eveything the same way as before and sometimes they spot me from 100 meters, sometimes i can sneak in front of them. Pure scripted cr*p,everythinbg depends on luck and how the game was meant to played, not how you want it."

5185,boring
5186,Yeah its really good but the problem is theres alot of toxic people
5187,"This game was the peak of the CoD for me. A story line that is unforgettable. The only other Call of Duty to live up to a story such as this one was Call of Duty II. If I could recommend any Call of Duty's to new players, I would suggest CoD II, CoD MW 1 (Original), and MW 2. Black Ops II had one of the best Zombie experiences out of the entire franchise."

5210,"""This is for the record, history is written by the victors, history is filled with ùíçùíäùíÇùíìùíî.""
-Captain Price on how History is written

Call of Duty: MW2 is one of those sequels that you can only make up in your dreams. It has the same old characters from the first game you know and love such as Price, Soap, and Nikolai. And some new ones that will rock your socks off such as Roach, Ghost, Makarov, and Shephard. The Campaign is a rollercoaster of events and if you enjoyed MW1's campaign, you'll fall in love with MW2's.

Multiplayer is a relic of its time. Despite the annoying killstreaks or everyone using the ACR. It's a pretty good gamemode. If you wanted somewhere for some quick TDM. I definetly recommend it, however if you are looking for some other gamemodes. It might be best to go try Modern Warfare (2019) as the game doesn't really have as many players as it used to.

Spec Ops is one of my absolute FAVORITE gamemodes. I could spend hours grinding the missions, setting up my claymores (If I have any left), and getting that epic, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED GOOD WORK! The Spec Ops in this game kind of puts MW3's and Modern Warfare 2019's Spec Ops to shame. If you played all 3 of their Spec Ops gamemodes, you'd understand what I'm saying.

MW2 is a correct example of how to do a sequel. It has it all from the Dialogue, to the characters, a kick-ass multiplayer with sick af guns, and even a Spec Ops to boot. MW2 is a game that has me coming back time and time again. Thank you for reading my review and I hope you decide to buy this game and have a safe day as well. :)
"
5211,Ol good Mw2 but nowdays full of hackers
5212,"buy it ONLY for the singleplayer/spec ops. forget about the multiplayer, there's too many hackers and apparently there has been a nasty exploit going around that allows people to screw with your system on multiplayer. worst case scenario, they install some malware onto your computer."
5213,vgoa
5214,play
5215,Only refunding due to the fact I dont wanna risk getting my pc compromised in any way.
5216,"Ok, it took me many years before I actually got to unwrap this game and play since it was first released. Anyway, overall I found the plot line to generally ok and ties into the map and progression and situation. The story does feel a little bit like it has ADHD though... the development seems more spasmatic than smooth which was a little irritating sometimes for me. 

Tied in with this, for some strange reason the voice acting and dialogue sometimes just gets so soft during in game play it's like you can't hear anything and I've tried switching between stereo and my actual 5.1 setup and it doesn't sole anything. The volume is always at max in the audio settings too so I don't know whats wrong.

The graphics is probably what I would expect for that generation, and honestly it isn't bad or anything quite playable. Everyone seems to be a ""predator"" in this game too BTW lol. This can be irritating on higher difficulty levels when you can get clipped in an instant with some rando camoflauged enemy that just blends into background or cover. So be warned.

Gameplay was good overall. Enough action and tactics to prevent people from just running and gunning. But some of your A.I. teammates are just DUMB as hell that it makes you want to kill them yourself. They could be right on your flank itself behind cover and let and enemy waltz right up and kill you. It almost feels like you have to do every single thing for yourself. No one's even remotely got your back. And I'm not expecting an AI escort, but dammit man... Like no help at all whatsoever. Really?

After finishing the campaign you get some challenges to do which makes replayability good, and you can even do it co-op. There's also the multiplayer mode as well. The campaign itself is pretty ok to play through, but it's rather short. Most people want COD for the multiplayer which I'm not interested in. I will say though that the types of guns and enemy AI should more than likely make it a great experience."
5217,BABY! THIS SHIT IS THE BEST.
5218,its okay
5219,10/10 did not use a riot shield
5220,Not bad mw3 better or mw remastered. Only thing that sucks is that if you dont play for a while game deletes you progress in story mode.
5221,awesome
5222,Great Game As always
5223,"The first Modern Warfare was lots of fun, and this one was great also!"
5224,very good game
5225,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is like Call of Duty 4: Modern warfare but one more. 

You play as Gary ‚ÄúRoach‚Äù Sanderson, operator of the fictional Taskforce 141 (At least I hope their fictional or else they'll beat me up). You also play as Bill Taylor, not really feeling it in the Marine Corp, fakes his death during a nuclear explosion and goes back to the Army Rangers under the name of James Ramirez. 
That's what happened, debate me. 

It has been five years since the events of Call of Duty 4, the Ultranationalists had won the war anyway, but another faction, I'm guessing thought that the Ultranationalists weren't Ultranationalist enough, splintered off under the leadership of Vladimir Makarov, who might have the most evil Russian name on the planet. 

Trying to get in on Makarov, Joseph Allen, a former Army Ranger turned CIA operative, is planted within Makarov's inner circle. But somehow Makarov knows, and uses Allen to frame the USA for a airport shooting that he caused. Now, out for blood, the Russians invade the United States and you get to play out your Red Dawn fantasies. Only there are more gadgets this time so it is a little bit cooler. 

From here you go on a quest to stop Makarov as TF 141, as well as defend memorable American landmarks as the US Rangers, such notable places as the Washington Monument, the White House, and Burgertown. 

Modern Warfare 2 had some controversy to it for PC, mostly because it was straight up a console port, and also because leaning was gone. I didn't get it myself until I playe MW2 on PC, and realized that I couldn't just lean around corners to stop myself from being turned into a human rug with too many holes in it. 

Many weapons return from MW1, now updated to look fancier, but also some new weapons are added to the roster, there is not a single bad shotgun in this game, at least in single player. The biggest problem is how they handle damage now. 

In COD 4, the screen would get a red tint, and for some reason it had to tell me that I was in trouble with a big ‚Äú YOU ARE HURT, FIND COVER!‚Äù message. This is even worse in MW2, now with someone slapping me on the face with red jam while ALSO covering my screen with a warning message. A lot of the times I would die just running aimlessly because I flat out couldn't see where I was going?
Why did they do this? Was it to anger me? Because it worked. 

With that being said, MW2 has the advantage over COD4 by having much more memorable levels. When your commanding officer tells you to Defend a burger joint using predator missiles and thermal scoped sniper rifles, you don't forget it. 

Its also a bit more exciting, looking up to see paratrooping Russians over American soil, seeing dozens, if not hundreds of helicopters and planes fly overhead, looking down on the Washington monument as the Americans desperately try to hold the perimeter, raiding a Russian Gulag, firing a nuclear missile from a submarine, all of these stand out more. If they're going to rely more on cinematic set-pieces, you may as well make them memorable.

But, much like my restraining orders, its still kind of annoying being constantly told what you have to do. 

This is considered the peak of COD game design, which I disagree with because I still prefer COD2, but I still had a good time for the 4 hours it took me to complete this campaign. 5 if you could the part where I got up to poop and chase off my inner demons. 

I played the multiplayer for a bit. About one minute into the first game somebody called me a homo. It was like I never left. 

Modern Warfare 2 was the first COD PC game to rely on peer to peer rather than dedicated servers, using matchmaking instead of a server browser. This is bad for connection and delay, obviously. But, at the same time, in the year 2020 it might be a sort of kind of okay thing to have. This is the first COD game who's multiplayer still plays like it did the day it was released. So if you don't want to handle weird sub cultures or strange server rules and regulations, you should probably start with this one.

Sure it has its problems, like rewarding you for doing good with more tools to kill people with, widening the gap even further during games, but that's only bad when its happening to you. When IM the one shooting you with an AC-130, its fair and balanced, you just need to get good. 

Progression is completely level based, you kill people, win games, and completely certain challenges which gains you experience that helps you level up. The higher the level, the more weapons and perks you can use, the more challenges completed: The more add-ons you can have for your weapons. Its a very rudimentary and straight forward system that rewards people for being good and playing longer. 
It has its problems, sure, like how people playing longer have an even higher advantage over new players by just having more options to pick from and better weapons to use...But.
In a day and age where loot boxes, pay to win, and skinner-box game design is prevalent, I kind of feel like the simple ‚ÄúPlay game, get prizes‚Äù formula COD started with 4 is something we really took for granted, huh? 

Carl on Duty: I Made This Joke Already 2 is probably the pinnacle of the series for a lot of people, I'm biased and I disagree, but I'm also great so you should agree with me as well.  From here it just kind of goes downhill, not fast, mind you, there are still some decent COD games after this, but you can feel the dip in quality from Multiplayer powerhouse, to Free-to-play shooter you paid $60 for. 

Call of Duty: They Screwed Up the Numbering After This One 2 gets  7 Keith David telling you what to do out of 10.

5232,"The second installment of Modern Warfare trilogy, the masterpiece series.

With the same ingredient as the original Modern Warfare, the developer nailed it, with the story and the action.

9/10"
5233,"Probably the best call of duty all time, with multiplayer, single player and special ops you can play by yourself or with a buddy and that is the best part of this game!"
5234,This is a beautiful game. One of the best stories.
5235,"The game is as exciting as I remember it. You don't need an expensive gaming computer to run it which is also great. My only complaint is the multiplayer is dead and I don't couldn't find anything on dedicated servers which makes no sense. If COD4 had dedicated servers why can't this too? Getting on sale wasn't a total loss, but with the dlc I got in the bundle that I can't even use, it just feels like I got ripped off. I repeat...

DO NOT BUY FOR MULTIPLAYER"
5236,It's 11 years later and I'm literally still playing this game. Servers are still plentiful with non hacked lobbies. Great gameplay. Nostalgia all the way.
5237,classic
5238,This game was pretty fun but infested with cheats
5239,cod mw2 is fun even multiplayer is fun i recommend this game to people who like fps games
5240,good game. 10/10 classic
5241,"It's honestly a classic, and definately worth buying for Spec Ops to play with a friend. Wouldn't recommend playing Steam Multiplayer, but instead downloading the iW4X Mod Client which has all DLCs, Community Dedicated Servers, and Custom Weapons and Maps ported from other CoDs."
5242,"Play it in Hardened and I can guarantee you a satisfying rage moments when you die at some really hard spots in the campaign. 

BUY THIS WHEN IT'S ON SALE ONLY"
5243,"The mission ""Loose Ends"" is still the same. It's broken. At the last part where you have to dash to the LZ, the game does not allows you to play it any other way than to follow its predetermined routes. It this makes it very annoying/frustrating. Really, if your stuck on this part of the game, all you need to do is just run like crazy to the LZ, ignoring bullets, enemys. Doing it any other way will get you killed with invisible bullets, mines or whatever the game dishes at you. 2020, 11 years later and they still have not fixed it."
5244,"ok so, this game is AMAZING on console, but everytime i try to change my multiplayer resolution settings, the game immdietly crashes, with my well working above-average pc. please respond if you know how to fix this, because i know other people who have the exact same problem, so please play with caution"

5248,"Modern Warfare 2 is one of the greatest first person games of all time, but it's not safe to play multiplayer in its current state.  Hackers can remotely control your computer if you're in the same lobby as them.  Apparently it's been like this for months and it's also an issue with the other Call of Duty games from that era.

Activision, please patch the security holes. I know you guys don't give two fucks about Steam users anymore, but this is a disgrace.  You've let your best game go to shit, to the point where it's now too dangerous to even play it.  To leave the game this way is bad for PC gaming in general, not just Steam."
5249,"Awesome gameplay and love the special ops. I've played this game 724 hours, so far..."
5250,Awesome . Great game . Smooth play
5251,Very good game. Thoroughly enjoyed the campaign and the special ops missions offer great replay value. Multiplayer has some hackers but it's miles better than that cheap cs:go.
5252,good
5253,best game ever
5254,"Modern Warfare is one of the best Call of Duty games (albeit my love and thus, what I consider the best goes to CoD: Big Red One on the PS2) I‚Äôve played, with a storyline that feels like it actually took some time and effort to draw up, a wide arsenal of weapons to choose from, decent graphics (while you could consider them outdated, in game the action is fast paced and/or intense, what little issues you could point out are usually overlooked), and most importantly when talking about FPS genre games, smooth mechanics. 

However, there are some things one could consider problematic, such as the main campaign‚Äôs length. I finished it in six or seven hours on hardened difficulty. For that alone I‚Äôd probably relegate it to a ‚Äúsales only‚Äù game, although between spec-ops and multiplayer there‚Äôs more fun and time to be had, which brings us to our other issues, the modest grind, and hacking. 

It isn‚Äôt necessary to grind through the main game, however, If you‚Äôre aiming to open up higher ‚Äútier‚Äù ops, you‚Äôll need to do so, at least to a degree, by beating the Ops on higher difficulties (by either slowly playing through the three difficulties separately or by immediately jumping to Veteran) to unlock the next tier of Ops, which is a pain in singleplayer as at least two require multiplayer, and thus limit the stars available overall (note that this does not stop you from progressing). Finally, the other issue, one I never actually encountered due to never utilizing it: Multiplayer. Apparently, the game is full of cheaters, who not only hack the game, but can utilize it as a back door of sorts to hack your own PC. Proper caution recommended.

All in all, I believe this game falls under the ‚ÄúOn Sale‚Äù category, due to its short length and related issues."
5255,"very good,"
5256,how can i make my nat type into open type?
5257,The game is very nostalgic. But the game stutter alot on modern hardware.
5258,.................................
5259,fun to kick ass
5260,This is a good COD game. I don't play COD games but it was still fun.
5261,"It's a solid fps that holds up to this day. The levels are well made and a good length. Only downside is that the game is shorter, around 6-7 hours. Well worth the money if it's on sale because of length, in my opinion."

5271,"When you play campaign it is bust fun adventure, but when you wander your way into the multiplayer on the other hand, there is unrealistic content that really makes you rage. If you rage do not play this game because you can get hurt. The content is so unreal whenever you engage a gunfight in this game within multiplayer and you shoot first, the enemy will usualy respond with hostile activity. As you fire first and the enemy fires next for some reason 99.99% of the time the enemy will kill you even though you shot first. The killstreak rewards are crazy involving kills. I do not reccomend playing this game unless you insist. Thank you for reading this review and I hope to see you on another steam game soon. :)"

5290,"Look, I could write endlessly about how great this game is, but I'll put it simply for you: when it comes to big-budget high quality games, this is Christopher Nolan level shit. More money was invested in making this game than any other in the history of games: ~300 million dollars, adjusted for inflation. Hans Zimmer composed the opening title theme. It's twenty dollars. Just buy it."

5293,"This is one of my absolute favorite FPS games of all time, incredible campaign, coop, and multiplayer, and it is very painful to give it a negative review but this needs to get attention.  DO NOT JOIN A MULTIPLAYER MATCH! There is a SERIOUS UNPATCHED VULNERABILITY that allows anyone in online lobbies to connect and completely take over your computer, steal any data you have on it, install ransomware, or anything they want. I hope this gets attention soon so I can change my review"
5294,B.R.U.H
5295,"Modern Warfare 2 is most definitely one of the top 3 Call of Duty games of all time. The story mode was very enjoyable, the missions were unique and interesting, the characters were likeable and had some great moments. 

The Spec Ops part of the game was really fun to play, I enjoyed going for all 69 stars and got them quite quickly. The gamemode doesn't have much replayability unfortunately. 

The multiplayer although in 2020 has hackers, you can still find clean games that are full, it's not the same as playing it back in 2009/2010 but it's still enjoyable with friends and you can have a decent experience. MW2 multiplayer is a blast when the lobbies are good.

Personally my 3rd favourite Call of Duty, would definitely recommend to people."
5296,Best campaign in the franchise no doubt. It was fun as hell but sometimes emotional (real men cried while playing loose ends} and no russian is what made this game a timeless classic. I'd say more about the campaign but this aint an essay. Multiplayer in this game is timeless and there is a reason people still play it to this day because of how it's both great and fast paced plus the voice chat to me is the best part especially the shit talk everyone would give each other both in game and the lobby almost every time you would join. I recommend it for sure but id rather play console version cause more people play there
5297,Classic legacy FPS game!
5298,Don't play this game if ur expecting multiplayer servers with good ping. Its all mexico or european servers makes game borderline impossible to play 50/50 chance of ur shots just being blanks.
5299,hell yeah brother! Childhood right here!
5300,it good
5301,"This is one of the best 1st person shooters I've ever played. Infinity Ward put a degree of polish on this game that had not been seen prior. It's a shame their company imploded due to the success of this game. The popular 1st person shooters that came after this game felt like an entire step back in video game generations. The single player campaign is compelling and of high quality, but a little short. The Spec Ops game mode really fleshes out the campaign and is fair but challenging. Finally, the multiplayer is VERY balanced. The only problems with this game in a modern setting are that half the multiplayer games you'll play are ruined by cheaters and most multiplayer game modes are unavailable due to the lack of players. Give it a go!"
5302,Campaign of this game is legend and spec ops coop missions are always enjoyable
5303,This game used to be awesome. Now the forced FOV 55 makes it weird to play.

5307,"A fucking classic. Put a whole bunch of hours into MW2 Multiplayer, which i played way back in the days on my friend's xbox. Crazy amounts of nostalgia, and still a remarkably alive playerbase.
Singleplayer campaign is a classic aswell, with amazing(ly shocking) moments like No Russian and Ghost getting murdered.
Good shit. They don't make 'em like this anymore."
5308,very good game
5309,In my opinion this is one of the best if not the best call of duty made. It has a great campaign and the multiplayer is fun as well. I highly recommend this if you are thinking about purchasing this game.
5310,Hands Down Best story and multiplayer. 95/100
5311,Super best game. Old school and cutting edge at the same time.
5312,dont get this game a couple of my friends got there pcs hacked into and its scary dont get this game just get the new cod

5324,Still one of the best!
5325,"Love this game. By far my favorite cod of all time.
But do not get this game if you plan to play multiplayer.
There are hackers in almost every match just ruining the game completely,
and as some other comments reiterate, their not just hacking the game. Somehow Activision's oblivious development
of this game allows other people to backdoor your computer and completely destroy it if they want to.
This kind of oversight fro a AAA developer is crazy. Whats worse is they will NEVER fix this. Once a cod has hits 2-3 years of age, Activision completely checks out and never does anything about any hacking. Ever. They don't care. So hackers have free roam to do WHATEVER they want with absolutely zero implications. 
Activision, pull your head out of your ass, ban some people and fix your anticheat."
5326,"The game that made me fell in-love with the franchise. Yes, this game is an absolute bloody masterpiece back in 2009. If you can't afford the bloody remastered, or your PC is still low, this is RECOMMENDED!

Story is still the best and it experience are intense as to being the greatest COD history back then, in my Xbox 360 day. Gunplay is still great, Spec-Ops is enjoyable and VETERAN is very tough! However, the cons here are the $h!tty multiplayer and it lacks of controller support makes the experience for transition gamers from console to have to endure it with Mouse and Keyboard, but it is easy to learn.

I recommended to buy this game on DISCOUNT (Yes, it's still bloody expensive) for it's single-player campaign along with the first-three, while try your best to avoid it's multiplayer, due to toxic players. Man, what happened to the old multiplayer day, where this $h!t is avoidable? Man, that was a good old day.

9.6/10"
5327,I mostly play the COOP with Friends. Called Special OPs. I would 100% Recommend this for friends to play together. The Single player campaign is awesome as well and I would 100% recommend. The Multiplayer we used to play Private matches Clan members only and that was Hella Fun. The public online MP Has no servers so I have trouble recommending it. It remote host's on a players that it deems the best for it at the time. If that player leaves or starts to lag it will switch to another player mid game or whatever. With that said there is no anti cheat that way and you can figure that out. The game is still Fun but Servers would be a better option.
5328,"I remember playing this on PS3 when it first came out, and it's as amazing now as it was back then. Setting nostalgia aside, it looks and runs pretty well for an 11 year old game. And it's nice to see that there are people still on the multiplayer."
5329,Gotta love this game

Worth the monies."
5343,"This game is still worth the money 10 years later, but know that you'll probably have to invest 500+ hours to get the full experience. The skill ceiling is infinitely high, and all the little bugs and quirks are legitimately good and interesting aspects of the game. That being said, configuring your game to a point that's actually advantageous takes a lot of time and external software. A timeless classic but one that requires a huge amount of commitment."
5344,a LEGEND of a game
5345,"MW2 is a fantastic follow up that doesn't muddle too much with the mixture of success found in the original, but instead just adds some more depth and a much higher level of polish. Whether you're a fan of the original MW or a newcomer to the series, this is easily one of the must-play titles. Honestly, unless you're completely against playing games in which you shoot things, this game's excellent single-player campaign, enjoyable Special Ops mode, and addictive and nearly endless online multiplayer experience should put MW2 at the very top of your ""to buy"" list."

i highly recommend playing spec ops with a friend its something a lot of people overlook with the OG cods these days especially because there are tons of servers / easy access to many good cods for free or just by downloading a special client and most people dont get to experience the greatness of running through the spec ops on veteran its something that's a lot of fun and i 100% recommend buying this game to play with a friend if ur a loner and have 0 friends go play MP and relive the old days and if you've never played MW2 go and play the campaign before u play MP just to understand how great the game was and how the Developers actually weren't straight pussies...if u do want the campaign only experience it has now recently been added to the xboner 1 and the blizzard store !! thats all i got GG"

These maps are still very visible in mind. Smooth running game.  Unfortunately the game removed dedicated server s from the game.  Cheaters became problematic."

I'm never going to waste my money on another COD game again. I was just trying to get back into the game and have some fun. I used to play this game all the time on Xbox360.

Don't waste your time with this game if you are just going to get banned for no good reason. they won't undo faulty VAC bans apparently. was in a game with a hacker or something? I don't know, but I grabbed the short straw on this one I guess."

A cod game like this would never survive todays standards for balance of a game. It was no unbalanced and full of overpowered everything LITERALLY. I hope they remaster this game fully and leave it almost what it was, just better graphics and maybe more content to keep it going."

The single player campaign is great; maybe not from a strictly narrative perspective, but there are a wide variety of locations and unique missions.
The co-op missions are even better. I can confidently say that I've never played a co-op FPS more intense.
Possibly the best part of the game is the difficulty. You are able to choose from a few different difficulties, and let me tell you, Veteran (the hardest option) does NOT pull punches. It's great."

5429,"its has a great campain and is even more fun on pc
"
5430,"So because of quarantine I decided to go back through old co op games that I played as a kid as a nostalgia trip and I have to say this game is still absolutely fantastic. I've been pretty much exclusively playing the spec ops mode with my brother and the game looks really good despite its age, genuinely kind of scary how good it looks compared to even other CoD's of the era. Anyways visuals aside the gameplay is tight as hell and the multitude of co op missions have not left me or my brother bored, big standout has got to be Overwatch, a co op mission where one person is on the ground trying to survive against tons of powerful enemies, while the other is in an AC-130 and raining hell on them, trying to keep their partner alive. Playing the mission either way provides a drastically different experience and was one of the best co op moments I've experienced in a long time. 

TLDR: Spec Ops is fantastic find a friend and play it with them asap"
5431,its fun

5441,It's ok I guess
5442,"I've always followed the Call of Duty canon and despite newer versions following this very successful one, I always drift back to CoD3 and more recently CoD2 - mainly because the online population is dwindling with only a few hundred die-hards playing what was an excellent on-line MP game instead of a few hundred thousand; it is unfortunate that many of those still playing have to resort to the Satan's spawn of wallhacks, aimbots, quickscopes etc.

11 years on CoD2 still has that sparkle that others try to emulate but fail miserably - Post Scriptum for one (...Scrotum more like), which has awful controls and even worse gameplay (respawning right back at the infil site every time you die and then have to wait for a vehicle to reappear before driving countless miles to the front line...blleeeuccchh!).

OK, whinging aside, if I had to compare CoD2 to CoD3, there is not a lot between them but for me the game play seems a lot quicker on 2.  Not too sure whether this is because the maps are smaller or that the games seem to be over quicker.  Weapons loadouts for me are spot on (no SCi-fi weapons here thank you very much!) and are comparible with those found in CoD3 but the navigation for the challenges in 3 are easier to navigate than in 2.  Graphics are similar but now looking a little flaky around the edges when you compare it to CoD's latest offering on Blizzard (which I have since deleted after getting fed up to the back teeth with constant updates everytime I turn it on - don't get me started on the rank progression either).

Good news to hear the rumours that CoD2 is possibly being remastered for delivery on Blizzard.net - If they keep all that's good in it but sharpen up detail and the menus then this will be a winner.  I've got the old version but would happily pay for the new one if it hits the mark, has the server following and does something to prevent all the cheaters from spoiling a great game.

The single player mode still brings a smile, bouncing seemlessly between different environments (freezing snow to middle-Eastern scorched lands) - a good gfx card really shows off the blizzard and sand-blown conditions with excellent sound quality making you feel as though you're right in the thick of it.  It's a bit linear but to be expected from single player and not too bad on length either when you consider this is 11 years old.  For me, it's the MP that has the most appeal though.

All in all, a great game but now unfortunately dogged by hacks on some servers."

5444,"While I personally found the first Modern Warfare to be better in terms of story telling, this game is still pretty damn good. Although I have to say they say Oscar Mike more times than Joe Biden stutters per speech.

Sometimes the shit gets confusing because you're swapping between points of view constantly and it causes you to lose track of what the hell is happening.

Oh and if you want Multiplayer that's actually surprisingly still pretty active."

5452,classic
5453,Beast Call of Duty game I've ever played
5454,"Absolutely fantastic game. One of the if not the best CoD game. its like if cod 4 took a cocaine binge and and fucked world at war and their love child was mw2. Ill split this and multiplayer but basically this version only has 80 percent of the game. Campaign and Spec Ops. Campaign is amazing it follows cod 4's story so good that either A you know the characters and such from cod 4 and understand the little nods to cod 4 or B you haven't played cod 4 but can get the story pretty well (which is something the black ops series did not have) no spoilers but the story the whole time has you on edge. I especially loved all the ranger's missions especially. IMO the best mission in the game is kind of hard to choose but i'll give it to whiskey hotel. now moving onto spec ops. spec ops is what I feel like really introduced the third game mode. cod 4 yes did have arcade mode but nobody played that and world at war had zombies which was gonna be rally hard to top but the mad lads at infinity ward  did it and BOOM spec ops emerged. This is a huge improvement  compared to arcade mode imo. it isn't just a bland copy and paste version of the campaign with co op no, hell no its way different. let me explain, so there are tons of missions. these range from holding out, training etc you can select switch your weapons and what not but you don't have a full sandbox like in multiplayer. there is a three star difficulty system. 1 star = easy. 2 stars = medium. 3 stars = hard. you can select which one and what not.  its pretty simple once you get the hand of it. now to overall gameplay. okay so i'll admit as a console player the controls are so weird and wonky at first but you will get use't to them. like c for crouching and ctrl for going prone? wouldn't it be more simpler if you could press ctrl or c once to crouch and then again to prone? regardless. its a amazing game and I give it a 9.6/10"
5455,"great game, always"
5456,Possibly the greatest COD of all time.
5457,"awesome!!
"
5458,nice
5459,"ghost dies, doctor said i have clinical depression. idk who to trust anymore."
5460,"This is the good ol cod we talking about. The campaign looks solid enough, gameplay and shooting mechanic i give it a 8/10. Spec ops also delivers a special and unique experience but the maps were mostly reuse from the campaign. Multiplayer is a shocker, kill streaks system made the game more entertaining and playable, you can have a fun time playing the multiplayer. Remember, no russian."
5461,its pretty good
5462,I can recommend this game to people who have interest in going through the campaign and people who already have someone that they can play Spec Ops with (assuming you both have a decent connection). Anyone that just wants this for the multiplayer might be better off not getting this and just getting the newest CoD instead.

5469,"The Modern Warfare series is one of my favorite series within the Call Of Duty franchise, and the second Modern Warfare is possibly my favorite out of all. I highly recommend this game and the other Modern Warfare games."
5470,"Great cod multiplayer 
"
5471,Very good game! Only downside is spec ops is not cross platform.
5472," I really enjoy the campaigns ""Of Their Own Accord"" and ""Whiskey Hotel"". Reminded me of the movie ""Red Dawn"". The Spec.OPs missions are excellent! Haven't beat ""Terminal"" yet, and haven't played the 2 player missions either but any game that makes me go-off on a tirade of profanity indicates that I'm in good company."

5477,This gae is fun I recommend it for other players
5478,I like this game because the controls are a lot better than the other ways to get it. I have a X-box 360 and i have MW3 on it but it took me a while to figure out the controls.
5479,A very good game
5480,Probably the most remembered campaign out of all CoDs. Multiplayer was also fun considering the game's age.
5481,"good game,nostalgic 8-}"
5482,"Remember




No Russian."
5483,"Multiple game-breaking bugs. 

First was in Wolverines! mission, in which I got stuck on the Predator Drone screen at the end of the mission and every single key command besides movement did nothing and I had to restart the mission, which wasted time. 

Second was in Exodus, in which my gun would fire one bullet, then switch to Stryker laser guidance automatically so you can't fire your gun, then one bullet, then laser guidance. Switching guns, throwing grenades, reloading checkpoints, and restarting the mission did not work. 

Googling these glitches provided me with hits from up to five years ago, so I have no hope in them being patched. Hopefully they don't happen to you!"
5484,Didn't play this when it first came out but I have always heard that this was the best COD game to ever come out qnd after playing it I definitly see why. If only I played it back during its realease I would have spent hours on this game alone. Mind you I have not played many Cod games except for this one and MW3. There always seemed to be this stigma surrounding COD that caused me to actively avoid it. But i see now that it is alot of fun and Im glad to have experienced this great shooter that alot of people have said is their favorite. Even just for the story I say give it a try because it keeps you hooked.

From CoD 4 to MW3, all of the call of duty games were doing great with there campaigns and had fun multiplayer modes that usually added something extra. Modern Warfare 2 has the single player campaign, multiplayer, and spec ops. While multiplayer is probably either dead or filled with cheaters, the other two modes are worth your money. MW2's campaign is amazing. It's full of memorable characters (Rameriez, Soap, Ghost, Price, Makarov, Foley, Roach), has amazing settings (South America, The Gulag, D.C., Russia) and makes you feel like a real soldier, unlike future iterations that make you the super soldier. Take my word, this game is worth it."

Multiplayer is quite pretty. Perks, classes and so on are offer you many ways to spent time there with pleasure. There are still players online. I think this fact is the best prof of my words.

For the appropriate review I should say some negative about the game. But honestly I don't know what to say. I am playing this game a lot of time so my eyes got blurred to see any minuses. But I guess they are. This way I can just recommend you to read other reviews for your objective vision."

5559,"Campaign is still as easy and fun as ever. Special Ops Missions is part of the reason I came back to this game in 2020, 11 years since it came out.

I started with this game about a decade ago, one of the many COD games I played in the series dating back to the original Call of Duty 1. This game is still loads of fun and excitement for any new player, especially with the crisp sounds, and beautiful array of guns and cosmetics. But since 2009, there have also come many games which have done each element COD made popular, but better. This was a good adrenaline rush to revisit, but with everything else I'm about to write, it's hard to continue.

The reason multiplayer was fun in 2009 was because people didn't know anything about the game - what guns were overpowered, what spots were able to be exploited with Scavenger combined with a shotgun and Claymores and easy killstreak combinations.

11 years later, and the more things change in the COD series, the more these exploits in the games they left behind stay the same. People using grenade launcher noob tubes to secure easy killstreaks in 2-3 kills with Hardline, people hiding with the Commando Perk in a stairwell or Claymores so you can't get to the high ground where their teammates are shooting you as you turn a corner, players using shotguns at medium range but still securing kills over anyone who uses a different weapon, machine gunners with the FMJ Perk shooting through half the map and with stopping power using only 2-3 bullets into a foray of new players to get Harriers and Pave Lows to dominate us. All while you aren't at the level to unlock the tools practically REQUIRED to stop them - no Stinger Missiles, no Hacker Perk, and no teammates who WON'T immediately charge into them. 

This is ALL before even mentioning the modded lobbies that force you to play a map different than the one you thought you'd be getting, with guns that you didn't WANT to use. And I even spotted someone using a toggle aimbot in a match. As if enough people didn't already hack their way into getting all the titles, emblems, ranks, and achievements through modded lobbies over the years.

In the decade since I've found a half dozen more games with more strategy in the abilities you use and the decisions to move you make, and with more interesting weapons than these spray and pray toys that ruin your ability to play a real FPS later on. The ACR baffles me as much as the Commando in Black Ops does, they're hurt to die to and are self-indulging to win with. 

157 hours later and I'm moving out. The original game reviewers on X-Play said, ""You come for the campaign, stay for the multiplayer."" If I started with this many hacks in 2020 and modded lobbies and prestige players killing me from across Wasteland and dying to helicopters I can't destroy, I would never have stayed."
5560,Very lighthearted campaign :) Nobody important dies :)))
5561,"this game so much fun
"
5562,"An epic shooter, Call of Duty 4 on drugs. Breathtaking campaign (even if quite linear), captivating Spec Ops, fantastic music. Multiplayer: over the top... Highly enjoyable if you win (aircraft killstreaks!), pretty annoying if you lose (easily-accessible grenade launchers). Hardware specs: not too demanding, wooden-PC-friendly. Can definitely recommend!"

5578,"I started Multiplayer and had a lot of fun like in the time as it was released. But after a few matches I had a lot of matches with hackers, which is a problem I knew I had to expect. But the quantity of hackers was really high and the biggest problem were lobbies with hackers in which you weren't able to open the game menu to leave the game. Even closing the game with task-Manager wasn't able. So I had fun until Rank 19 where I was thrown into a lobby with a hacker which I was not able to leave and after shutting down my PC I was level 70 and had everything unlocked. So the last bit of fun with the game unlocking all that stuff, that I had on the console had been taken.

5632,"[Extreme Cyber Security Risks]

I love the game itself and I've spent hundreds of hours playing online. However, multiplayer is a mess. With the way servers work, it is not worth the risk.  Hackers are everywhere, and they are not just trying to cheat the game. There have been many reports (and it has happened to me as well) of hackers RATting players. By doing this, they have complete remote control of the user's computer. I discovered this when I joined a lobby only to have my game suddenly minimized, an internet browser opened, and someone on the other end started searching images online from my computer. If the hacker wished, they could break the computer. It's an absolute mess. If you search ""MW2 hacker controlling computer"", you can see more people talking about this problem. Even if this game is old, it is no excuse for such critical vulnerabilities to exist without giving players a massive red alert button informing them of the inherent risks. 

If, however, you just care about the campaign, that is fun."

5659,Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is probably one of the best campaigns that I have ever played and if you haven't I feel very bad for you. The gameplay itself is enough to make it a great game but is as well is funny and has a great story line that makes you care about the characters and want to play more modern warfare and more games for it.

5662,CALL OF DUTY MODERN WARFARE 2 IS AWSOME! FOR 20$ GO FOR IT
5663,this game makes me think back on how good call of duty was and then ill go play one of the new ones and realize its dog shit
5664,9/10.
5665,Ben bu oyunu 2 kez bitirdim bence herkezin oynamasƒ± gereken bir oyun a≈üƒ±rƒ± iyi bence zaten en iyi cod serisi modern warfare ve en iyi oyunu.Tavsiyem ilk oyunu oynayƒ±p alƒ±n.
5666,S.S.D.D.
5667,"Having played through the campaign many times for MW2 in the past. I decided for another go to see how it holds up. The levels, which there are a decent amount. Are short usually and sometimes really simple overall with map designs. the game is essentially, get from point A to point B. and your going to be patiently taking out guys as they spawn all around the directions your usually heading towards. Windows, doors, alleys, enemies can be anywhere. In previous infinity award games usually the enemies would have one or two spawn points and would continue to re spawn until you pushed foward a little bit. While I don't dislike this method it does feel a little simple. This is the first Call of Duty to alter away from the  previous formula. The new trick is to just spawn a LOT of enemies and you'll have to take care of them. This in trade creates a more aggressive enemy type who is usually trying to close in on you. I much prefer the design behind the way enemies are handled in this game. I think overall it's an improvement.
The story is a simple blockbuster action hollywood military story. it's full of movie references and is very unrealistic, but I do think for how silly it is. Holds up well still today as a entertaining action piece. The characters grab hold of you real quick which is neat. The game has a pretty star studded cast, which really helps. And you just can't replace the old original non remastered  captiain Price,(looking at you MW2019). If your not too harsh on stories or enjoy blockbuster films. play this. 

  The music is amazing, i'm a pretty picky critic when it comes to video game soundtraacks and I think MW2 excells at it's musical performance. I played hundreds of games and I can easily say that MW2 is easily high up there with some of the greats, which is very surprising being from a Call of Duty title, at least for me. The graphics are a little dated but I still think it looks gorgeous, a lot of the the enviromental set pieces are really a work of art and are still amazing today to look at when traversing through some of the main story missions.

Does MW2 hold, yes. this is the last COD title designed by the original team before they disbanded, and we've had a lot of COD's release since then. looking back and having this 5-6 hour experience with this game showed me just how good talent is when you have a talent filled team. I'm not sure if COD has progressed since this title.

i could have written much much more. I easily recommend this game, go PLAY IT!"

5677,"Game is a classic. Every now and then I install it and play for a few weeks.
It would be great if there were more intense or realistic FPS for MAC on Steam in place of more blocky/zombie shooters.
"
5678,"classic!!
can't wait for remastered for pc version"
5679,Best FPS game ever made anyone who thinks otherwise is just wrong
5680,Excellent cgi can't fault anything
5681,Spec ops on veteran is hard as balls but so satisfying when you finish it and of course the campaign is always great.
5682,"Game was legendary, I have to say at first it seemed hard but it got to the point where you start doing challgenges like ""if i die i restart the game"" or ""stealth"" throughout the game, honestly its super fun and the story makes sense"
5683,yes.
5684,Remember...No Russian
5685,"Wow.
"
5686,replayed campaign cause of mw2 remastered announced
5687,"Everybody knows that this game is amazing but I have to tell you again that this game is amazing. Well made campaign with great character and story development. Very lively community for such an old game, have met some lovely people in the multiplayer aspect of this game. Love the weapons and mechanics of this game. Do recommend! :)"
5688,hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
5689,"single player portion is very good. Fast paced and intense, slow and stealth, loud and explosive."
5690,One of my favourite call of duty games
5691,good
5692,Co-op play
5693,Love 100/10
5694,It reminds me of all the time i spent in this game
5695,old but gold
5696,It's okay in all regards.
5697,este un fel de dracu satana
5698,good game would buy again
5699,"Logged way to many hours on this back in the day, plying the new MW currently and missing this game a lot.    if your wondering if you should buy it.. yes."
5700,Best COD before the era of Titanfall (in which the main Infinity Ward team changes their teams to after Vince Zampella and Jason West have been out of Activision)
5701,If you are triggered go and play cod mw2 play the no russian and just push the trigger
5702,"not the best COD game
"
5703,"amazing. its brings back so many memories. on pc it has so many opportunities. such as modding.(i don't condone modding in multiplayer, you may get banned).

9/10
graphics are good but not shocking.
gameplay is a 10
 overall great game"
5704,ssssss
5705,"nics
"
5706,Classic Great game!
5707,"the game dosent hasent ran right
"
5708,"Hey, it's ""Call of Duty,"" a Classic Episode like the rest!  SGT T"
5709,game plot is mediocre but i like the aesthetic and visual tone of this game
5710,Literally a classic. COD doesn't get better than this.
5711,good
5712,"great campaign
"
5713,its a game to be honest
5714,Good story .Good gameplay . Good and sad Music. Shoot everyone
5715,The campaign
5716,classic
5717,nah get WaW
5718,Played This when I was a child its still good to this day
5719,"I bought this game to play the campaign. It's awesome, a lot of action. Gameplay is great too."
5720,"Probally the best MW game, this is so fun and for low end pc's, it plays so well on it even on max graphics"
5721,Goodgame
5722,"This games a childhood favorite, but man they've changes, i thinks its a new CEO or something but COD multiplayer and COD in general has gotten progressively worse, however this game is a masterpiece."
5723,Great campaign beat it on veteran difficulty
5724,got level 70 from a hacked lobby and made my friend babyrage 10/10
5725,"the graphics still look good, the game is still good, the story is amazing; nothing else to really say"
5726,GUn shoot
5727,yes
5728,definetly the best game i played
5729,"There's plenty to do, whether is be play through the campaign on a difficulty of your choosing or completing every Spec Ops mission with 3 stars. By the end of it you'll surely end up trying to obtain all 50 of this games achievements like I did. It has plenty of replayability, the only bad thing is that the campaign and Spec Ops mission progress only saves locally, so if you uninstall and reinstall you will lose your progress in both."
5730,"Much better than the so called ""Remaster"" which completely ruined the game's visuals and doesn't even include a Spec Ops campaign let alone a multiplayer mode."
5731,9/10 2 Wars I think probably
5732,"Fun, classic game."
5733,This game will never get old. The story line is amazing
5734,"Buy this instead of the remaster. They're the same price, but this one actually gives you MP and spec ops."
5735,"Reviewing this after playing through the remaster on PS4. It might be just because of nostalgia, but this game still holds its own after 10 and a half years and is still one of the best games in the franchise - up there with (in my opinion) World at War and Black Ops 2. There are still a good amount of people in online lobbies, but you're probably out of luck if you want to play something besides the most popular gamemodes (TDM, Dom, S&D, FFA). And, if you didn't know, the remaster is only the campaign, so if you want to relive the One Man Army noobtubers, Intervention quickscopers, silenced UMP45s, and akimbo Model 1887s, get this one.

If you've never played MW2 - or any Call of Duty - at all, I would still definitely recommend this game. The campaign is fun, spectacular, and memorable, and it started the trend of badass campaigns in Call of Duty: big explosions, a Russian invasion of Washington, D.C., and [spoiler]one of the playable characters pulling a knife out of his own chest and killing someone by throwing it in his eye[/spoiler]. A great game and I highly recommend it."
5736,"super good
"
5737,I LOVE THIS GAME
5738,only for nostalgia
5739,Get after it.
5740,Remember. No russian
5741,buy it

5745,Personally my favorite out of the MW games. MP is still pretty active and its still very fun.
5746,"yes

5747,great game COD at its best
5748,One of the Best Games That Call of Duty has produced.

5757,"Love this game, played the hell out of multiplayer, 500+ hours. 
BUT
Why the fuck do I have to pay for a remastered version when I've owned this game for almost 10 years? 
Not cool activision. 
Suck it. 
"
5758,Very good game. Would reccommend.
5759,very good
5760,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is your quintessential FPS game. It has everything: fun game play, an over-the-top story, great characters, and it's fun and satisfying to shoot people. I played this on PC with a shitty monitor and I still had fun. If anyone wants to get into FPS games, I'd recommend this game as a first."
5761,"Fun, cinematic, and a great story for the campaign.

In the campaign, you just have to understand that you can't kill all the bad guys they are infinite. You have to keep moving."
5762,ok
5763,sdfg
5764,Remastered should be on steam!!
5765,"Total points:+30(single mod),+30(multi),+20 (weapons),+20 (personal experience)= max100

5771,great game first call of duty I bought for my PC it was amazing I loved it way better than other call of duties as in call of duty black ops 3.
5772,"Many, many years on and still my favourite game. Played this on the XBox 360 and came here and although MP was dead, its still amazing. Preordered the remaster for PC and im excited to hop in :)"
5773,shoot guns
5774,"I played Call of Duty MW2 for more than 1000 hours and here is what I thought of it:

Greatest multiplayer game of its time. I loved the maps and the tempo of the game (weapons balance, Normal & hardcore mode, ...)


+++ Excellent progression design (badge, perks, accessories, painting,...)
++ Good gun balance
+ Good scenario with content and game design different than in multiplayer


-- Some accessories are abused (grenade launchers mainly)
-- Amount of hacker and lack of response from Activision about it
- Solo duration (<6hours in normal)

Rate : 18/20
"
5775,it very good the campaign is on point

Additional note: Remember! No Russian."

Bad propaganda.
"
5802,How can i play co op in spec ops??
5803,DO NOT buy if you're interested in Multiplayer. I've tried everything. Just can't invite friends to a private match even with an open NAT type. Waste of good money.

5861,Good
5862,Good game play and graphics
5863,like every cod game this one stands out .For an example one of the missions  there is an invasion  of America . but i do not recommend playing this game on a mac because the audio cuts out and the characters repeat what they're saying so i recommend playing on windows 10
5864,"Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is one of the most popular games in the Call Of Duty franchise. I am one the biggest fan of this and other Call Of Duty games. But every game has it's flwas including Call of Duty such as: When the missiles blew up the sattelite, it came crashing down right at the exact spot where Ramirez was and so they were lucky. Also, how did Price even get in prison. But those are the little questions that no on really pays attention to. The thing that caught my attentio was how the enemy who remains the enemy ""Makarov"" helps out Price even though they want to strangle eachother. Also it was unique on how the main hero kills the main villain, with a throwing knife, now you dont see that in any other game. Also you had no suspicion that Shephard would betray you until he does."
5865,damn
5866,for 20 dollars not bad  story is good single player is great
5867,"Futuristic and full of action, reminds me of the movie Red Dawn."

5888,"MW2 is one of the most beloved FPS games of the last 20 years and will go down as one of the best games in the Call of Duty franchise. Excellent multiplayer, legendary campaign, and an engaging solo or co-op spec ops missions that I will never forget. Truly one of the greats when it comes to shooters and never a bad choice for anyone who enjoys the genre."
5889,"I love MW2, it has a great campaign, spec ops, and multiplayer. which unfortunately stopped working a year or two ago. I have soaked so much time in this. I also have a version on the Xbox360 which added up time whise is {37 + 45 + >100 = >182} probably more then 180 hours. Ive always loved Halo more then CoD but i do like CoD. CoD and Halo i like to play for diffrent reasons. Does Halo have a Zombies or Spec ops mode???? No. Does CoD have lore that im invested in???? No. Does CoD give me the same nostalgia as Halo???? No. Does Halo allow me to have dumb fun in multiplayer with bots (because im sad and lonely)???? No."
5890,nice
5891,"A COD Classic. had this for xbox back in the day and i'm excited to have it on pc again. would recommend.

Spec Ops is so so so SO good. It really is the best thing about the game in my opinion and so much fun to play.

5919,"The healthy human mind doesn't wake up in the morning thinking this is it's last day on Earth. But I think that's a luxury, not a curse. To know you're close to the end is a kind of freedom. Good time to take... inventory. Outgunned. Outnumbered. Out of our minds on a suicide mission, but the sands and rocks here stained with thousands of years of warfare... they will remember us for this. Because out of all our vast array of nightmares, this is the one we choose for ourselves. We go forward like a breath exhaled from the Earth. With vigor in our hearts and one goal in sight: We will kill him."

5943,good game
5944,Great game.
5945,"Even better than Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the story is super silly with the inciting incident being kinda silly with a massive plothole. The gameplay feels even faster and more fluid with excellent use of scripted set pieces with some levels being more open ended that makes you use the full sandbox in the levels, very similar to Black Ops 2. I could see myself returning to this campaign again for a veteran playthrough with it's emaculate pacing. The special ops bonus mode is great and the online is dead but occasionally fun with awful spawns and broken balancing of weapons and gear. This game is excellent and worth the price for sure depending on what you get out of it."

5947,just nice.
5948,"I miss my family, I miss my friends, I miss my life. I have 4,090 hours on this game's multiplayer. Where did all that time go, when did it all go wrong. To be honest, I wouldn't have it any other way."

It should not cost that much to be honest.
Overall Recommendable"
5975,:D
5976,The story for modern warfare two is like no other. It is packed full of action and truly allows you to meet the characters i cannot recommend this game anymore especially if you're a fan of the call of duty series
5977,best Tom Clancy's games ever and i enjoy them all.
5978,Get er done
5979,great story and action!
5980,I really enjoyed replaying this after so many years
5981,"If you're coming to play the single player or spec ops then definitely worth the buy as both hold up fantastically even still. If you're coming for the multiplayer then DO NOT PURCHASE, the game mode has always been incredibly unbalanced however the amount of hacked lobbies is nuts, occasionally you find some the give you every challenge in the game as well as lvl 70 which fucks you over if you were trying to do those for fun (as has happened to me) and good luck trying to leave these lobbies as they're the strongest connection so you'll always join that same lobby over and over and over again until the person running it logs off."
5982,"I mean its mw2, what else do you need to know about it?"
5983,"***This review got censored when I tried to mention a certain dedicated multiplayer client. I have revised my review so that hopefully when you read this, you'll understand what I'm trying to tell you.***

Modern Warfare 2- the pinnacle of the series, at least in my opinion. ""Muh balance peepeepoopoo"" shut up loser no one cares. Back in the day you could snipe dudes with akimbo 1887 Winchesters. You still kinda can. Come on, what more could you want from a game?

One thing- if you're trying to play this game's dedicated multiplayer, don't. The default multiplayer experience is pure cancer- and not the kind of cancer you get nostalgic for, thinking of playing this game on your old console before you upgraded to PC. No, no, the kind of cancer that sends you directly into hacked lobbies, some of which could even remotely install malware on your PC.

But never fear, Google is your friend. Look up (Eye Double U Four Ecks), READ THE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY, and once you have it installed, never look back. You want more maps and game modes? Dedicated servers? Bots? Zombies? More guns? More loadouts? Don't wanna farm to get back up to Prestige, or get back all your old emblems, ranks, dog tags etc.? (Eye Double U Four Ecks) has got you covered. Seriously. Don't try to play the default multiplayer. Please."
5984,exciting game can't stop
5985,"I've played enough of each section of the game like spec ops sp and mp. All of them are amazing but have minor and major flaws, 1st flaw is that in the sp it is fucking terrible and amazing there is to much action and it just feels the same after awhile unlike cod waw cod 4 etc those games had just enough action not to much not to little and they had amazing story's. I feel like the devs focused more on making the player badass rather than focusing more on the story, but the story was good and had very memorable moments in them for example, thats one less loose end (no spoilers). The spec ops is amazing in everyway, but the lag is terrible. The MP is the greatest of all time exept One man army noob tube spam."
5986,By far the best COD before 2019!

5999,"It's a really good game but the multiplayer has a lot of hackers/modders. and hackers/modders can do something to your mw2 account, steam account, and even your computer. so just be aware when you come across hacker/Modders. but in general it's a good game both multiplayer and campaign."
6000,"A really good game, with an interesting storyline."
6001,good game

6004,very good
6005,"A very interesting game with overall simple mechanics, dispute being extremely old and its graphics being outcompeted by the newer games, how has this jewel remained intact after the years that have passed and how has it remain known as call of duty's golden age?MW2 is an awfully simple shooter. You pick a loadout, go out in a small or medium sized map, the only exception being wasteland and find enemies to shoot. It seems like an extremely simple game that can get boring very quickly. But thing is, it still remains playable after a decade. This is because of the lack of complexity that we get with the newer games. There aren't 100 buttons that do 200 different things. Just point your mouse and shoot. The killstreaks which you get by killing people without dying are all perfectly balanced (with the exception of the sentry gun being underpowered and the chopper gunner and AC130 being overpowered). This is all compensated by the fact that the sentry  gun is easy to get and the other 2 require real skill or hardcore camping to obtain. When it comes to the guns, there is none that is worse than the other. Each gun has something that the next one doesn't. On bigger maps you may want to take one with better accuracy, but will you sacrifice damage for it? There are guns specialized in short quarters combat and in long quarters combat. Of course you can always just take a pistol and shoot everything that moves. That won't work on big maps but on condensed  ones like rust you may actually get a kill or 2. The perfection of this game is not determined only by skill, but also by weapon choice and the killstreaks you take with you, this way, even new players that take a shotgun in a small map may beat some veteran players with snipers or LMGs. It's the diversity of every map that makes this game good. No map is ever the same and everything you find won't ever be the same with the last map you played. I'm gonna conclude this interview by saying that this is my favorite call of duty, by far"
6006,"Can't believe this game was released ten years ago. It's aged pretty well. Can't speak for multiplayer since I never use it, but single player is every bit as good as I remembered it to be.

---------------------------------





She‚Äôs so sad she could do anything, for nothing, for everything.
She weeps softly as she dances around with the fools.
Love has killed the words that move her, move her.
Against your mouth, she wants to be laid out.

She‚Äôs so sad she pulls a face in front of her mirror.
She embraces the passing shadow with a love at first sight
And nothing will ever wipe the cowardly smudges
Of the blood flowing from bodies that break apart.

So long Tristana, your heart caught a cold.
So long Tristana, God is giving up.
Let her go, let her die.
Don‚Äôt say it. Tristana, it‚Äôs me!

Sad fate, Tristana.
You know, believe me,
It goes by in a flash, your life, just like that.
The most beautiful days end up in sorrow, hatred.
Why do you have to pay with your veins?

6017,Yes
6018,Great Game
6019,i dont need to describe whats great about this product
6020,It's ok
6021,"Amazing, Legendary Game! Forever Fan! <3"
6022,Simply yes. This game has the best story mode of all COD-s. I mean BACK TO BACK TO BACK missions
6023,"Tl;dr: Probably the best Call of Duty game and single-player campaign in my opinion, but the unplayable multiplayer filled with hackers makes the $22 CAD price tag not worth it. Also note my review will only show my single-player hours, but I have over 40 hours on multiplayer that it doesn't take into account.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was the last Call of Duty game I played a for a significant amount of time back when it originally released, and it stands as my absolute favourite of the entire series. The sequel to the equally incredible Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the story picks up five years after the last game left off, and the campaign delivers an amazingly atmospheric and dramatic experience that is unmatched by many other Call of Duty games.

The music is another area where this game shines. I can never get over just how [i]amazing[/i] the scores in MW2 are, especially given how they span different genres and seem to suit each faction and environment so well. They truly serve to immerse you in the experience and add a significant amount of intensity and drama to every mission.

Of course, the game runs beautifully, and the visuals still hold up even to this day. Given that this is an eleven year-old game, it is astounding how good it still looks and sounds, and it plays just as smoothly as you'd expect from a current-generation shooter.

Unfortunately, with the current PC release, there are two significant flaws.

First, the multiplayer is borderline unplayable these days due to hackers and aimbots. These can range from something as simple as a barely-noticeable aimbot, to things as obvious as somebody running around full-auto shooting an L86 and hitting everybody across the entire map. Malicious attacks can happen, too. It didn't take long for my rank to be modified by another player, maxing my account out at level 70 and unlocking everything, which can really ruin your fun if you enjoy the progression as I do. 

I've also (rarely) seen even more malicious attacks, such as affecting players' internet connections and pushing malicious packets to clients connected to the match. There are also rumours of some players exploiting the game to install malware on other players' systems. Laggy hosts are almost always an issue, and you have to be extremely lucky to find a quality match with no hackers or lag. Despite this, I can't blame Infinity Ward or Activision in the slightest. This [i]is[/i] an eleven year-old game, and support has long-since passed. There aren't many other games of this age that don't suffer from some sort of hacking or exploits.

The second issue is the price, which is a significant issue. How does Activision justify charging $22 CAD for an eleven year-old game in which a good portion of the game, the multiplayer, is unplayable? This goes not just for Modern Warfare 2, but most of the older Call of Duty games on Steam which all have an atrocious asking price.

Actually, if this game was $10 or less on Steam, I'd probably change this to a positive review simply for the campaign and Special Ops missions. But at the price they're asking, it just isn't worth it, even taking into account the amazing experience this game provides."
6024,"WARNING: Word has spread that this game's multiplayer has big hacking problem. And no, I'm not just talking about losers using things like wall hacks and aimbot, but people actually using lobbies to install malware on your PC. I found this out on this game's community thread title ""RCE Exploits are Back."" It's your final decision, but you're taking a risk if you decide to play on multiplayer.

Okay, since that's out of the way, this game does have great singleplayer. The campaign is great fun. Nothing much to say about an old school CoD game, since just about everyone knows what to expect from CoD, but it's definitely a lot better than what Activision puts out now. Shoot your gun, throw grenades, what more could you ask for? 

As for my brief experience with multiplayer, it would be great if it wasn't filled with hackers and pathetic losers who own modded lobbies. I've seen people using aimbot, wallhacks, or both, and no action is taken against them. Then you've got pathetic, sore losers who have modded lobbies and design them so that everyone has the same gun except them. A lot of lobby owners rig their mod so only they get to pick their own weapons and builds. If you think that wasn't bad enough, then get this; they also hijack online traffic so that anyone in matchmaking ends up stuck in their garbage lobby. 

Get this game for singleplayer. Multiplayer is unsafe, and it's also garbage. If it wasn't filled with pathetic hackers then it'd be great."

6033,"Without a doubt, the best COD game that has come out, and likely ever will. I will say though that this far into the future, the game may have stability issues on your PC. I got crashes like crazy on this one. Aside from that though, this game for its action, story, and even its multiplayer make it a rare 10/10."
6034,One of my most favorite games ever!

6050,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is a classic Call of Duty from the PS 3/XBOX 360 era. I personally just bought this for the nostalgia but the game still holds up. Not to say this game isn't dated in some aspects. This games single player campaign and special ops have a ton of content to give. The biggest problem with this game is the price. 40‚Ç¨ for a game this old is outrageous. Only buy it on sale and even then it's still 20‚Ç¨ which should be the normal price for this game on steam. 

This game has an iconic campaign which everyone should play through at least once. You already most likely know what COD games are like. This is in the top 5 COD games of all time for sure. This game is also really fun for achievement hunters. The achievements are perfect in their difficulty IMO. 

I haven't even try the online but I'm 90% sure that if you were to try it there wouldn't be many players and the few players would be using hacks.

Good
+Iconic campaign
+Fun and challenging achievements
+Side missions(special ops)

Bad
-Gets boring before long
-Price is too high

7.5/10

ONLY BUY WHEN IT'S ON SALE"
6051,classic
6052,"The best call of duty to ever come out imo. It's still almost as fun as it was back when it came out, theres not as many people still playing unfortunately but you can still easily find lobbies in the more popular game modes. 

Yes there are a few hackers and cheaters here and there but its really not as bad as all the negative reviews make it out to be, what can you expect form a game that came out 11 years ago? Still better than any modern Call of Duty game by far. No rigged lootbox mechanics, no grimy money grubbing by devs, no lame neon splatterpaint weapons and floss dancing, just a good solid shooter that knows what it is and fills the role well."
6053,ITS SO fun Not very happy about that whole genaral sheppard killing ghost AND roach but its ok it was a good game anyway
6054,its cool

6078,Excellent story. Well balanced difficulty. Great production.
6079,"Fun game, lots of nostalgia at play with this one. Unfortunately the DLC is a waste of money as so few people also own, so on the rare occasion you get into a dlc map, it'll be a 1v1-3v3 at best. 

Also the servers are a lawless wasteland of hacking. It's not uncommon to have game after game in different lobbies become unplayable due to people hacking with aim bots or worse. Activion and steam have apparently given up on any resemblence of punishment for cheaters. 

I'd recommend it, but only if the customer is aware that this will often be a frustrating experience."
6080,"This game is one of the best games i have played EVER! To keep it short i would just like to point out two things:
1.This game deserves to be in the ""Hall of Games""
2.This game single-handedly made a sub-genre of videos by the name of ""MLG Montage"" that inspired a ton of people (myself included) to try and replacate the cool tricks they made.

6092,"This Game is amazing, one of Call Of Duty best games ever. For 20 Euros is completely worth buying for the Campain and Spec Ops. the multiplayer is very active and alive, and i havent found any (bad) hacker. mostly they just make u max level and give you everything in multiplayer and it is very hard to find one of these...

The campain:
New and awesome missions to play through...  The campain follows the story of COD 4 (Modern warfare) and it has to be one of the best if not the best together with cod 4 campain...
Good character development, fun and in some cases original missions to play... you know the drill... After completing the campain you get the museum, where u can find any gun from MW2 and some guns from COD 4 MW and you can see a small representation of each mission of the story, with the addition that by pressing a red button the npc from the museum will turn hostile and attack you (a lot of fun)

The singleplayer (SPEC OPS):
This are small and nice missions to play, most maps are taken from the campain but this time u have different objetives like surviving waves of enemies, eliminating all enemies, rescue prisioners... etc

Multiplyer:
Alive and Fun"
6093,better then the new one

Everytime it just feels like it is the first time you are actually playing the game. Sad but great ending too. 10/10 would defo replay and beat the game for the 7th time in the future."

100% recommended."
6180,Great game.
6181,"yeet
"
6182,"it's so goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
"
6183,"If your thinking about buying this for the Multiplayer, you will have some lobbies but not a lot. It is still worth the money"
6184,Still holds true to original CoD concepts
6185,"Possibly the best campaign in the Modern Warfare trilogy. Add on top of that the innovative Spec Ops mode, and you end up with a must have for military shooter fans."
6186,"[b]To begin with, in Modern Warfare 2 shows the war by the ground forces. It is always nice to look in a shooter exactly at warfare through the eyes of an ordinary soldier who uses his powers to survive. Nevertheless, the player himself must control this character.
The second is very interesting and exciting tasks. Each mission in MW2 is an action - an action and only that is pleasant to watch from the side and in fact the tasks are not repeated throughout the entire two-hour campaign.
The third point is a clear division into parties. In the Modern Warfare 2 campaign, it‚Äôs immediately clear when the task begins on one side, and when on the other. That is, for example, if the American campaign consists entirely of battlefields and a ""meat grinder"", then in the British campaign it is stealth in the main advantage.
Fourth are catchy characters. Well, there‚Äôs nothing to paint. For example: Soap is a person who returns to us from MW1, the main character of whom we learn that he became a captain and now commands the new main character of the game MW2. Captain Price is a separate topic. After being released from the Gulag, he begins to dictate his own rules. General Shepherd - appears only in this Call of Duty, but is so remembered for his betrayal that we cannot forget this to this day. And even Ghost is a character who actually did not reveal himself to the players and does not represent anything other than the most ordinary military, but damn how cool he looks on the battlefield, and how he tragically dies. And remember the American campaign. What is remembered by James Ramirez, and the fact that he pronounces his surname about eighty times over the entire storyline of Sergeant Foley. Yes, and Sergeant Foley and Corporal Dunn are remembered by the fact that these are the only two Americans whose surnames are pronounced constantly throughout the game. And despite the fact that Vladimir Makarov is not, as such, the main villain of MW2, in any case, thanks to one mission alone, he becomes our number one enemy before we learn that Shepherd is the main traitor in this game.
The fifth is a vivid picture. In Modern Warfare 2, brightness and contrast is the first thing that attracts from the very first seconds of the game. We always see a vivid picture, even when battles take place in the evening, we see a stunning sunset that illuminates this battlefield.
Sixth is the soundtrack. The soundtrack in MW2 is the best in the entire CoD series. The music is very tangible. She is crushing, heavy, sometimes creepy.
Seventh is the storyline. The story in the game, frankly, is primitive - it did not shine in the last part, but there will still be interesting and unexpected turns. And they, of course, will play a role. This part is insanely dynamic.
Eighth - special operations. Their essence is as follows. A section from the campaign is taken, for example, a submarine base. The player is put on a high point, he must withstand several waves of opponents. Or we appear on a snowmobile, you need to temporarily drive the track and not die. Or we break through to the signal fire, and the partner is sitting on the AC-130 airplane, looking at the thermal imager, shooting enemies. These are small such tests on a different topic.[/b]"
6187,"Compared to other games with Direct X 9,, it outshines them. The textures and art detail are top-notch.  The graphics overall are amazing. The campaign is also fun,  I don't play the multiplayer that much. But if you enjoyed MW1 this will satisfy your gameplay."
6188,its fun

AAAAND yes it is, Modern Warfare 2 is still my top favorite COD game and one of my top favorite shooter games ever.

6243,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. The multiplayer used to be fantastic but, considering it is a 10 year old game, it's not so great anymore. You can't blame the game for that, though. The campaign is solid and the side missions offer a decent challenge and will keep you entertained for quite a while. I still boot this up now and then."

6319,"STILL A FPS MASTERPIECE.

10 years later. If not everybody liked the story (set years after the first MW and slightly unrelated to its events), many of the missions of the main campaign are some of the best of all time for the FPS genre: the Battle of Washington, the rescue mission in an eastern Siberia gulag, the mission in Rio's favela, etc. And of course the ""No Russian"" controversy, and one of the most genuinely shocking (and saddest) twist betrayals in the history of gaming. Once you've finished the cinematic campaign, very nice and addictive spec ops solo missions are waiting for you. The game still looks gorgeous and the new engine really brought COD into the next decade.

For many, the 2000's were the pinnacle of gaming, and 2009 ended that golden decade with this big-roaring lion of a FPS. Easily COD's apex. Only complain? As always, the continuous re-spawning of enemies and their lethal accuracy, and the slightly dumb AI of your companions (pretty much useless if you do not advance to the next checkpoint and even messing with your line of fire, friendly fire indeed).

9/10."

6340,I have never really been a massive CoD fan but I learned to like it a while ago because my son used to play it so much that I picked it up so we could play at the same time. I do really enjoy this simple style of controls for the key-board and mouse. The graphics are really good but the music and some sound issues have made me turn the music off. I would highly recommend Metallica for music in many levels just gets my old blood pumping again. I really have not played a ton since my son has grown up and is now a father to a 2 year old. I do not like the pvp it moves to fast for me at least at times and a lot of the people are assholes who camp then complain when you call them on it. However The game is solid specially the story. I also enjoyed playing the Mission in Act 2 I believe it was that had the whole world in a Spaz because you walk through an airport with some friends and you hurt some peoples feelings while on your romp through the airport. I must say that the acts 2 and 3 are the ones I enjoy playing the most. There tough on Vet but worth it. True to form the people whom did the research on the weapons and also tactics were true to form and amazing with what they came up with. The AI seems to be fast accurate and just as you would think a military and rebels would act with tactics. Over all I would give this one and CoD Modern Warfare 4 a score of 8.9 over all. Just the music were the downfalls. Even the bugs when it fist came out were minor to me not to many crashes and its been a rush to find those tangos and dispatch them. Also in conclusion I am happy to say that the DLC for this is not over the top were your forced to choose to buy items left and right like a lot of other games. Low Micro-transactions are always welcome.

[h1]Game Comparisons:[/h1]
This game was genre-defining. The only comparison that I can't make it to Halo, and that only applies to the multiplayer. The single-player campaign has no comparison. Modern Warfare 2, for the first time ever, included a warning about violent content with the option to skip a level because of it. That's how ahead of it's time this game was. Of course, there are MANY games out now that are like this one, but this one definitely set the trend towards those gritty, fast-paced FPS games.

[h1]Review:[/h1]
I still remember the first time I played this game with my friends on the Xbox 360 and the feeling I got getting owned on multiplayer all the time. I still remember the first time playing the campaign and playing through the ‚ÄúNo Russian‚Äù mission, and how blown away I was that something like that would be included in a video game. A mission like that, especially with all the things going on in the world at that time, was WAY ahead of its time. It was revolutionary.

The campaign was something that defined the game for me. Being able to play through missions as different characters had me highly invested in the story, such as Captain Price and John ‚ÄúSoap‚Äù MacTavish. Captain Price is still a character being included in Call of Duty games even to this day. Playing through missions set in South America, Russia, the Middle East, and suburban America, the developers had you running missions all over the world.

The multiplayer was a game-changer. The fast-paced action, the Map Pack DLC that were released every few months and just the grind to get to level 10 Prestige. Many an hour were played with the homies online and it‚Äôs fun that I had that I‚Äôll never forget. Yes, there were cheaters, as in all games, but it wasn‚Äôt bad enough where it‚Äôd keep you away from playing.

This is definitely a game to have in your library if you‚Äôre a fan of any Call of Duty game or just a casual gamer. This is the type of game that can define a decade and is a must-have.

This is officially a game that I've completed to 100% on Xbox and PC.

Either way, i still recommend ya try the best cod there was..."
6379,"This game has been pretty weird since I have done around 3 - 4 sessions of its campaign. The game can get bland at some times, and the multiplayer is really nice. If there was one thing I could change, maybe make the game have more areas instead of being really black, it makes it look gross. I liked it, good shooter for a cheap price! :)"
6380,Not as fun as the XBOX 360 days. Multiplayer on here is kinda garbage. Only had fun when playing with a friend.

6392,Don't play any cod game. developers of this game are a bunch of morons allowing tons of hacks. multiplayer is unplayable and no one ever gets banned for using cheats/hacks. Fuck you thousand times sons of whores should've requested instant refund years ago. Since my experience with mw 2 and the never ending cheaters i haven't bought any other cod game ever. Best decision of my life. Cod is like that toxic person in your life that you should remove it entirely. Low iq stupid developers deserves to be shit on.

6444,its a great game even years after it came out
6445,"A big nostalgia trip for me, I really enjoyed it when it came out and I was a rage filled teenager and I still enjoy it now as a rage filled adult. The story is...well it's a call of duty story but I loved playing it on veteran. I don't know if the multiplayer is good, it's certainly fun and definitely not very balanced but this game is just a good time which is something I cannot say about newer Call of Duty games I played since this one. This was the last CoD game I truly just had fun with."
6446,"You can't go wrong with this game, in respect to its campaign.

The multiplayer USED to be great. It was the best CoD multiplayer in my opinion. 
Right now the multiplayer is hot garbage. Finding a match is an absolutely horrendous process, and when you do eventually get in, the lobby consists of mainly hackers. Spinbotters aimbotters, etc. 

Trying to set up a private lobby to play with friends is near impossible. You physically can't stay in a lobby for more than five seconds without the game kicking you. 

And the price at which this game is sold (usually) is basically robbery. How can Activision charge ¬£19.99 for an eleven year old game? I feel like they are losing a significant amount of money as you can easily buy this from a key reselling site for less than ¬£5.  

In summary:

Multiplayer is basically nonexistent.
Great campaign and singleplayer modes.
Overpriced. 

Only buy on sale. I know I'm being a little too harsh on a decade old game but it has the same price of some games at launch. If it were cheaper I'd be a little more lax with it.

(I just played this for the campaign btw)

Edit: Ok not gonna lie I actually tried the multiplayer and its still great, when the first time you boot up to multi you might go with a 0 kills and 22 deaths but that's okay, cause its still fun. And yes the player base is definitely small as hell but you can still join a lobby and get to play with other people. As far as I know when writing this I haven't found a hacker yet but just becareful when playing. Cause the majority of the players are actually good at playing this. And this game has a great story, great graphics if we're still in 2009, and a great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.

6463,"Despite it has been 10 years, this remains my second best CoD series I've ever played. Sure, for some people MW2 may have been the series when CoD started to get into mainstream, with its No Russian stage being the most controversial of all, but it was this game that had eventually put me into the CoD franchise, despite of not being the first one I played.

It's pretty much surprising yet satisfying that the multiplayer is still active until now days despite the newer MW2019 has come out, maybe because people still can't forget the good ol days of CoD multiplaying or nostalgia reason. Anyway, while as much as I enjoy the new MW2019, it still can't beat this one."

6469,"When I think of Call of Duty games this is usually one of the first ones to come to mind. The Modern Warfare series is, in my opinion the Golden saga of the Call of Duty franchise, the levels and story are memorable, the characters are full of personality and the gameplay is a ton of fun. It‚Äôs before the series got bogged down with weird plots in the future, and super technology that is confusing and when every level featured a ‚Äúsuper weapon‚Äù that you use once and then never use again.
My biggest complaint with this game is the infamous ‚ÄúNo Russian‚Äù level, while several people get into different arguments over whether it should be allowed or not, I personally don‚Äôt see a point in it. It feels very out of place and that it‚Äôs in the game for the sole purpose of ‚Äúbeing shocking.‚Äù
Along with the campaign Modern Warfare 2 features ‚ÄúSpecial Ops‚Äù missions which involve completing specific objectives on certain maps like fighting off waves of enemies or finding a special item. It‚Äôs a fun game mode but is a lot more fun to do with a co-op partner.
Overall Modern Warefare 2 is one of my favorite Call of Duty games. It feels like a classic Call of Duty game before it the campaign fell to the wayside, which I understand the multiplayer is a huge part of the game, but there is an audience that likes to play the campaigns as well and I wish more games put more of a focus on it.

6479,"I went into this as an old vet from the PS3 era thinking it would be the same thing as on console.
Dead MP, hacked lobbies, cheaters, etc. rendering the SP as the only usable part.
But I was pleasantly surprised when I joined a server (which *was* modded, mind you) and it was just about exactly like I remembered it! Lively servers (with chat!) that I had a good connection to and a playerbase that had me grinning with nostalgia as I was noobtubed several times. lol
I don't recommend this as highly for someone who's never played CoD before for obvious reasons, but for anyone looking to get a fun blast from the past this is definitely a treat!"

Multiplayer, even after a full decade, is still alive and strong. It just goes to show how much love people have for this game, even when the reboot entry to this series is out.

Just one thing: you should get this game at a cheaper price. Either wait for a sale or buy a cheaper game key from online sellers (cdkeys, humblebundle, g2a offer better prices sometimes) because $16 for a game this aged is not very good."

This game is a classic call of duty game that always provides. No matter what, this game has always stayed in my mind when someone has mentioned call of duty. I first played this game when it was most popular on the xbox. This game deserves all the praise it gets, much due to all three game modes.
The Multiplayer has always been a fun, action packed part of all the call of duty games, more so to this one. the days of quickscoping and trash talking is especially what gave this game such fame and recognition.
The campaign is wonderful, the story mainly revolving around Roach, a member of the 141 Task Force, and RAMIREZ, a United States Ranger. The whole story will show you the horror of war and just how much destruction it can cause.
Spec Ops is a beautiful game mode to do with your friends, it has time trials, survival and missions that make you feel unstoppable."

6573,"HONEST REVIEW
We all like the steam platform, so why is the new Modern Warfare on Blizzard?
I think i know why. Cause of money and reviews doesn't cope with eachother!
Short ago New MW came out, but it is already farming on microtransaction?! look for yourself
I think it has to do with blizzard being a platform where the community can't review games,
Which means noone can complain about it. 
Which leads me to the next: DLC's, Packs etc.
I think New MW will be PACKED with this BS. they already added ingame valuta?! 
It's not f****** Fortnite. This is not the Call of Duty we would like! 
Where is the competition from back in the day with Battlefield and CoD?"
6574,"Easy to Play with a mouse, the other Modern Warfare games are no good with a mouse."

Campaign is awesome, Spec Ops missions are really good and the multiplayer has lots of bullshit in it, but damn is it so good. 

If you want to play the MP, I recommend to install the I W 4 X mod. More servers, options and no more lag or hackers."

6583,"I personally did not grow up with the CoD series, or any major series in that matter. 
Yet when I played CoD WW2, albeit on PS4, I didn't experience quite the enjoyment nor enthusiasm that MW2 brought me. 
The setting in many levels, especially those located on US soil, are stunning is a graphic and beautiful way. 
The different levels all play differently, with one focusing more on vehicles, where as the other requires for you to be stealthy instead and this makes for a diverse experiennce.
Despite its relatively old age, MW2 tops the charts and wipes the ground with the newer games in the CoD series."
6584,"When CoD was at it's peak, arguably the best CoD ever made.

As the game stands currently I haven't encountered any hackers, though the noobtubing is quite real in this game. Beware of the tubers."

6616,crappy map and checkpoint save design fps games arent hard for me but i have been playing this same checkpoint 50th time and still couldnt pass because shitty save point got me cornered between ton of enemies and that part of map just sucks spawning random enemies everywhere.

6626,"This game still shits all over Modern Warfare 2019.
Sure, there isn't RTX like MW2019 (ooooooOOOooh)
Sure, there isn't Warzone like MW2019 (COD Battle Royale? Seriously?)
But is it nearly 200 GB in size like MW2019?
Does it run like shit like MW2019?
Does it false ban people like MW2019?
Does it have the world's dumbest monkeys writing the code like MW2019?
Does it have shit gameplay like MW2019?
Does it have microtransactions and battle passes like MW2019, needing you to pay for content instead of playing the game?

One answer to all of these questions:
No."

6657,"MW2 is an enjoyable fast-paced shooter filled to the brim with action. Three years ago I would have probably given this game an 8/10, but now MW2 is on its way out -- a dwindling playerbase, server issues, and many hackers make it difficult to have a good time sometimes."
6658,its an amazing game 12/5 it has a amazing story and shows what CoD should be
6659,"you really don't need a good computer, i played this on a 1.1 ghz, 8 gigs of ram macbook and it was flawless on max resolution"

6669,Its a pretty good game
6670,classic call of duty.
6671,Blimmin' LOVE it!
6672,brings back fun time of playing that and you can tell how much better the newer games are in comparison

6680,GAME IS GOOD
6681,"its godly
"
6682,"This is probably my favorite Call of Duty game out of the PS3/XBOX 360 era of CODs.

The game is just a blast to play through even to this day.
 (while I have 4-5 hrs on the main game I have over 1000 hrs on the multiplayer portion)

The Campaign is a bit over the top but has it's great moments, Multiplayer is an unbalanced but enjoyable mess with just the right amount of chaos, Special Ops is a great PvE experience especially with a friend. 

I'd say it's worth the purchase but the game isn't everyone's cup of tea."
6683,Sick
6684,Very G00D

6697,Still the best Campaign storyline of all the call of dutys
6698,"BEST COD ever made!  10 years later, this is STILL one of the BEST MP experiences.  It's all about nostalgia with COD, for me.  MW19 is a great game from what I have seen, but the OG MW2 is what made the MP experience online today."

6703,"Good story, from back when CoD was good and not some random gun and run multiplayer based game like in later editions (*cough cough* Infinite Warfare & WW2).

Just avoid multiplayer because of two main reasons
1- It's dead
2- The very few players you might find, are all cheating.

6714,This is an alltime favorite of mine. Played it first on a different platform. Nowadays it's a well aged classic with one of the best storys avaiable on the whole Market.
6715,good game
6716,This game  is broken. My 1070 cant run this unless I use vsync. I have never seen screen tearing in my life until I booted this remastered pos up. Stay away from this game. The others cods are fine.  So much for this game's story line ;(
6717,got called the nword in multiplayer overall enjoyable experience
6718,Campaign is still fun
6719,A classic Call of Duty game during the best years of the franchise. All three parts of the game serve the player with great content and plenty of replayability.

6740,Very Good
6741,No Russian
6742,best story ever
6743,"very cool wepons and maps
"
6744,"Single-player - The best in the series. A non-stop thrill ride from start to finish with back to back memorable highlights. Realism is thrown out the window for a more james-bond-esc action style, but felt well-paced enough that I could suspend my disbelief for a ultra fun COD campaign. I love the radio chatter during fights too. 9/10

Multiplayer - Some of the best and most memorable maps in the series, but the balancing is wonky and the exploit-heavy weapon upgrade system makes for some pretty chaotic (in a not-so-good way) type gameplay. Still, the maps and modes make up for most of the annoyances. 7/10"
6745,First game that ever blew me away and I still love it so much

6758,"Good old game. A player base that hates everyone, even themselves. Strap on your earmuffs, load your noobtubes, and pull out a silenced ARC and get ready rumble with people that don't care if you die the next day.
Better yet, get a friend or two (or five) and actually work together."

6774,yes
6775,"Extremely fun, a must have old classic. It may run on even slower pcs!"
6776,One of the media's least-favourite games of all time... which makes it arguably one of the best games of its time. Enough said.
6777,classic game for me.
6778,gr8 game
6779,Very good game! Really reccomend it you're looking for a 1st person shooter with a very good story and soundtrack!
6780,This game is amazing the game play seems realistic and it continues the story after you get lifted away.
6781,This one is still enjoyable even when it is near the dead game today...
6782,i am a call of duty guy i get in depth in cods so this game is awesome everyone have a good time playing it
6783,"Its a great game, there are some things about it that are not good, though.  8.35/10.00
Once thing I don't like about it in full screen maxed out settings the gameplay does not look amazing. And if you have played the new Call of Duty Modern Warfare, It's a much slower game."
6784,This is hands down the best CoD ever made but pick it up on sales if you want to play the campaign only and some Spec-Ops missions because nowadays the multiplayer really sucks.
6785,This game is KING of all games
6786,"After first modern warfare i didn't saw this coming but boi has i shocked 
Good singleplayer with unique mechanics and some controversyas well 
Spec ops was very interesting gamemode 
Multiplayer is sometimes fun but you will see alot guys with grenadelaunchers (noobtubers)
and a lot of claymores (gamores)"

6795,it is soo cool and fun
6796,what do you mean i dont pay my bills what do you think im broke huh but theres a new way ill be the first in line but it better work this time peace sells but whos buyin
6797,"I really enjoyed this game when it first came out. It was a lot of fun, but I started to miss it recently. I came back to it and it really aged well imo. Just a fun well built FPS (plus playing Spec Ops with a friend is still amazing and you can have some funny antics haha)"
6798,"Have you ever felt it?
The immaculate feeling when you take sprinting perks, silent foot-steps, dual-wielding double barrel sawed-off shotguns sprinting with the bomb to the drop-off sight.

Deliver that package and finish the match so quick."

"
6827,"Good game. Fun to play. It is perhaps lacking in role play and story line, which will make it soon fall into to the genera of arcade games. More successful games have a in depth story line to it like half life or assasin's greed. Never the less a fun game if you want to shoot some baddies before going to bed."
6828,Good stuff

6831,OMG SO GOOOOOD EVEN THOUGH I PLAYED IT 7 FAKING YEARS AGO..........

6839,"The multiplayer of the game is really enjoyable and really nice. I wouldn't recommend the campaign though. Not because the story isn't great, but the gameplay and level design is just nuts. For ex. in Mission 2 [spoiler] the game doesn't show you that you can detonate the C4 with 'F' [/spoiler] and I died so many times because the game just fucks with you. Really frustrating. Still, it's a great game, but if you want to keep your cool, play the multiplayer."
6840,"Great game,Great price, and noob tubing is still a thing after all these years."

The graphics are a little dated by now but are still solid and the gameplay is nice and simple.  The story is cool and the previous characters tie-in nicely.  No real complaints.  Recommended."

Don't get me wrong I like music, I am a professional musician in fact,  but I am also ex military and so I don't like it when I am game-playing a 'serious looking situation' ( ie a war situation) . I love the graphics and the storylines are imaginatively engaging whilst very clever in places. A totally creative approach to breaking a new angle on 'mise en scene' Play it and see for yourself though, don't just take my word for it. I played this on a MacBook Pro with only the keyboard and a bluetooth mouse at every level. My favourite? That Flavella is a dangerous place amigo."

6878,"I cannot stress this enough. This is an entry level CoD game that could ease curious players into the franchise, but even then! I cannot express how great this game was and still is to this day. A relatively active player base exists and I still like to play with my friends on co-op, so there's really no downside to owning this great entry into a monster of a franchise. 

It's pretty well optimized for PC, with a few crashes here and there, but not enough to bat an eye toward. The graphics still hold up for a game from 2009. I still remember playing it back then and being called several names that I cannot repeat in this review... good memories! Even with that being said, going into this game now it feels like an untouched world, still occupied by the things that made it how it was ten years prior.

Get this game :)"

6888,Absolute classic from the golden age of Call of Duty
6889,VERY FUN SPEC OPS IS THE BEST PLAY WITH A FRIEND RECOMMENDED
6890,I re-bought this game on PC just for the Spec Ops. It is still super fun and worth your money. The story is amazing and it is still really enjoyable after already knowing all the twists. The spec ops mode is very addictive and helps create one of the greatest Call of duty games of all time!
6891,"Overall great game, Idk really what to put lol."
6892,10/10 game. Nothing more to say.
6893,It was a great experience and i now want to die. ( But i already did )

6909,";
"
6910,"MP first, well the game could be one of the best Call of dutys in MP but i dislike the maps from theire art style most of them are just ugly, the game is full of cheaters and Pro Players. But still you can have fun with it and work to become better but this will be a rough progress.

The SP is not as good as the first part of the Trilogy but its a good expierence, good that MW3 cames out and ended the story because this one ends with an cliffhanger and an unfinished story. The Graphics aged well i would say better then most games who were released back then. Dont ask me why, but cod4 aged better (dont talking about the remaster)! 
The SpecOps mission are nice to play but to play them all, you need a buddy to enjoy them. Some of them are coop only and this is bad because the older the games get the less players are playing this game on coop. coop is nearly dead. And the game is Reduced at max 50%. So its hard to tell steam friends to buy this old game and play it nowdays xD."

6939,"Best. Game. Ever.
This is The Dark Knight of video games. The campaign and multiplayer build off the original to perfection, the characters, graphics, voice acting, and weapon sounds are all amazing, and there is an iconic score done by the one and only Hans Zimmer. Everything in this game makes you feel like a god amongst mere mortals whether it's the guns, kill streaks, or the power fantasy that are the PvE modes. You're life is incomplete without this game. Happy 10th birthday MW2, we love you."
6940,Excellent campaign
6941,I've never played a game that makes me hate myself so much.
6942,"Hands down one of my personal favourite stories, everything about this franchise is amazing. About the 7th or 8th time i played through the campaign."
6943,"Good campaign, great multiplayer - wasted many good hours on this."
6944,"Spec Ops is far greater on the older games (CoD4:MW, MW2 & MW3) than the new CoD:MW."
6945,yes
6946,"This game is perfect, no really Im not joking for me it is better than others Call Of Duty games. ( CoDmodern warfare is also good) Company took from me only 8 hours, but it was perfect i was crying like a kid then Shepherd killed Ghost. What about multiplayer? Its also very good i played like 10 hours and it was very fun, where is one minus what CoD MW have low online and everyone are playing team death match. So if you have friend buy it try not to cry and just enjoy best Call of Duty ever.=)

Glory days of Call Of Duty"
6993,Modern Warfare 2 is legit the best Call of Duty game ive ever played and is most peoples favourite game aswell. I highly recommend buying this game. No Russiaaaaaaaa
6994,love mowing down innocents at a russian ariport 10/10 would play again
6995,aaaaaa
6996,"MW2 is one of the better Call of Duty games. The campaign is great with lots of memorable moments (No Russian, one certain level that involves collecting data on a computer) and Spec Ops is a lot of fun with a friend.

Multiplayer is hit or miss depending on the lobby you are in. You could end up having a great experience or a negative one (usually involving hacked and/or modded lobbies and the infamous MW2 noobtubing). Overall I really enjoy the multiplayer. This game has probably the best maps in a Call of Duty game, ever.

Overall highly recommended."
6997,"First of all, I'd like to say this is my first COD game I've ever played. I'm not familiar with any of the COD games, but I've been told this is one of the best out of all of them. 

As someone however, who's been playing FPS games for over a decade, this is actually a pretty decent game to play. Perhaps even more fun if you have friends to play along in Multiplayer. MW2 is pretty much what you'd expect a FPS to be. More kills you get, you rank up, unlock new weapons, etc. Gameplay is solid and very fast-paced, the soundtrack is outstanding, and performance on this game is great. Although I still prefer Battlefield over COD, this is not a bad alternative at all. 

To sum it all up, If you're a big fan of FPS's, then this might be a game for you to grab. :)"
6998,best cod.
6999,all it has are bruh moments
7000,"Remember, no Russian."
7001,Great story and gameplay
7002,"i mean, yeah its pretty good."
7003,"This is actually a fun game that people are still playing online today (at least the popular gametypes) and there's really nothing wrong with it. The only real problem is the MAP PACKS. It's $30 for them normally. Today they went on sale, for how much? $20! Still a huge ripoff for EIGHT maps, less than the amount that comes with the actual game. The game itself is with no maps is normally $20 ($15 on sale right now, WHAT A STEAL) so this price value for the map packs is as awful now as it was in 2010. For this reason I can't recommend it because you'll pay $50 for the complete game package, only to be playing non-DLC maps online with the people who didn't bother to pay for them. It's really sad that even on sale, this game's price points are a big ripoff. This game should be $15 for the complete package at all times, it came out in 2009, and the map packs were NEVER worth $30! NEVER."
7004,"Great game ;)

7007,"his game is godly and amazing, you really should buy it. It sould be a million dollars it's so good
"
7008,Shooting people is fun but barely anyone plays this these days.
7009,"this is by far one of the best story games i've ever played. (the game didn't take me 16 hours to beat so don't let that fool you. i played this freshman year on veteran difficulty and i got my ass beat. i would say this took me 6-10 hours to finish. keep in mind that i didn't attempt to get any extras or intel, so if you plan on doing that it'll probably take twice the amount of time). [b] i cannot emphasize this enough, but you SHOULD PLAY MW1 TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE STORY![/b] this game is a direct sequel to the first one, so i highly advise beating that one first before you move onto this one. i didn't understand anything freshman year my first playthrough, (kinda a spoiler ahead, skip it if you want) [spoiler]and i got to the plot twist and ruined it for myself years later[/spoiler]. 

heard that multiplayer was bad, but if you're buying this for multiplayer you need help.

[h1]tl;dr[/h1]

10/10 one of the best stories i've ever played. play mw1 first (not the new one, the original one)"
7010,i cried
7011,This is a great COD game for those who don't have enough money to buy the latest in the series and cant run the new ones
7012,gg

7022,after 10 years still better then other fps games
7023,"Good game, lots of action and nicely variable missions."
7024,The #1 game ever made
7025,Fuck
7026,"In my opinion, this game should still be $60. The campaign is a well written masterpiece, even to this day. The characters and plot are incredible. The game has so many details that are easy to overlook, and enhance the story to an incredible degree. The music, voice acting, and sound design are all amazing. The graphics still hold up even to this day, including some imagery that has stuck with me for years. I have played through the campaign hundreds of time, and I have hundreds of hours on the multiplayer (mainly on xbox). If you want an incredible game that you can get for a great price, buy this game. It's worth every cent and more."
7027,MMmhmm
7028,"Absolutely brilliant! An amazing, unbelievably immersive experience and story. It has addictive gameplay and a well designed multiplayer. This game may be slightly old but it is gold."
7029,"its very good
"
7030,yes very game yes?
7031,Its a great game one of the best call of dutys of all time.
7032,One of the great call of duty games.
7033,"Hell yeah, of course i recommend this legend of a game. My and many others damn childhoods right here."
7034,finished main story in 4 hours but still shit tons more to do!! It's hella fun and brings back memories of when i was 7 and played a free version off a usb!!
7035,Really boring compared to other shooter games...
7036,"Absolutely the most refined arcade Call of Duty experience there is. It's not nearly as grounded as CoD 4, in fact I'd argue several mechanics such as dual-wielding and the tactical nuke are very much jumping the shark. But holy shit, is it a fun ride. The multiplay isn't nearly as polished as BO2, but the sheer insanity of MW2 makes it hilariously fun."
7037,It won't recognize my controller. No options to chose controller in settings.
7038,k
7039,retards on every servers and chetares and kibbsen cant play sniper
7040,"great twist, big fan of COD already, a little bit short but a must buy"
7041,"The language of the German and I am unable to change it to English from the 'Options' menu, although the I downloaded the game with English language, can someone help please?"
7042,"""For the record"".

One of the best CoD campaigns"
7043,it's mw2
7044,This Game Is VERY FUN And I Would Highly Recommend This To Other Call Of Duty Fans
7045,"Story is good, multiplayer is just full of modders but there ARE some games that are normal.  8/10 would play again"
7046,"Modern Warfare 2 changed the Call of Duty world and many people into becoming something greater as a gamer.
Variety in weapons,perks and killstreaks to match your liking meaning there's a place for all.
Definitely the greatest Call of Duty of all time so i recommend this game for everyone but especially Call of Duty fans."
7047,Best Cod
7048,Accurate portrayal of equipment and environment.  Game interface was appreciated and enjoyable
7049,"weird game, you launch it and you have fun for a few hours
usually when you launch a game its a complete dog shit torturous experience that assaults your mind to manipulate you into buying microtransactions
made in the days when you trusted skilled level designers to deliver you a good experience instead of a bunch of dipshits that put 5 minutes of travel between each piece of content and then it turns out they reused the same content x500 times for these areas because they have to fill up their ""vast open world"""
7050,.
7051,did campaign on veteran. was fun. fuck the favela mission
7052,Good memories and good times and still replay some missions more
7053,"not as good as MW 2019 in terms of graphics, but better in every other fucking way. Only problem is the jumping mechanics make me want to have kids just so i could get drunk and beat them."
7054,"like a lots
"
7055,very good yes
7056,yea
7057,"I played this game, still looks good in 2020"
7058,i don't see any reason why you shouldn't play this game if you haven't already
7059,Hist√≥ria muito boa.
7060,THE best COD ever made!
7061,"good game, get it retard"
7062,RAMIREZ!
7063,Easily the most solid entry in the MW series
7064,ok
7065,Very good fun time. Classic game and has a pretty decent campaign. Lots of fun trickshotting!
7066,Fun times!!
7067,nice story
7068,"Campaign is good, multiplayer kinda dead"
7069,Good story
7070,This game atleast imo. Is a fucking masterpiece its so fucking cool to me that you go on ''Specialist missions'' to for example extract some hostages on an oil rig.  Stealth missions like (the oil rig) are fucking amazing. And back in the day when the game came out i think we can all agree that THAT was the day we all became fans of this franchise
7071,I'm apparently living in the futur. Well it was a way better game than Modern warfare 1 (2019).
7072,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 offers an amazing online and single player experience. As far as single player is concerned, the plot of the storyline is really interesting and intense that keeps you attached till the end. It's not all about killing enemies in a battlefield like many other ordinary first person games. 

The storyline is structured in such way, that brings an abundance of emotions and suspense. In addition, the missions that are involved in the Spec Ops game mode are really enjoyfull and challenging. The huge variety of well built maps and different tasks included in the missions followed by rewards make the particular game mode extremely amusing. When it comes to multiplayer, words are not enough to express the greatness of this game. Personally, I believe that Modern Warfare 2 offers the best online experience in the ""Call of Duty"" franchise. 

There is not a single Call of Duty game so far that can be compared to MW2 when it comes to online experience. By the huge number of extraordinary challenges, game modes, titles, emblems, killstreaks, perks, attachments, camos, pretty exquisite maps and guns, this section of the game is extremely addictive and absolutely close to perfection. The only problem is the small amount of cheaters that sometimes ruin the online experience. But not that big of a deal. 

For me, definetely a ""must play"" for fps gamers. It's a 9.9 out of 10 by me."
7073,Its fun
7074,I like the campaign a lot. multiplayer is fun as well but there is always something to complain about with everything
7075,This was the first COD game i ever owned and im glad to have it again. But the noobtubers are just cunts man and they've kinda ruined the game. Overall its still a good game tho.
7076,"It's Modern Warfare 2, this game in of itself speaks to how good it is. I recommend it to anyone, and everyone. Just stay away from online unless you're ready for REALLY toxic people"
7077,"good shooter a lil heavy on the red scare bull ish tho....
viva la revolucion"
7078,Great story
7079,Trash game worst game ever played
7080,if you're masochist
7081,"Nostalgia from Xbox days. 
Typical online.
I think it's the most good looking game out of the trilogy. 
OP yet fun killstreaks. 
Small but active population (Dedigamer)
Might have annoying NAT issues which magically fix and I dunno how no matter what I tried. 

7/10

would give 8 if the full bar matches I had were honestly on point hit reg for me, instead of a lag. I know because I feel the difference in the few moments during the day I play I get good reg."
7082,it's fun. What's else to say about it.
7083,its the origanal COD and i think one of the better ones
7084,Tango sucka
7085,gdgd
7086,"this game made me remember the golden era of cod.

7087,horny nibba laundry basket
7088,Still the best CoD game to date. Modern Warfare (2019) is a close 2nd but too short of a campaign.
7089,Gud
7090,This game on veteran is one of the most fun challenges ive had in a while and recommend it to anyone looking to enjoy themselves and get a splash of nostalgia.
7091,K
7092,buy it
7093,"Classic game, COD at it's finest!"

7095,Best missions and special ops. Guns are super.
7096,all of it
7097,"The most epic, hearth broke, game ever made 
good storyline"
7098,Great Game
7099,"Don't buy this game if you're strictly playing multiplayer, do yourself a favor and just don't. You'll enjoy yourself with playing a few vanilla matches then you start playing against those who enjoy cheating in this game, a game a few years old at that. Then you have those who go the extra mile and they make an attempt at hijacking your browser. I don't understand what's up with this game but it attracts weird individuals who find enjoyment in causing havoc on the internet, for no reason except to power trip."
7100,"We are talking about a good old Call of Duty and nothing can go wrong with it.It's the sequel of Modern Warfare(COD4).This is one of the best video games series in my opinion.The story line,the characters and the gameplay are just perfect.It's is worth every cent of your money.You won't regret it."
7101,"This is like the Call of Duty 2 of the Modern Warfare's.   Oh wait.. It is Modern Warfare 2.  

So yah anyways.   MW2 was a lot like CoD2 in a way.   It took a good formula - refined it - aged it - made it sweet and sublime all at once.     But it was fun.   10 years ago.    It kinda still holds up.  But Nostalgia trips are still hella fun sometimes.  Until you realise it's not as cool as you remembered.   =\"
7102,Really great game. In my opinion this is the saddest and the most thrilling game among COD series
7103,Legendary
7104,still good after all these years
7105,"Its good
"
7106,"Just a pure classic Cod. Possibly the best MW of the three orginals. The spec-ops is challenging, but made easier with a friend, making teamwork a boon and an enjoyable factor of the game. The multiplayer may be sparse, but with a devoted few, with hardly any hackers/modders, at least few that I have experienced. Overall, i enjoyed the game, and hop on time from time to live out the good old days."
7107,"The best Call of Duty
"
7108,A bit overpriced if you just want the campaign but worth it
7109,although full with hacked lobbies its still fun to play
7110,"A masterpiece of a game. One of the Best Call of Duty Titles and sequels ever made. Amazing story, amazing characters, amazing multiplayer... Everything is made in the best way possible. This is what I call a gem of the golden era of video games. Back then, when games were made right and with passion. Not with the only purpose to grab people's money."
7111,"Addictive gameplay and I highly recommend the game... but -- oh boy -- aren't those juggernaughts the very definition of bullet sponge. Even a T1000 robot would be slowed down more, when eating a Barrett round in the face..."
7112,s o a p
7113,yes
7114,still better than ghost

[h1] Best Call of Duty [/h1] 

I know that i have got an Multiplayer Ban in this Game, 
[strike] but dont worry was not rly my fault [/strike] and i just have to share this awesome Game with all of you.

First i wan to praise the Single Player Campaign, just like any older Call of Dutys this  has such an thrilling, loving and schocking campaign.

+ Multiplayer ( Dont know if there are still enough players )
+ Weapon System, much better than in the newer Games

"
7117,"Still one of the best games ever made, very smooth gameplay"
7118,Good ol COD
7119,best game ever
7120,This game is just... the best i cant say much more
7121,"For it's age, this game hold up very well. Be warned that some people have problems with the game on steam. The only problem is that the average player count is less than 1,000. If you like the game, and have friends to play it with, it's worth it. Otherwise, I wouldn't put money into it unless it's on sale."
7122,"420/10 would play agen


but MW 2019 took it's place and has all the good stuff and nerfed bad stuff.



Liek if u cri everytiem"
7123,dreadful
7124,"Tis good, sp not as good as first, but spec ops is great and the mp was fun at the time. I have no idea why I am writing this review in 2019 but I am currently waiting for my friend to download it so we can play the spec ops and steam asked me to write a review."
7125,Lol XD
7126,xD
7127,the truck is coming
7128,One of the best CoD ever with best soundtracks and the best composer
7129,yos
7130,I can't wait until Modern Warfare 3
7131,Best graphics!
7132,Game isnt too bad hackers have gone down on multiplayer resently so over all glad i can come back to an old game i had played long ago.
7133,I would recommend this game when you want to just play alone without anyone else hassling you or griefing you this also has  multiplayer if you feel like pvp.
7134,"I really like this game. I think that as a CoD game it aged really well and it is faster than MW1. While MW1 was great too, I feel that this one while the already mentioned faster paced combat also provided a bigger variety of weapons as opposed to first one. It also introduces the breach mechanic, which is a good change of pace when used.

I do think that without the first one trying out something new, this one would not be as good as it is. The story gets carried on and it develops very well.

I haven't really played any CoD games after the MW series, so I cannot compare with the newest ones, but I will definitely revisit the MW again.

I do not play MP so what I wrote only goes for SP, which as any CoD game is not really all that long(about 6 hours), but the game also has an arcade play mode that could extend your game play, I found it fun. 

So in the end I do recommend this game, still today."
7135,Explosions and goodness. That's all I'll say.
7136,If you like fps games but not what call of duty has done in the past few years you will probably like this.  It is a great game that is fun for countless hours.  With it's amazing campaign and spec-ops mode along with it's enjoyable multiplayer it is easily one of my favorite games of all time.
7137,Cool ass campain but a bitch to deal with if your playing on the highest difficulty
7138,This game is masterpiece. I remember playing this game 24/7. Still playing this now. Such a great game!!
7139,"estoy teniendo problemas para emntrar se bugue en la pantalla negra y yano me deja pasar tanto como en modo normal como en multiplayer
"
7140,"It's a very fun game, and very challenging to complete on veteran. I managed to do spec ops 69 and complete the campaign on veteran, and if you do that it will take up plenty of your time and it'll be fun while doing it"

7149,the one actually good call of duty and is still better than all of them after ten years its no wonder their going back to it
7150,gost die g
7151,"Pretty good game, definitely my favorite CoD."
7152,this game brings me so much memories. i started playing this game 8-9 years ago and it was so great! The campaign itself was fantastic filled with plot twists and unexpected moments. the multiplayer was ok but fun! This is by far the best call of duty in history of the franchise! i ll give this game a rating of 9.5/10 one reason is because of the multiplayer. i wasnt a fan of multiplayer back then. sorry but its my opinion! hope this gets remastered in the future. i cant wait for a remaster of this masterpiece!
7153,No Russian mission is very bad idea

first off I love this game far more than I could ever put into words in this review, the game is fun and entertaining. the story is by far the best in any COD game that has ever been made. 

special ops is fun and very challenging, I personally had to spend a majority of a day grinding for all the stars (stopped one off).

Now... as far as multi player is concerned, Overall it is very fun, kills are not easy nor too difficult, which makes them very satisfying, movement is pretty well designed and overall feels nice. The sights are nice, but I personally don't like the acog. The visuals are not amazing but also not terrible (this isn't The witcher, it's COD).

now as far as this games negatives... obviously tubing exists, and to be honest it has gotten worse depending on the people that are in your lobby.  people love to use this games age as an excuse to act like a child (PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE!). some lobbies are fun, others are crap, occasionally this game gets into a pattern of sucking you into the same crappy lobby again and again and again and again and again, but this only happens every once in a while depending on how many lobbies are active. some lobbies I have been connected to automatically unlock EVERYTHING (titles, weapons, skins, emblems, ETC...) this is VERY irritating, in fact it's enraging... because unless you have your rank MANUALLY backed up you will have to COMPLETELY restart. That is if you actually want some accomplishment and satisfaction with your gameplay. I personally have had to restart twice. the first time at second prestige, the second time at fourth prestige. ever since then I have kept a manual backup of my rank on my desktop ready for immediate application, I would recommend doing this as it is almost inevitable that you will get put into one of these modded lobbies at some point or another. Hackers are a thing just as much as in any other COD game, just leave the lobby and try to rejoin another.

NOW DO NOT GET ME WRONG!!!

this game is a blast! it's fun, entertaining and I honestly love it. It seems like I have a lot of bad things to say because the positives are pretty easily explained. whereas the negatives take a bit more time. I love this game. that's it, I love it, it's fun. There is a lot of stuff you will have to deal with, but this is only really in the multiplayer and is the fault of the players and hosts, NOT the game itself (for the most part)."
7160,it's good
7161,"Campaign is ok but is very short and not worth 20 dollars
Multiplayer is basically empty and the gamemodes aren't fun
I played this for hundreds of hours years ago but in 2019, it's lost its playability"
7162,Campaign was about as long as Luigi's Mansion
7163,no russian.
7164,"
Playing it online is very difficult and it won't load later"
7165,"I LOVE this game soooo much, especially on the PS3, when I first played it, and i cannot say this game is the best and to this day you should play it. The story-line is good, the guns are even better, and I suggest getting a couple copies because doing a multiplayer match is kinda a pain in the a**, but other than that, highly recommend."
7166,Not that interesting imo
7167,this game needs a 64 bit update
7168,liked
7169,Hours of play on this game and can never get old. By far one of the best shooters and if not best video game in history. So many memories and lots of times with many many people. And was the best experince I've had with a game. Such an iconic title and was one of my first. This really is what started it all and I'm happy to always go back to it for as long as I can. Thank you :)
7170,"Modern Warfare 2 is without a doubt, one of the best installments in the Call of Duty series. It's short but gripping story and it's still-active multilayer, and it's fast paced Spec Ops mode not to mention the museum easter egg for some casual fun, deserve the 20$ price tag. I cannot recommend this game enough."
7171,"It's basically unplayable now. Only modded servers. 


F"
7172,"I have about 60 days of playtime on MW2. It is absolutely wild, fast paced, bombastic fun. The best cod in my honest opinion. If you are good, you can do well with any gun, because the balance in this game is achieved by making every gun strong as hell in separate aspects of the game. The map design is fantastic, although prone to some spawn-trapping potential. If they removed noob tubes and death streaks it would be one of the most perfect games ever created!"
7173,I love the graphics and the story is very good.
7174,its to expensive
7175,Would really enjoy some controller support being added to the game; particularly Nintendo Pro [as it was meant to be played].
7176,God I miss Xbox-live chat rooms.
7177,"REALLY WHO CAN GIVE A DISLIKE TO THIS GAME>?????? EVERY BUDY THAT DISLIKE THIS GAME IS A GREEDY FU,CKIN WH.ORE ://// :))))"
7178,Fun as hell. Made me feel like I was back in 2009 on my cousin's Xbox 360 playing it at 1 A.M. when I was supposed to be asleep. Now I just have to wait for Halo: Reach to come out on PC and then I can truly be a kid again.
7179,"Just got back into playing this gem, I don't really like games that tend to revolve around its multiplayer component.
The last time I played this was in 2011 on Consoles, and, honestly it's still just as good as the day of release.
Even got me back into playing multiplayer after feeling multiplayer fatigue for the last 5 or so years.
The campaign is still one of the best in the series and the characters stand far above any of the newer outings in the series.
MW2 is still rated by many as the high point of Call of Duty and multiplayer games and you can see why from the campaign to spec ops and multiplayer this game doesn't fail in entertaining.

Having never really played this game on PC, it takes some getting used too.
I'm not too good with a K&M but even when I am getting murdered online I still have fun.
There is no controller support other than the steam controller configs and they are awful to play with.
I fully recommend people getting this game, the campaign is great, Spec Ops is fun with a friend and the multiplayer is still full of players and at the time of typing this, I have never found a lobby that isn't full.
And, going off how many people still play Cod4 online, I would say this game has years left."
7180,It's the golden age of COD
7181,"One of the best CALL OF DUTY games, incredibly OP weapons tho..."
7182,"Introduction:
A classic Call of Duty game in today's standards. I played it a long long time ago when I was still an Xbox player. Never really appreciated it until Call of Duty started hitting the rock bottom. All I can tell now is that the game is still good. The campaign whilst slightly unrealistic is entertaining and well constructed. The Spec-Ops missions are simple but they are a lot of fun especially with a friend. The multiplayer is still alive and kicking as of 2019, it may have the same problems with balancing and the same problems with broken weapons as it did back in 2009. But if you can play a normal game without any of that bulls*it then the multiplayer can be loads of fun.

Modern Warfare 2 is the direct sequel to the first Modern Warfare and probably the most influential and well-remembered entry into the whole first-person shooter category. Modern Warfare 2 is set in a fictional future where World War 3 is sparked and later fought between the United States of America, the Russian Federation and various other countries. You play as an operator of fictional special forces unit dubbed Task Force 141 and as a Ranger of the US Army 75th Rangers as you live and partake in the battles of World War 3. Old faces return and fight alongside you as well as new faces join the fight.

The Story:
6 years after the events of Modern Warfare. The Russian Civil War still rages on. The breakthrough in this civil war is that ultranationalists seize control of Russia, making Imran Zakhaev. The villain of the previous game. A martyr and this further strains diplomatic relations with the United States. Vladimir Makarov back then Zakhaev's second in command. Rises to power and begins his campaign of terror against the West. After a terrorist attack on a Russian airport orchestrated by Makarov. The United States ends up being framed for it as an undercover CIA agent was founded amongst the dead. This causes Russia to declare war on the United States thus beginning World War 3. Russian paratroopers invade the US East Coast (Terribly unrealistic btw) and begin their battle campaign to Washington D.C. Whilst the 75th Army Rangers battle the Russian Army and Paratroopers on the US mainland. Task Force 141 is sent on various missions around the world in order to find evidence and connection linking Makarov to the Airport massacre. 

Pros:
‚óè Engaging story
‚óè Well written characters
‚óè Diverse and unique levels
‚óè Big weapon pool
‚óè Well composed Soundtrack
‚óè Well optimized
‚óè Achievements
‚óè Collectibles
‚óè Spec Ops mode (Simple but incredibly fun missions to play through)
‚óè Really fun Multiplayer
‚óè Lots of good Multiplayer maps
‚óè Enjoyable progression system
‚óè Great sound design (From your gunfire puncturing your enemies to a Predator missile crashing near you.)

Cons:
‚óè MP Spawn System (Very frustrating spawn system and by far the worst one in the series. Half of your spawns will result in you either spawning into a Killzone, an enemy spawning behind you, spawning in the middle of the map or getting killed before you can react as MW2 MP doesn't have a spawn protection system.)

‚óè MP Unbalanced Weapons (It plagued the game back in 2009-2010 and it still plagues the game today. One Many Army + Grenade launcher spamming, ridiculous Commando perk knife range and instant zap into you upon the activation of the melee button, RPG spam almost every game.)

‚óè DLC Maps Matchmaking (Not a lot of people own the DLC maps for Cod MW2. Mainly due to the extremely greedy pricing on a 9-year-old DLC. But the problem doesn't end there. You will deliberately be matched into game lobbies with the DLC maps. If you don't own the DLC maps you will be kicked out of the game when it starts. The fact that DLC maps are put into the base game map roster is really stupid.)

‚óè No Steam trading cards 
‚óè Shakey screen when shot (Such an annoying and useless feature! This gets extremely annoying and problematic when you play on the Veteran difficulty. As enemies already have incredibly stupid aim lock like aim where they can shoot you from distances that you can't see from. Pair that along with the shaky screen upon taking a shot and you will be either dead in mere minutes or will be forced to retreat because you won't be able to aim at the hostile and land your shots because your screen shakes like if you're standing upon on an Earthquake hot zone.)

‚óè No FOV controls (Use the FOV program.[github.com])

‚óè Activision's Greed (Whilst ¬£20 is not a bad price. It should not even be ¬£20 in today's day and age. This is a 10-year-old game that should cost a maximum of ¬£5-¬£10. The high price point and Activision greed is the sole reason why the games community is not as big as it was. Of course, bear in mind that COD was never really a big franchise on PC, to begin with, but the player base would definitely be bigger than what it is today had the price been reduced years ago. The DLC map packs are no better either. 5 maps for ¬£10.99? Yea f*ck off Activision. I was able to pick up the DLC map packs for half price but not everyone is that fortunate.)

Conclusion:
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle and most well-remembered Call of Duty game behind Call of Duty 4. Yes, it has its problems that to this day plague the game but other than those problems. The game is loads of fun, the Campaign is well-written and really fun to play through. Of course minus that one super unrealistic part where Russia invaded the US East Coast. Spec Ops is a really fun secondary game mode for you to play when you will be looking for more of that sweet campaign-style gameplay. And Multiplayer is still that classic old MW2 multiplayer from 2009-2010. Loads of people still play the game and while there are some of those extremely annoying tryhard players who will do everything in their power to ruin your fun. But once you look past those problems, MW2 can still be quite a lot of fun for a 10-year-old game. If you're looking to get into the Campaign and Spec Ops mainly then it's a good purchase as long as you can get it discounted. Multiplayer is also a good buy but try to remember that problems still exist within the game to this day in the online mode. Buy it heavily discounted and enjoy the game that once was apart of the great Call of Duty franchise."

7184,"Awesome campaign, multiplayer is still alive and well with no hackers."
7185,"I laughed at this game on first impressions. Especially the 1st mission of singleplayer.

After giving it a proper go i have to say its a really solid shooter. Plenty of nice weapons to play with.  Best of all the multiplayer is still alive and active for such an old game. The co-op/ spec ops is some of the most fun ive had in fps.

Fun-9/10
Graphics still look great.
Awesome gameplay in multiplayer
Single player is very engaging and fun to play through.
Spec Ops/ Coop as well which is really fun to"
7186,This was a great game back on xbox and ps4 but on pc if u are new to fps games or just COD in general you wont find this game fun. Everyone plays so campy i guess and it might just be me but i find it very hard to actually spot players and am constantly dying not knowing where i am being shot from.
7187,"This is an assessment of the campaign 

Starting off with the technical aspects Doesn't seem like much was done to improve the original. I still get tearing on my G-Sync monitor so I had turn put on fast sync to avoid it entirely and there is still no FOV slider for campaign that is but as far as graphical presentation, there is clearly a descent upgrade. Much more colourful and vibrant colours as supposed to the constant greys and browns on the original but this game weirdly enough, has reasons why it's a good sequel and why it isn't. 

This is up for you to decide campaign-wise starting off with the negatives: 
1) Game play in this one felt far more directed towards action which inevitably hurt the series later down the road 
2) Game play also felt repetitive. Every encounter was just me or other men killing hoards and hoards of solider's again and again and again which did happen in the original but far less frequently to this. 
3) Some very important and interesting dialogue told while your in game on the battlefield, making it quite hard sometimes to focus on two things at the same time. 

Now on why it is a better sequel:
1) Clearly better and more memorable soundracks 
2) More interesting villains
3) More twists

I do like just how bombastic and in your face it is with its story and the twist with shepherd was alright but I wouldn't say its campaign earns it legendary status like its multiplayer does and with how repetitive the game play loop was for me I can't rate it any higher the the original. So I'll give it an 8/10.

I completed the campaign in just about 5 hours on the dot which is roughly the same as original so I would advice you to get this game cheap as well if you aren't into the multiplayer. Also shepherd I felt also had an anticlimactic ending just like Zakhaev's which kinda disappointed me also but since they don't really focus on the campaign on these types of games to begin with, I guess I can't really expect well flushed characters to begin with. I call them surface level villains.

They have also seemed to have fixed all my minor gripes in the original which were quite problematic which I guess is a bonus."
7188,"Activition-Blizzard support the chinese goverment over the hong kong protester, for the pride of china (source: https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1181926542080958464 )

They protest for human rights and that the contracts the chinese goverment signed won't be broken. During the protests the chinese goverment killed underaged people and adults. Further more they ship many protesters to their re-education camps.

I don't feel confortable supporting such a company"
7189,Good Nostalgia
7190,I played this game for like half an hour using the IW 4X mod and it gave me over 400 hours so it must have been so good that I just blacked out and didnt realize I was playing for so long in one day
7191,Classics
7192,"I'm having a lot of fun with it, I must admit. I'm afraid I cant comment on the online as I would prefer to stay away from that, but the campaign is very good. I really like this one, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good FPS campaign. It's also good for people with not so great PCs because its from 2009, and my shitty ass PC can run it pretty well."

7197,"I don't even know where to start with this review. I finished the game within three days, because it is that fucking good (and a little short, too).

The story is, while over the top, incredibly intriguing. It is packed with well timed twists and distinctive characters. The immersion that is created by the incredible sound effect and Hans Zimmer's amazing music causes me to lose hours on end without even realising it. Playing on the 'Hardened' difficulty was perfect, as it caused the game to be difficult enough to keep me trying. 

Visually, the game is just as impressive. It contains many details that contribute to the immersion; crashing helicopters, the trail of RPG-missiles, the sky which is lit up with the light of explosions and so on. 

The combat varies when it comes to satisfaction. One hit kills with silenced sniper rifles are an excellent side to this game's shooting mechanics. On the other hand, shooting large hordes of enemies can be a little less satisfying. Despite this, it does not mean these action packed levels are not engaging. There needs to be a balance between three things; knowing where the OPFOR is coming from, having enough cover to shelter yourself from bullets, and knowing when to use bullets and when to use explosives. Acquiring this holy trinity of military combat can be tough but once you have, it is amazing to see how much of an advantage you can gain over the enemy. There will be some difficulty spikes throughout the game, but these make the challenge all the more compelling.

On the downside, the friendly AI is quite flawed. Where opposing forces will flank you and tactically throw grenades, friendly units will let hostiles pass straight through the line of fire. This will cause you to die more often than what's necessary. Compared to the huge plus sides however, these flaws are a mere speck. 

In conclusion, Modern Warfare 2 has one of the greatest campaigns I have ever witnessed and I would give up a lot to be able to experience it again. 9/10"

7223,"This game was a big part of my childhood gaming experience. I spent a lot of time with my little brother staying up late trying to finish spec ops missions on veteran or playing with friends in multiplayer lobbies. But replaying it as an adult made me fully appreciate how good this game really was.

The story is top-notch, based in reality, and no holds barred. The graphics still hold up and look good to this day. You'll come to love the NPC's that traverse the levels with you, as their voice acting and character designs are iconic. Map design in campaign and multiplayer is TOP TIER - even modern games cannot match the replayability of maps like Terminal, Highrise, or Rust. Gunplay is also extremely well done; all weapons feel different from one another and sound beautiful. Speaking of sound, the sound design is great. You will never forget the ominous noise when a Juggernaut is approaching or the absolute hellfire that is akimbo G18's spraying at full blast. The optional Special Ops missions that you can play are still stupidly fun to play solo or with friends. I recently met someone on the MW2 steam forums who helped me complete all the co-op spec ops achievements and we had an absolute blast playing through all of the levels. I highly recommend if you're looking for people to play with to check there also. The community is still very active and very friendly to newcomers and veterans alike.

This was one of the last games before Call of Duty went through an identity crisis - it's grounded in reality and even though cinematic at times, it's believeable and well-written. Even in 2020, Modern Warfare 2 is a top-notch game. Play it by yourself, play it with the homies. Either way, I'd give it a 10/10."
7224,"""My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because MW2pc gave me cancer anyway.""

I'd rather play this game with some car batteries hooked up to my nuts because the amount of cheating degenerates have demolished this game.
If you don't run into clowns who have spin in circles shooting you from 6 miles away then your gonna enjoy some goofy DDosing you from his garbage bitmining setup.
Biggest disappointment about this garbage? Can't even play Favela.

MW2 PC is garbage right behind COD Ghost and Infinite Warfare just bury this game."
7225,its not good i want my money back you play in a veck then you uninstal it then you want you money back then steam say no then you lose yor money then you gay
7226,i shot a dog then went to jail
7227,One of the better COD singleplayers out there
7228,nice
7229,"In my opinion, this is the best Call Of Duty game. The Campaign is fun, Spec Ops is awesome, Multiplayer is good. Makes it so much better when you have someone to play through Spec Ops or multiplayer with you. The Campaign is the last decent one of the whole series, it's fun, action packed, and has a lot of surprising moments. This is a must play game, even if you're not a Call Of Duty fan."
7230,nice Game with nice Story +rep go buy fast ye
7231,"The game is great, i really recommend it, although the game was better back at release, it still is my favorite game in the franchise."
7232,"Modern Warfare 2, great story alone for the entire MW franchise.  Nostalgia multiplayer with the famous nuke kill streak. Yes there were some converse moments in the campaign but the game is not bad in the slightest. Also there‚Äôs a new community mod ‚ÄúIW4X‚Äù makes MW2 multiplayer play a lot like the previous game and it‚Äôs all community based. No servers. Just by the commutity.

10/10 for the campaigns exicting never ending action.
10/10 Multiplayer thanks to IW4X"
7233,love it
7234,I still can't believe they killed Ghost

7238,Best shooter game in history.
7239,"[h1]Proton 4.11[/h1]
10 years after the original release date, COD MW2 is still a great FPS game, as good as it always was. Multiplayer is easy and stupid but that's what makes it so relaxing. It's the game I play when I feel that I need a break from competitive games like CSGO because this is just pure relaxing fun and nobody takes it too seriously.

Technically this game has two parts. Multiplayer runs perfectly on Linux (despite the lack of official support) in Valve's Proton compatibility layer maxed out butter smooth with maximum FPS (Arch Linux, 1050 Ti). I recommend using D9VK Proton feature to enable D3D9->Vulkan layer for the best performance which you can achieve using [code]PROTON_USE_D9VK=1 %command%[/code] 
or (for Optimus laptops with Prime render offload enabled) [code]PROTON_USE_D9VK=1 __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia %command%[/code]launch parameter.

Single player unfortunately does NOT start at all so as long as you don't care about the campaign (which I believe almost everyone already finished at least once) you're good to go."
7240,"classic, finding a lobby is quick and not to many modded lobbies"
7241,Got banned because i was in someones lobby and didn't know they were hacking. it vac banned me
7242,amazing
7243,3rd best cod for me after cod4 and mw3 this game soundtrack is so epic best in series hands down (looking at you wolvervines soundtrack) campaing is very good and multyplayers is very fun  actuly the only reason i like mw3 is becuse i did like multyplayer a little more and campaing is very close to mw2 maybe a little worse and cod 4 becuse of nostalgia i guess but i would reccomend mw2 to everybody but again dont you ever but cod game at its full price wait for sale expectuly the old cods its just not fair that old games cost this much greedy activitions and infitiy ward
7244,Best FPS game ever made.
7245,Wish this game pioneered more and had its singleplayer stood out more with more mission diversity like its predecessor but still a classic. Mayhaps it's just my childhood nostalgia for the first mw game only though.
7246,great game
7247,"this game is so much fun in all the modes which are spec ops, campaign, and multiplayer."
7248,US defeated in all wars (Hollywood Army)

7250,the best thing about this game is hans zimmers music
7251,Nostalgia
7252,This game makes you feel like a terrorist and hero at the same time. very epic. will kill general sherperd again
7253,The music alone is worth the buy.
7254,it's ok i guess
7255,"This game was amazing, first time playing it and it had me hooked since the first mission. How the story continued 5 years after where Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare ended was well done. Some of the missions just had me say ""wow"" because of the graphics and visual design, and this is a game that isn't exactly new but I'll say this, it's worth the price.

10/10"
7256,"The game is littered with hackers!

You have to go out of your time and install a seperate client to get dedicated servers, because the public matches have tons of hackers. A great game that slowly died due to the hacking community."
7257,"Great Game, It's a classic for when I play with friends. The campaign is okay, but the multiplayer was for sure the best."
7258,Best online game in COD
7259,"Nice game
Good storyline

7260,"Love this game, rip ghost."
7261,"I give it a 9/10. I loved this game since release, and i've been replaying it ever since then. Story is very appealing to me, and even though they're not the best graphics, I still love this game, even today."
7262,"The best Call of Duty, period."
7263,Surprisingly not that bad
7264,"One of my favorite shooting games :))

this game is so classic & nostalgic.
it has a extraordinary story, in aspect of structure they really worked on it and it seems still amazing.

about multiplayer :

i played mw2 multiplayer on my previous account for 869 hours and i believe i didn't waste my time. <3"
7265,"This game was the reason that I got steam in the first place. Yes, this game was my frist game on steam (dating back to 22 May 2011). I can still remember my dad installing the game for 12 year old me from the 2 CD's that I got inside the case on my old ""Dinousaur PC"" on a winter Sunday evening. I was filled with excitement...This was my first game in the ""Modern Warfare"" series (Yes, I actually went straight to MW2 not even knowing that there was a MW1). I remember the times where I couldn't even get past the level 'No Russian' on Recruit... but as time went by... I got to know and learn the game (that's how most games work right - you put in the hours and you get to know and love the game I guess...).This game, thinking back, makes me tear up... I remember my dad and I playing this game together, having fun and laughing, playing this game right through until the sun comes up and just enjoying life, having a good time... Heck, I even remember my group of friends and I also staying up late beyond midnight to play a quick game of S&D snipers (mostly Intervention or Barrett) quickscope only (which would not turn out to be a quick game at all...) on Derail, Favela or even Highrise... those were the days. MW2... I salute you with tears in my eyes. Thanks for being the game and the reason that made me fall in love with the Call of Duty Modern Warfare series in the first place. The nostalgia is real... and as I sit here, 8 years later and a bit embarrassed for being all teared up... thinking back at the good times... all I have left is good memories of this game... back when I had no worries or no real stress... spent together with my dad and my good friends... just enjoying life without any regrets... Thanks once again MW2."
7266,"this game was fun back in the day on the xbox 360.....

but this port is AWFUL and its so full of cheaters you cant even play it anymore without getting your levels wiped.

also people are able to use this game to execute malicious code on your steam account too so thats epic.




edit:
 oh yeah there's the campaign too and that's pretty alright if you've never played it before."

7270,"9/10!

This game is awesome! Replaying it is just as fun as the first time I played it back in 2009! It doesn't take long to complete the story and get all achievements. Even though the story is short it is extremely fun and enjoyable to play, so you are able to run it multiple times without getting bored. The Spec Ops game mode in this is quality and i highly recommend it if you have a mate to play it with. Multiplayer is good but it's a shame that not many people play it anymore."
7271,Absolute Belter still in summer 2019
7272,"In 2019, this game is showing its age with bad servers, no real anti-cheat software, and being a game by activison you bet your ass this game has a crap pc port, but this game still has the great campaign that i remember back in the day and a nice and fluid multiplayer. The worst thing about the multiplayer is that all the no-life campers from black ops: 4 invaded this game, just crouched in a corner with a rpk and just making the whole game not as fun for everybody. I personally don't see any enjoyment from playing the game the most boring way possible, but i guess being a 30 year old neck beard, still living with his parents and not contributing anything to society being a cunt is just par for the course. But ramblings aside this game is still good and i give it a 7/10, 8/10 if we were still in 2009. and maybe a 9/10 on console in 2009. For 20$, i would pick it up"
7273,Faggots banned me smh. Fucking nerds
7274,bad game
7275,"It's a good game. It's challenging and has an in-depth story. Although the multiplayer doesn't work for me, the campaign part of the game makes up for it. Will recommend"
7276,Good Game.
7277,"Very nice game, even in 2019.  Grenade launcher sucks but otherwise its really good !"
7278,"No Russian
"
7279,"dont think about buying this game for multiplayer if youre in asia,

other than that its alright"
7280,Better on pc than on my old Xbox 360
7281,this game is based as fuck.
7282,"It's a very nice game, and the second best CoD out there and it still is. It may not be a very good FPS game like Quake 1, 2 & 3 and CoD 4, and Half-Life, but it's still good! And, the second best in the series! With a intense campaign, better graphics. It has a better campaign and goregous life-like graphics. The multiplayer is better than the original. I would recommend this game 100 %. But, only if your'e a CoD die-hard and a fan of the series to the core. 

Overall PC Score: 89 % 

Xbox 360 Score: 94 % 

PS3 Score: 93 %"
7283," We're gonna start with things I didn't like and this is a review of the single-player campaign only.

*Some levels just feel like a bunch of giant hands dropped handfuls of enemies all over the place which I came to realize very rarely do you even have to fight them.
*Most of the weapons just feel like garbage.
*The grenade indicator is wonky as hell. Sometimes it pops up when things are like 30ft from you and others its right on top of you it is super inconsistent and can make you run around like an idiot only to run into the grenade.
*NPCs will legit bitch at you endlessly to do the objective which you are actively doing as they bitch at you.
*No matter what difficulty you are on (I know because I compared) the enemies are just damage sponges and it sucks.

Okay now shit I loved.
*Badass set pieces and locales visually.
*Looks pretty even being as old as it is it isn't groundbreaking but I was never like ""ew gross"" at the graphics.
*Great music.
*The smaller detail-oriented missions were all awesome.
*It was a really short game. I even got about halfway through it then restarted on Veteran and it still only took me 7hrs. Honestly, I really needed a short game so that was awesome.
*The late-game really ramps up and the payoff was pretty cool.

Now general stuff, I really wish I'd played through and beaten the first game which I'll go back and do sometime now because it is super apparent they set this series up to be a trilogy from the beginning and I feel like I'm missing some pieces. I mean yeah it's a COD game so it's mostly just military blah blah and cool explosions but It'd still be nice to see how this game evolved from its predecessor."
7284,Definitely worth a a buy if you‚Äôre tryna relive old 360 memories from back in the day
7285,yes.
7286,NO NO SOAP SOAP!
7287,ok
7288,"This game is fun and, if you played it closer to its release, nostalgic. However, on PC, it has severe security flaws. Hacked lobbies frequently display the IP address of every player that joins. It is not worth the risk without a VPN, which for anything reliable will involve a monthly subscription. Infinity Ward doesn't care enough about the game to fix it. Source: I have 250 hours in the game. (The hour counter on this game only displays campaign time.)"
7289,This is a very good game if you're into shooters. The campaign is very good and really interesting. The story carry's on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and does a good job picking it up. The special ops aren't really for me but it was fun trying to unlock the achievements. Special ops can be played by yourself or with another player. Good luck trying to find someone else to play with but would be better to play with a friend. Multiplayer is something I haven't played but looks fun when I look at old videos. All in all if you're looking for a good shooter to play and want a good story this is one that I would recommend. Also if you would like to know the start of the story Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is also a good game and worth your time.
7290,"Oh man, Where do i begin?


I absolutely loved the campagin, And the multiplayer, Though flawed, There is alot of tubing, Which can be quite annoying.

Though, I do not recommend the dlc as no one plays the maps, Maps themselves may be good though.


Overall, 9/10"
7291,A Cult-Classic!
7292,Call of Duty Modern warfare 2 is not playable i can't even beat the second mission but on console i can trash port
7293,"All warfare is based on deception. For years, the West hypocrisy has made the world a battlefield. The corrupt talk while our brothers and sons spill their own blood. But deceit cuts both ways. The bigger the lie, the more likely people will believe it, and when a nation cries for vengeance, the lie spreads like a wildfire. The fire builds, devouring everything in its path. Our enemies believe that they alone dictate the course of history, and all it takes is the will of a single man."
7294,"What can i say,its really good and fun..."
7295,mantap lah
7296,"One of the best and darkest sequels of Modern Warfare series
Best Campaign.
Like the Spec Ops."
7297,Not a fan of multiplayer shooters and never was big on CoD multiplayer. But they did so great with the single player campaigns I feel they're worth recommending for those alone
7298,"Once in a great while you will find a TDM lobby that takes you back to the good old days of endless noobtubes and quickscopes, but recently this game is full of modders and hackers that force everyone in multiplayer into a huge domination lobby then spawn kills you with infinite ammo interventions/wall hacks and aimbot. Only buy this for the campaign/spec ops."
7299,"Simply the best CoD ever. Not only for the plot, the multiplayer game also it's amazing, with a lot of prestiges, really nice community and nices ways to evolve.

Regarding the single player, the story is really challenging and really nice to follow and to get into. In addition, there are a few achievements which makes everything more interesting because they need a co-op mode.

Don't hesitate, the game is really worth it."
7300,Decent campaign for a COD game but an awful plot - no where near as good as Modern Warfare 1. Graphics are still acceptable today. I do not recommend playing on Veteran because you will constantly die due to 2 hits basically being an instant kill.
7301,game broke
7302,good game but horrific playerbase everyone uses the exact same guns there is zero variety online really isnt worth playing at this point
7303,csgo

7310,Best campaign out of any Call of Duty game ever.
7311,"This isn't a current CoD game, do not buy.

Modern Warfare 2's campaign is really short, but historically significant for a couple of scenes which I won't spoil. This game might be worth buying heavily discounted, but not at the current price."
7312,i like this game
7313,DON'T LET THE FLAME DIE OUT
7314,"The game was good in the beginnings, now it all feels like quake 3 arena thanks to ""GRENADE LAUNCHERS"" . Your old games are overpriced, and no one can (and shouldn't) buy the new ones. I recommended this game to my friends but they prefer not to buy it because of it's price. There should be public servers as you did in MW 1.  Go back to Activision when it was perfect. When did you guys become greedy about money more than the gameplay.
For those who want to start or continue to COD series I have an advice for you: F*UCKING DON'T!!! 
Go play insurgency, day of infamy etc. 
Black ops series.... You guys call that a GAME !!!!"
7315,"[h1]RAMIREZ GET ON STEAM AND GIVE THIS GAME A GOOD REVIEW.[/h1]

Eleven years later and MW2 is still one of the best COD games ever created. To keep it short and sweet, the story is engaging, the soundtrack is excellent, the graphics have aged very well, and the multiplayer/spec ops is still very fun. It's interesting how games this old still hold up compared to newer titles. Most of the time they have more character and don't feel so over-polished. Definitely recommend picking this game up, along with COD4, BO1, MW3, AND BO2. All excellent games."
7316,"I only play this game because 
A) its 40$ cheaper than cod:ghosts
B) its playerbase is still somewhat active
C) its the closest thing i can get to cod:ghosts

Cod: ghosts is the best cod and im serious. Please buy an xbox and hop on ghosts best time ive had playing a shooter game in years."
7317,My very first Steam game. It was 10 Years ago. Great game.
7318,"Campaign is amazing. Multiplayer? I mean, pretty fun but an absolute jittery lagfest that's completely unfixable. Moving my mouse in multiplayer feels like dragging my cock over a cheese grater, and the campaign is too short to make up for it."
7319,"A classic game for sure at this point, the campaign as well as the multiplayer still hold up to this day. Comprised of the classic Call of Duty formula that inspired games for generations to come, I can't count the amount of hours that I spilled into this game in my teen years. Simply put, it is still a LOT of fun.

When I eat a piece of this jerky I feel myself transferred to a whole other dimension, I feel like I become the green pastures, I get filled with more strength than ever due to the incredible amount of PURE protein that this jerky contains, I become the mountain, I become an immovable object and an unstoppable force at the same time.

_____________
Multiplayer:
It's one of the best COD multiplayer. yes it's still have a large players and only take a minute to find a game (I prefer domination).
in newer COD multiplayer they decide to have regional matchmaking that means it takes a lot and sometimes never find a server for me. but this baby is not like that and as I said you can easily join game servers. (it's true that some of the game mod is dead like CPT or grand war but Free For All, TDM, DOM, S&D has a lot of players.)

It's a shame that they decide not to release any COD games on steam. Please change your mind."
7347,Just buy it. It was and always will be a great game!

7349,very fun
7350,"One of the best campaigns in a First person Shooter ever.

The balls they had when they made this. The immersion and locations and overall the gameplay experience is just that good you feel like you're right inside of your favorite action movie playing it.

Some levels take direct inspiration from movies like The Rock or various Schwarzenegger/Sylvester Stalone movies.

The level with the EMP when no electronics work anymore and planes and helicopters fall from the sky is so epic. Then there's the famous No Russian level which is one of the best levels in gaming. They actually let you play a false flag mission. The balls they had when making this game. So many hidden messages are hidden.

Just keep in mind you're not playing a military simulation. This is by all intents and purposes a playable action movie and should be judged as such.

MP is rather bad. They made several guns like shotguns akimbo. Killstreaks are totally overpowered. I know many love its MP and I wouldn't call it bad but I just did so there's that.

Spec Ops mode is really fun its additional missions with high replayability.

The museum is such a cool thing I'd wish more games had it."
7351,"Okay, IMO best fucking CoD game ever, great single player, great multiplayer, I used to play it on ps3 and boy like i've gotten one modded match after 20 hours here, when ever single match i played on console either had a full team of hackers or was full modded, i recommend you buy this game,it cured my sister's cancer!!!

Second, no, I do not want to play Domination, I want to play Team Deathmatch. You know, the mode I actually selected? If I wanted to play Domination, I would have actually selected it and not TDM. Besides, if you really want to play Domination, why are you not queueing for Domination in the first place? Why are you queueing for TDM instead?

2. hosts that flatout refuse to even give you certain weapons, yet alone actually allow you to use them - If there are huge chunks of this game that you hate, why are you even playing it anymore, literally 10 years after its original release?

3. hosts that can kick you from the game - Believe me, if you're playing against such a host, you WILL get kicked sooner or later if you're even remotely better than they are. Imagine being so salty that you'd kick an enemy player just because they killed you once or twice and manage to effortlessly destroy your UAV. Glad to see COD players still behave like angry 13-year-olds even 10 years later.

The worst thing is, you can't even block modded hosts in any way. You could block them if the game used dedicated servers with a server browser, but SOMEONE thought it would be a good idea to use P2P servers/hosts only, something that's bad in itself and attracted quite a bit of bad press back in the day.

And don't let me even get started on the fact that in literally every other match, you'll get people complaining about the noob tube. Once again, if there are major game mechanics that you absolutely hate, why are you still even playing the game 10 years later?

If you're going to get this game, get it for singleplayer. Multiplayer, on the other hand? Avoid it as much as you can."
7359,This game is my childhood
7360,it's gud
7361,Still an amazing game..unfortunately without players like old times..
7362,10/10 ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
7363,"Modern Warfare 2 was and still is one of my favorite call of duty's of all time along with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and will always hold a special place in my heart as the Call of Duty that jump started a ton of game commentators careers (WhiteBoy7thStreet, WingsOfRedemption, Drift0r, xJawz, Hutch, a lot of the FaZe quick scopers even, etc.) as well as sort of started the era of Call of Duty content creation in the Machinima realm that no longer exists. Anyways, this game was basically an improvement to its predecessor (Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare), but actually DONE RIGHT. 

MW2 had just as good as, if not better of a campaign as cod4, it had an incredible co-op mode that I would always play with my online friends or split-screen play with my irl friends and of course, the multiplayer was downright incredible. Who can forget the timeless shhit talking that would always go on before a match would start on the ps4 or xbox, and for some reason, a feature that was removed from the PC version. This game by the way, is one of the only call of duty's that is actually optimized somewhat for the PC in terms of its multiplayer as for some reason, Modern Warfare Remastered (2016) does not work properly on the PC. Even though the servers on the PC for MW2 are pretty much dead and overrun by hackers who just derank you, it is still fun to play as you get that nostalgia feeling. 

Although, it's not JUST the nostalgia that makes the game good, the game physics, the fov, the gun variety, gun sounds, kill streaks, map design, breakable windows and cars and game modes are all of what made the game's multiplayer fun. I LOVED the claymores, the Javelin, the throwing knife, the noob tube, the heartbeat monitor, I mean hell, the quickscoping scene was pretty much created thanks to this game and launched a lot of the current FaZe members careers as this is where the quick scoping scene with the intervention pretty much started. No Call of Duty game has been able to come even close to this one in terms of the sniping mechanics, except for maybe MWR, as this is where the  Y Y ladder kids came from and just something about the scoping in and movement of the sniper felt very solid. The akimbo aspect of the game was very fun as well, who could forget akimbo g18 full-auto glocks or even the ridicilous akimbo (double) P90's. And who can forget the extremely overpowered, but very fun silenced UMP or the ACR with hearbeat sensor that everyone would use to get a Nuke in the game. The Nuke, which was the last kill streak that everyone would race for as it was the ultimate challenge. Even though everyone would just run Harrier, Chopper Gunner or AC-130 and Nuke as their setup lol, even with Hardline you would just need 6 kills in a row basically and you have a chance to get a Nuke basically, which was so satisfying.

The map Rust, was the place where everyone challenged the shhit talkers to ""prove their worth"" in a quick scoping match. The amount of online friends and memories I have formed with just this 1 single game is really incredible, I even became irl friends with some of the online friends I made from this game. Overall, this game (MW2) as well as (Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare) will always hold a special place in my heart, not only because of the nostalgia, but especially because of just how good of a game both of these titles were and were deemed by most of the cod community as the gold days and peaks of cod. 10/10, Incredible game."
7364,"Single player/campaign its fantastic.  

 [B]But never touch multiplayer![/b]

Multiplayer: Is this mode fun you ask [spoiler]Fuck NO![/spoiler] unless you like watching hackers shoot the ground the whole match then this is a perfect game for you. honestly if this game Had anti cheat this game would be great but sadly this game is dead to the core and probably will stay this way. It is a rarity to find a [spoiler]fucking[/spoiler]  normal game ever all the lobby's I get are those losers that give you a gun instead of your actual class because they don't like what your using. and then the hacker lags out the lobby because there getting there asses handed to them by a regular player.
Now I just hope they get this trash of a game off steam now and give us a re-fund I mean the devs clearly would like this game to rather rot in the state that it is in."
7365,"This game is timeless, most of the complaints about multiplayer are hackers. most hackers wont stay too long, you just need to get good. I enjoyed this game as a young lad on ps3 and still enjoy it here on steam. 11/10 on the nostalgia scale."

Balant cheaters in multiplayer."

7381,this Game is amazing in almost every way
7382,nice game...
7383,"The only Modern Warfare 2 that exists. 
Arguably one of the best character line ups in any COD, with the villains being the most memorable.
The campaign is quite over the top and despite that the level design is hit and miss, it has its noticeable amount of great moments, followed by an excellent soundtrack and an even more excellent gunplay. 
The level design in the multiplayer however is, and I'm not exaggerating, all killer, no filler. Definitely where Infinity Ward's map design peaked. Though the multiplayer is unbalanced. Thankfully not unbalanced in a frustrating way, but rather in a ludicrous way. Yeah, MW2 doesn't hide its over the top nature no matter what game mode you play in. Spec Ops was also decent."
7384,"Played game of multiplayer, had a hacker in it. Hacker then proceeded to send me back to level 1 as if I just bought the game. Shame because I love this game. Oh well!"
7385,"An excellent and unforgettable campaign, thanks to the well-written, well-scripted and unique missions. Although an action game the campaign definitely showcases the might of both the American and Russian army. The campaign includes some amazing characters as well that evolve throughout the missions. The game showcases the courage it takes from great men to change the world in dire and desperate situations. To fight and die for your values and let God play the rest out.

7396,"Ah yes, Modern Warfare 2 the game I grew up watching my older bother play and probably one of the games that got me into gaming in general.

This 10 year old game (as of 2019) Is still one of my top games mostly for the nostalgia and the absolutely FANTASTIC work of art which is the single player story and the great Co-Op mode that is an absolute joy to play with a great friend.

Honestly the entire Modern Warfare story line is just great to play overall and hasn't disappointed me once.
Personally I had an absolute great time achievement hunting with my close friend Naga who is my number one choice in any Co-Op game and also a good mate to discuss lore and story lines with."

7399,Big Game
7400,"One of (if not) the best CoD games of all time. Online is still somewhat populated, with dedicated lobbies."
7401,"UPDATED

Pros:
+ Great story line and characters
+ Superb voice acting and character's dialogues
+ Theme songs/Soundtracks Hans Zimmer + Lorne Balfe. And compare with other games in this franchise, this game probably got the best soundtracks
+ Campaign's loading scenes
+ Wonderful atmosphere and environment, especially D.C. settings
+ Spec Ops, Museum, and Multiplayer mode

Cons:
- Friendly AIs act weirdly and unreliable in overall, they often run straight into bullets and get themselves killed (especially TF141, they died too easy)
- Enemy AIs will likely to shoot at the player first, even if friendly AIs were staying closer to them
- No lean left/right
- If you stay on the half-broken plane (to snipe the enemies) in a middle of Snatch&Grab Spec Ops mission for every 1-2 min, Juggernaut will spawn behind you.
- This is where the franchise began to lose its own identity: more action, Hollywood, and less war being (Act Man is right about this, you can check his video in Youtube)
- So many illogical and unrealistic things appear in the game that following Michael Bay traditions
  Here are some of examples for those who interested:

1) Illogical/unrealistic stuff
- In reality, just attacked civilian in the airport might not enough to convince the world to believe it was all planned by the US government. Such a bold motive with no strategic value would have ended up rising a suspicious toward the Russian Government also.
  It would be more believable if Makarov's men also attack on Russian Government's places, other military related locations, and assassinate their political rivals (airport is just a diversion).
- Why FSB operatives don't check up or follow the Makarov's ambulance? (They might have known about the set up as well or just the devs makes them arrived in the scene too quick)
- How could no one able to detects hundreds of large cargo planes flying over European territories into the US? It'll make more sense if devs mentioned that Russian could be able to hack their security systems also.
- By such a distance, how did Russians able to support their logistics for invasion force? This seems like a single trip since there isn't enough fuel to return to Russia.
- In reality, it was unlikely that only Russia alone could be able to (nearly) win the war against USA. It'd make more sense if China and their allies countries assist the attack also.
- How could the nuclear blast wave be able to destroy the space station and satellite in space? With no atmosphere, the wave should be ineffective.  
  Still, EMP and radiation wave with no atmosphere to interrupt their path should be enough to kill those poor people in the station.
- From the Cliff hanger mission, why 2 elite special forces didn't even try to hide or cover up the dead bodies at all? This is possibly the reason of how they blown their cover.
- In Takedown mission, Rojas assistant was firing his Desert Eagle about 13 rounds, from the entire 7 rounds clip. 
- FSB and Spetsnaz with American MH-6 Little Bird.
- To shoot Shepherd's Helo down, Price should use M203 instead.
- Russian VDV alone can't secure the entire Northeast US, Russian Army should appear in DC settings also.
- Devs should have mentioned that a swift Russian invasion is suspected to be prepared long before No Russian incident.

2) Fast paced video game come along with fast paced story line: 
   If they carefully arranged the timeline (extended the story and time gap) the whole game can be separated into 2 parts, for the sake of logic and realistic:
   Part 1 -> S.S.D.D ~ No Russian, and more additional missions
   1.1 For PFC.Allen - add more missions to gain more trust for Makarov and his mates 
   1.2 (optional) Some missions for Roach or Ghost
   1.3 Ramirez - few missions in Afghanistan, before the Rangers were transferred back to the US after the No Russian incident
   1.4 Other Makarov goons - Attack other locations during the No Russian incident
   Part 2 -> Brazil (Takedown) ~ Ending, extra missions can be included 

3) AIs models and appearances
- Seems like German Shepherd is the only kind of dog that existed in the COD games
- Lack of variations for the enemy models (faces and uniforms), especially: 

  The Favela gangsters
  - More variations on the uniforms and faces, and about a half of them shouldn't have a well-dressing and military hardware

  Russians and other factions
  - Change Russian VDV camo, proper uniforms for winter Spetsnaz, and new model of the VDV sniper
  - Variation on faces models (unmasked, and including the partially visible ones)

4) The worst of all, [b]choice of the WEAPONS for the Campaign[/b]
In the game, you'll see the enemies are largely equipped with inappropriate firearms, the finest example is:
Russian VDVs equipped with a huge amount of NATO firearms (P90, UMP45, FAL), Israeli (TAR-21), American (Vector, Striker), also Walmart's AK47 and outdated RPD.
Similar thing happen with the FSB, airport security, and winter Spetsnaz as well. While the Makarov's Mercs (not the airport attackers) is exceptional, but it would make more sense if most of them equipped with Russian weapons.   

Well seriously, they made the entire Russia ruled by the ULTRAnationalist, but using a large amount of foreign weapons doesn't sounds like they are Ultranationalist at all... 
Also, although Russian officials and military indeed have some foreigners weapons in their arsenal in real life. But they are using them in a FEW amount and it's mainly for personal protection and testing.
[b]If you still don't see this is a problem, just imagine if one day, some Russian video game devs portrayed the US soldiers to use the customized version of M16A1 as a standard rifle, and others were equipping with firearms manufactured by South American countries, along with 2-3 Russian CQB weapons.[/b]

The solution is quite simple - made the Russians equipped with proper Russian weapons like: AK74M, PKP Pecheneg, MP-443, AKS74U, RPK74M, PP-19, Saiga-12, VSS Vintorez, Dragunov SVU, OTs-14, 9A-91/SR-3 Vikhr and etc. 

As for Favela gangsters and OpFors, many of them can be seen running along with high-graded firearms that should be uncommonly seen in the real life Arabian war zone and Rio's favela.
OpFor men should be equipped with old firearms, such as: old AK variants (like AKM, AMD-65 and AKMS/AKMSU), G3A3, PKM, Skorpion, etc. mix with new ones.
While a half of Favela gangsters should be equipped with old firearms: like the old AK variants, Uzi, old shotguns (870, ranger), old AR-15, some old rifles/carbine, Madsen LMG, etc. 
Mixing with a normal black synthetic FN FAL, MD97L, some new Western and Russian weapons.      
Also, some of the gangster should be equipped with a single pistol (M9/PT92, Desert Eagle, 1911, etc.), and revolver only.

For US Army Rangers, Glock 19 should replace the Desert Eagle. Mk11/Mk12 and Mk46/Mk48 should be included for this faction.

Plus, every AIRSOFT weapons models in this game should be replaced by the realistic ones. 


[b]In conclusion: 7.5/10[/b] 

This game is certainly a memorable piece of work and so much fun to play with. But it's also filled with many of unrealistic issues and Hollywood flaws.
And to make it even worse, the fact that developers still keep on this unnecessary tradition is the main reason why later COD games are getting worse, and now the credibility of the franchise is currently going downhill (BO1 & 2 somehow acceptable in term of story line and such).

To put it simple, despite it was the highest era of the whole franchise, it was also the beginning of the downfall.


PS. Thanks to my Russian Modder friend (who has a vast knowledge about firearms) and one Facebook user who I was dealing with for various information"
7402,Great game ruined by modded and hacked lobbies. smh my head
7403,"This is a review of the multiplayer. The campaign is one of the best in the franchise, and everything runs very smoothly once you find your resolution. In MW2 Multiplayer, I have 266 hours as of 7/19/19, but I have around 27 in this game because I've replayed the campaign multiple times.

You know what game this is. It's ridiculous fun where you'll be yelling bullsh!t with every other death (because it probably was bullsh!t.) I play this game WAY too much because it's a great way to kill time and just have fun. Alongside, the chat function really brings a whole new element of interaction in this game, with MOST people being very nice and open for any kind of conversation (some toxicity, racism, etc, but it's call of duty. It's to be expected.) 

However, people still occasionally camp, people still tube, you'll come across the occasional subtle or not-so-subtle cheater, and there's a 30% chance you'll end up in a modded lobby, where you're at a risk of getting 10th prestige'd without your permission, or you'll have your loadouts blocked, or killstreaks/knifing will be disabled, etc. It all depends on the host. Speaking of hosts, it's a gamble whether you'll get a solid connection through the randomly-selected host (if the lobby is unmodded.) But most of the time you'll be okay.

I think the fact that I have so many hours in this game proves that it's a worthwhile purchase. It's definitely worth the $20, but if you don't see yourself playing it as much as I have, I recommend waiting for a sale."

MW2's campaign was crazy good, better than an action movie, and leaves you in control every time you expect a cutscene.  

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Spec-Ops)
Coop horde mode, vs actual soldiers (not zombies), with an upgrade shop, provides some extra playtime.  

‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Multiplayer)
Originally quit playing MW2 because custom servers were basically viruses, which hijack your connection and inject files.  

Come back 200 years later, when there are only a handful of players left, and the very first match I join has a blatant hacker, hipfire 1shot aimbotting people through walls with a sniper rifle, quality stuff, definitely qualifies as playable /s  

Its sad that this was ever successful, 33% responsible for the death of gaming.

If they had treated all CoDs as expansions to CoD4, CoD would be the greatest game of all time.  Instead, its a deservedly abandoned scam.  Not a single CoD makes the top 100 list on Steam anymore."

7437,"I've been playing MW2 on xbox and so It's the best COD game so far... As for multiplayer, it still kinda holds up to this year, but most of the gamemodes (especially unpopular ones such as 3rd person TDM which I enjoyed back then) are dead. Campaign is great also, but I prefer playing Multiplayer rather than completing it. For 10 bucks it is a must have in my opinion."

7440,"COD MW2 is the best Call of Duty game ever released. DO you disagree? Well tough, because the facts don't care about your feelings. Modern Warfare 2 has on e of the best story campaigns ever released in a COD game, but where it really shined was the amazing PVP mode which to this day has not been topped. MW2 had the best guns, the best perks, the best killstreaks, and the best sound effects. Do you remember that sound it made when you leveld up? THat was all the motivation i needed to keep going at 4:00 in the morning. No microtransactions, no jetpacks, no female ciborg amputees, just the best running and gunning Call of Duty ever offered."
7441,The campaign is just so much fun! It still holds up in 2019. Worth 10 bucks just for the story. The multiplayer doesn't have as much hackers as people say. Just give it a try.
7442,"even tho the game was released back in 09 its still considered great for its time, and compared to today standards, the multiplayer is alive with a thousand player or some few hundreds, never ran into any hacker during my hours of play.
if you are looking for something classic go buy it :)"
7443,"Worst part is the player community.
Online servers that they force you to join in matchmaking are so prone to hackers that even when you're not in a game with a hacker the players can't help but shout bullshit to each other. Regardless of whether they're winning, losing, doing bad on the team, doing slightly better on the team; the go-to explanation for a lucky shot is always hacking and it happens every game.
Everything else is great. Great game. Well put together."

7495,"This Game To Me Is Like A Bumpy Road But In The End, It Works.

Here's The Good Stuff ---  Climactic Story With Sexy Twists.

                                      Over The Top Unrealstic Action (I Dont Take This Game Very Seriously So It May Be A Turn Off For You                           
                                      But Turn On For Me).

                                      Cool, Kinda Memorable Characters (You'll Probably Appreciate And Like This More If You Beat MW1).
                                      
                                      All Kinds Of Settings And Landscapes (Both Single-Player And Multi-Player).

                                      10/10 SUPERB Level And Map Design, The Strongest Of Suits.

                                       Captain Price's Panty-Flooding Voice.

Here's The Bad Stuff ---           

                                        Over The Top Rambo On Crack Style Action (Again Almost Entirely Subjective).

                                        Hilariously Bad Balancing In Multiplayer (AA12 As A Secondary Kind Of Bad).

                                        The WORST Plothole In Gaming History (I'm Not Gonna Spoil It Go Watch The Act Man).

                                        A Tad Bit Hard To Take Seriously At Times.            

Conclusion ---

                       It's A Cool, Cocaine Fueled Call Of Duty Expierence.

                       I Give COD:MW2  Solid 7.5/10               I Like It."

7556,"Purchased this bad boy on day 1 as a die-hard Call of Duty fan back in those days, started casually, finished singleplayer mode in like 5 hours, dominated random matches as a pub hero, demolished co-op with my co-teamlead, created one of the best teams in Greece, reached top on competitive ladders on platforms like ESL and EuroDomination with my team DM, claimed first in whole Greece for many months and generally ripped the shit out of people when this was hot and I used to be decent.

Would rate 10/10 anytime but sad cause the game is dead.

Nostalgia hits hard."

For th time of creation of this game the graphics are good for something this old and i thought that the swapovers between the three differant playable charecters was a very nice freature and in my opinion i enjoyed Task force 141 the most out of all three.
I would recommend this game to all of my friends it may be old but the mechanics and storyline are amazing."

The only thing I wish they did was actually give a damn about PC."
7596,"Even 10 years later this game hold up as one of, if not the best, call of duty game. if youre ever bored, just hop on some mw2 and maybe do some spec ops or just spend hours annoying and getting annoyed in the multiplayer"
7597,best cod
7598,gay
7599,"One of the best CoD campains of all time, probably top 3 multiplayer in the saga, one of the best mission of all time. This game aged better than MW3 and it is more played than its succesor. With todays rigs you can always played it on 60+FPS. Playing it now with yesterday friends is awsome. DO IT"

7619,"The campaign in 2 is the most interesting of the MW line. I think I prefer 1's multiplayer overall, and there are a few specific maps in MW3 and the BOs that I like better than any I've tried so far in MW2 but it's still pretty good."

The only CoD so far that comes close to this one is CoD4.
Fingers crossed that the new CoD MW coming out is as good as this one."

7628,People still camping 10 years later.  Good game tho.
7629,"What a fantastic game. call of duties are either meh or trash, but like 3 of em are gold and this is one of them. This is a fantastci title for learning how t oshoot wiht the mouse. everything about the game is smooth and responisve. music by hans zimmer btw."
7630,still fun in 2019 although servers are a little bit dead
7631,Dunkey explained this game best. Go hear it from him.
7632,"still one of the best first person shooter games of all time, dont think itll ever be surpassed"
7633,Still one of the best out of the Modern Warfare series and is still active in multiplayer.
7634,One of the best Call of Duty games that I have seen
7635,the greatest cod ever devised.
7636,Never gets old <3

7640,Can Noob Tube- 10/10
7641,"What can I say, the most rage-filled Call of Duty game there is! Relive your childhood by playing on classic maps like Afghan, Favela,  and Rust. Still to this day you will have an increase in blood pressure when losing a killstreak. Great game, should not cost what Activision charges for it (the games been out for over a decade!)"
7642,Not fun
7643,"brings back alot of memories from my childhood, R.I.P. ghost"

7654,One of the best Call of Duty games to be released. The campaign is fun and thrilling with great set pieces.

7662,"600 players online a day, 200 of them are cheating.
No Option To Report Hacking Kids"
7663,Its okay I guess
7664,"Game still holds up as fun time killer, but be prepared for only online servers to have players be
>modded
>normal tdm

All other game modes are completely abandoned. Single player is still great, if you like normal TDM, online is still great.

Biggest annoyance is the modded servers that you don't want to join, but are the only ones with players in your region."

7675,"Servers are empty, not recommended especially at the current pricing"
7676,Despite the weapon imbalance its easily one of the top Multiplayer games I ever played!
7677,"This is possibly the absolute worst Call of Duty game released through Steam. Well it's the absolute worst when compared to other Call of Duties released around it's time. For one the game legit starts to break within a few days owning it from my experience. You would open either game files and it would hang on you and refuse to respond which forces you to having to force quit every single time. Also online is a hit or miss. You either join a regular server or you join a hacked server. Even with purchasing it on sale, I gotta say it's no where worth it. If you want an old Call of Duty golden age experience get any of the ones released from 2007-2012 but this piece of useless garbage. $20 is a bigger ripoff. MW2 itself is a good game, but this version is pure straight garbage of the lowest kind. Other versions of MW2: 9/10, Steam version of  MW2: 0.5/10

TL;DR This version is essentially trash and deserves to be removed from Steam. It barely works and has really horrendous game breaking glitches that can potentially cause the game to break within a couple of days of owning and installing it which prompts for a reinstall."
7678,Modern Warfare is the best franchise of Call of Duty games.
7679,best!
7680,It's playable as my hour count says
7681,Great game. Clocked most of my hours on console but pc game now so i grabbed it loved playing story and spec ops. while multiplayer mostly only has TDM still love playing
7682,Good ole times
7683,The original in good games
7684,"Still great, but I'm more trash than I used to be."
7685,It's okay
7686,Original.
7687,Nothing beats the classics
7688,gret game no hax wutsoevur
7689,Best CoD. Period.
7690,"Nice classic
"
7691,"Pros:
*Awesome singleplayer campaign
*Satisfying and quick paced gunplay
*Fun Spec-Ops missions if you enjoy playing co-op. This should give you roughly +10 more hours of game time.

Cons:
*No FOV slider. Have to use external tools which are somewhat risky.
*Multiplayer is riddled with noobtubers, campers and cheaters. 
*Modded lobbies ruining the experience for people who just want to play TDM.
*Huge security issues where someone can execute lines of code on your computer by sending data to it. Users with malicious intent can take full control of your computer just by seeing your IP through the game.

Is it worth buying? For singleplayer and spec-ops - YES! Multiplayer? Hell no."
7692,Still a classic with an active multiplayer community and hours of replay value.
7693,"Playing this on steam was hella nostalgic, Good game overall!"
7694,classic
7695,its only good for the campaign

7709,The good old days
7710,epic
7711,Best Call of Duty of all time. Brings back memories. The multiplayer is still somewhat active; its easy to get into a TDM of FFA game.
7712,Sick Game loads of snipes

7714,Most likely the best CoD.

7729,After coming back to this game after a long time. Can say its as fun as it was back then.
7730,"Nice sequel to COD MW1. Nice Spec-Ops  level. I totally love it. Multiplayer on other hands is very sensitive to my opinion, I just did not like that higher sensitivity on mouse movement."
7731,probably best call of duty port to pc before infinity ward gave up
7732,Best Cod
7733,very nice very good
7734,"Old classic! A bit too many hackers sometimes, but still enjoyable"
7735,fun game but needs more players
7736,"Blast from the past, this game has aged very well and is majorly fun with friends"
7737,slap
7738,Yes. Good Gam.
7739,really nice game
7740,yes
7741,Spec Ops is lit
7742,In my opinion this is the best call of duty it has good singleplayer with an awesome soundtrack a spec ops mode wich is very difficult on veteran #69stars and a perfect multiplayer
7743,Fighting your way through suburban Virginia is a pretty intense experience. There are better FPS games out there but this one is pretty fun and has some great unique experiences.
7744,"Brings back my childhood, still able to find full matches and i love it"
7745,very good game :))

7793,"It's a great game. Haven't played special ops or multiplayer yet, but I can assure you, you will have the time of your life in the campaign mode. Overall, great game."
7794,It's fun
7795,10/10
7796,"The multiplayer is still operational although nowadays the only modes that you will find games will be for TDM, Hardcore TDM, FFA, Domination and S&D. Other than that, still a classic COD experience."
7797,best game
7798,No other game makes me so angry. But it's so ****ing good at the same time.
7799,whoever decided to kill Ghost probably puts ice in their milk

7807,best game
7808,Still holds a good amount of people dont buy the dlc or you will never find a match. also get stuck in modded  lobbys where its says its team deathmatch but its actually something else.
7809,Play this if you're willing to play single player or spec ops. Don't bother with online.
7810,Best CoD to ever be released.
7811,yall ready know
7812,good game
7813,"Years later, this game is still the best COD"
7814,I owned this game on the 360 and loved it so much I bought it for the pc.
7815,Ghost died.. 0/10
7816,Fun
7817,"amazing campaign, special ops missions, maps (rust), and multiplayer"
7818,"Game is very fun overall, but playing the co-op missions with my buddy for any extended amount of time ends with the game stuttering every few seconds, wish it didnt."
7819,Amazing nostalgia from when i was a kid. 10x better than i remembered.
7820,i like
7821,fun but a lot of hackers
7822,FUN
7823,Great game brings back some good memories
7824,Just as good as i remember when i first played it on the xbox 360 and the multiplayer is great until that one kid with the noob tube comes along and ruins your sandwich.
7825,"Hands down best CoD, amazing campaign and spec op missions"
7826,This is the best game of all time imo.  We need more games like this.
7827,Modders ruin the multiplayer
7828,This is an old classic that I love to turn on and run through the Spec Ops missions whenever I need to blow off steam. Highly recommend!
7829,Taught me to aim down my sights thanks foley
7830,epic throwback
7831,Best CoD ever.

7837,pre good 10/10
7838,ITS SO FUN <3
7839,yes
7840,A classic
7841,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best CoD games in the series and has a good campaign story. It is a very good game and has fun gunplay.
7842,"This is a beautiful game. Great game, would buy again. 100% recommended. Totally doing this not because of steam grand prix. Totally love this game. Buy the game. Its fun. Great experience, fun game. Lots of shooting, much fun."
7843,"do you like cod, this CoD is 2 good 4 you"
7844,yoink
7845,Tis p fun
7846,Still my favorite call of duty
7847,Best CoD ever made
7848,get FOV changer mod
7849,I don't know how it got to be The Most Liked COD Game From the Community but Nice Job on the Game.
7850,Been a die hard Battlefield fan from 1942-to BF4 and since then i have had to make a decision. and i have to say while i dont care for most of the call of duty games the Modern Warfare Series is everything in a story i want in Battlefield
7851,360 no scoppe
7852,It's okay game
7853,"BEST COD

7860,"Can't wait for the remaster. Been getting into this game recently, allthough the game is dead, you can still play td and ffa. great fun!"
7861,"Very fun game to play and story mode is pretty cool. Although, I have not and most likely will not play multiplayer due to their being a lot of problems with people cheating in online multiplayer."
7862,I like soda
7863,amazing apart from the fucking nube tubers
7864,One of the better cod games of all time. Wave mode is still a spot of fun in to you can find it cheap.
7865,The speedrun game of choice who angry 9 year olds who trash your mum
7866,simply classic..
7867,I love this game. Everything about it.
7868,Best Cod ever made
7869,"yup, 12 year old still f***ed my mum"
7870,"This game is still worth playing in 2019, and there are, surprisingly, less hackers here than on PS3."
7871,Good old times
7872,What kind of name is soap

7880,Pretty fun.
7881,i think this game is cool and fun
7882,good
7883,In my opinion the best part of the entire CoD series. Even better the CoD 4. Had one of my best times in that game. Best Campain in CoD
7884,"I can definetly recommend mw2 without any doubt about you not having fun only if u dont like FPS in general or the online world that comes with it the community which can be retarded but just mute em play your game or leave the lobby if they stop you from having fun in any.

Also the Story is nice not like newer Call of Dutys which cam out few years ago.

"
7885,"A true time capsule. The community is the same as it was in 2009. Still has massive latency, a hacking problem and more modded lobbies than regular ones. An absolute pleasure to play."
7886,"7/10
Explosives + Scavenger Perk spam is dumb fun
Playing with shield to confuse nobody

not enough players anymore = lags"
7887,"Okay, this is epic. -Ben Shapiro"
7888,DO NOT PLAY MULTIPLAYER RCE  IS BACK AND IT CAN BREAK YOUR COMPUTER GIVE YOU TROJANS OPEN YOUR WEB BROWSER AND STEAL PERSONAL DATA SPREAD THE WORD

7901,people still fucking use the grenade launcher fuck this game
7902,Very nice
7903,epic game
7904,Absolutely awesome game probably the best Call of Duty of all time.
7905,amazing
7906,"Pinnacle of the multiplayer genre.

7907,gud gud
7908,This is one of my favorite cod games. The multiplayer is still good

7929,Lobbies are fun when they aren't hacked
7930,This game is amazing! It is a true throwback to when things were good. You should buy it!
7931,the best call of duty game for campaign and multiplayer in my opinion
7932,[b]Ramirez![/b]
7933,-b
7934, The quality of the lobby chat is something that cannot be experienced in any other game.
7935,gg
7936,Nice Game
7937,I want no Russians
7938,"This game is very good, although I don't play it cause I never really liked it on PC since I have no friends to play with and how many hours I had on this on Xbox. It's a good game, but with the lack of player base, I'd suggest you to not buy it."
7939,Super fun game
7940,"Good game but developers gave up on it, i played this game many years ago and i still love it. If they would put more effort, gave dlc maps for free since no one is gonna buy them ever, and dealt with cheaters they could have amazing multplayer game here."
7941,"Its pretty ok, but infinite warfare was definitly better then this."
7942,Still the best Call of Duty game.
7943,The last good one in the series..... Feelsbadman
7944,Good story
7945,"This is another successful episode of Modern Warfare Call of Duty‚Ñ¢ series, which also has a special mode, called Special Ops.

Graphics are stunning, as well as the way of design in some levels.
As difficulty increases, the game becomes much harder, requiring you to actually cover, and use the training - To aim down the sight(s). Without that, you're pretty much a dead man.

There are special units, classy thieves, traitors, even in the famous World-known units like Navy Seals, Task Force 141, (...).
The game lets you to take role in some really very intensive firefights, which fit the story just perfectly.

You'll have to try hard to find such a great game, that is easy to handle - Doesn't even require a boosted gaming PC.

It's not like that you'll survive everything.
Youre the hero afterall, but you'll still die, and you can't change it without changing some of the files, which is definitely not recommended.

Special Ops can be played with a friend.
The missions there are hell of a challenge, as they're really very hard, but once you master the basics, how the enemy will treat you, when they'll appear, (...), you should be able to not be surprised.
To beat the Infinity Ward times is absolutely hard, but it's definitely possible, especially in mission Body Count, which you can finish within twenty seconds, if you spend enough of a time to know everything about that map.

Let's also not forget, that the game has a multiplayer version.
There are plenty of hackers, who may hack into your computer, change your files, and the result is - You'll receive a Vavle Anti-Cheat Ban.
So, [b]ALWAYS HAVE YOUR FILE, ''config_mp'' SET TO ''Read only''[/b].
There are also ''kicktool abusers'', using an allowed third party program, called ''MW2SA'', known as the ''kicktool'', as I've mentioned before.
They'll simply kick you out from the lobby, no matter, if you're a hacker or not, just because you're better, or because they've set up their own rules.
Sadly, it's OK to kick you, if they warn you, but without warning, you can report that user to the MW2SA Developers, who'll most likely ban that user for abusing the MW2SA.
Ther is also a group, where people post and tell to each other, who abuses it, and who doesn't.
In conclussion, this game is hella epic. One of the best games, that I've ever played, but I am affraid, that I can't recommend it in the current state.
The hackers, kicktool abusers.. Those people ruin the game. They think, it's funny.
"
7946,dank
7947,always a classic
7948,Story Line is absolute quality
7949,This was my childhood growing up. Best game ever

7951,"Annoying aspects of MW2 online:
Noobtubes, UMP, G18, Thermal, Chopper Gunner, ACR, Cheaters, Modded lobbies, Sniping, One Man Army, Commando, Last Stand, every other weapon and perk in the multiplayer.

When most things in your multiplayer game are overpowered and broken nothing is - 10/10"

7972,Lit
7973,"You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh bout how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub
Lookin for some love, in every club
I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin
Guess it's true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweating, can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm saying, boo, is this is all about you

Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollering my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
With the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggas
Cause we coming from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggas at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm going through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga, it's all about you

Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I'm tellin ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean.. god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm sittin back, watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in, my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin?
And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in, the homeboy Warren G video!
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah

"
7974,"maybe one of the best shooters of the 2000‚Äôs era! Best call of duty by far and cannot be beat! Finished the story mode in about 12 hours or so and was very fun couldn‚Äôt put it down until I did! Although this game is kinda outdated... it‚Äôs a game that will be golden forever. Never to late to play it. One flaw would be multiplayer if you aren‚Äôt as experienced because there are either very very good players or hackers and or cheaters so I recommend if you are sure to buy this game, play the campaign and special ops. Multiplayer is pretty cancerous :/
8.3/10"
7975,"Arguably the best CoD single player and multiplayer experience there is. Weapon balance? Who cares, just make all the guns OP. 
Good fun."
7976,"Half the time joining tdm puts you in a shitty modded server or a domination game. Also, noob tubing is absolutely rampant and balance is non-existent. No FOV slider either."
7977,The nostalgia is great
7978,funny bruh
7979,classic
7980,R.I.P. to the best COD ever.
7981,"Do you have the dsm?
We got it sir
Good that's one less loose end.

5 years ago i lost 30.000 men in a blink of an eye"
7982,One of the best games for trickshotting lol
7983,"an oldie but a goodie, always a fun story and ending!"
7984,"I almost forgot what cod was like without supply drops
such a good game"
7985,ok
7986,"I just remembered how garbage i was at this game



still good tho"
7987,One of the best games I ever played!
7988,gooooooooooooooooood
7989,Still one of the greatest SP Call of Duty games ever. Worth playing upscaled to 2K at 144FPS =)

8009,"Really fun game with your friends, also a classic Cod game to boot. Especially fun when you dick around with different maps and modes."
8010,"It is a great game, just the character deaths are quite sad, especially Ghost's and Roach's, the ending was satisfying, however."
8011,"The good ol' days playing this as a kid and getting nukes, ahhh... I love this game so much"

8016,Great game
8017,"This game is great. It's also a decade old, but my playtime speaks to how much replay value it has. The player movement and aiming feels much more responsive and smooth than most other FPS games. The single player story is epic but the multiplayer is where it really shines. The only downside is the rampant hacking that no longer seems to be moderated. Even so, I consider it a must-have for fps fans."

8019,perfect
8020,Mission Failed
8021,HOSBALLE
8022,"well, time for remastered!"
8023,With the IW4X mod installed makes this game so much better. The mod let's you choose different servers to join. A tactical nuke in some lobbies doesn't end the game and other lobbies the score is unlimited. I thought modern warfare 2 was fun back in the day on ps3 but the IW4X mod here on pc makes it so much more then the developers originally planned. I mean the mod has the peacekeeper from black ops 2 and some weapons from the original modern warfare. I am already 10 prestige level 70 from how many hours I put into the online cause of the iw4x mod. If you already own this game and don't have the mod I recommend downloading the mod.
8024,Ez Pz
8025,"Game is still great, out of the good amount of games I've played (I'm sitting at rank 46 from starting from the first rank) I've only run into maybe 1 or 2 actual hackers who try to ruin the game. There are plenty of other people who ""hack"" (name changes, colored names, etc) but they just want to play. The worst thing about the game is the private lobbies where people get really butt hurt if you kill them during their streak and then they kick you."
8026,"After all these years this game still brings joy every time I start it up.
May have various Problems in the balancing and cheating department but that does not hinder the fun you can have when playing this gem."
8027,Still the best COD game.
8028,i think i like?
8029,good
8030,What are you waiting for?
8031,*laughs maniacally with akimbo G18*
8032,"The game is a classic, come on now. Buy it.....you know you want to relive that after school experience of just sitting down and grinding on a game for hours on end."
8033,old but gold
8034,Sure.
8035,its ok
8036,"I have spent HOURS trying to get this game to run, and have only successfully gotten this game to get to the main menu once. The game stops responding on launch, and there is no support for the issue currently available. Unacceptable from a company that has had almost 11 years to figure out how to make their game work properly. I was really excited to replay one of my favorite games of all time, but Activision seems to be far more interested making cash-grab POS's rather than making their classics operable. Saddening."
8037,its good man
8038,the good ol days
8039,"Timeless classic, still being played to this day"
8040,"Classic game, second best cod after cod4"
8041,"Best call of duty game ever. PC multiplayer is a bit shady though. Many hackers, strange connection issues. Overall still worth the small amount of money that the game costs for the campaign alone."
8042,"The best CoD singleplayer. The co op missions are fun and the multiplayer is a terrible but still enjoyable mess, especially on some custom servers."
8043,good for killing friends
8044,very good to be back playing this accept seeing all the camping and bad players who just sit in a corner a noob tube so that hasnt changed

8093,fun
8094,"One of the best if not the best COD (game-wise).

Sadly it's been left alone by the developers and only receives security updates (very very rarely), so cheaters and modders are almost free to go. It didn't take long until some nasty vulnerabilities appeared that even allow for Remote Code Execution on other player machines in a Multiplayer lobby (some of those flaws still not fixed). You can e.g. easily bypass VAC and play online with a VAC banned account. That's just one of the smaller ""exploits"" that has been around for years and Infinity Ward does not feel like fixing.

So security-wise this game is a mess but I love the weapons, the maps and the way this game plays. The single-player campaign and coop-missions are definitely play-worthy. You can easily host a private game and play with friends you invite which is a lot of fun.

I recommend playing the Single Player and private online matches.
I do not recommend playing in public Multiplayer lobbies because of the security flaws mentioned."
8095,cod king
8096,You can only really play tdm but still fun
8097,"Great campain and coop missions, online on the other hand is filled with either max level hardcore/hackers or noobs"

8115,"The best Call of Duty game after all. 

Story: Absolutely the best one. 
For me - super realistic and cool to enjoy. Just like the old times.

Gameplay: Nothing to say, to be honest. Cool.
One thing i hate about the gameplay is the absurd amount of difficulty on Veteran.
Just got locked on one mission and cant pass it.

Soundtrack: ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. 
(if u dont believe me just listen to the whole OST in one go.)

Final Points:

Story: 9/10
Gameplay: 8/10
Soundtrack 10/10

This game is 9/10 for me. I would put in the S tier in Tiermaker.

8122,good
8123,brings back the memories from the old times when me and my friends log in right after school awsome game and he will always have a spot in my heart I really miss the old style of call of duty
8124,I love every second of this game. I still listen to its OST sometimes.
8125,"good, that's one less loose end..."
8126,great game and video still holds up today
8127,"game crashes every time i try to play a game, and then offers to run it in safe mode which still doesnt work. wanted to relive a masterpiece, but this bug is very disappointing. i dont want to give it a negative review, but it sucks not being able to play it"

- Relive the first person shooter that changed the franchise
- Feel unstoppable with the grenade launcher attachment
- Get cheesy with the secondary shotguns
- Take in the beauty of how multiplayer maps used to be made
- Drop into last stand and make your enemies work for those points

MW2 has it all for you!!!"

8206,"Game crashes while playing.  All drivers are  up to date.  All other games are fine, only this one crashes.  tried reinstalling it.  No help"
8207,i was just in kindergarden when i played my first ever call of duty game and this so happens to be the one I played. I loved this game with the toxic voice chats and the matches themselves being very chaotic. upon replaying it on pc today i was shocked as the player count was really low just like console nowadays this felt saddening but when i started to play a match (TDM) i was surprised to see that the game still plays like an absolute mess (Well chaotic). killing players just never got old huh? but what worries is the player count. its about 1000 and up. To me its hanging by a thread and i would love to see people coming back to play this gem for at least one day it would certainly help the players still playing this game making it easier for them to find a match. (Now for the story mode......its something to remember...i think. I never really paid attention to the story mode as a child and i rarely gave a shit a about it now. [spoiler]No Russian was pre good[/spoiler]
8208,One of the best fps of all time.
8209,Great storyline great multiplayer 100% recommended

8212,"Very nice game i swear man im pro 50 kill 6 dead 
But i have VAC   and band 
"
8213,yo this guy hasn't beaten the story
8214,"Where to start? Modern Warfare 2 was a game I played in my youth, however Multiplayer only. Time went on and more Call of Duty came out, keeping up with the games. Eventually I just went back to MW2. A beautiful masterpiece of a game with the best feature IMO which is Co-Op. Didn't think of Co-Op back in the days, but I have now and I really did enjoy doing the missions with my friend. 

The campaign wasn't difficult. Playing on Veteran instantly and me who played only like the first 4 missions back in the days could make it with some obstacles of course, but it was enjoyable. The missions were lovely, some better than others, but all in all, I could play it again after a while.

Co-Op was really the icing on the cake when it comes to this game nowadays. Requiring some tactical head, but you could also just goof around with your friend and just do you. Which of course, we did. There were also trial and error, a lot. Because we goofed.

I wish my dumbass wouldn't have hacked in Multiplayer back in 2011, because I can't play it on this account, but just started playing it with my friends on another account.

I would achievement hunt again and probably will on my secondary account."

8224,"Nostalgia kicks in and is great. The game is great, the combat system is realistic and the story is interesting and combat situations are intense. This game's multiplayer is terrible. It is filled with salty players and hackers. But the campaign is awesome and really interesting can't wait for the new one to come out hopefully soon."
8225,"So much nostalgia, RIP Ghost.

11/10 would kill Shepherd again."
8226,"I ended up buying this in anticipation to the Modern Warfare Reboot, to see if I was honestly disillusioned by nostalgia after all these years. I wasn't. This was and still is the peak of the COD series, and where standards should have been set instead of the downhill spiral FPS companies have been riding. All the memorable moments still have that hard impact on you, gunplay feels amazing and nothing feels unfair. I already ran through a veteran difficulty campaign run and did all the Spec Ops missions to 3 stars, I recommend you do it. This is an amazing FPS and the peak of it's respective series. It'll always be worth a buy."
8227,"Safety's off, weapons free, it's go time!"
8228,"People in multiplayer just abuse the meta. Prepare to see people with under-barrel rocket launchers and akimbo shotguns in every game. It's not as ""perfect"" as people claim. Can't say anything about the campaign though"
8229,"A very good first-person shooter, it is my favorite game in the franchise. The campaign is amazing, and so fun that you're gonna wanna play it over and over again! Multiplayer is great, and Special Ops adds a cool new twist, allowing yo to go solo, or take on enemies with friends alongside you. Overall great game, 10/10!"
8230,"I love the story, the game. Its awesome love it"
8231,"It's really difficult for me to review this as it was an objectively good shooter with all the right gameplay mechanics and good level design and all that, as well as some challenging combat scenarios (I'm talking about the campaign). The trouble was for me it just didn't feel as well rounded as the first one. [b] WAIT PUT YOUR PITCH FORKS DOWN [/b], hear me out.

From a gameplay perspective this game was fantastic but for me the thing that made the first modern warfare special was the story and the characters. (It feels very strange saying that nowadays about a call of duty game). In the first game, to me at least, the situation seemed fairly plausible (of course it did have its more extreme elements) but for the most part I was immersed in the overall plot and premise. Where as, with this game, I felt like the plot didn't feel quite as genuine nor intense as the first (although that is just my opinion). Also I feel the characters were far better written in the first game with each one having their own personality and unique take on things. The one exception being Captain Price who was just as good in this game as he was in the first. In this game however the cast seems quite dry and inhuman, again with the exception of Captain Price.

The real reason I struggle to give this game a recommend is because I genuinely completely forgot literally everything about it after my first play through and even forgot that I had the game until I saw it in my library while formatting my controller (I don't tend to open steam that much I just use shortcuts on the desktop). Upon realising that I did in fact own this game and that I had already played through it once I sat for quite some time trying to remember what the story was but I drew a complete blank. I suppose the upside was that it felt like playing it for the first time again the second time round but that didn't mean much as when I finished it I didn't really feel like I'd just experienced epic tale of war and (well I guess this is kind of a spoiler) [spoiler] betrayal [/spoiler]. Instead I just felt like I'd spend a few hours playing through yet another call of duty game that I will probably forget again.

I suppose if I had to some up this game in one word it would be [i] underwhelming [/i]. But it is decent from a gameplay perspective and I only play for the story not the multiplayer, so if you're just in it for the multiplayer then I'm afraid I can't really help. And of course this is just my opinion so don't take it as a personal attack if you love the game."
8232,yes
8233,Top
8234,Lovely
8235,Peak of the CoD franchise.
8236,sick game bro
8237,Has good story
8238,One of the most successful fps game of all time MW2 to this day still offers a great single player and coop experience for players looking for some action.
8239,"Only real OG's know that MW2 is the best COD game ever made,
a game way ahead of its time"
8240,Many hours spent on it. Love every aspect. Favorite part is no russian. You havent played an fps until youve 1v1 someone in rust.
8241,"In 2019, obvs looking a tad dated, but still holds up a half-decent, bombastic, linear and on rails campaign, with lots of varied scenarios. Storywise .. something about bad guys and nukes and betrayal and revenge - whatever!"
8242,"The best COD game by far
 Would recomend to everyone"
8243,"A truly brilliant FPS classic :3
"
8244,"I played this game when it first came out on the xbox 360, and revisiting it on pc was a great experience. There's nothing different, but playing the game with a mouse and keyboard feels better than a xbox controller. Surprisingly, people are still on multiplayer, but that may just be because people are hyped for the new Call of Duty. I'm glad that I got to play this game a second time and revisit the fun I had 10 years ago."
8245,"While I love this game, I think that the price is really not worth it. The game is really old and from what I have seen, server support is not there anymore."
8246,is good
8247,Just as cancerous as i rember 10/10
8248,This game is freaking good but hacked looby every where.
8249,The last good Call of Duty. 11/10
8250,"If you haven't played Modern Warfare 2 before or had played it on PS3/X360, GET IT NOW. It's worth it to run campaign again on high details, especially if you have a high resolution display. I replayed the campaign in 4K and it just looked great even thought it came out in 2009. 

The multiplayer is just soooooo good. I played countless hours on PS3 and still put in many hours on multiplayer on PC. It's my most played game on steam at the moment at 149 hours on multiplayer. There are even modded servers if you use IW4X client which you can google for more info. 

I have played most of the Call of Duty campaigns ranging from the very first Call of Duty to Call of Duty Black Ops 2. MW2 is the best Call of Duty I have played to date. I also played BO3/BO4 multiplayer and although they were pretty good, doesn't come close to MW2.

10/10, enough said."
8251,its just yes
8252,"a 9 year old from the USA  told me to go F''k myself all cause i killed him
then i 1v1 him and i won and told him to suck his mum 
so...
9.5/10 
would tell a 9 year old trash talker to suck his mum again"
8253,"Single-player Campaign:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MW2 has the most epic, breath-taking :) and cinematic single-player campaign in all FPS games  
10/10. Perfection! 

This is the epitome of the Call of Duty franchise:
Fluid gameplay. You are a TF-141 operative!
One-of-a-kind story, with twists and turns

Terrific variety of missions (perfect pacing between TF141's tactical and the Rangers' all-in combat styles) 
Innovative locations


Multiplayer Review (33 hrs) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Probably one of the best MP shooters out there. Still very active
10/10. Highly recommended

The game has aged very well and still looks great.

One of the few online shooters were players don't turn into bunnies jumping 5 feet and sniping you mid air (Looking at you, BLOPS 4)! This alone merits MW2 mp a recommendation.

TDM and Domination modes still have a healthy population (June 2019). My wait time is usually two minutes.

The multiplayer is well-balanced and fairly easy to get into. 
Even as a beginner, I could repeatedly kill level-70 players when I was at a much lower level.

There's a wide variety of guns+attachments, perks and killstreaks to choose from.
You can create your own class, so it's easy to mix-&-match to fit your own play style.

The game gives the player a sense of deserved achievement every time you unlock a new gun, attachment or perk.

The maps are really good. You got to check out Airport, High Rise and Skidrow."
8254,very epic
8255,why are you still playing this game
8256,im glad i had an xbox when the cod games were good
8257,"Better than 2019 Modern Warfare. The Steam version of MW2 multiplayer is bad tho, if you want to play the better version with unlocked FPS, an FOV changer, server browser, mod support, custom maps and more players then search 'mw2 client'."
8258,call of suty is the best in this serice dont miss it
8259,"Although it is quite an old game and it is sometimes difficult to find a good lobby, it is still a good game. If you are getting a really good price on it, enjoy it!"
8260,the story one is not workin
8261,"Even in 2019, it still holds up as an amazing game."
8262,"100% the best call of duty game ever, the story was insane, the gameplay was better than MW1, great quality for a 2009 game."
8263,MUST COMMIT MORE WAR CRIMES
8264,"I wanted to give this a positive review because of what the game used to be but I can't recommend this game in its current state. The multiplayer is completely broken on steam to the point where any game I was able to connect to was just me being killed by hackers. Wait for the eventual remaster if you want to play this game again or for the first time. 

It's a shame what happened to this game because in my opinion this was by far the best Call of Duty ever made"
8265,Possibly one of the best cod games ever definitely a classic. It's in my top 3 cod games and it's always very enjoyable even almost 10 years later. This game is extreme bullshit a lot of the time but that makes it more fun I would definitely recommend.
8266,Badass!!
8267,"Buy and large the most disgustingly overrated piece of entertainment ever flourished. 

A campaign that dude-bros the shit out of the US military, with some of the most infuriating open area based mission design put in a game to this very day (Have fun playing Veteran mode because of this). A 3rd mode called Special Ops, which is okay at it's VERY best, but is really just a set of reused assets from the campaign skinned with differing objectives based around getting stars as a rank. No replayability outside of trying to beat your previous high score. And the shit dollop on top? The most infuriating, laughable, unbalanced MESS of a competitive multiplayer component divised by a CoD Developer. One Man Army/Danger Close Noobtubes, stackable killstreaks, Tactical Nuke that ends the game, Pinpoint accurate weapons across all classes and subsets, Stopping Power but no Juggernaut to counter it, Death Streaks that rewards shitty players, Shotguns as secondaries, Scavenger resupplies explosives, Perks and Rifles tailored to easy quickscoping, etc. 

MY. FUCKING. LORD. ALMIGHTY. 

Every time i hear or see someone say this game was good/great i want to either deck them in the face or commit seppuku. This game is also the one that started the whole Doritos/Mountain Dew subculture that still fucking exists. Yeah, this is that game. You knew something was up when Eminem played during the trailer. If you were one of those people that hopped onto the CoD hate bandwagon, it's pretty much ironclad fact that it was in 2009 when this piece of shit came out. I don't even need to fact check that. I just know. Fuck this game, and fuck everybody who likes it. And fuck you if you're one of those inbreds who are clamoring for a MW2 Remastered. There's a reason the first one was remastered. There isn't one for this garbage. Have better taste in games."
8268,"Garbage console port; multiplayer lobbies are heavily infested with hackers just as a mexican whore's cooch is infested with bugs.

I really don't see Activision issuing Quality of Life updates in the far future either."
8269,much awesome very nice
8270,Literal masterpiece of a game.
8271,best one
8272,"Bought the game a few days ago to see how the game is nowadays, expected it to be empty or full of hackers.

I can gladly tell you that there's an active group of a few thousand still playing and haven't encountered malicious hackers at all.

In only a few days of playing I completed all the Spec Ops on Veteran with a friend and completed the Campaign on Veteran as well, both gave me joy and filled me with nostalgia. The multiplayer is just how its always been, crazy and action-packed, which is how I personally like it.

If you're debating on buying it, do it.
Full price or on sale if you like Call of Duty, play Modern Warfare 2, it's some of the most fun I've had in recent times and don't regret paying the full ¬£20 at all, worth every penny."
8273,"The best COD, not BO2 but MW2."
8274,"Bravo six, going dark."
8275,"The game is good, runs well and the campaign is always fun to play. I do not mind playing multiplayer, I have put 30+ hours in to multiplayer alone. But if you are willing to deal with the mods and hackers in multiplayer, you should get it. Because most the matches I get in to are either hacked or modded. Overall MW2 is still fun to play and if you do buy it, you'll get used to the hacked lobbies."
8276,.
8277,"History is written by the victor.

* Pros
+ Decent story
+ Lots of gun variety
+ Great multiplayer that is still active
+ Graphics are pretty good for the most part
+ Good variety of locations you'll visit, one moment you'll sneaking through a tundra and the other you'll defending a house in the forest.
+ Campaign isn't too short or too long

* Cons
- I couldn't disable the hint that says ""You're hurt, get to cover!"" (It was very annoying)
- The player takes too much damage in singleplayer (it wants you to sit  behind cover constantly then progress, that's just boring)
- Some moments are a little too over the top
- Some character deaths are meaningless to the player (not much character building is done to the ones that die)
- VERY LINEAR

Overall: 7/10 Good

Must Have? | Buy? | Wait for Sale? | Don't Buy This?
[Wait for Sale]"
8278,Get the game after that install the mod I-W-4-x. It's much better than the vanilla version.
8279,Wodern Marfare has always been a good game. I recommend playing with IW4X if you decide to get it at this point in time!
8280,Ok so were do I start... this game is a classic MW2 I play this game on Xbox a a lot and on PC its a great game out of all of the call of dutys this game had the best campaign and I LOVED the spec ops missions...... the only thing about this game is the multiplayer please don't get me wrong I LOVE THE multiplayer but over time this game has been destroyed with hackers and mods. I cannot find a game were someone is using godmode or no clip (flying). Its sad to be honest this game used to be a good game and is to some what playable but not worth my time grinding because you just get leveled up by a hacker or leveled down by a hacker. But its still worth the money to get to have a blast from the past and with the hackers in the queston this game is still my fav cod game along with BO3 and BO1 and has some great maps
8281,One of the bestt games i ever played!
8282,Better than Cod Modern Warfare
8283,"newb tube still op, would use it again 10/10"
8284,"Almost 10 years passed and this game still delivers! One of the best FPS ever created, truly a masterpiece!"
8285,decent 2000s' game but still not ok with war. Make love
8286,yes
8287,"Yeah, it's pretty good..."
8288,"Time for a lesson about patriotism with considered by many, best Call of Duty game out there. 

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision.

MW2 continuous the storyline of Modern Warfare 1. (I recommend playing it first to fully understand it.)
After the events from MW1, Ultranationalists seize control of the Russian Federation, even with best efforts of US Marine Corps and SAS to stop them, and make Imran Zakhaev (villain from previous COD) a martyr, which also ruins the diplomatic relations with USA. Vladimir Makarov, Zakhaev's right-hand man, starts a campaign of revenge against the West, and five years later, commits a mass murder and leaves American body on the scene, sparking a war between Russian and USA. 
You will follow the story from 2 perspectives-of a Task Force 141, special forces unit that is hunting down Makarov, and United States Army Rangers, who try to defend their country from invasion. 

Gameplay hasn't changed from previous COD's, it still is a linear shooter with interactive and action sequences, from vehicle combat, to slow-mo door breaching a room filled with enemies. You will jump, sprint, crouch, and kill baddies like in every other Call Of Duty, while trying to stay behind a cover if shot, to regenerate your health. If you die, you get a lovely quote and you start from a checkpoint. To complete the level, just follow and do your objectives! Pretty self-explanatory, not much to discuss. On the start of each level you get two weapons, but you can always switch them if they don't fit your style. Game, just like previous entry, has a wide variety of weapons and attachments to choose from. From obvious different type of crosshair, to more fancy ones, such as weapons with heartbeat sensors, or attached weapon under a weapon! Because there is no such thing as enough weapons. Some levels will even give you special equipment, like night vision goggles, or a laser designator. Normal equipment involves grenades, flashbangs, C4 and claymore mines. And as always, a combat knife if in real need to kill an enemy, yet with no ammo or time to reload. 

Thankfully they didn't try to really mess up the ratio of non-scripted/scripted gameplay, they kept it just like in first MW, so be sure game isn't either a simple ""go and kill"", neither ""press X to do everything"". Missions are build well and the variety of gameplay will keep you interested from start to finish. From snowy base infiltration, to defending a White House, always changing up pace and objectives are great, keeping it fresh and interesting. Also it is simple like most of the COD's, developers thankfully didn't change that and counted on the great storyline plus well-written characters to do the hardwork of having some sort of ingame depth.   

And if the ""COD Games are too easy for you"", you can always try to beat the game on harder mode, or try your luck on Veteran, which, rejoice, is finally balanced! No more grenade spam from enemies or dying from god knows why rushing-kamikaze-like opponents, allowing you to have a enjoyable challenge requiring strategy and aim instead of clustermess first one was. 
That works not only in Veteran, don't get me wrong, but on lower difficulties it wasn't that painful and I know a lot of people complained about that, me inculded. So AI now is better because it plays like it should have. Well, enemy AI that is. Allies AI is..decent. Sometimes it's helpful, by throwing away enemy grenades, supporting you with cover fire, or by simply having a crisp aim, sometimes it can leave enemies behind, get under fire and just die, or stay in cover doing nothing. So it's quite mixed. 

On your journey you can collect laptops with intel, working as collectibles! Shamefully it only is to collect them and you can't read or check the intel you collect, which could add more lore and story to the game, a wasted opportunity if you ask me. Still, fun to collect! 

Besides main campaign, you have Special Operations, ""Spec Ops"", in which you will have to complete fast missions in locations from the game, solo or with a coop partner. Worth noting that with partner, instead of dying and restarting the mission you only get downed, and you can be revived by your friend. A must in later Ops. Operations are seperated into 5 groups, starting with Alpha and by gathering enough stars you unlock next group of operations! Each of them is harder than before. You can grab 3 stars from each mission, if you will complete them on Veteran difficulty. Those missions also have a new enemy you didn't have in main game-Juggernaut. With really heavy armor and Light Machine Gun (or shotgun), those brutal mercenaries are the toughest enemy in game, requiring a heavy firepower to be eliminated. 
And you have Multiplayer, which somehow is it's own component so I won't get much into that mode. Known for it's legendary Youtube clips and Akimbo Pre Nerfed Shotguns, you probably know how it works already.

Best soundtrack from COD's, that's for sure. Main theme composed by Hans Zimmer himself, while rest of the score was crafted by Lorne Bafle. It's just fantastic and there is nothing else to say about it. Voice actors also did a great job, both newly introduced ones, and the ones that simply changed a character they voice over. 

I had terrible issues with connecting to friends in Spec Ops mode, that were getting fixed/broken again by itself so it's something on the COD side rather than mine. It was painfully annoying. Rest of the game worked flawlessly. 

Simple yet action and variety packed gameplay, superb storyline with well-written characters combined with fantastic soundtrack plus two additional gamemodes, Modern Warfare 2 has everything you need from a FPS, and continuous great story on MW1. 9/10!

8295,very very nice game lmao hahaha legend
8296,"The multiplayer is why most people get the game, it's hard, intense and fun. The ping is the problem, if it's too low you won't be able to kill anything, and everyone with better ping will kill you."
8297,"If you are thinking to buy this game, just don't. The game is infested with hackers, especially modded lobbies. 

As an updare; the game also is full of kicktool abusing players. At this point i really don't suggest you to buy this game."

8304,"Just finished the campaign and if i had to call it one word it would be: Great.
awesome storyline and cutscenes overall just one of the best cod games ever made"
8305,good shooter game
8306,MASTERPIECE

8316,its a good game
8317,shut up
8318,"this game is many times better than the first one, the story its like a holywood movie just pew and more pew and dog oh the dog are mean but the multiplayer is fun but there are some times you get in a moded sever and one moded sever got me every thing in multiplayer so i hope i dont get banned, in this modern warfare theres a co-op mod called spec opps and you can do it solo or have a budy with you but there may be some mission where you need a budy to compleat it but there are some missions that take place in the first modern warfare but all out a good game"
8319,"Like all other cod games its hillariously casual and dumbed down with broken spawns, weapons and perks, so thats basically nothing that can be held as a negative. The difference is this one has less garbage maps than the other cod games, which gives it some much needed variety. 

Recommended if youre looking for the best of the worst."
8320,"The hackers, FPS cap and hit delay are the only bad things about this game. A remake is needed."
8321,"Worked fine until a windows 10 update a while back broke it. Either goes unresponsive when the smaller image shows up, or it blackscreens, or it freezes on the menu. For a while disabling the internet just after opening the game would fix it, but now that doesn't work either. I've tried everything (uninstalling, verifying cache, various youtube ""fixes"" tutorials etc), and nothing works. Shame as it's a great game

EDIT: also worth noting I've had ~60 hours in the multiplayer. Already played a lot on the PS3 back in the day so I haven't really replayed the campaign, hence the 1.2 hour game time"
8322,"An absolute masterpiece. One of the greatest shooters ever made. Excellent compelling campaign, fun co-op, and the best multiplayer in Call of Duty history. I have played this game since 2009 on console and only recently purchased on PC. It still holds up great today."
8323,Still good.
8324,nice game
8325,When Call of Duty was good.
8326,Miss the old COD when life was simple.
8327,ah
8328,"game is fun, online player base can be so frustrating especially with all the private lobbies where they disable launchers so u cant kill their planes or cant sniper bc they take away fast ads, or even the fact that you could just annoy the host by being better than them and they just kick you. Very frustrating to say the least."
8329,10/10 everything is hacked
8330,360 ladder stall. p
8331,Awesome game to play. I have hundreds of hours on console and i probably have completed the campaign  over 30 times over. The guns are a little unbalanced but the game is still fun. I bought the game on PC to relive the experiences i had when i was younger with my friends
8332,"Very good game but like all CoDs very short campaign.
Buy it when its really really  cheap."
8333,..
8334,"I enjoy multiplayer in MW2 much more than cod4, however the campaign is infuriating for one reason: you can't fucking lean. Whose dumbass idea was it to remove leaning. I was angry throughout the entire campaign as a result and therefore made it unenjoyable. Not being able to lean forces you to expose your entire body to shoot around corners which lets the NPC's shoot you because they know exactly where you are, getting you killed every time. And this wouldn't be much of a problem if the NPC's did the same thing except THE FUCKING NPC's CAN LEAN.
I don't know who is responsible for this but I hope they were fired.
Also your allies in this game are as accurate as storm troopers, I might as well be taking on the enemy myself.
Also, don't even bother playing the campaign because when you reach the mission Exodus, it bugs out every time you reload a checkpoint meaning you have to complete the entire mission without dying once.
Big fucking surprise, I finally finish the mission without dying only to have the game crash before it starts the next mission and saves. Fucking garbage. Avoid this shit-pile."
8335,Nostalgia
8336,Mending nge crack asu
8337,Get iw4x more players still need to buy the game first tho
8338,"I cannot get this to run with Windows 10, would not recommend buying since I can't play it at all. I have struggled for almost 6 hours trying to get this game to work trolling forums and playing around with config files but none of what I've tried has been able to get this game to run. Update: I got this game to run and played for about an hour. However, when I came back to play it again I was once again unable to play it"
8339,"do not recommend for online play , hackers hackers hackers. but if you want an original for the story mode its great . dont think its worth the price caz the online is trashed. but still good oldy"
8340,I really love the game! Mainly the story... It feels like an uncharted game but in first person. I would recommend this game to anyone who love action adventure linear story games.
8341,"thinking of my time with this game on the PS3 circa 2010-2012 genuinely makes me sad, the worst kind of nostalgia"
8342,I would smash :]
8343,"one of my first cod games. while it has some flaws it still is a ton of fun to hop on and play some matches here and there, spec ops missions are fun, the campaign is iconic, and there are still is a community playing!"
8344,"this is a fun multi player shoot em up, i guess there is cheaters hanging out, i got booted from a server for killing the host then i could not get back in to the game, had fun, i uninstalled it, what ever cod.   if you want a fun game the first player has some real crazy times in it. multiplayer is fun but, you deal with cheaters"

A good game

+ Great soundtrack
+ Graphics
+ Story

and i'm still playing it 
i give it a 10/10"

8348,CLASIC CALL OF DUTY EXPERIENCE
8349,Special Ops now working again. So all happy here. Thank you!
8350,yes
8351,got banned for using mods to play offline with bots

8361,vs
8362,"Campaign is short, but filled with action and the classic MW characters we all know and love. MW2 multiplayer is my favourite call of duty multiplayer by a long run. MW2 multiplayer has everything you want minus all the extra bullshit in the newer cods. MW2 is my favourite COD and 100% worth getting!"
8363,trash go away wasted my money dont buy poo poo game HACKERS and TRY HARDS YAY FUN
8364,My personal favorite MW campaign and one of the better COD titles in general. Multiplayer is absolutely timeless; the population hits 500+ players on weekends and matchmaking is still quite fast considering how dated this game is.
8365,EPIC
8366,Really love this game and one of the best campaigns in the series just the multiplayer is slightly ruined by mod lobbies
8367,would not recommend to hack :(
8368,TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING...
8369,The only game that make me cry
8370,Shepard is a meanie :(
8371,how the fuck is this game so good. Please make cods like this again!
8372,"Alright it's 20 bucks big deal! MW2 is still worth the 20$ it's asking for because 1 thriving community on the main steam servers, epic campaign still worth playing, spec ops is nice, and finally with a mod called IW4x you get a new influx of player with new and old maps from cod 4, mw2, mw2 dlcs, and even black ops! New weapons such as the ak-74u, m40, peacekeeper, golden desert eagle (cod4), and dragonov! And even if you down want all this then just play the steam version. Totally recommended and stop bickering about the price lol."
8373,"The best call of duty to play. The base multiplayer game is however filled with people who have been playing since 2009 so be ready to get spawn killed ALOT. In 2019 most are playing iw 4x        a sorta ""mod"" for the game that has custom games with so many different rulesets such as a terminal 24/7 server, a nuketown server stuff like that. Its sooo fun."
8374,I played only a bit of multiplayer but the story was awesome because i haveant finnished the game sinsce ps3 4 years ago
8375,"Better and cheaper than newer cods, although quickscoping is sometimes an issue and no, it's not cool anymore it just makes others feel like s h i t and ruins your mood. A great sequel of the first mw too. 


Multiplayer playtime: 1000+ hours"
8376,"The first FPS shooter I have ever played, and by far one of the best.

10/10 would recommend buying to relive memories
"
8377,Great game I love it
8378,Campaign and spec ops are fantastic. Multiplayer is fairly active for an old COD on PC but the constant modded lobbies and terrible servers drag it down
8379,"Amazing campaign and a timeless classic, multiplayer is full of lag and hackers though and to be honest i wouldnt waste your money."
8380,good
8381,Been super great so far doesn't even require a good pc to run. Matches are easy to find there is still many people playing in 2019 (which I was very surprised of) Definitely cop this while it's on a sale or smth it's worth it!
8382,"Edited review: I finished the game like yesturday, Here we go again.

So i've actually known cod for a long time know, i played ghosts on my friends ps3, I played bo2 as well,  I have AW on my ps3 and some people say it's, bad? I don't like playing on console so i bought a old school one and that is MW2, Great game honestly, No russian is a bad mission where you just brutally kill civillians, fuck Makarov, Only way to get back at him is to yeet a frag when he shoots you at the end of No Russian, Not gonna kill him but gonna kill like half of his squad lol,  Cliffhanger was a nice mission, And the Favela one with Soap Roach Sandman and Nikolai,  It's weird because at the end when you get to the helicopter the entire squad jumps on a roof, Roach slips and grabs on to the edge, And soap failed to grab him, But like Soap was directly looking at Roach, In cliffhanger Soap did not even focus on Roach and grabbed him at the last second, Most annoying one was with the white house when you had to plant green flares on the white house roof, Because there is like a radio repeating the same fucking shit over and over and over and over a fucking gain, ""iF YoU ArE hEaRiNg tHiS yOu ArE A hIgH vAlUe"" Bla bla something, And won't stop shitting you untill you plant greenflares on the roof, or just put them, or just wave them, "" E n d g a m e"" was also a nice mission where you get to kill Shephard, Loose ends is a ""bad mission"" Since Roach and ghost die, Everyone overreacted when that happend, Lol i'm kinda upset when characters die but my bro is like ""WHO GIVES A SHIT HE'S/SHE'S NOT EVEN REAL"" Lol, This is a great classic/oldschool cod game, Absolutely great.


[spoiler] Thank you for reading my review on MW2, I hope you have a nice day. [spoiler]"
8383,+rep good game
8384,"Oh MW2 what can I say its so much fun. Even with all the bull****. Love this game to death. 

There still are 350+ players online, mainly TDM. Modded lobbies occasionally, but nothing crazy. Haven't gotten into any XP lobbies or super jump infinite ammo, etc.

Best Call of Duty EVER! Much faster paced than MW3. I find games so much quicker.

Oh the campaign is good too."
8385,hot
8386,gratest game
8387,"good memories on this game, annoying that people still noob tube."
8388,Brings me back to the good old days.
8389,tactical shadi imcoming
8390,The grenade launcher spam in multiplayer is fucking terrible (what a surprise) but still great. Not to mention the campaign
8391,yez
8392,The beginning of the revolution in Call of Duty series - that game makes me miss the old times.
8393,This game is the real deal. Totally legit. I'd buy this game 4 times.
8394,Best COD game
8395,yuh
8396,get it
8397,"This game is amazing has one of the best multiplayer of cod history, story and interesting spec ops mode. But there is one thing that has to change or has to be taken out of the game, we all know it and it is (noob tube) people just spam it over and over and takes the fun out of the game. I know most dont know how to play and thats the only way they get kills.
----------overall this game is fun to play solo and multy but without the noob tube----------------
story 10/10
spec ops 8.5/10
multiplayer 8/10     would be 10/10 just without the noob tube spamers (I know you guys agree with me on this) well the noob tube part"
8398,High Defenison
8399,"This is a great legacy game. Which still has following since its release years ago.  

Just a pity you cannot install the PC version from your retail DVD package anymore, it only installs from STEAM.

If your system crashes - you need to reinstall it via steam, regardless of having the actual retail ActiVision disc package."
8400,"The multiplayer for mw2 is great to this day. It is a LOT IF fin especially with friends and there is barely any hackers. If you get bored of the Steam version you can download iw4x, its a server browser and you can play with modded Guns and maps, barely any hackers there. Hope this was helpful:)"
8401,"The question is, ""Do i recommend this game?"" and to that i say, ""Of course!"" This game was here ever since i was young, i grew up playing this game and it honestly is one of the best COD's ever created, from game-play to story. In this game you could easily fall in love with any character, for reference, Simon ""Ghost"" Riley, he was only in this game and not the COD prior to this games release. We all loved his backstory, and when he was finally killed, everyone's heart was broken. The story was basically a middle finger to the media as well. Like the mission, ""No Russian,"" one of the most controversial moments in gaming history. This was around the time when Call of Duty's basically said, ""F*ck your feelings,"" and this i really missed. Oh yeah, and no supply drops which we all hate. This was one of the last Call of Duty's that were amazing before COD's massive incline. Game-play wise this game was really fun, all guns were a viable option, and of course, noob toobs. They were amazingly annoying but once you finally killed those people that were camping in the corners, and noob toobing, it was super satisfying. I only have a few hours on the game as of now but i can guarantee that i have at the least a couple hundred hours, even days. I always found new things to do, like achieving new kill-streaks and getting that glorious, ""Fall,"" Camo. But i'm going to go back to the story. There was so many memorable missions, especially Mission 15, ""Loose Ends,"" I almost remember every single mission name in order, i have replayed the campaign many many times. and there is news circling around the Call Of Duty community that suggests that a MW2 Remaster will come out, which i believe, but that it will only be campaign, many are angered by it, but i really don't mind, i could play it over and over again just to relive those moments i had when i was younger. There was one theory that i read that maybe they are remastering every Modern Warfare to ready players for a supposed, ""Modern Warfare 4,"" Which i would love to see. In conclusion, this game has a special place in my heart, and I will always remember it, and  I can remember playing with my dad, which just doesn't happen anymore."
8402,"This game is great but it is a server list of hackers
"
8403,MW2 is as of yet the best Call of Duty that I have played on my mac
8404,"The campain and gameplay is great, but in multiplayer the game really suffers from poor spawning and the lack of dedicated servers. Connections are usualy pretty shit, and it seams pretty normal for the host to change a few times between games.

Buy it on sale for the campain, but not the kneecapped multiplayer.
Can only hope for a remaster/rerelease that fixes the server issue."
8405,"Continues the story of Modern Warfare series with new mechanics and additions as well as downgrades, adding to the already large list of issues they now removed the last ""bastion"" of defense in terms of tactical gameplay, the legendary lean function. Campaign isn't all that long, the story/lore is still interesting, the added ""most controversial mission in gaming"" is a hot take, there's now an addition of Spec Ops and MP offers more than its predecessors MW and WAW."
8406,Yes iz nice
8407,A good game but sadly it's dying slowly.
8408,The only reason I still play this is purely for the Special Operations.
8409,"[b]Review is 99% positive![/b]
Although there are few things, that I didn't like (Let's go from ''Negative'' to ''Positive'')
Negative: This story felt uncompleted (for [url=www.store.steampowered.com/app/7940/Call_of_Duty_4_Modern_Warfare/]Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare[/url] it didn't), because [b](Big spoiler ahead!)[/b] [spoiler]Soap MacTavish and Captain Price didn't kill Makarov (for some reason).[/spoiler]
And now for the positive things:
Everything other than previously mentioned stuff was gorgeous. I love the gameplay: The gunplay is just amazing compared to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/]CS:GO[/url](for example). The missions of the campaign were very interesting: I went to so many different places etc. So the last sentence already leads me to the next topic: Campaign: It was extra nice. (Although why did this [spoiler]dickhead[/spoiler][spoiler]Shepherd[/spoiler] kill [spoiler]Ghost[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Roach[/spoiler]?). Overall it was extra dope. My favourite missions were [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imvViSk0n-A]''The Only Easy Day...Was Yesterday'' aka ''The Oil RIg Mission''[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HquNnMVzOw] ''The Gulag'' aka ''Save Captain Price''[/url] (Also you'll get a funny achievement: ''Soap on a rope''). Overall solid over 5 hours Campaign experience.
Also the weird freezing in cutscenes from [url=www.store.steampowered.com/app/7940/Call_of_Duty_4_Modern_Warfare/]Modern Warfare[/url] wasn't a thing anymore in this game, which I liked a lot. Also I loved the breaching mechanic, it was nice, but for some reason the developers removed the ''Q & E'' peeking mechanic. It hurt my brain, to play without it...
''Remember, no Russian.''
The Multiplayer was OK, but I won't probably play it. The Spec-Ops is only interesting with friends.

So is it worth 19.99‚Ç¨?
I think it isn't, but if it's on sale, then you have to buy it, no joke! Because for its great graphics, great campaign (with nice storyline), kind of good multiplayer. What could you want more, right? Except you have to buy the next game too then to finish the story.
Also you can buy it from G3A(.com)
[I]It doesn't allow me to write that site name correctly, because why should GabeN lose money because of this site? Right?![/i]

[b]Thank you for attention![/b]

8410,Imo the game play and story was waaaaaaay cooler than the first one but they downgraded the music a bit (cod 4s music is something else dude) I really recommend this game but do keep in mind playing the first one is important if you want to enjoy this to its maximum capacity.
8411,"Amazing story, amazing multiplayer and amazing gameplay. A great game."
8412,"A pure classic to the Call of Duty franchise. The Modern Warfare Series stood out above all the other Call of Duty games. The franchise is so watered down now and the choice to cut the campaign only added to the fuel of Activision‚Äôs downfall. Infinity Ward, the developer for the Modern Warfare series had such a giant series in its hands and is a MUST play for old and new Call of Duty fans. The second in the series, the campaign was phenomenal and brought characters to you that will be remembered for years. The well thought out story and gun fights brought true enjoyment to this game. Between Modern Warfare 1 and 2, that brought the modern FPS online multiplayer together, There is nothing more enjoyable then reliving this classic. Even today, this stands above the current gen games as a fan favorite.
"
8413,Recommend for the campaign only. The multiplayer used to be fun but has been ruined over the years. I personally can't play it and have fun anymore.
8414,"Such a cool game on ps3.
Remembering me to the good old time. 
Great game!"
8415,BAMBI!!!! TANGO SUCKA!!!!!!!
8416,"Back when COD was good, Decent."
8417,"sO FuNnY GaMeS EvErr, I love it...
the graphics are good, the gameplay are awesome!!
I dont regret to lost my money for this game....."
8418,"The Game Is Finish
-%100 Buy,Game Is So Good :)
-I Think Best Cod Game
-Good Story And Good Characters
-A Good Game Of 2009 Making
-See you ghost and others...
and finally
-FUCK U STEPHERD DIE BITCH
"
8419,"Buying Modern Warfare 2 is essentially getting two great games for the price of one. 

The single-player campaign is iconic and the most memorable for the entire series. It's nearly impossible to be bored when each mission is so full of action straight out of a movie. Playing on Veteran felt like a good test of my skills as a player, but also kinda bs at times. It's a challenging time and it can make you resort to playing like a coward, but it's probably the best way to experience the game. 

There is so much for me to complain about in multiplayer that part of me struggles to comprehend why I enjoy it so much. Akimo G18s shredding you in half, the notorious Commando Pro lunges, One Man Army + Danger Close + Grenade launchers. There's so much bull shit that it feels like nothing is bull shit. If everything is broken, nothing is broken, right? This game is still quite alive, and for good reason. The guns feel fantastic. The SCAR feels like it rips people in half, because it does. The echo of Barrett 50 Cals and Interventions that your mind has never been able to forget followed by the satisfying one shot kill. The grind to call in that Tactical Nuke and then have the match end before you get to even call it in. There's something about this game that just couldn't seem to be replicated and even coming back so many years later it's still a great game."
8420,"A game with great, over the top, campaign experience. Story and execution are done very well. Coming from time when you where free to express your story without being afraid it's gonna hurt. It's a arcadish game with ""serious"" theme. Damn good one,

As for multiplayer? A brainless gun 'n' run, meh."
8421,10/10 Mastahpiece.
8422,This game is okay.
8423,great game
8424,best cod after mw3
8425,"Another awesome COD Title nearing the end of the good-times for COD.

Graphically pleasing and even more-so in single player

Sound engine is solid

Storyline is great and exciting!

Price is a bit much for it's age and should be purchased on sale."
8426,"This will be forever my favorite shooter game
"
8427,same o'l noobtubes and game chat as console. legendary title!
8428,wish for better controller support other then that amazing.
8429,i like it i guess
8430,1. Harrier Strike 2. Chopper Gunner 3. You already know whats about to go down :)))
8431,"Remember,no Russian."
8432,Quuick scope :)
8433,good graphics for a 10 year old game
8434,"fucked game, modded lobbies left and right."
8435,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is First Call of Duty Game in My Life & Love it Very Good Game!!
100% Recommend MW2 is legendary Game
The Campaign is one of the best Call of Duty Campaign Ever.!! Much better then modern COD games.
Campaign and Co-Op are really fun
My Favorite Call of duty Game of all time!
"
8436,you have been banned from the server
8437,noob toob
8438,"Fun af, People are bots on it though and i have recieved a threat recently for being better than a player who i didnt even know i faced XD"
8439,So much nostalgia!!! still a noob tho
8440,This game is so good that future Call of Duty games are hardly an improvement to this timeless game. Worth every penny for the campaign alone.
8441,One of the best COD's i guess it's better than Cod Mw3 to be honest.
8442,"Probably the best FPS ever made for multiplayer. Words cannot describe how much fun I've had with this game over the years. New COD games suck so hard now. This game had the best time to kill and weapon balance of all the titles, not to mention better maps and more gun variety in my personal opinion. Multiplayer is still active as of April 2019. Seems everybody is coming back to this title and thank God. NO BS Loot Box nonsense that never adds to the fun. Game developer wasn't busy trying to figure out how to monetize everything and clearly spent more time making a legendary game. I always feel like the other player killed me because he/she was better than me. I never feel ripped off from an encounter. I love the way the game spawns you when you die. Ever play the new titles and get spawned directly behind the enemy team? Yeah I don't wanna kill them like that, if they're better than me then they're better. This jacked spawning doesn't apply to MW2 I feel like the battle lines are fair and never really feel disadvantaged. Play BO4 and I run for 30 seconds to meet with battle and turn around only to see enemy players literally spawning behind my team. If you're frustrated with the new games please buy this and join with the many players who've come back to this title. Only downside is that the game doesn't have controller support, which is rough because you'll have to get xpadder or another software to map controller buttons and it never really feels the same. That being said I still have more fun with this game than any of the others. If you've had enough of enemy players zig-zagging back and forth through a hail of bullets to literally hit you with a bag of bloody coins, come back to this title. Where there's at least a little realism, yes your bullets actually kill them before they get to you, which is nice. You know, bullets, more powerful than a knife or some bloody bag of holiday shite."
8443,Burger Town
8444,"One of the all time greats. Before the time of Colorful microtransactions and horrific lazy Story telling, There was the Modern warfare story and the Black ops series.

With such an amazing multiplayer that is still populated to this day. If you wanna dive down memory lane. Grab this for PC.
Combine it with the server browser mod ( not specifying what it's called just in case) and you got yourself hours and hours of entertainment at your finger tips.

Stay frosty. 
And don't drop the soap ."
8445,Amazing campaign and nostalgic multiplayer
8446,one of the best FPS out there
8447,"Good soap, bad shepherd"
8448,play with a friend on spec ops or you dont win. multiplayer is messed cause of op stuff. story isnt bad but definitely the call of duty formula
8449,"Possibly the best multiplayer experiences by COD... not because of balance; rather, EVERYTHING was SO unbalanced that you could use whatever you want, and still pop off."
8450,big shootY
8451,This is what real E P I C Gamers play
8452,"Bought the game cause I read someone review saying it was easy to find multiplayer games.
It's just not true, 0 players online 24/7. 
DON'T BUY IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR MULTIPLAYER, the campaign and specops is all you get.
Although you can challenge friends to a good old fashioned 1v1 on rust in a private match."
8453,"hands down ""one of the"" best call of duty ever made in it's time period.
The best call of duty in this time period is Cod 4 MW. this game goes second best.

"
8454,yeah
8455,GOAT!! What more can be said!!
8456,This one will remain the best in Call of Duty franchise.
8457,"Ghost my man 

6/10"
8458,as fun as it was 9 years ago
8459,Fun game but the multiplayer is pretty dead so if you want this game your just gonna play is the campaign
8460,This game doesnt work on multiplayer because of wrong versions.
8461,360 no scope across the map wall bang. Good game
8462,also bahd
8463,adsfhdfsadghghjm
8464,This game ruined more friendships than UNO and Monopoly...combined
8465,"A classic. Very fun. Get ""I W 4 X"" for dedicated servers and no cheaters, FOV settings, unlock all, etc. Steam servers are not awful either."
8466,cool
8467,This is still one of my favorite games. In my opion this is the best COD game still.
8468,"Good game also i love CoD
"
8469,This is my favorite campaign. I forgot how good it was.
8470,"It's not a bad game but there are a lot of weird lobbies and weird things that happen on multiplayer,other wise it's a good game to play with friends but I'm going to not recommend this game from my experiences."
8471,Buy it. Do it.
8472,"Very ASTONISHING game. Graphics are good for the time it was released.
STORY: Very good. I played this game 3 times and I still love it. Great voice acting, etc. It catches the players emotions very well.

""I cried at the last mission"""
8473,"I grew up on this game, in this series, I do not know what to say is bad or good but 
what I know exactly this game is the legend of the shooters.  
This series today is in the dick, but some of my heart belongs to them."
8474,"One of my favorite games. The Ranger missions do a great job at making you feel like you‚Äôre in the middle of a war, whereas the 141 missions are more tactical and stealth oriented, but equally intense. In addition, the overarching story is original. And you get some great voice-acting from Lance Henrikson, Barry Pepper, and the legendary Keith David. Probably a classic at this point.

9/10

SPOILER ALERT below





Shepherd‚Äôs motivation isn‚Äôt made clear but here it is: ‚ÄúI lost 30,000 Marines.‚Äù And ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a war hero, and I will dispose of anyone and anything that could tarnish that reputation.‚Äù The whole inspiring patriotism thing would just be a byproduct of killing Price and Soap because Shepherd framed them for planting Allen in Makarov‚Äôs crew, resulting in WWIII."

8479,MW2 came back when COD was still good-decent in terms of shooters. In terms of a campaign it is really good and takes about 3-5 hours to complete on normal give or take.  Multiplayer is filled with hackers unfortunately so i cant recommend that part of it. Overall I would recommend buying this if its no more than $10 or cheaper.
8480,Better than MW3 :)
8481,classic
8482,multiplayer barely fucking works
8483,its a game that i can't belive how great it is if only a few steps were made to prewent heckers from joining hands and hat down best call of duty game ever made it holds up to all future and past releses of call of duty best game of the sereus as of 2019 its shocking how bad map desighns become after mw2. the maps in and after black ops 2 became so generic you played it once you played them all it became so bad i never boght another cod title just bad maps to expect and maybe one ok one in there. mw3 holds up in class setups but lacks in owerall game balance so 3-4 guns rule supreme and in mw2 its like no gun is realy supreme or realy bad killstreaks are at its hight and even after aimbots and hacker trash floded multiplayer its just so great to play a match with frends from time to time. i just wish the glory days of mw2 return if i was able to go back in time to the relase date i 100% buy it again and play the crap out of it more tahn i actualy did becuse tehn i new these is the best cod game ever relased and noone will ever top it and as for any typs a future cod combine mw2 and mw3 the amazing (maps class custumization from mw2) killstreaks and mw3 suport class streaks mw2 perks mw3 specialist class weapons across both titles many belive taht the perks from mw2 were to much and a few of them did owerperform but the fell of them made the multiplayer realy great and all of them except one man army and maybe the enoying final stand were great and balanced for the game enviremant they were put in becuse it had the right fell and you had to secrefice one op perk for another the combination of mw2 and mw3 in my mind is the perfection that call of duty can ever achive but since i now taht will never hapen i am a dreamer oh well... so mw2 must have best cod of all time anly the mentioned mw2 mw3 combo can ever take that away from it but since that will never happen best cod of all time... :D
8484,best call of duty
8485,"An absolutely great game, you don't find gems like these anymore."
8486,"Modern Warfare 2 is a timeless FPS masterpiece. MW2 is the prime example for what a AAA FPS should deliver.

Pros:
-Single player story is well paced and well driven. Entire cast is memorable, even after 10 years.
-Spec Ops is a challenging yet rewarding experience, both in single player and co-op.
-Graphics and animations are still fantastic.
-Achievements are doable but still require skill and time.
-Multiplayer is reasonably populated; very few blatant hackers.
-Multiplayer gameplay is as fun, fast paced and addictive as ever.

Cons:
-Some multiplayer balancing can be occasionally frustrating, namely grenade launchers and deathstreaks.
-Very hard to find a non-TDM lobby.

The fact that I can still play and recommend MW2 is a testament to how this game is a relic from a different age. In the past 10 years, no other multiplayer FPS has proven more worthy to be called a classic. MW2 is a 10/10."
8487,an game hast bhtrem to kodes
8488,the best multiplayer of all call of duty
8489,"Suffered the same faith as every other COD game, it's filled with hackers"
8490,"Modern Warefare 2 is what I like to consider a classic Call of Duty, (back when they were still really good games.) Although its release was before zombies became a playmode. The online community is still somewhat active which is nice! So you can participate in online multiplayer. The campaign if you followed the story of the first modern warefare is just as good. In terms of graphics it supports full 1080p HD, which is pretty darn good considering this game came out in 2009. 10/10 IGN would highly recommend to any FPS fan."
8491,"The peak of the COD franchise. The campaign is still awesome, the multiplayer is great for nostalgia.
8/10"
8492,Best call of duty to have ever exist.
8493,You have a higher chance of winning the lottery than finding a lobby that's not hacked in anyway. The campaign is still a joy to play through but unfortunately spec ops is dead.

Good old CoD MW2.
It's still great.

8507,"A classic. Would recommend. However, don't expect stellar online gameplay. The servers are dead and private hosted ones are infested with modders."
8508,"The classic FPS from the late 00's.
Graphics are beautiful, story is great, although I recommend you check a YouTube video or get the prequel first so y'know what's going on in the story. 

Multiplayer is good, although most players I've encountered are at a maxed level, not necessarily bad, but they can be toxic or too difficult if you're new to multiplayer FPS games. 
The levels vary greatly, so don't worry about getting bored. 

Soundtrack is pretty good.

8532,A game like this will never exist again.
8533,"Well the game itself is almost perfect compared to the new releases, and the old ones,
But the peer to peer system does not work well for the computer version,
And the lack of support for dedicated servers is a big disappointment. 
The peer to peer system sometimes causes massive lag, and sometimes the servers crash completely... 
And finding a server when you have (More than one) friends in your'e party can be a bit tedious,
And can take a bit of time. Though overall it's a good game.

8534,"BEST COD GAME. Well, overall yes. COD 4 started the genre revolution but MW2 perfected it. Excellent gameplay and graphics, dynamic and captivating story and characters. I'll always remember the scene when walking out of the bunker to see the Washington Monument damaged from the DC assault. Spec Ops is a good MP challenge set. Although I buy games for the singleplayer (and this was no different), I love the multiplayer. Although native to me on console, it translates well to PC and brings back fond memories. Too bad all the servers now suck.

10/10"
8535,Great game  ! Even though its old its still fun to play and looks great in 2019. Wish the story mode was a little longer though but thrilling missions through and through with no punches pulled. Sit back be trigger happy and enjoy the ride!
8536,"Best game I have ever played. Campaign is great, many fun missions to complete on veteran difficulty. The special ops is fun, and fun to complete. The multiplayer is the best out of all games. Grenade launcher is op, but that is the only thing that is unbalanced in this entire game. All of the guns are great as well as the speed of progression and grinding it takes to move on to higher levels. This game is even more fun with friends. 10/10 would recommend. 
"
8537,My fav game of all time
8538,WARNING SPOILERS INCOMING the game was good and i was shocked that the main villian inst a Russian mob boss it was a american general i never see an american military video game like this killing an american general.
8539,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwssssssssssssssssssoooooooooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8540,OLD AF but fun multiplaper
8541,"Dont know what to write here other than that its a cod classic, and that I recommend it."
8542,good game
8543,good game lots of hackers got campaign is good guy tracked me down in game to F*** me over
8544,"Great game, install IW4X though."
8545,"My first and favorite Call of Duty, play this game if you have a chance because the community is still alive."
8546,"yeah this game is full of cheaters now , if you want to get some nostalgia i suggest getting it elsewhere"
8547,The best
8548,Wont let me play online plzz help error host every time now
8549,"One of the best shooters made, one of if not the best COD out there as of now. The singleplayer gave my 18+ hours of content to play through, multiplayer 31+ and i still play this now and again. guns are solid, maps are expansive, singleplayer is great with fun missions and an emotional twist, but most important of all, this is where the screaming 11 year old inside of all of us was born."
8550,"This was the first purchase I ever made on steam, before I even had a credit card. This soon to be 10 year old game still has active lobbies on PC, which speaks for itself on the multi-player experience. The modern warfare series also has some of the best and most memorable Campaign missions as well. The spec ops are alright on their own, but A+ if you have a friend to do them with. Honestly 10/10 game"
8551,my favourite game in all the CoD saga
8552,Pretty good game even though its a little old.
8553,very nice game
8554,One of the classics and its still easy to find games
8555,AWESOME DUH
8556,fucking amazing
8557,Really a well made game all around. As a lot more potential to it.
8558,Still one of my favorite games when I was a kid. tons of nostalgia
8559,"This game is good. For the $20 you have to use the campain and special ops are very good, but the mulitplayer has a bit of hackers, does not stop me from playing tho"
8560,It's MW2 it's amazing I can't say anything else. Disagree and I will get my good Old pal Danny motherfucking G to come fight you.
8561,Hands Down One Of The Best Cod Games Of All Time
8562,great game but after you have it for a few days it doesn't FREAKING start i cant play the game i can only play the multiplayer now so my review is in the middle if you only want to play multiplayer
8563,"Questionably the best game by their developers from my eyes. Though I can't really recommend as I do not trust the anti-cheat. I had shared this game with my friend which is VERY good at the game. They were reported for ""hacking"" and I was banned for it. Smooth move valve."
8564,"Still somehow crashes and glitches in 2019. Hold this L, this game used to be great"
8565,No russian

8571,It's a classic and I hold close to my heart.
8572,i love this multiplayer game better then any other mw versions. nice movement engine make this game different then others. i played over 1500 hours
8573,"MW2 is good for lower end PCs cause its not that hard of a game to run and its one of the best COD games 
btw if u want a good first person shooter this is the game cause the campaign is FUCKING AWESOME 
Have Fun And Good Luck"
8574,Nice game
8575,it a fucking good
8576,"Doesn't work on WIndows 10 with AMD cards.  COD4MW, COD2 and MW2 are all broken. Tested on two systems, one with the preview(beta) build of Windows 10 the other with the most Current build as of today.  Game fights with the OS over the mouse. While the mouse moves the screen stops updating even though logs indicate the frame rates never dip under 140. Stop moving the mouse the screen updates the cursor/ crosshair(happens in menu and in game) shows up where it would have been expected to move and the game continues on. Keyboard actions do not trigger any issues. Once you move the mouse the screen remains frozen perfectly still until the second the mouse stops. Then the screen resumes updating.  Once again, logging frame rates to a file, the gpu never slows down, the frames rendered stay over 140 per second. 


 Unplugging all extra monitors fixes the issue in COD2 and improves the issue in the other two games so that instead of a total freeze under movement it stutters instead.  The issue is not present on older IW games like COD and United Offensive. Nor do I have problems running a large number of modern graphically intensive games at high settings. This is specific to IW 2.0+ engines, Windows 10 and potentially AMD drivers.

Ryzen 1700 Rx 570, 16gb ram. I've tried the last three driver iterations from AMD as well.  Don't waste your money. It's one of the best games to have every been made but it doesn't work and there is no incentive for them to patch it since they would rather sell a remaster."

8588,i play this in 2019. WORTH IT. :cartman:
8589,"It's fun when there are no hackers around in lobbies, multiplayer that is.

No matter what, Spec-Ops and singleplayer campaign will always save this legend of a game. An instant classic."
8590,Its a good game you should try it :)
8591,10/10
8592,"Everyone has that game that defined their childhood, and Modern Warfare 2 is that game for me. It released when I was only twelve years old in 2009.  I have played this game on PS3, Xbox 360 and now PC. I love the PC version of this game. The PC version was able to make this almost decade-old game feel brand new again and for that, I really appreciate it. The multiplayer is still thriving on PC compared to the console versions."
8593,This has been hands down one of the best Call of Dutys I have ever owned and I still play it almost 10 years later.

Very fun game!!!"

[b]THIS REVIEW DOES NOT EVALUATE MULTIPLAYER DUE TO LOW QUALITY NETWORKING[/b]

[h1]Story[/h1]
Set in the year 2016, it has been five years since an extremist faction of Russia's Ultranationalist party attempted to nuke the United States' eastern coast, and fives years since a nuclear weapon was detonated in the Middle East; killing tens of thousands of U.S. marines, enemy insurgents, and civilians alike.  In that time, the Ultranationalist party has managed to win the presidential election in Russia and take control of the country while America's war in the Middle East continues to rage.  Split into two separate campaigns between the American Rangers and the hand picked elite Task Force 141; MW2 has a lot of globe trotting.  After a major terrorist attack on a Russian airport implicates America as the perpetrating party, Russia invades in retaliation.  While the Rangers do their best to hold the Russian advance, the boys of 141 rush around the world to hunt the true mastermind of the attack, who seems hell-bent on pushing the planet into a third world war.  As a means to set up incredible action and scenery, MW2's story excels.  As a cohesive, logical narrative, the story falls apart entirely.  The man personally leading the massacre at the airport is a world wide known Russian terrorist who seems to be capable of avoiding security cameras entirely as he slowly walks through the halls; machine gun blazing.  The story is full of oversights and outright illogical situations like this one that really make the story seem decidedly less than modern, despite its title.  Still, for every bad scene that makes no sense, the game is loaded with good ones.  Characters aren't particularly interesting or easy to connect with, but the game still pulls some clever moves to get an emotional response out of players.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Modern Warfare 2 is a very standard shooter, but what it lacks in original ideas, it makes up for with excellent weapon feel and balanced play.  Weapons come in many rather redundant varieties but there are several standouts and all of them feel excellent to shoot regardless.  Even the pistols have a satisfying laser accuracy to them when aiming down the sights.  Enemy hit reactions help top off the good game feel by tripping, stumbling, falling over, or flying in whichever way they were hit.  Frag and stun grenades are useful for suppression and the one hit melee attack can save your life in a pinch.  Weapons can also be scavenged from the field with useful attachments ranging from scopes to silencers to a radar like screen that detects nearby heartbeats.  The game's overall pacing is excellent with larger, sometimes harrowing battles lasting just long enough to make the player beg for a reprieve only for them to be rewarded with one.  A few occasional turret sections appear that neither thrill nor bore.
Veteran difficulty ups the ante significantly by dropping player health to a minimum.  For the most part, this is exciting and can be overcome with careful use of cover and fast but accurate aim.  However some of the MW2's more pitched battles or insane moments throw so many enemies at you, that it can be a slog to find the right path to victory.
The campaign also includes 45 collectible enemy intel laptops, but finding them won't render anything other than a Steam Achievement, if that's your thing.
Adding longevity to the game is the inclusion of Spec Ops mode.  Playable solo or cooperatively with a friend, the mode includes 23 missions that range from 1 minute snowmobile races to 15 minute survival challenges, and even asymmetrical co-op levels in which one player makes their way through night time farm houses while their buddy provides overwatch from the gunnery seat of an overhead AC-130 gunship.  The mode is a lot of fun and each of the five tiers increases the difficulty it will take for players to unlock each level's three stars.
Perhaps the two biggest gripes for MW2 is the player hit reaction.  Taking a bullet will cause your aim to fly wildly in a random direction and taking multiple consecutive hits will rapidly spam your aim around.  In principle, this isn't a bad idea as it keeps players from being a full on death machine that they A.I. can't fight back against, but it's far too aggressive and could stand to be toned down some.  Far more egregious is the blood effect that absolutely dominates the screen when the player's health is low.  Alerting the player to their imminent death is a very good thing to do but not when done to the point that it's a complete detriment to aiming and situational awareness.  Low health is a player's most desperate moment and in that moment they need to be able to see clearly in order to save their own skin.  Being blinded is not fun.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
Modern Warfare 2 looks quite good.  Environments are loaded with detail and small destructible objects and some areas and scenes are absolutely gorgeous.  Soldiers look alright but aside from a few of the characters, do very little to stand out from one another.  Fortunately their stellar voice acting makes them immediately identifiable.  Texture work is easily the weakest link on close inspection but in the heat of battle everything blends together just fine.  Animation is excellent stuff with everything from clean and weighty reload animations to vehicle physics and in-engine cutscenes.  The musical score is adequate some of the time and an utter treat during some of the game's best moments.  The opening recap of the story's previous five years has a score that instantly puts players in the proper mood for the type of game this is going to be.  The credits sequence deserves extra credit itself for not only being an interesting surprise but being fully explorable after the fact.  Overall, MW2 is a solid package that sometimes reaches exceptionalism."
8622,"Remember, no russians!"
8623,Good.
8624,oof
8625,love it always will love it been playing it since launch BEST COD EVER MADE :)!!!
8626,"It's not as good as COD4. Not even close. Multiplayer is alright. Singleplayer is not alright. 
But if you go on to a website called google.com, you can find a mod to let you progress through the multiplayer suite against bots. Freakin' awesome.
Keep it a secret."
8627,fucking fix the join friend
8628,"For me this is by far the best call of duty games they have released as well as mw3, played endless hours and had a lot of fun. Some decent maps, guns etc well worth the money !!!

Call of duty games these days seem to be boring too Arcady and not graphical enough especially playing in 720p is an utter joke."
8629,"I thought that I would enjoy multiplayer, but I mostly dont. Maps are designed in a way that supports camping. People often use granade launchers, which results in your instant death - and there is nothing you can do about it. If you wanna buy some older cod, choose modern warfare, modern warfare 3 or black ops 2 instead."
8630,Amazing Game!
8631,WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS GAMEEEEEEEEEE>!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????
8632,"got vac for cet engine nice
 
10/10
would not recommend having a 3rd partrry open niggerrs my rr rrkey is fucked"
8633,The first game I play went I grew up and i never forget the name Soap and Price
8634,"i love this game very much. but sadly in multiplayer mostly everyone is a hacker. i mean , auto sniper shots without aiming, i shot kill. this could be better without these cheaters."
8635,great  game  8.5/10
8636,"""They say truth is the first casualty of war. But who defines what's true? Truth is just a matter of perspective. The duty of every soldier is to protect the innocent, and sometimes that means preserving the lie of good and evil‚Äîthat war isn't just natural selection played out on a grand scale. The only truth I found is that the world we live in is a giant tinderbox. All it takes...is someone to light the match.""

9/10"
8637,Ver good YES
8638,enemy ac130 above !!!!!
8639,"The audio's ruined and everything sounds like it's behind me even if I use a 7.1 headset. This whole ordeal with not being able to hear where the enemy's at, completely ruined the entire experience for me. 

Don't get me wrong, the graphics are still good, didn't see any glitches or bugs during my playtrough, and if it wasn't for the sound, I would have given it a thumbs up for sure. Sadly though, I just can't stand being shot from every direction and not know where it's coming from, before I actually see the one who's shooting at me. 


If you can deal with this, buy it, if not, wait for remake or something instead."
8640,the best cod ever nothing will ever compete with mw2
8641,"Best multiplayer in COD. Don't be surprised if you hear n words, f words, and any other racial or homosexuals slurs when playing."
8642,"This game is responsible for so many good memories and great friends. Hardcore Mosh-pit back in the good ol' days was an absolute blast. Joined my first clan in this game, and those members would go on to be close friends even to this day. I am so grateful to this title for giving me a sense of belonging when I needed it most. 10/10 

Recently, the game has been reduced to hackers and a small playerbase consisting of mostly foreigners that are finally buying it at a discount price. (nothing wrong with foreigners, it's just hard to find a game with good connection because of the game's 'Host' system.) The only playlist that people join is 'soft-core' Team Deathmatch ( which is boring and makes only a few guns viable in my opinion). You're lucky to see 300 players online max on a good day. I wouldn't recommend getting this game at this point in time because it will not deliver the riveting experience it did back in the day. However! maybe if everyone did buy it and play it, it could be revived to its former glory? I can only hope."
8643,It is a very fun and intertainig game
8644,The best Call of Duty ever made hands down. Little to no cheaters on the Multiplayer in 2019! Amazing.
8645,good game
8646,"My game restarted for no reason and i worked hard on missons not happy cod not happy
"
8647,"awesome game, with pro players in multiplayer."
8648,Great game in all
8649,"I sometimes wonder. In total, if you took all the accumulated video time on Youtube. All those billions of hours stored on it. What percent of that is just old forgotten MW2 Frag Montages set to Thirty Seconds to Mars?"
8650,"I love this game, but unfortunately i am not being able to open my nat inside the game eventhough i have it open on my pc, any help would be much appreciated"
8651,Was the best COD game and still is.
8652,very good
8653,"There is an error saying couldnt load image 'falling linear'
P{lease Help"
8654,A great followup to MW. Interesting to see the fight come home. I wish though we would have seen more of the home front stuff. I'll have to see what happens in #3.
8655,a classic with great graphics well worth it
8656,"classic COD. still overpriced as shit for a 10 year old game, but its probably the 3rd best one ever made."
8657,"even though is old, is still gold, one of the best FPS so far in terms of story and gameplay, cinematic and fast pace yet I didnt get bored playing it repeatedly
need more chicken from colonel sanderson ( Õ°¬∞ ·¥•Õ°¬∞)"
8658,This is great better then black ops 1 but the online is closed
8659,Very good game. Many hosts and very balanced multiplayer !!!!!!
8660,wow queen youre so beautiful
8661,fun to play great campain and the main story.
8662,It's a lot better if you have friends to play it with.
8663,"The campaign of MW2 is the best ever and the multiplayer also, but now a days MW2 Multiplayer is so broken. Campers, noob tubers are ruining the game. There have some moded lobby, I don't like those.
Despite being all of this MW2 is still great.
But it's not the game you buy and play in 2019."
8664,"One of the best CoDs, sucks vanilla on pc with the 65 fov and listen servers, but good with iw4x. Campaign and spec ops are pretty fun too."
8665,Master Piece
8666,I've never played better game than this one
8667,"It's Call of Duty. you're not buying it for the deep gameplay, you're buying it for some mindless fun, although... 9 years after its release, i don't see why anyone would buy this for the multiplayer...

BUT what i CAN recommend is the campaign. no, it's not space nazis invading earth, or robots invading earth, or nazis again. the Modern Warfare games all have their own story AND an overarching chase for the bad guy.

the campaigns are great, and everyone has their preference, although i can't give my favorite at this point, seeing as i can only remember this game since it's the most recent i've played.

seriously, if you find the MW Trilogy on sale (like it is at the time of me writing this), pick them all up. what you get is essentially a Hollywood action movie you play with an amazing soundtrack to boot, although not really, as there's actual character and stakes here (you stop a nuke from launching in MW1, and WW3 kicks off in MW3. just saying).

get these games. i know CoD 4 is moddable to a degree, MW2 has spec ops and MW3 has survival and i think some spec ops, though i can't remember right now. seriously. they're all great. pick them up. play them. i guarantee you'll get a better story for the low low price of $40 (at the time of writing, you'll have to cough up $80 for the whole trilogy, but the only extra content there is for these games is multiplayer related, and they were released in a time before the lootbox pandemic, so is $80 really that much to ask for three amazing games? ok, to some people yes, but it's up to you if you want to spend $15 bucks on candy or put $15 bucks into your savings, right?)"
8668,After 10 years the game is still full of 12 year olds. Good old COD!!
8669,"this was the last good call of duty. playing this now as of 2019 brings back so many memories. the broken g18 akimbos, the model 1887 akimbo and tactical insertion teaming to get a nuke. seriously the best multiplayer call of duty and the 2nd best campaign prior to its predecessor. my favorite weapons to use were 

ACR - FMJ or Silencer
M9 - FMJ
Scavenger
Stopping Power
Commando
Semtex
Concussions
Painkiller

Scar-H - FMJ
M9 - FMJ
Sleight of Hand
Stopping Power
Commando 
Semtex
Concussions
Painkiller"
8670,"I only recommend two COD titles and that's MW and MW2. Anything after that, is all greed ..."
8671,"Was the best game, still is the best game!"
8672,When COD was best
8673,"In retrospect the best COD in my opinion, spent months playing it on PS3. If you want explosive action, you have one of the greatest single player campaigns, if you want to have a really good time with a buddy, you have the spec ops mode. And if you want to be absolutely annihilated by lightning fast tactical knife wielding 12 year olds, you have the fantastic multiplayer.

10/10, do yourself a favor and buy it, worth it even now."
8674,Superb
8675,One of the best Modern Fighting games of all time. Must have!!!
8676,good game
8677,"Pros:
‚Ä¢ Part of great trilogy;
‚Ä¢ Story;
‚Ä¢ 3 characters, 2 plots driven in turns, connected at most dramatic point of story;
‚Ä¢ Spec Ops mode (Echo missions are pretty demanding);
‚Ä¢ Veteran in not too hard and not too easy, pretty balanced;
‚Ä¢ No multiplayer achievements needed for 100%;
‚Ä¢ Museum (and possibility to kill Makarov);

Cons
‚Ä¢ None."
8678,my childhood
8679,Cool Game
8680,the best call of duty ever it updates sooo fast than modern warfare 3 and finds server so quick for me
8681,cant get better than a bit of modern warfare 2 ;)
8682,"In this game you play as a member of task force 141 ( lead by captain soap) and you gotta find this terrorist organization who shot up an airport and also killed a CIA agent who was pretending to also be a terrorist, So then you gotta go to the mountains and shoot people while riding on a snow mobile. But wait, the Russians found out your guy was a spy and now they're attacking the U.S with helicopters and missiles, so now you have to rescue captain Price who's being held in the gulag so he can help you send a larger missile into outer space to knock all the Russian missiles out of the air!!! Needless to say the games pretty fun."
8683,"The single player is great and can run on quite low end machines fairly easy. Will run fine on anything above a HD3870. I'm running it on a R7 240 DDR3 64bit and a 2.5GHz Core 2 Quad. Multiplayer will scratch that CoD itch but people habitually cheat in this game and ruin it. I've even had someone open up gay porn in my browser when they rage quit (not joking) while squaring off against other cheaters. Hackers paradise is this multiplayer which is really ironic since this game does not have dedicated servers specifically because they felt it wasn't the way it was meant to be played (which is really the 360). I blame Activision and Microsoft for that though not the devs.

Not a bad buy for under $10 like I bought it for. Still shows that the original Infinityward devs knew what they were doing."
8684,If you don't like this game then what is wrong with you...
8685,Very nostalgic at this point. I loved playing this game as a young teen.
8686,"Good story.
Fun multiplayer.
I am 9 years late to this game... fuck!!"
8687,"Had put about 2000h+ on the PS3, and still thought it was worth buying for my computer"
8688,"Campaign is one of the best in the series in my opinion, multiplayer is obscenely annoying though, everyone constantly using RPG's or grenade launchers. Good game 10/10"
8689,"Very nice game, fasted paced shooter"
8690,Pretty decent but basicly dead.
8691,best game
8692,10/10 was pissed about the dedicated servers thing when it came out but I lost like two years of highschool to this fucking game.
8693,10/10
8694,"nice game
"
8695,The story line is good the graphics are pretty goog for a game that came out in 2009 and last its really good with its guns because they actually used accurate guns that the army your in would use. I would definatly recommend this game.
8696,Modern Warfare 2 and 3 are the BEST Call of Duty series!!!

8698,Modding is fun :3
8699,"Damn, those feels! 

Missing old days playing this game with my friend :(

Best COD game ever."
8700,"The Modern Warfare series are the true call of duty games, this one being the best. From the greatest story mode ever constructed in Call of Duty, despite the coolest character ever, Ghost, dying. The multiplayer still epic and cool as its ever been, and the spec ops always being a challenge everytime I play it. MW2 is the one and only dingle best Call of Duty game made and no COD game will ever be as good. 10/10"
8701,"Classic.

Its PC support is.... mixed, even during its prime it was not liked (No dedicated server, mod support, etc)

However its fun to hop into matchmaking nowadays, I recommend using AgentRevs's fov changer to prevent motion sickness."

8703, Play this if you want that 2009 experience back again. You may need a CRT TV and a semi-broken Xbox 360 controller for the full immersion and nostalgia that this will bring you.
8704,best call of duty ever made
8705,"very epic
i recommend"
8706,yes
8707,"A classic, with some great missions. The multiplayer maps are great but they should have added bot support, which has to be found elsewhere, made by people such as R.S.E."
8708,"I'd highly recommend, this is one of the few COD's that isn't trash. It is just as fun as I remember it being from my childhood."
8709,The game is a classic and the multiplayer has aged like fine wine. You can still easily find a game on Team Deatmatch and Free For All
8710,"The single player is the main attraction for this game. Besides my memories for this game, I love it because the music combained with the highlights in the game make for an enjoyable and short experience. Single player is 10/10, if you can get a friend to buy this game also, trying to beat every Spec Ops mission on Veteran is also VERY fun."
8711,"This with Tubes, OMA, Danger Close = Best game ever XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"
8712,"Easily in the top 3 best CoD games. The i W 4 X Is amazing only issue is i apparently have 267 hours as it runs in the background sometimes?
Custom servers maps are great still upholds for a 2009 classic"
8713,TACTICAL NUKE INBOUND
8714,Cloud save unusable.
8715,"It's hard to say if I recommend this or not. One one hand it's the greatest CoD ever made and playing it brings back so many great memories of playing this on the 360 back in the day. However on the other hand, you've got the reality that it's hackers paradise and most matches you get into will be hacked, or at the very least modded. Lost track of how many times I've gone to play Team Deathmatch and ended up playing a modded version of Domination. 

I'd say it's worth it if you can get it dirt cheap. Various sites will sell a Steam key for this for around ¬£5. Wouldn't pay more than that purely because of how hackers pretty much own the servers."
8716,[spoiler] Rip my boi Ghost. [/spoiler]
8717,"ACTIVISION Adds ""SHAME MARKERS"" Next to BLOPS4 NON SEASON PASS Owners !!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQSv70Sf-qw

Activizzard has sunk to a new low. I won't be changing this review. The game is the last great in a series of now microtransactions and now shaming someone that didn't buy the season pass. Thanks for reaffirming that it is a great idea to buy from other companies and not from you."
8718,"One of the best Call of Duty's ever. Had a great plot line, characters, and is very replayable. Although, Infinity Ward for some reason thought the one many army perk couldn't ever be broken, it is a fantastic game."
8719,Standard Call of Duty fun. Arcadey shooting for a quick fix of action.
8720,Old but gold
8721,"Highly recommend after all this time, and here's why: (I only bought it for single player)

The graphics have not aged, and continue to blow me away. The game is amazingly optimised and although it looks amazing, runs very smoothly on low end computers. 

The gameplay and shooter mechanics have to be one of the most notable in history. Call of Duty has always been one of the best shooters out there, and I find the game satisfying and rewarding. 

Something that stands out to me most in a game like this is the story in the campaign. Honestly, I only played this game for the campaign, as I heard it was brilliant, and I was in no way disappointed. There is incredibly detailed character development for a story based on running around shooting people, and there was emotion, anger and all sorts of revenge and spite interwoven into the story - you really feel for the character you are playing for which is cool for sure.

I really enjoyed and still do enjoy playing the game, as once the campaign is finished, there are still options to complete duo scenarios and even create private servers to play with multiple friends. I love how this game never ages and so still 100% recommend a buy!

"
8722,Made that last mag count.
8723,BEST GAME EVER
8724,"While many said that I would hate this game if I played it today and my love of it was only ""due to nostalgia goggles"", recently replaying it, the game is still one of the top 3 best if not the best CODs in the post COD 4 era, 16-17 maps without needing dlc, tons of weapons without needing supply drops that are viable, and pro perks are why this COD is still the gold standard of COD.

However, always leave immediately if a modder is in your lobby, as rank resets and such are possible, which is why I still hate the fact that MW2 launched without dedicated servers, and every PC COD after did as well until Black Ops 2.

Also, fuck OMA/Danger Close/Noobtubing scrubs"
8725,How could i not
8726,"Can be a bitch to get multiplayer working, but besides that it's very fun.
Don't buy this on the steam page, buy it off a key site, and don't purchase the DLCs.
It automatically locks you into lobbies with people that ONLY have the dlcs, plus the dlcs are full priced after almost what a DECADE of release? Just don't even bother.
2k people at peak nowadays and you can get full lobbies in fan favorite game modes really quick.
Have fun"
8727,i like when you terroist
8728,Good game
8729,freat game
8730,"Arguably the pinnacle of FPS online multiplayer back in 2009. 

Addictive, fast paced gameplay - many guns are very strong with high damage and minimal recoil. It gives players a range of weapons to dominate with.

Unfortunately there are occassional hacked lobbies - to be expected at this point but bare it in mind. Really good to play for nostalgic sessions with friends. 
"
8731,Terrible
8732,"I decided to buy this game over the holiday day break since it was on sale. I hadn't played in quite a few years and remembered the campaign as being a lot of fun. Though it's still fun, it has definitely aged.

All in all, it's still worth it for a low price though more recent games have done it better."
8733, I GOT VAC BANNED BECAUSE OF A MOD INFECTION IN THE WHOLE LOBBY
8734,Fucking HATE CAMPERS AND NUKE TUBES!
8735,The death of this franchise started here.
8736,"Good game fun , exiting and for a game Thats OLD still fun"
8737,"I enjoyed this game so much when it first came out. I played it for hours, days, weeks, months on end. Eventually we 'upgraded' to a PS4 when it came out which means I lost access to the game. I realised how much I really loved this game. Many years went by and i got my own PC, and I found out i could still get the game on steam. 

After I rebought the game on steam about a year ago I installed it as fast as i could and jumped straight into the campaign. I was overwhelmed to relive the old nostalgic days of when i played this game. The campaign, the visuals, the sounds, the characters, the plot, the maps, EVERYTHING was absolutely amazing. In the course of 3 days (cause of school getting in my way), I finished the campaign again. The story is so good that I played it through on every difficulty again and again. One of the things that set the line between this COD than the others is the soundtracks (Hans Zimmers). Holy shit they are amazing, and it gives the campaign so much more atmosphere, and just makes it overall even more intense. Characters in this game (spoilers) like Price, Soap, Ghost, General Sheperd, Foley, Dunn, etc. just leave me hooked. This is one of the only COD games that has an amazing multiplayer that you can literally just play for hours on end. (Some others being BO1, kinda BO2, MW1, MW3). I just thought I would write this because BO4 recently came out and it doesn't even have a campaign :(

Overall rating: 11/10. If you haven't played this masterpiece, definitely play it as it is now quite cheap and it is just overall an insane game."
8738,Classic Game Very Good
8739,Well in the Franchise for soem reason does not fit the best. I feel always sick after playing this game . May be the camera moves way to fast
8740,A classic. The best COD by far.
8741,"This is the game PUBG wishes it was, 
 MW2 gives  the meaning of ''immersiveness'' an honourary mention

Great graphics for age, 
NOTE: Windows 10 users: Install DX *&* VCREDIST2005C++ :) no problems,

Multiplayer saved by VAC< Its still super fun averages 2k players per day- open your ports and thou art a host. NAT not strict.

P.s. Infinity Ward made thee best COD games :)"
8742,xD
8743,10/10
8744,Best COD hands down! Remaster plz
8745,yes
8746,"Best game of my childhood, along with Final Fantasy X and World of warcraft Vanilla."
8747,10/10 game
8748,People only in some gamemodes. TDM and ground war seem to be only game modes that i can find a lobby. But MW2 still MW2
8749,"this is old game and still the best!
"
8750,"Call of Duty is the one of my favorite war game.
The story line is so nice, cant wait for another Call of Duty version."
8751,"The online is sorta dead which that's all I play. I have fun with it though. It's not as hacked to hell as I thought it'd be. Get this game on sale, no old cod is worth full price anymore."
8752,"it good, `cause it good"
8753,"Amazing multiplayer, but very underwhelming campaign.  Could easily be beaten in under three hours.  [spoiler]All the cool/decent characters that you develop connections to just die or have unanswered endings with an obvious lack of intention to finish their story.  The rest of the characters just suck ass and bore me to death.[/spoiler]

Multiplayer not dead, but is not as good as MW3 imo."
8754,"This is the 2nd best game I have ever played! Right after 'Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare'. I feel this game is good because you get to know the characters like Cpt. Price, Ghost, Soap and so on. They are all the most badass characters I have seen in video games EVER! The graphics, gameplay, visual effects, storyline & realism are all factors that add up to how good this game is."
8755,Play for the campaign. Multiplayer is dead.
8756,Combat efficiency. Good game.
8757,"Everything in this game is great every inch. But there's 1 thing that i'm very disappointed in this game is that the servers in multiplayer, it's lagging to much tuat the game became unplayable, i mean not all servers all lag, but most of them are laggy."
8758,"Very good game, solid multiplayer. Very good story. All around solid product"
8759,Literally my fucking childhood I would recommend this game above any other game.
8760,Classic
8761,Nice Game
8762,Too many hackers 1/10
8763,a must have classic.
8764,Such a good game still holds up todate but theres just too many hackers/cheaters and the matchmaking is just unplayable but if you have a friend its still so fun to play 1v1 on rust or something like that :)
8765,"It's an ok game, BUT... it's still a COD game. I'd say wait till it's on sale, but even then $10 for a 10 year old game?"
8766,"Good shooter, good story, good characters ! Respect !"
8767,"Easily one of the best games ever made, the Graphics are Rough but are still amazing for their time and they are still good enough to play through, being better then even some games to date, of course the more powerful you pc is the better it will assist, not that there is a need for a good pc to even run this pc ive seen people run it on macs, laptops and potatos, ill address the hackers as that was one of the larger issues back in the day, its rare to find them really rare but if your on the game long enough you will fall into a hacked session, you can instantly tell because you get pulled from team deathmatch into something like capture the flag, theres colours flying in chat and theres more players permitted in a single session, but you can just leave and join another lobby, this is the only hacking ive seen at all. (Multiplayer) 

The Campaign is to Die for, its something we as fans of Call of Duty miss, theres clear directive, theres plot twists, looks of action, its difficult, better and more clear choice in difficulty typically described as stars or veteran and so on.
Yet it keeps it both simple, playable and easy to follow, the twists fit well and you can notice hints towards then end, and though its suprising it doesnt drag you off track.

Theres a good few Gamemodes of both multiplayer and the default game, The main ones youll see on Multiplayer are the Team Death Match, Capture the Flag, Domination and Private Custom Lobbies, All Very Fun i suggest trying them all!
For the Default game we have Special OPS and the Story Mode, The Special OPS is a challenging two player battle ground, with multiple scenarios range from different back drops and class, some times racing, sometimes bombing, some times attacking objectives and sometimes even defusing bombs! Great fun really Challenging!

Get this Game! It gave me plenty of good memories when i was younger and plenty now, even better with friends but that is expected!"
8768,worst campaing i have ever played... just boring
8769,quite good
8770,"Probably one of the grand daddy of multiplayer for me, where it started many years ago, great game play, maps and guns"
8771,"1. Awesome Campaign
2. Fun Multiplayer (altho pretty hard to find server unless you play IW4X)
3. Good PVE mode (Spec Ops)"
8772,It's aight
8773,Amazing.
8774,Still the only good Call of Duty game
8775,its aight
8776,Intervention.
8777,I love this game its really fun to play.But you should fix it on xbox 360 again i loved it even more on xboxx ceep the great work up
8778,"hell yeah
but so many modders rip"
8779,If you like old cod games i suggest this one
8780,"One of the best CODs, worth buying even in 2018."
8781,I liked this game but i'm sick of connecting to dedigamer almost every time i try find a game
8782,"Campaign:
A great story about Makarov the terroist trying to start World War 3 but after the efforts by Task Force 141 and Army Ranger his evil plan fails. The game also provides great soundtracks which motivate the player to fight against invaders and terrorists. And it brings the player to various environments, from arctic to mountains and favela to prisons. Last but not least, there're a lot of memorable moments where you won't forget after playing the missions.

Multiplayer:
A fast-paced experience for FPS lovers. Easily customized loadouts and weapons with low recoil. Those who barely play FPS can still enjoy this game's multiplayer part very much. It has wide range of maps in which some are small areas while some are large wildlands. And there're still lots of players playing in even nowadays. Only con is that too many players spamming noob-tubing which ruins the game.

Others:
Perfectly optimized and smooth controls. It ran perfectly on my old PC, yet it's graphics is not bad even accroding to today's standards. A 10/10 master-piece."
8783,"I kinda wish Steam was as toxic as Xbox Live in 2009.... Oh well, I guess this is as close as I'll get. 
"
8784,"Really short campaign, still one of the best i've ever played."
8785,"Probably still worth it for the campaign if you get it on sale. The last time I checked, the multiplayer community was pretty much dead outside of team deathmatch.

Still, this is the most fun I've ever had with a COD game. To this day I haven't found a gaming experience to match the stress + satisfaction of getting that 25 killstreak and dropping a nuke. It's a shame developer support was total garbage for this. If they had used dedicated servers and actually bothered to patch their game, people might still be playing this today."
8786,"It's just like the end of 2008 on my PS3 all over again.

EXCEPT WITH BLAZING 100 FPS CAPPED AND SUPER PRECISE MOUSE AIMING.

10/10 THIS GAME HALF-DEFINED MY TEENAGE LIFE."
8787,old but gold
8788,"Finally got this out of my wishlist when it was 50% off. Best Call of Duty game by far. Used to play it on my Playstation 3. Great story with meaningful characters. Great multiplayer maps, such a blast to play in. I had to purchase it again! Recommended to anyone but not for the faint hearted. Worth every penny, and even more if you've got a friend to play with. Love it!"
8789,Its possible to dump a surprisingly high amount of time into 7 maps which are stuffed with campers and cheaters.
8790,Amazing game! Superb single player story and Special Ops missions. Thoroughly recommend it. Best purchase I ever made back in the day.
8791,"Played it,beat it,enjoyed it, actually beat it like 10 times since im a cod fan, enjoyed this as much as i enjoyed cod II and I but dissapointe because i thought i would be able to kill makarov but Shepard's death was intresting i guess.

Love it.

8793,Mutiplayer is so bad i cant even play with my brother
8794,"I have always loved this game since my childhood , its such a beautiful game and in my oppinion the best call of duty , 1 thing that i think makes the game very fun to play is the dramatic events that always seem to happen to your character and even just epic events in general this game is 9.5/10 , wish it could get a remaster or even make another modern warfare"
8795,"70%cheater 
20% lagger low fps kids

dont buy this crap"
8796,The game is fun.
8797,"never thought i'd ever buy any COD games, but here I am and I dont regret it at all."
8798,Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2 are still the best Call of Duty games ever created.
8799,Love the story
8800,still the best CoD to ever come out. suprised that people still play it <3
8801,Best Call Of Duty by far. (MW3 comes in a close 2nd with infected)
8802,"The last good Call of Duty, before the series went to shit :/"
8803,"[h1] Good old MW2.[/h1]
[b][i]Best Version of MW2[/i][/b]

Some annoying things about the game is Sometimes you'll search for Team Deathmatch but be put in a Dedicated Domanation game.

Randomly got banned from one for no reason."
8804,Best meme game most that sniper but fun game and i will give 10/10
8805,best game i played multiplayer is damn good
8806,This game brings back great memories. Its fucking timeless and im glad there's a strong player base. I havent bumped into modded matches. Get this game while you can before the sale ends.
8807,bad game
8808,"There will never be another shooter that delivers what the original Modern Warfare series did.

Doom on you Mr. Tango"
8809,"Awesome, probably the best CoD ever made."
8810,"Another part of the series, after Modern Warfare, which takes place in modern times. And this is undoubtedly a successful game that I can recommend to any FPS fan. Interesting missions, rich weaponry and good audiovisual setting. The biggest plus is the plot, thanks to which we feel like in the action movie, which we are the main character. Excellent film interludes that add dramaturgy and stimulate curiosity, which will happen next. By combining it with a trivially simple control, not much hardware requirements and a decent price, we get almost an obligatory position. I would recommend.

Benefits
playability, graphics, great sound, encouraging storyline, good controllability
"
8811,"this game is very fun and i have many childhood memories, but i hope every single noob tuber dies in their sleep"
8812,"CoD when it narrative-driven and good, now its multiplayer mayhem and bad..."
8813,good game
8814,"Amazing, came back to the game after a while still find it great.

must buy"
8815,üëç
8816,Good game!
8817,"MP is absolutely dead: laggy servers, mediocre maps, awful design, cheaters, ridiculous experience system, default fov 65 which might be changed only with unofficial files, bad balance of abilities. Also, the strongest noobtubes are here.
The next CoD (BO1) is far better."
8818,"Call of Duty MW2 has one of the best multiplayers in a CoD game, even after damn near 10 years InfWard has mastered the multiplayer in this game. 

The story mode is one of the best ones as well (Next to MW1 and BO1) I highly recommend this game :D"
8819,I have played all of the games up to bo2 and if you like the cod franchise I would recommend this game
8820,controller capability please
8821,Cried like a little girl when Ghost was shot. 11/10 recommend ;-;
8822,It's a fun game. Its older but the game play is still a good time. It's still my go to when not in the mood for something else.
8823,Awesome game
8824,"ahhhhh, the good old days..."
8825,Get commando pro and run around with a care package... you're welcome
8826,Ghosts?
8827,"Good game and probably the best Call of Duty ever, you'll find cheaters very often, but when you don't it is an awesome experience. Its fast paced combat where you have to constantly flick your mouse is awesome."
8828,"Bought it for the memories.
So worth it.
"
8829,So Great ! Play This You Will Love it <3
8830,"At this stage i don't have much good to say about the game. I think got banned for cheating and one big problem on my PC got hacked all my stuff got change had problems with steam and battle net. Battle net  seems to have sorted out my stuff in under 24 hours, but here I don't even  get replay or the  game doesn't work . Formatting my pc and getting most my stuff back already costed my a fortune. And not to be able to play or get feed back on a  game i purchased makes me sad. Not even talking about the problems i am suffering from Dota 2.
"
8831,How could i not
8832,<3
8833,"One of my favorites Call of Duty games, its good in his story, and mechanics"
8834,"I like shooter games but this was very violent, by that i mean, In the first levels, i had to 'spray down' civilians that didn't do nothing wrong but i didn't as i couldn't do that and after that in the next level, i had to kill a dog which was supposed to attack me, i try but i stopped as i can't do it because i like animals, and don't get me wrong, ohhhh you are just too sensitive, i'm not but i have some feelings and this destroys them, and it doesn't feel right to me. I know you can skip levels but if its gonna be all the time with killing civilians and dogs etc then with all that skipping i will skip half the game... 
      If you are not that sensitive and you are ok with killing civilians (The level after the snow thing with the Russian guy) and dogs (After the Russian guy mission) which the dog attacks you but still, it looked cute xD, i can't kill it, and if you are gonna say that i am too sensitive, answer me, if i a dog attacked you in real life but you had a choice to run away to safety 100% or kill it and survive 100% what would you do? (100% cause if i don't like the game 'i can run away'  aka leave the game) 
     So to sum its a ok-good game but if you sensitive (not to a point to be afraid of everything but to some things as i stated above) Because i am ok with dealing with enemies but some things.... then don't buy game , if you are not so caring about that and it doesn't bother you, go for it!!"
8835,"Fantastic Call of Duty game. This one is my personal Favorite. Despite it being several years old, the campaign is extremely fun to play through, which I have done 5+ times, and the special ops are all well made and very enjoyable to work your way through, especially with the co-op functionality."
8836,Not a bad game! Some things about it are a little cheesey. AI is really bold. I liked it though!
8837,"everytime i finish this game, i cry. if you havent played mw2, you better play it soon"
8838,One of the best games i ever played.

8841,"Modern Warfare (CoD4) is the game that sucked me into first person shooters. The campaign is great, and even now years after release, I'm replaying the trilogy. Maxed out on my new PC, even an older game like CoD4 looks awesome. The controls are easy to map to your liking and the story is really engaging. This continues on into MW2 and 3, with an exciting and surprising conclusion. The multiplayer brought me hours of fun with friends, and I especially like the more tactical modes like Search & Destroy. It's easy to discern that the Modern Warfare series is one of the most popular CoD titles with it holding a decently high price and even earning a remaster for the first in the trilogy."
8842,"[b]Intro[/b]
My personal favourite CoD, and an absolutely phenomenal game. It's no wonder this game sold bucket loads. It may have changed the tone of the series from here on, but I can't fault it for that. It's just superb.

[b]The Great:[/b]
++Brilliant gunplay
++Legitimately jaw dropping set pieces
++Very memorable levels
++Fantastic story
++Spec-Ops is the best addition to a CoD game and is a total rush. With so many levels and a ton of replayability, it's almost like a second, nonsensical campaign.
++Multiplayer is an andrenaline fueled blast

[b]The Good:[/b]
+Also easily my favourite characters in a CoD game. Ones you actually give a single crap about.
+Some of the best weapons in a CoD game
+Looks amazing visually with extensive graphical options and optimisation. Runs like a dream on modern hardware, no tweaking or fixes needed.
+Decent sound design
+Memorable soundtrack
+Has a feel of tension and intensity I've never felt in a game before
+Great cutscenes
+Fantastic voice-acting
+Has a really good atmosphere
+Interesting bonus level

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Honestly, I can't find a whole lot to fault with this game. I don't think it's nostalgia, it's just an exceptional first-person shooter and really, it's a cliche word to use, but it is a must-play first person shooter for anyone that likes first person shooters."
8843,"campaign: solid 5 hours of classic COD gameplay. Story is minimal, but the charactors do have personality.

side ops: Good challenges, slightly easier with freinds.

multiplayer: despite being 10 years old, it does still have players on it. Though I hope you like Team deathmatch and Free for all, becuase those are the only modes that still get played. But chances are if you are buying this game this late into it's life, it's not for the multiplayer anyhow.

9/10 best cod."
8844,Good Game! :)
8845,Those 10 year olds will still be bangin' your mom well into their 30's...according to the community. I swear some of these dudes don't play anything else...
8846,"First COD game, Great start imo"
8847,good
8848,"The campaign is great, but if you want to play this locally on a LAN network with friends, it is totally useless. You don't even have everything unlocked when playing locally, completely utter bullshit.

I can understand not having all weapons unlocked etc when playing online, but on LAN? Come on, not buying another COD game ever again before this is fixed."
8849,"Overrated, but a good CoD."

8852,A true classic. This game is gonna jerk the tears right outta your childhood.
8853,"While not as bad as some of the later entries in the franchise, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was truely the beginning of the end for the once-great series of Infinity Ward developed Call of Duty games. Where as Call of Duty 4 was known for having a very mature story that was told in a very tasteful manner, MW2 seems to go purposely out of it's way to be as edgy and over-the-top as possible, and as a result ends up as the sort of game that only 10-year-old kids think is cool. While CoD4's most memorable missions included realistic scenarios such as sneaking through the abandon village or Pripyat, Ukraine in a guilly suit in a failed attempt to assassinate an enemy leader, providing AC-130 air support for your squad as they attempt to clear a town of hostile forces, and going house to house in the middle of the night in a desperate search for a hostage that is about to be assassinated, MW2 is far less subtle with its mission structure. In one mission, it puts you into a ridiculous scenario straight out of a bad James Bond movie where in you are racing down a hill on a snowmobile, launching your vehicle off insane jumps all the while exchanging gunfire with enemy snowmobiles. In another infamous mission who's sole intent is to be super edgy and drum up as much controversy as possible, you find yourself in an airport gunning down hundreds of innocent civilians. One of the final missions has you facing off against dozens of enemies in an aircraft graveyard where one wrong move results in you getting shot at from multiple directions simultaniously and dying almost instantly, followed by a repeat of the snowmobile segment from earlier (except with speedboats this time) and culminating with the player getting stabbed, pulling the knife out of his own stomach, throwing it at the Big Bad and sticking him directly in the eyesocket. There is also an attempt to one-up the iconic mission in CoD4 where one of the protagonists dies slowly and painfully in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion by doing the same thing no less than three different times, including getting shot in the face at the end of one mission, getting burned alive at the end of another, and the aformentioned scene in which the Big Bad thrusts a knife into your character's stomach. All of this happens in a campaign that is less than 4 hours long.

The multiplayer is unfortunately not any better than the single player. Instead of trying to improve upon the well-balanced multiplayer of CoD4, the devs seem to have simply thrown up their hands and gone with an ""anything goes"" approach. In CoD4, players would need to carefully choose which equipment to bring into battle. You couldn't have an assault rifle with both a grip to decrease recoil and an ACOG sight to increase magnification, and thus you would need to carefully chose which attachment best suits your particular playstyle. In MW2, that choice is no longer neccessary since you can just have both at the same time. Another baffling choice is the decision to make the Shotguns equipable as secondary weapons instead of primary weapons, as well as adding the ability to duel-wield them. This desicion was particularly succeptible to abuse as a certain 150-year-old shotgun that you would unlock upon reaching the highest level could be effectively dual-wielded without any penalty to range or accuracy, thus resulting in high-level players being able to use said shotguns to snipe people from across the map (although this was later nerfed with a patch, the fact that it was even a problem in the first place shows how little effort the devs put into balancing the multiplayer). Instead of addressing the camping problems of CoD4, the devs actually made it even worse by designing maps in such a way that seems specifically designed to give campers a huge advantage, while also adding the Tactical Insertion item that allows campers to spawn right back in their camping spot. One map set in a rock quarry is particularly bad, with one of the two major major choke points for team A being overlooked by a sniper window that is easily accessible from the spawn area of team B. This resulted in several memorable games for me wherein the other team would send a single sniper with a tactical intertion to cover that choke point while the rest of the team went to cover the other choke point, thus effectively trapping my entire team in its own spawn area. Another bad map takes place in an airport, where a sniper with a tactical insertion can sit in the cockpit of an airplane out on the tarmac and have full coverage of an important corridor within the terminal, thus effectively cutting off access to that corridor until someone is able to enter the plane, kill the sniper and destroy his tactical insertion. Almost every map in the game is afflicted with similar issues.

Finally, Modern Warfare 2 is the first game in the series to feature an incredibly sloppy PC port. When you first start up the game, the options menu can not be accessed until you start a new campaign and sit through an unskippable cutscene. In addition, while the PC versions of CoD2, CoD4, and CoD World at War included PC-specific features such as buttons for leaning left and right and a developers' console, as well as including all of the previously released DLC, MW2 was the first game in the series to not include any PC-specific features as well as the first to make PC players buy all the DLC separately. Seeing as it is basically a sloppy port of the Xbox version, you might expect it to at least have support for Xbox 360 controllers like the PC version of Black Ops that came out the following year, but this game doesn't even have that. Overall, it is a sloppy port of the game that signalled the beginning of the end for the once-mighty Call of Duty franchise. I would recommend any of the previous games in the series as well as 2010's Call of Duty Black Ops over this game.

EDIT: Here is a youtube video i found that does a better job at explaining a few of the many, many problems with this game's single-player campaign, especially in comparison to the previous games in the franchise.

8854,Good Game.
8855,"The campaign is fun but in the mission Exodus, their is a bug when you die everytime you shoot your gun the laser just pops out of no where and ruins the experience of the mission. PLEASE CAN SOMEONE FIX THIS CRAP!!!!!!!!"
8856,good game
8857,Just the BEST Call Of Duty !
8858,"awesome game, event if it is old it is one of the best call of duty games"
8859,"One of my many childhood games, for sure my all time favorite and will forever be. I Played and finished it on my PS3 for more then 20 times i think, this is my favorite game of all times, made my hole childhood, you have to buy it, now!!! its a masterpeace, amazing, kicking, fun,a great storyline and everything that every fps game would like to be, do yourself a favor, grab a damm copy of it (if you havent already),  10/10"
8860,"At 20 bucks I wouldn't recommend this game, and the online from what I've seen is mostly dead. It has a decent singleplayer though, campaign and special ops."
8861,Awesome campaign :))))))) PERIOD
8862,Nostalgia time ;) Best game in this cod series.
8863,THIS GAME ITS JUST AWSOME!!!!
8864,I like the gane but i waish to get rid of it for another game. Is it possible to get my money back or even half the amount back I spent. I spent 50$ on the game cause i got the dlc package. Is it possiblle for stean to refunfd me the money? If so how can i reach them. through emal or phone. I would really like to get my money back. Otherwise it is a grat game an di would definatley reccomend
8865,"okay just buy it, no need to explain here"
8866,"For Modern Warfare 2, I'm only reviewing the campaign. Modern Warfare 2 is my favorite game in the Modern Warfare trilogy. The plot can be dumb at times, but man is the campaign fun. Just like the first game, Modern Warfare 2's campaign is filled with so many memorable moments, like the No Russian mission, the invasion of America, the favela, and the river chase."
8867,"Game does not launch. I have tried various solutions, but none have worked."
8868,Û†Ä°
8869,√ßok iyi olm
8870,10/10 should still buy today.
8871,BEST GAME IN  2009
8872,"Finished in 8 hours. I found it better than Modern Warfare 1 and can't wait for MW3 to go on sale to pick it up to continue the series. Full price is too much to finish in so short a time. I don't play multiplayer. Oh and why, oh why why why do the developers insist on a loud obnoxious soundtrack that you can't turn off? You have to close the game, find the directory files and rename the music folder to turn it off. Had to do that with MW1 too and it was very annoying. Other than that, good game."
8873,It¬¥s The Best COD i ever played in my life
8874,"Grat game, Brings back some good memories!"
8875,Nice game
8876,This game brings back so many memories of the good days of 2009! Fab game. Needs to be remastered for next Call of Duty! :)
8877,verryy guud
8878,multiplayer sucks. wish nerds would stop turning tdm servers into domination
8879,"Best Game Ever.

But.. Delta, Ehco missions in Special Ops were deadly hard.

I also think when developers are making these missions, they must talk about that, ""How we can make many players are painful when they're trying to play these missions with 3 stars??""

In private, I still fighting with A.I but dead soon infinitly in 3 stars.. (+10hrs only in Delta)"
8880,MW2 is the best call of duty games ive ever played epic campaign fun spec ops mode but nobody plays multiplayer 9/10
8881,This is one of the best ever COD games in the series go get it if you've not tried it..
8882,meh
8883,"So I bought this game again after getting a new graphics card, and I am so happy that I did. It brings back so many memories of playing this game years ago. The campaign is (in my opinion) the best campaign out of every Call of Duty game - The characters are likeable, the story is brilliant and the gameplay is amazing. As a previous review by another user states, people STILL play multiplayer (mainly Team Deathmatch) to this day! 

The only thing that I wish for is for Infinity Ward to make a Modern Warfare 4 and bring back Ghost (many fan theories stating that he survived, he was my favourite character along with Captain Price)."
8884,Prostate
8885,"the best call of duty game ever and just fix the modded server/hackers with aimbot please :D
if update will come to this game this is will be better then call of duty IIII (4) and i love this game and the story mod
i done this review with a like and donate :D you must to buy it :""D"
8886,If you have never played mw2 you need to do it rn. For me this was one of the first call of duty games I got into hard . I have done campaign prob 10 times on my Xbox and purchased it again to run trough it on the pc. Also have multiplayer level maxed out . And I‚Äôm starting to play multiply player again ... that‚Äôs a lot of time over lots of years and I‚Äôm still going at it
8887,"Good storyline. The Modern Warfare series will always be the best in my opinion. The good ol' games were better than today's Call of Duty games in my opinion. Battlefield 3/4 graphics with a Call of Duty Modern warfare storyline would have people going nuts. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Cool action scenes such as the EMP, helicopter mini gun part, Cliffhanger, the final mission, Predator drones, the U.S. neighborhoods, Burger Town, and Whiskey Hotel. Too bad the series seemed to be discontinued. Dunn, Foley, and the Rangers were awesome. The characters and missions were awesome. You could really feel the emotions of the game after soaking it all in, especially in Whiskey Hotel where you're fighting to make a last stand to stop D.C. from being bombed into oblivion, the gameplay is fun, plenty of attachments and weapons to use, and cool action segments, along with a multiplayer, and PVE Spec Ops. This is my favorite Call of Duty game, of all time."
8888,This and Black Ops 1 <3
8889,Cool :D Very very nice game :D

8935,"One of the best shooters ever made. Even close to 10 years later it still looks great, plays great, and has around 1500 players logging in daily to play a match or two. 

The Single Player Campaign is great, but I think this game truly shines in the Multiplayer. It added much needed complexity to MW1s multiplayer, but has a more concise and focused feel than MW3s multiplayer. I think it's a perfect ballance, though some might prefer MW3 due to the sheer amount of content."

9024,"The Pinnacle of CoD Fish history, you want the best of the best, you get this game. Great Single Player content, Multiplayer is still very much alive, there is also the Online Co Op mode that is a blast with friends. 

I would recommend this game to everyone, it gets a solid 10/10 :D"
9025,not bad
9026,Game is fine but the multiplayer community is equal to ebola.
9027,"Great game evn though it isn't the newest game.

9030,Golden age of CoD. One of the best in the series. Nostalgia at its finest.
9031,I'm nominating this for best alternative history award fall sale 2018.
9032,mw2 is luv C:
9033,"Still one of the best games I ever played. Lots of fun with friends. Best game at all, if there weren't these one man army tube guys, but just kill them and you're fine :D"
9034,This is the i think best game of the CoD name.
9035,AWESOME
9036,Such a classic...
9037,Best game.
9038,"Fun to mess around with friends in the multiplayer, and the single player campaign is very interesting."
9039,"Still the best game to my knowledge on the COD franchise. This game has caused alot of nights LAN-ing, yelling and sometimes cursing. Good to play."
9040,stop lookin at my profile
9041,one of the best!!!!! 10/10
9042,Amazink
9043,Last good CoD before everything went to shit!!
9044,Who on the world doesn't like this game
9045,Best CoD of all time!
9046,Very nice game!
9047,never change's
9048,call of duty died after MW2.
9049,Best cod ever. Better than all the new ones
9050,good
9051,Still one of Infinity Ward's best games.
9052,best game ever!
9053,this is possibly the only game to exist
9054,10 days ago this game became Game of the Year 9 years in a row
9055,Best Call of Duty
9056,This COD is why I have friends. It's still good after all these years
9057,The story is really good and i keep replaying the game over and over again.
9058,Best cod
9059,it is still a good game and really fun even in 2018!!!
9060,"Definitely the best Call Of Duty game ever made and one of my all-time favorites. I used to play this game on console many years ago and decided to purchase it again in an attempt to relive the good old days. The campaign, multiplayer, and special ops mode are all incredible. Surprisingly, you can still find a match when playing online (as of November 2018). It‚Äôs just as frustrating and toxic as it was back then, but the OG players like me still love it.

It really is a shame, seeing what happened to the Call Of Duty franchise. Kids today will never be able to experience the same greatness and excitement that we once had with the Modern Warfare series. Even if the multiplayer completely dies out, I very highly recommend playing this game along with the other Modern Warfare titles. And remember - ‚ÄúNo Russian.‚Äù"
9061,K.
9062,its okay
9063,Great game
9064,BEST GAME EVER
9065,gold.
9066,"Remember, no russian..."
9067,One of the best games of all time
9068,Still one of the best shooters to date.  Multiplayer seems to have died though
9069,"A good game ridded with hackers. It is a p2p based game, so third party applications are used by others to rid of people they consider 'toxic'."
9070,Very good timeless game!
9071,Arguably the best Call of Duty.
9072,"beutiful Game, Great campain, Multiplayer could use some refineing 9/10"
9073,10/10 No Hackers
9074,Excelente multijugador <3
9075,Just buy it...
9076,dick and ball
9077,This game slaps
9078,simply one of the best campaign ever
9079,9/10
9080,great game
9081,"Love it, Just wish these modders would leave and that this game would be brought back to life."
9082,Not bad.
9083,still the best CoD in 2018
9084,5/5
9085,after all these years... still the best cod
9086,"This game brings back so many memories of the good days... Great game, no complaints"
9087,This Call of duty is probably the best of all Call of duty
9088,much wow
9089,nice one
9090,So many years later it is still a pleasure to play this game
9091,10 tricksots out of 10
9092,Just still a amazing game/best comunnity
9093,"Almost 10 years old and the dlc are still 7 quid, classic cod - 10/10"
9094,im so horny
9095,heck yes
9096,Still one of the best Call of Duty games
9097,"Old, but still good to play with frends."
9098,"If you haven't played this by now and still need a review, I guess you were born after the year 2000? 

Wow, you so yung.

Well, this is the game your grandfather really liked to play with his friends. You probably have a new version of it, since this franchise will never die."
9099,Great CoD game in times when Activision didn't release the same game every year.
9100,Old school and still cool!
9101,9 years later and still fun.
9102,Great game
9103,good old days
9104,My wife left me
9105,Old but Gold.  A lot of people still play the multiplayer because its so good.  Campaign is very good also with great voice acting and fast pace action.
9106,"I love this game. Ever since I played this on console back in 09. The way the game feels is amazing. It's fast paced classic cod. With boots on ground, what more can you ask for? The game does bring back great memories, but the only issue is that it's kind of dying. Barely anybody plays so you can't really level up and unlock the guns/camos you want to use. :L"
9107,One of the best entries to the series.
9108,I'm kinda' surprised cuz' I've played for over 3hs straight and haven't found a cheater... I'm glad I bought it again. :'D Altough hard to level up.
9109,"This game brings back so many memories of the good days... Great game, no complaints

420/10 would joint ops again"
9110,still as terrible as it was in 2009
9111,Best CoD game ever. Period.
9112,Dont bother buying this game. Noobs and hackers completely ruined it. Used to be great but now fucking retarded kids come in and think they own it and it ruins it for legit players. dont fucking waste your goddamn money
9113,Enemy AC-130 up above
9114,"I got VAC banned 3 years ago just by been thrown into modded/hacked lobbies on matchmaking, and now it seems like i can't even get in the multiplayer menu, this one was my fav CoD and now im only able to play alone in SP mode"
9115,This game is by far the best game ever! I played thousands of hours on console and loved it so much. Modern Warfare 2 is by far the best COD game on the market. The matchmaking is pretty good consideriing I get into Dedicated servers about a quarter of the time. 10/10 would pay 60$ to play. iWX is also available on MW2 and has hundreds of server to play from.
9116,"Can't express how much I love this game. Brings back a lot of memories and fun. Doesn't matter how much a play it, it's always one of the Call of Duty's that never gets old."
9117,"Get this game, seriously, it is one of the best shooters I have played. I didn‚Äôt realize this had a storyline when I bought it so I will have to get the first game so I can have some context. But from playing the single player campaign, I can tell you that this game is worth it."
9118,"Short, but good game. Loved the story, you have much more to interact with than the last Modern Warfare."
9119,Awesome as fuck
9120,Timeless and still populated
9121,"""No russian."""
9122,Just recommended
9123,Best game every. period
9124,"Last of its kind. COD MW 1 and 2 did something that the others can't keep up with. (Full review coming up)

[h1] FINAL VERDICT: 10/10 [/h1]"
9125,Actually this game is a masterpiece! It's released in 2009 and in 2018 people are still playing it!
9126,was good a few years back....
9127,Does this game really need any introduction?
9128,"The best character died so I got angry, in multiplayer I got hit by a grenade launcher so I got angry.  I started using grenade launchers and now I am no longer angry.

10/10 would want to restart the game to have Ghost alive again.

0/10 would want to restart the game to have General Shepard alive again."
9129,noice
9130,the game is fun
9131,Hacker infested dead game
9132,"The multiplayer is good, if you dont find cheater."
9133,The last good COD....
9134,"Played a couple of COD and in general, MW2 is pretty sick and is one of the top few IMO. However as new COD releases, the number of players playing MW2 drop significantly thus pretty much wouldn't recommend this game at the current moment."
9135,"It continues what is left on COD 4, the singleplayer is awesome and the gameplay is easy to use, loved this game"
9136,"The best call of duty game, hands down no competition, still holds up and is still well worth the price definitely recommend!"
9137,"one of the best stories ive ever seen, even thought its short (6-8 hours), it's an amazing game!

9138,"If all you like is Team Deathmatch, or just want the campaign then it might be worth it. Other than that, you aren't getting into any lobies because it's mostly dead except for TDM."
9139,great campaign
9140,One of a kind
9141,"A great game but plagued with annoying technical problems such as Lag, Timeouts and Unnerfed Weapons such as the UMP and Noobtubes (M203 and GP25)."
9142,"Jesus Christ for a four hour long game this took forever. I was so bored by the end I wanted to smash my head against the desk until i was unconcious just so I didnt have to play this any more. The story is so stupid I wanted to drown my computer to put it out of its misery, it didn't deserve this kind of torment. Russia invades America? Bull, bull crap, this is stuff only a game license like Homefront could come up with. I really love the level where I have to sit around and protect a stupid box, and the levels where I'm facing down like fifty enemies at once. 

I've never noticed this before but the knife has probably one of the longest reload times for a knife in the history of knives. Stab, wait an hour, stab again. Oh, and let's not leave out the ""controversial scene"" first off, the nuke or missile or whatever in the last third? Yeah, seeing it from space doesnt make it any less of a boring shock tactic. And lets talk about the airport shooting scene, and why it doesn't work.

For all you COD fan boys out there about to pull your pants up and start yelling about how ""YOU CAN SKIP DIS SCENE YOU FRICKIN NOOOOB!!!"" shut up and listen up. I can also skip the entire game too but I don't because I thought this might actually have some value after the stellar World at War blew my mind. It's a part of the game and I get to critique it because of that, and for a scene it sucks, it sucks hard. First of the plan is the dumbest in the history of plans. Send an American in to infiltrate a terrorist group and if he gets shot by anyone and dies, then unmasked you go to war with Russia. Nobody is this stupid, I'm a dorky jerk sitting at a computer and even I can figure this out. And somehow this small group of terrorists can take out an entire Russian swat team with no casualties? Again, BULL. 

The one scene I actually liked was the snow mobile chase, and even then they screwed it up with the stupid boat chase that wasn't nearly as well put together. Every step forward they take they immediately take two steps back. Even the graphics, amazing I'll be honest, but I can barely see them when every inch of the battlefield is covered in blood or smoke or dust GOD I hate this game! And all the fake out endings, just drawing it out while I'm begging for the whole experience to end, down on my knees in tears just praying that the credits will roll and release me from my torment. 

What a living nightmare, thank god it's over, I guess Black Ops is next right? At least I get to look forward to some more zombies."
9143,Da - I know a place
9144,"This game is legendary compared to today's Call of Duty games. However, it has not aged well at all. The game crawls with tryhards who have devoted their lives to this game and nothing else, dropshotters, explosive spammers, and people who abuse the old physics engine to get knife kills. Play at your own risk."
9145,very good
9146,"This is a very good game in the Call of Duty series.
The gunplay in the multiplayer is very fun.
The campaign has a fairly decent story and an amazing soundtrack by none other than Hans Zimmer.
This game could do with an FOV slider though as the FOV isn't quite as zoomed in as it is in a game such as Modern Warfare 3 but I could do with a wider FOV."
9147,It's like if the first modern warfare was on crack cocaine
9148,"Whats with the gunfight in Rio? That was hard
good game tho"
9149,Needs a patch for controller support and lacks zombies.
9150,"Great game, it is old but still runs great. Well done Activison."
9151,"I really miss this game, back then when call of duty was not crap, when people used to love this game."
9152,"Although i'm not a COD fan, i really like this game, the characters are pretty cool, so is the storyline. For a game from 2009 it still looks really good. The multiplayer servers are still working and i didn't have any problems with waiting too long for other players, this game will always be great."

9154,"A lost of stuff doesn't really work anymore, like seeing, how many players are in a gamemode (which would be crucial to know, since there are not enough active players anymore, to fill most gamemodes. It's just boing TDM all the time). The peer-to-peer system has always been crap and there are hackers all the time. Not worth anyones time. Check out IW4X."
9155,"still a great game,
but mostly nostalgic"
9156,"Getting deranked in mw2 and then be expected to be all chill and to just suck it up, despite wasting countless months to rank up and get that deared acr or that one perk. Blame the ban on the hosts, if I want tdm I expect tdm not ctf by some random modder-host, or my 'favourite' getting booted by host, just because you killed him. That ban is a big fy from the devs, like seriously tho why are the modders freely hosting lobbies, why aren't they getting banned. Favourite game ruined forever. 

tl;dr Got deranked after spending months to rank up, being expected to suck it up.
Game's great, try to avoid toxic lobbies at all costs or risk getting deranked."
9157,"absolutely terrible, would not recomend"
9158,my favourite call of duty of all time : )
9159,"Campaign is really fun to play and very interesting story. The multiplayer is tough to start out with but gets easier as you go along. Veteran on the campaign is very challenging and I only recommend people who are committed to play it. Only downside would be the occasional hacker that you might find in multiplayer lobbies, however it is uncommon."
9160,"c y k a  b l y a t
damn this story is so good. Too bad the multiplayer has more t4rds than a fortnite lobby"
9161,****1/4
9162,Still such a great game in 2018 barley no hackers on and the ones I‚Äôve got to  don‚Äôt really do anything just change the speed of how fast you walk or run.
9163,"Mission failed, we'll get 'em next time"
9164,This game is awesome
9165,Best call of duty ever made.
9166,nice
9167,Great shooter in which you can play for hours without a break. Variants of missions and passage. Good training as a workout and very challenging levels.
9168,trash game
9169,This game has a very good storyline and the story is not as heavy as COD infinite warfare and in terms of Gameplay and graphics is very stunning and exciting to play my rating is 10/10
9170,i mean its an old game but on ps3 its better graphics
9171,"This game isn't just contain DLC, it also contain my childhood."
9172,Multiplayer is still poppin. Occasionally run into modded lobbies but its whatever. But be warned some modded lobbies will instantly level you up to level 70 after you earn one kill.
9173,"That was the shit back wen i was 12 ... Lost its charm now that im 18 . If you are like a veteran in this game don't revisit it , it'll ruin your memories"
9174,please make more dlc.
9175,"COD: Modern Warfare 2 was an extremely good game with a super dramatic story I could tell. The characters were super exceptional, I can say especially that we dealt with Captain Price, who is one of the greatest characters in COD. I don't have much to say, it's worth playing!"
9176,Classic
9177,despacito rip quickscoping
9178,gud game
9179,I love MW2
9180,!
9181,gaem sux
9182,"Best COD ever made, Black Ops 4 is bad by the way. Repopulate the servers!"
9183,one of the best first person shooter with a good story and the spec ops mod is challenging and fun
9184,My favourite CoD. <3
9185,WTF! Steam why i get Permanent Banned. I never done anything I liturally just play it for fun and i got to level 70 and prestige master all by my self i brought it and everything and I just got on now and i went to launch mw2 and it says Steam Connect Failed then in my steam notification it said i been permanent banned for what i never cheat in the game i dont have any files in my mw2 files that i add to it. My game is completly clean i think you mistaken me of someone else steam wtf. Please Just unbanned me cause i liturally didnt do anything i was just gonna hop on and play some few games but now i cant cause im been banned for nothin i see steam wow thanks Banning people for no reason ayy wow.
9186,"I know its a retro and a aged game, its still give me a good rating of why I played Call Of Duty for the past few years. I still remembered my dad bought me the first Call Of Duty, nevertherless, the game was totally Awesome and I did love the storyline.To me, the whole franchise of this game is still up to the standards of players whom is a fnatic of this whole Game."
9187,"Trueachievements.com found that less than 50% of Call of Duty players complete the single player campaign.


on May2018, Treyarch said that ""Our players enjoyed multiplayer more than singleplayer"".



D0uch3b4gs. Fukk1ng d0uchebags."
9188,"I'm not saying this is the best shooting game, but this is the most beauty shooting game. Unfortunately, MP isn't work pretty well, unless you have NAT in ""open"" status. But it's still worth to get. I suggest to buy this when it's on sale.

Just Like Old Times..."
9189,"Single Player Campaign review:
Worthless over-the-top piece of scrap; enough said"
9190,Thrilling sequel to CoD: Modern Warfare. Hilariously portentous but with some genuinely heart-in-mouth moments.
9191,"DEAD GAME no-one plays mp anymore unless you find a 3rd party server.

It's a good buy to revisit old memories and play the story"
9192,"By far the best game from the timeline of when Call of Duty were releasing great games. Not that I personally hate games beyond MW2. I just really enjoyed MW2 (and also sorta MW3) back in the days. Also the closest you could get to realistic shooter games back in the days, competing with Battlefield and all. Good times."
9193,remember. no russian
9194,"My first foray into the CoD franchise (I know, way late)
Glad I took the plunge. The close quarters combat isn't always my style, but wow this game was intense. You have got to be focused 110%
The single player story is short, but crams a truck load into it.

Grab it on special and don't be disappointed."

9196,"*ahem* so I would like to start this review off by saying that this game is the best game on steam. Sike you got fucking pranked kid. its tanner from highschool remember me? Im banging that hot cheerleader now, and im driving a mustang gt. Oh yea i forgot to mention that I make $200,000 a year, what do you make again? Oh yeah yeah..it's me MAX."
9197,"Fun multiplayer ONLY when its on sale because there's generally a lot more players. When the sale ends however, its filled with the kind of people who have been playing this game for 8 hours a day, everyday, since the night it was released"
9198,"A lot of people would agree when I say this is probably the MOST memorable CoD game. You actually get attached to characters then watch as your heart is ripped out when they hit the bucket. :"") Characters are likeable, not annoying, and generally funny. This is a must buy if you are starting out in the CoD franchise."
9199,"MW2, the game that many fans of older entries in the series thought killed it for good...and it's the first one I ever played. *sigh*, time to don some juggernaught armor, I'll need it to deal with this much salt. 

Is it as good as its predecessor? No, but that's due largely to the fact that COD4 was breaking new ground. It brought the military shooter to a mass market for the first time. It created the idea of the blockbuster video game. How exactly do you follow that? Short answer, go over the top. 

COD4 is Die Hard, MW2 is Hard Boiled. The scenario is ludicrous, the set pieces are hilarious and it's all backed by a Hans Zimmer soundtrack. This is an interactive action movie, leave your brain at the door and shoot some bad guys. The missions in this game exist to provide a fun shooting gallery strung together by a plot that technically continues from the previous game, but tone wise is far less grounded. This pattern continued into the third game but that's a story for another steam review. 

Sound design is a step up and a step down from the previous game. Much like BLACK from the previous generation, satisfaction and gun porn was emphasized over realism, fitting the new more tongue in cheek tone nicely in my opinion. 

Level design is excellent, with a few unfortunate smudges. There are a few times when you are charged with proceeding through an alley of doods that just will not stop coming until you move up, but to move up you need to get them out of the way. This leads to gridlock for quite a while as you scoot forward, pick a few off, duck back to rub the jam off your face and then repeat as they've all respawned. That being said, it is more than possible to complete the game for any shooter fan without more than a handful of ""Oh come ON!"" moments. 

As above, keep in mind this was my first forray into the series, so I do very much have my nostalgia beer goggles on. My highschool afternoons were filled with 4 player splitscreen games of free for all on my old 360, and I maxed out my level on XBL. The big thing that people seem to miss is that this is not a military shooter, it's a military THEMED arena shooter. Time to kill is short, run and gun tactics are encouraged, it's all about those RPG elements of leveling up to get more gear to play around with. This was a game from before the formula got stale and was the first to introduce customizeable killstreaks. The online is on the deader side these days but there's a great way around that. 

Google ""i w 4 x"". It's a fan rebuild of the multiplayer portion that sports a whole bunch of servers, LAN play, increased field of view and mods. If you don't feel like dealing with the modern server, just download a bot mod and populate a listen server for some of that old fashioned COD, smack talk included if you run the bot mod I do. Be forewarned the program WILL break the singleplayer mode, so you'll have to delete and redownload the game if you want to play the campaign or Spec Ops again.

TL;DR: It is braindead, thrilling, satisfying, and scratches all the itches of someone who just wants to play a movie made by John Woo and Micheal Bay, and remains one of the most beloved video games in my collection."
9200,"good ol' times, love it"
9201,this has some of the best missions in any cod game this one is my favorite besides infinity warfare
9202,"Very bad game, u will get kicked if u are doing fine :_)"
9203,i can't found any other player on multiplayer? the server is dead? i want my money back
9204,"Suprisingly holds up pretty well today. Tons of hackers online, but not too much to keep fair matches. UMP, ACR, and Spas are for gai bois. M14 gang rise up. P2P servers? In my game? No thanks."
9205,like it alot
9206,long time ago but still good game
9207,its a bloody classic

9213,Besto gamu
9214,"You can kill Russians with a fully automatic pistol, while speeding down a mountain on a snowmoble.

10/10 would recomend"
9215,The best in the series.
9216,Maybe not the best but it's the last playable game from the Cod franchise. Despite many cheaters I had fun.
9217,good but ùïÄùïéùüúùïè is where its at
9218,"I love this game! It's a classic and my all time favorite Call of Duty ever! Haven't played it since 2013, but I've started again just a week ago and it brings so much memories. Iconic game!"
9219,Yo the story is great
9220,"awsm game, awsm story, great graphics 10/10"
9221,Been a while since I played it but I had to re-download it because it's litterally the best COD game!
9222,best Call of duty
9223,Gr8 game
9224,"This was a good game, but the level where you're supposed to help massacre defenseless civilians in an airport is just stupid and disturbingly indulgent.  When it gives you the option to skip a level, say yes because you really won't be missing anything worthwhile.  Great game otherwise"
9225,10/10 game. big memories
9226,"Best optimized CoD in the series, most endorse the Black Ops line but Modern Warfare is where it's at. As soon as ""Modern"" abandoned the title (concerning Infinity Ward/Sledge Hammer Games) it has been a ski trip downhill.
But the battle has always been between the first Modern Warfare and this, but I do prefer this, the less gritty one.
Personally I find the classes to preserve a decent balance, with addons that actually makes sense each, although the silencer shouldn't be that much of a damage let down as it is in this release.
The maps are each fun and beholds an interesting approach to details, not too much of the camping part, which the first MW had a larger side effect at. The maps in this actually tries to get you en gard into swiftly arranged fire fights.
The story also left an impression back in the day for me, giving a normalized Veteran playthough that's not too easy (Ghosts) or too hard (World at War).
Players are still active in Multiplayer so it's your moment to shine like it's 2009!"
9227,"Oh yes, this is the shit, definitely worth it"
9228,"This game feels like what you'd get if you threw a AAA game budget and a game engine from a great game at an experienced dev team and told them to make the shittiest game they could.

The campaign makes Battlefield 4's campaign look like a masterpiece."
9229,"multiplayer is sorta dead. campaign is good iguess. spec ops was nice, but goddamn the players are the mos tcancerous shet ive seen to the point where i"
9230,"My most favorite CoD campaign ever! Although there are hackers, the campaign is really good. And for only 20 dollars? The CoD MW trio is the best in video game history. I will probably buy all of them."
9231,Bring it back
9232,es muy bueno
9233,love it
9234,The last really good Call of Duty game and surprisingly still active Multiplayer. Spec Ops is a fun time and the campaign is pretty good all things considered.
9235,"An incredible game, probably one the best games in the COD saga, which is in a great downfall right now, trying to imitate HALO, in my personal experience, only 5 games of the 19 got my attention, and this specific game, is remarkable between the 5

What makes this game good?
. Unforgivable campaign, great story, characters 
. Equilibrated action without going absolutely crazy (like the new cods)
. Good weapons that are satisfying to shoot
. Fun gameplay 
. Challenging and nice spec ops
. Nice gamemodes and killstreaks (in multiplayer)
. MEMES

What makes this game not so good?
. Some spec ops are near to imposible (specially if some of them are played in veteran)
. If killstreaks are abused, they can make the game a bit unfair
. Some sounds are good, but the AK sounds are ridiculous
. Some maps are great, but some like Rust sucks
. NOOOOOOO SHEPARDDDDD YOU KILLED GHOST AND ROACHHH :((((((((((
. As the game is a bit old, hackers can sometimes ruin your expericence

This game is not only centralized on the online, which make the 5 games I mentioned before remarkable between the all 19 cod games, between these 5 games, this specific one is the one that in my opinion, is the best one

My recomendation? Buy it on summer, winter, or basically all the major discounts on steam 

I dont think I can put a puntuation at this game, it¬¥s like deciding between mother or father, between ass or breasts, if you choose any option, you know that in some point you're being unfair, if I put an 6,7 or 8/10 I know somehow I'm being unfair, so do it yourselves"
9236,"mw2 will always be in my heart. Was one of the first games I went to when I went to pc because I saw it on steam. I probably have 3k+ hours on console for it. Here it is infested with hackers. I played it for about 400 hours before I got vac banned. I absolutly hate hackers. After a while of playing it I decided to find  force host that worked(never found one that did for me) so that I could kick modders/hackers. Never worked and now I can't play because of it. Get it I'm pretty sure it's the cheapest cod on steam and the best one in my opinion, but beware of hackers..."
9237,"[b]AS A PREFACE, I HAVE 2400+ HOURS IN MULTIPLAYER                                              
Proof: https://imgur.com/gallery/0DPtQKl[/b], the hours stamp is for single-player executable only.

Top CoD of all time still holds up almost 10 years later. Best maps, killstreaks, and guns of the entire series with an epic campaign as well. Not planning on stopping any time soon, completing challenges and grinding for camos makes it infinitely replayable since your hand isn't held (2500 headshots for a calling card and 250 for the top-tier camo compared to 100 headshots in modern CoD games)."
9238,"Why do people even like this game and bash on mw3, and say that this game is way better than mw3? These people are literally noob tubing every round and camping every round, and just sitting around. The maps are worst than mw3 imo. This game is garbage compared to mw3. I do not recommend this trash."
9239,when squeaker has bigger balls than you
9240,Still awesome
9241,good
9242,Best cod game had a lot of fun with it back in the ps3 days
9243,Simply the finest CoD game

9250,"A great sequel for a great game, it takes everything on the first one that was great and makes it better. Recommended for the campaign, of course in a game this old the multiplayer is dead."
9251,"One of the best Call of Duty games ever. Haven't played the multiplayer jet, but the single player and special ops are awesome! And as far as I hear the multiplayer is still goin :D"
9252,"Like all COD games, there are more cheaters than clean players. Get this only for collection @ 3-5$ maximum."
9253,Probably my favorite game of all time
9254,Peace of s@it game never buy it bc the multiplayer is ful of hackers
9255,"Great game, it never gets old... and in my opinion it is the best Call of Duty of all time. It was definitely ahead of its time when it first came out and it is just great to play. The memories etc, 1v1 rust so fun.   Lots of multiplayer lobbies, so you won't struggle finding a game. And for single player? remember.. No russian!

You should definitely get this great game!"
9256,"Definitely one of the better ones. 8.5/10
"
9257,"Really awesome game, only bought it to play with a mate originally... but now I‚Äôm just stoked with it anyways, lots of content, great campaign. The initial mouse sensitivity was a bit too much in the beginning, even though it took a hot minute to get used to it, it is fully worth it"
9258,"One of the best COD games of all time, it has some players left but mostly dead."
9259,very fun
9260,"Beautiful, nice gameplay, not really need high spec to play it, really fun game to play"
9261,I really enjoyed this game. I focused more on the campaign then the multiplayer and i enjoyed the co-op mode.
9262,Ramirez! Write a review for this game!
9263,"I grew up with this game on xbox 360 and I have always kept coming back to 360 to play it and its 20 dollars is great and most people dont play the dlc maps so no need to buy em, unless you have a lot of friends to on em with

Amazing campaign, I have played through this campaign countless times, some missions aren't as fun as most but most of them are amazing, btw it is a b**ch to complete on Veteran.

Multiplayer is great only problem with it is the noob tubes and campers, hackers are quite rare i've play so much of this game and i have seen only 1 cheater

spec-ops is amazing especially with a friend its not as replayable as zombies you'll probably play it every once in a while but have a blast for the few hours you'll play it

Graphics are pretty nice if you don't really need em to look super amazing"
9264,"The strongest entry in the Modern Warfare trilogy. This game is the perfect example of how you make a sequel because
-it bring back fan favourite characters like Price and Soap
-we get to hear Soap's voice and see how he looks like for the first time
-it follows up perfectly on the events after COD 4
-heart-pumping scripted events and a plot-twist that shocked everyone who first saw it
-weapons actually have recoil
-it shows us the horrors of war
-actually makes us feel like a special ops soldier and US ranger

10/10 highly recommended"

9267,"Hands down, the best Call of Duty game ever released. Even a decade later it is objectively superior to the watered down versions of CoD being produced in modern times.

So why the thumbs down?

The multiplayer is dead. Through ridiculous host issues, hackers and modded lobbies you would be a lottery winner to find a fair match.

That's if you are lucky and aren't deranked by a random modder. There's too many salty 12 year olds who are ready to get a kick out of ruining your hard work in this game with the push of a button, literally forcing you to find an XP lobby just to get your things back.

I politely asked to be removed from a modded lobby and got a boot message saying""Get Deranked Dumbass""

Lost all my progress simply for entering a child's modded lobby.

Feel free to view the screenshot on my account for an example of what I'm talking about. Not something you want to log into if you've been playing for 100 hours and take challenges seriously.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1531124639

Fortunately, I unlocked everything I needed to on console. Including the maxed M16A4 headshot challenge. Eat your heart out scrubs and derankers, unlocking everything a second time was just gravy >= D

The campaign didn't age well at all, and isn't a worthy challenge for veteran players to replay. Same goes for spec ops. Challenges are bugged in the PC version, and the game is the full price of a new AAA title when you factor in the unincluded DLC's.

Even if MW2 was remastered, it would probably only have a slight graphical tweak, play worse than ever, and be buried and day one DLC's and Microtransactions.

TBH it's absurd that steam allows games to be sold in this state, when it's clear their security and integrity are compromised. A warning at least would be nice.

RIP CoD. We had fun while it lasted."
9268,The game was super fun and still till this day is a solid fps game. I got banned for cheating when I was making a custom modded lobby to play with friends when modding wasnt supported.
9269,"One of the best CoDs of the old time, however the multiplayer can be really cancerous with all the granade launchers and RPGs..."
9270,Great fun. Beware of dogs
9271,I played this game to death on the 360 & then when I found it on Steam of course I got it. So why not controller support? Playing a game like this with a mouse & keyboard is a pain in the ass. Period.
9272,"love the good ole days of cod on xbox, still enjoying this game years later, if you wanna play a cod game this is the best one in my opinion"
9273,"Played up until the mission ""No Russian"". It was a beautiful display of gamers getting revenge on our common enemy. The people who don't understand. Us gamers are the most resilient group of people, and this mission displays that beautifully. I didn't complete the campaign; just played the mission once and now I'm making [i] plans	[/i]. 10/10 for killing innocent people in an airport."
9274,"Game keeps freezing at same time, no solution... :(
[MacOS, HighSierra 10.13.6, 2017 MacBook Pro]"
9275,"[b]Be cautious when playing this game. Seriously.[/b]

I loved Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and still do, however this... this isn't the same. Oh how much fun I have had on this game from when it was first released up to now but this it's a complete different story. Multiplayer is full of hackers and cheaters and this saddens me because there are still decent people who play this game. People say ""MW2 is dead"" and things like that but rarely you will see the same people you were playing with the day before so that says something. :) 

Anyway, on the day I am writing this review, it is the day where I completely had enough with it all as I got hacked. Cheaters... okay fine, I can leave the lobby and join a new one but being hacked is a whole other thing. Those damned modded lobbies... it's a plague. Getting put to 10th prestige lvl 1 instantly slightly annoyed me as I wanted to get there the proper way but alas, I kept playing. Although, only did I realsie a few matches later, that I was leveling up normally but not unlocking any new weapons and attachments. Now this really annoyed me. And no, this wasn't someone doing me and the other people in the lobby a favour that went wrong, it was a malicious act and to top it off... the person in question didn't even have a proper steam profile, it wasn't even level 0.

 So, with my rant over, I am not saying ""do not buy this game"". What I am saying is, it is not how it used to be so do not expect that nostalgic feeling. True, you will find lobbies full with decent people who just want to play some CoD but you will also find modded lobbies full with hackers and cheaters and fake FaZe wannabes and all it takes is for you to randomly join one of those and your CoD profile is messed up forever. So just play cautiosly and if you select Team Deathmatch and get put into Ground War Domination... save yourself and leave.

[b]Disclaimer:[/b] The time played shows how long I have played single player. I have played multiplayer for much longer."
9276,"Taking off the rose tinted glasses, this game is fun and has its moments, but its broken. However with the touch of an easy to installation of the IW4X mod, the game becomes stress free. I reccomended for those who want to play multiplayer and are willing to install the mod. If you dont like the idea of mods, then I can only reccomend this game for the single player experience. For its price, youre basically getting for what you pay for. Its a good game for its price."
9277,best cod alltime
9278,Only hackers left now. Fuck up your challenges by maxing out your level and challenges every other goddamn game. Just wait and buy BO4.
9279,Very good game and i hope MW2 remastered is released one day.
9280,hate it i played and grinded my rank then my pc ran into an error i fact restarted my pc my rank went to lvl 1 never fkn playing again
9281,"Played it before and want the nostalgia again? buy it.
still a great singleplayer story, wanted to buy mw3 after it but the price keeps me away (for now)
Multiplayer has a small chance to have a hacked lobby but that is no problem, it's like a 30 a 40% chance you get that.
Singleplayer 10/10 RIP Ghost.
Multiplayer 9/10 too many noobtubes.

9288,Good game.
9289,"Easily one of if not the best Call of Duty game. I cannot express how many hours I put into this game on the Xbox 360. If you have not played this game, you seriously missed out. 10/10 game highly recommend to anyone."
9290,How i open the NAT??
9291,Get it
9292,Good game
9293,THIS IS THE BEST 17 DOLLARS II EVAR SPENT
9294,"Although there were moments of action packed fun, this game does not live up to its previous title. COD:MW2 had a boring story and felt rushed at times. Disappointed it didn't meet the standards COD 4 had."
9295,like the cum inside my mouth
9296,very good br0ther
9297,Best CoD ever.
9298,"As nostalgic as the game is, the only playlist that is active is basic tdm which is smothered with tubers and toxic hackers that have the power to ban you from a match by killing them once or end the server knowing that you are about to get a nuke. There are also hackers that unlock everything for themselves, rendering your hard-earned accomplishments basically useless. The DLC is not inclusive with the game, and in fact, permantently ruins the game if you buy it since the matchmaking ONLY puts you in games with people that have DLC as well (which is next to none), whether you are playing the new maps or not. There is no selection to disable/enable DLC. You will be stuck for hours trying to find one match."
9299,"The best FPS game out there, holding up even now!"
9300,SHIT
9301,Hey thats pretty good
9302,i cant run the game anymore people!!! could someone help me!?!?! it use to run but stays stuck on the loading screen. :(

Just buy it already!"

9308,Pretty good
9309,Is this game alive again? wut
9310,i love this game!!
9311,No up keep on the older games.. causes for majority of hackers. Not fun to play anymore and the makers and steam dont even try to catch the hacking going on in older games.
9312,is fun
9313,"Still has an active playerbase, amazing game, whole lot of fun to be had for the price. Multiplayer lobbies are 50% modded, but some modded lobbies play the same as regular lobbies at the core, sometimes providing sniper only lobbies for example. Good game, also has its smaller sub-communities. 
Worth the price and time years after."
9314,"Origionally owned this game on my 360, imo it is the most well written and executed call of duty (Campaign and Multiplayer). I had logged roughly over 500 hours on it (across platforms). The multiplayer is still my favorite, yes there are a lot of noobtoobs but that comes with cod. Catch me on terminal :)"
9315,Best Call Of Duty in my opinion
9316,Good Game
9317,its the best game i have ever played after the cod4 :) its still ready to play on my comp. add me for spec ops.
9318,Still good even it's getting old
9319,"Let's be honest. Everybody knows this is the best Call of Duty game ever made, so would I recommend? I'd be a sinner not to!"
9320,.
9321,The game is good and player base for pc is higher than expected.
9322,"Modern Warfare 2 is probably one of the best installments of the CoD franchise, in my book only second to CoD4.
But through the years, it has fallen from grace, overshadowed by its publishers missteps in handling the series as well as lobbies infested with hackers.

Modern Warfare 2 offers a great campaign, crisp and satisfying gunplay and an engaging multiplayer. Well, it used to.
Still priced at a ridiculous 20‚Ç¨, the game certainly didn't age well, in part thanks to the greed of Activision.

With the death of AlterIW NET, a third-party platform for finding server hosted games, the multiplayer is now entirely Peer2Peer based, which puts you at the mercy of your fellow players' ISPs. For a game in 2018, this is unacceptable. For an almost 10 year old game, it's alright.

With a heavy heart, I must say that I can not recommend MW2 to anyone in 2018, unless you get it on sale with your friends for private fun rounds. Public multiplayer is unplayable at worst, mediocre at best, and the community is next to nonexistant.

Rest in Peace, sweet prince."
9323,"they ruined a good game i cant handle this cluster fuck shit pardon my language but campers and explosions every where u go also iw4x sweaty try hards dont get it i recommend black ops 1 and 2 and maybe mw3 

DONT GET THIS GAME IM TELLING U UNLESS U GET CONSOLE"
9324,the nostalgia
9325,"It's been years since I played this game, but anyways... it's definitely the best game out of the Call of Duty franchise. Every other game they've made after this one has just gotten worse and worse.

Nowadays the player base is very small and in order for someone new or older player returning to do well in this game is quite difficult. Nonetheless, you can still go rek some noobs and have fun."
9326,not funnnnn
9327,"best cod even in 2019 it was very good..its graphics are even great in 2019 its graphics are near to cod blackops 2...best cod i ever played
"
9328,"There's still a living, breathing toxic community that makes this game a true Call of Duty experience even to this day.

Pros:
-People still play this game
-People still toxic
-'Tarded and overpowered killstreaks make for gamebreaking balance issues
-Quick run and gun style action, class creation, map variety

Cons:
-People still toxic
-'Tarded and overpowered killstreaks make for gamebreaking balance issues
-Matchmaking lobbies and host migrations often make for laggy games
-Overpowered team destroys other team, game doesn't auto-redistribute players to make for a more balanced team experience
-Who even uses things like SMGs or shields?
-Feels a little dated in terms of class creation. I think Black Ops 2 had a good perk system."
9329,"The greatest single-player and multiplayer experience of a Call of Duty I've had to date, and one of the greatest games I've ever played, a modern classic."
9330,"Back on the Xbox 360, I played this game so much that I was able to hit Master Prestiege TWICE on two different accounts for the multiplayer.  It's a pretty quick game to 100%. Even if you aren't a completionist, I recomend trying to beat it just for the fun of it.  You do need a partner for the COOP achievements but besides that, this game can be beaten relatively easily."
9331,"This Installment of the Call Of Duty franchise is by far the best story is amazing, graphics are pretty good and the character's movement is pretty good. The multiplayer is amazing.

OVERALL: 10/10 Would.... ahhh.... buy again?"
9332,Fun until you get Noobtubed
9333,"The campaign is surprisingly engaging, and the gameplay, while monotnous, remains consistent and playable. Even if you don't like COD, the story is worth checkng out."
9334,LOVE THE GAME defintly worth it
9335,Probably best Call of Duty multiplayer for low PCs. Completely recommend it. 9/10. Awesome gameplay :)
9336,its fun and runs good on my old sistun
9337,ya
9338,love this game i have been playing this ever since i was a kid great game

9341, yay for call of duty would play again 7/10
9342,"all my hours are in multiplayer just picked the game up again, No more hackers, and multiplayer is alive and well, graphics feel great as well after 9 years, And the controls are just as good, Campaign is fun and worth the challenge as well, DEFINENTLY A HUGE RECCOMENDATION!"

9344,"1v1 me Rust, bro"
9345,Ramirez buy this game!!!
9346,"Nothing will ever replace the grit and dirt experience of the old call of duty times but this call of duty literally is the number one call of duty. This is where the series turned into an experience and a journey, the campaign is so thrilling and unexpected around every corner its like every time I play the campaign over and over again I am never disapointed"
9347,still good
9348,Good game
9349,"very good, probably the best in the franchise behind cod 4, i recommend this if you wan't to play multiplayer"
9350,"Apart from OMA (One Man Army) and Danger Close noobtubes, the multiplayer is actually really good. So far, I've only encountered 3 modded lobbies (9vs9 Domination instead of Team Deathmatch.) It still has a good playerbase, so finding a TDM is not hard at all. If you hate grenade launchers and P2P matchmaking, you should try out I W 4 X (Without the space.) It's a Modern Warfare 2 client which has dedicated servers, modtools and many more. It's free by the way. Third-party versions are better than what Steam can offer, but I enjoy this one more, because that's how it's meant to be played originally. Better than newer COD titles, that's for sure!"
9351,A staple of the Call of Duty franchise.
9352,Call Of Duty : Modern warfare 2 . Second best version after Call of duty Modern war fare .
9353,"nat type is always strict which doesnt allow you to play any online games.

I know that theres a way to change it so it is open, but long story short I shouldnt have to muck around and google ways to make the nat type open for a game I paid for.I have given up good bye MW2.

aside from that THIS IS THE BEST COD"
9354,I have a game ban on my account from this shit
9355,"Best COD, period"
9356,Just like old times!
9357,"Game is beatiful,clean and have a lot more missions. The universe of the game has a variety of history missions and weapons. I've really enjoyed it! 
Shut up and take my money!"

9359,"Its just the best, mate."
9360,MW2-MW4 only CODs i'll actually play
9361,10/10 would rage over last stand again
9362,This game is my personal favorite PC shooter game that I have currently (since I dont really play that many PC shooters)
9363,e
9364,"Single player is fantastic. One of the best storyline of so many Call of Duties, music by Hans Zimmer truly immersed the experience. Any FPS fan needs to try out MW2 single player. 

Multiplayer is another story. While I enjoy the weapons and game settings, there are a lot of overpowered stuffs that IMO ruined my multiplayer experience. Grenade launcher with danger close & one man army, Akimbo glocks, commando knife, are prime examples. And then, we have the MW2Sa, the kick tool. Im sure the intent behind developing this is good, but frankly Im dissapointing to say its misused to kick innocent player, and since it revealed all players' IP address, it makes player vulnerable for DDoS attack. It is a shame, I wish I could enjoy playing MW2 multiplayer, but these will definitely makes me stay away for the time being."
9365,Remember no russian.
9366,Great game and is really fun :D
9367,TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING
9368,asd
9369,Best COD game and one of the last good ones...
9370,cool game
9371,i can't play it keeps saying falloff linear please fix this this game is my childhood and i can't even play my favorite campaign
9372,"General Sheperd can go stick a revolver up his  a s s












10/10 would shoot up an airport again"
9373,It's a personal favorite of mine and reminds me of a much simpler time. Nowadays multiplayer is ok at best but better than most in the series especially since these games can be disposable in the online world. It's good to see this game stands the test of time. Single player story is pretty bad ass and worth playing through at least once. Can be beat within a day. Watch out for modded lobbies if that's not your thing. At least you can back out and join another.
9374,The story was top notch and an amazing continuation to the prequel of Modern Warfare. The characters were very memorable and the gameplay along with the amazing multiplayer is very fun. This is how Call of Duty games should be made. 9/10
9375,"Multiplayer is absolutely deadified
"
9376,fun
9377,"Remember, No Russian!"
9378,"Single player campaign packed with action, story and challenges. It feels and plays great in 2018 and if you haven't played it and thinking to buy it then you should definitely do that!

You won't like this game if you expect something more than just shooting range with a lot of explosions, bad ass moments and scripts.

The only thing that I hate in this game is levels in USA. They're dark and boring."
9379,Amazing Missions.
9380,"One of my favorite games, even today.
Still playable, lots of lobbys, way better than newer CoDs where you can not find even a single lobby.."
9381,"Back in 2011, I purchased my first ever COD game called 'Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2' and once I played the game I was Instantly hooked! The story is amazing, the characters are memoriable, and the multiplayer is damn near addicting. No COD game (In my opinion) Is as great as this game. I just can't seem to stop thinking about all the times me and a bunch of friends played Spec Ops together and tried to beat every level. So you may ask, Is It worth It still even today and my response would be, ""FUCK YES!!!"" 9/10"
9382,"Pretty cool game, loved playing the campaign ever since I was a kid, MW1,2,3 are the best CODs in my opinion."
9383,"Awesome addition to the MW Series. All the COD games have awesome storylines, but this one has to be one of my favorites."
9384,Greate game. best cod history
9385,Best
9386,It is ok game a bit old but online is still one of the best
9387,Best game ever. Played in ps3 with more than 3000h and its just amazing. Nowdays too much moded servers.
9388,"I love this game, the campaign is great, the multiplayer is fun but sadly you can only find empty servers."
9389,One of the best Call of Duty games ever made. The Modern Warfare games have an interesting story that's told across all three games. It's honestly the only Call of Duty trilogy that has a story that makes sense and doesn't jump all of the place. The weapons in this game are honestly really good and each one is memorable unlike some of the new Call of Duty's and the multiplayer customization is really simple and easy to use. I also love the amount of challenges and achievements that you can get in this game. However MW2 isn't as good as Call of Duty: World at War; so buy WaW first.
9390,Yes the campaign is as good as you remembered it. Yes the multiplayer is as good as you remembered it. Yes the UMP is as OP as you remembered it. It's still amazing. It's like a vintage Ferrari. A time capsule back to the good old days of the 360.
9391,Best game ever
9392,"The game of my childhood
Everything about the campaign is next to perfect
The online is meh

9394,"This was my second CoD game after Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.  I still think COD4 and COD Modern Warfare 2 are the best COD games made. Its multiplayer is awesome, and the storyline in singleplayer is also very good. I really enyojed playing this game. Even now, I still play it because im so OP and no one can touch me in this game, pure swag pure gold. I would sell my goat to get the remastered COD4. 

Awesome Game, get it and have fun :)"
9395,Best call of duty ever made :)
9396,"don't be fooled by my veteran playtime of 3 hours, i actually beat the game on xbox, and have 1k hours on the multiplayer game. this is one of the best cod MPs i've ever played, alongside with black ops 2. and for the price of $20, this game is worth it"

The story is how you would expect it to be action packed and twists and turns, the story was done really well in my opinion, because how the story is put together in such a thrilling and everything you do has meaning sort of way. The ending parts is THE BEST. oline is if you want to get weked nrd, but for real you need to know the maps and everything if you want to not die every 6 seconds. the co op (spec ops) are just chalenges with or agenced your friends and it is kinda underwelming, not my cup of tea. In the end it is a short gem that after playing the first time you wish you could play it again for the first time. 
very nice / 10 would play for the first time again."

Cons: FOV Changer isn¬¥t working  at Win 10 (Also testet Steam quick fix guide...). Bullshit with 65. Fiew to play, not worth it.

Activision is not able to install an FOV modification tool inside of the game launcher.

9420,"A true Masterpiece! even in 2018 this game still rocks! I wish COD series make a comeback and make another superb title like MW and MW 2 ! but i guess we won't see that day again :) and maybe we do! who knows! anyway the visuals are still amazing, the gameplay is fast and top notch, the musics are astonishing and the story is awesome! aboslutely the best stroy in the whole COD series IMO :) the spec ops part in Vet deifficulty can be very challenging and is definitely much more harder than the MW3 missions! the multiplayer is still one of a kind and ofcourse it's a COD game, so if you can get along with hackers and cheater in MP , you are for a fun ride!"
9421,"Great game

9425,I really like the story  in the game and all the action in it.
9426,"One of the most fun Call of Duty titles in the franchise, even despite the presence of rampant hacking. You could easily sink countless hours just playing with friends in private matches to avoid hacking. The singleplayer campaign is also a very memorable one in comparison to others in the series. Fast paced and well designed multiplayer maps make the combat fun although there are a few weapon balancing issues. Graphics are pretty underwhelming though.

8/10 Great shooter, one of the few COD titles worth the ridiculous Steam pricepoint"
9427,yes
9428,"if youre an indonesian, you only met australians in this game"

9432,just as tilting as i remember
9433,because of this game i got VAC BAN and they won't tell me why I got VAC BAN can open this game no more they didn't gave me no warning they just VAC BAN and then told me to make a new steam account and buy the game again
9434,Game was great but now its overrun with modders. either its modded lobbies that you repeatedly join into no matter how many times you try or its people with esp. They will just blatanly look at you through walls without giving two shits about getting banned. finally just uninstalled because there's no point in trying anymore. RIP MW2 maybe theyll remaster it someday without bullshit lootboxes
9435,this is the most probbly the best game u  can get on steam
9436,just pirate it
9437,This was one of the best CoD games ever made.

9441,great fuckin game
9442,Tubers still exist
9443,"Back in the day, on PlayStation 3, I must have put upwards of 3-4k hours in this game, and boy did I love it equally throughout each and every one.

Recently, I rediscovered my love for this game, and bought it on Steam. (Mostly rebought it 'cause the console lobbies are all filled with modders, sad f*cks.)

It is just as beautiful of a game as the one I fell in love with way back when, I love the principle that if everything is overpowered, then nothing is overpowered.

I hate to love this game. - No matter how many times I got frustrated at a OMA Noob Tuber on Wasteland, an RPD with FMJ dude camping, or someone going completely ham with a shotty, I kept coming back to this game.

Definitely - DEFINITELY worth a buy, even to this day.
In my opinion the best Call of Duty ever created, none of these modern day casino simulators."
9444,"Great game, lots of fun for single and multiplayer."
9445,Soap
9446,One of the best games I have ever played
9447,Gaz is Ghost. Do not argue with me.
9448,"My personal favorite out of all of the Modern Warfare series.
But sadly a Roach gets stomped. :((((((((("
9449,"Terrible FOV, but still fun and no cheaters like I hear everyone say, theres maybe 1 cheaters every 20ish games which isnt a lot at all because you can just back out and join another lobby.

also download AgentRevs FOV changer I dont think you can be banned and it works really well!"
9450,"This game has grown soo much! XD.  Love it. Despite how people are on Multiplayer, i like the themes for each team, it's un-dislikeable. *thumbs up*"
9451,"I think Modern warfare 2 wanted to prove something. That it can be the best damn sequel to one of the most revolutionary games ever in the fps genre. Modern Warfare was phenomenal, and amazing. So what the developers did with this game was took everything we liked about modern warfare and enhanced upon it. The maps are great, multiplayer was fun, and the customization for the guns were neat. The campaign had such BALLS. I don't know how they got away with the No russian level. Wow, that was such a big risk. But that's the name of the game, sometimes you have to go all out. Modern warfare 2 went all out, and it's honestly still my top favorite call of duty game ever."
9452,"Very fun game. Brings back the good ole days memories. The only thing i dislike about this game is the fact that the favela multiplayer map was once removed from online multiplayer map rotation for ""offensive"" writing on picture frames in a bathroom, and has yet to this day been added back (this is only true for the pc version). It's available for private matches but that's it."
9453,"remember, no russian"
9454,Had my best times with this game!
9455,Its my favorite game.
9456,really fun game. all guns are op so it make all weapons seem balenced. very few  hacked lobbies. the only downside is the fov with i could change it
9457,"There is a file called mp.playlist and it prevents your MP game from launching. Do not buy this game as it is a waste of your money, there is also hackers that mod lobbies and kick you out for being too good when you get your streaks. I have tried to put the file to ""Read-Only"" but it ignores the command and loads it in anyway."
9458,"Actually made me feel genuine sadness and anger.
Fucking great game, buy it."
9459,"One of the best Call of Duty campaigns I have ever played. I played this when it came out on the ps3. It is exactly how I remember it. The story mode had memorable characters, with a great villain. The multiplayer although dead, is really fun. Although some people may not like some aspects, I liked the variety of viable weapons available."
9460,"I have purchased this game only to play through the campaign. I had no interest whatsoever in multiplayer, so none of that will be touched in this review.

When I started the game, after completing the training session, the easiest difficulty was recommended for me, which I gladly accepted. After all I was here to experience what has been created. And at the beginning of the very first mission I died. After a bit of confusion I figured out what was expected from me, then I progressed a little and died again. This dying part happened later too, more frequent than I would be comfortable with. Sometimes it wasn't directly by the enemy, but because of time limits, or quick time events. The campaign consists from heavily scripted scenarios, where you must conform to the script. Failing/dying is not such a hindrance, there is a generous amount of savepoints, so you won't loose much of progress. Still, it is grating to fail repeatedly on the easiest difficulty.

What the game presented to me was that modern warfare is a confusing mess. Most of the time I fight alongside a small squad, sometimes only with one partner and there are a few solo sections. The problem is that only when I'm partnered with one teammate is when I'm sure who is with me, and everyone else is an enemy. There were numerous cases, where in the heat of the action, in close quarters, I really didn't know who was with me, and who was the enemy. Holding my fire in front of an enemy usually let me dead, so after a while I have often attacked my own side too, just to be sure. If the enemy seemed somewhat resilient to my attacks I assumed that he was at my side, and went on. In one section, where I was in a helicopter and was requested to support our side I was at a total loss as who is who. Eventually I mowed down a few soldiers, with no feedback whatsoever if they were enemies or friendly forces. So yes, this game boiled down to me that modern warfare is indeed a confusing mess. I'm not sure if that was the intention of the game creators.

The graphics of the game is generally still acceptable almost 10 years after it's release. There was put great effort in the animation of the people and vehicles, and also on the large number of weapons that can be held by the player. It's only when I get close to less important things is when the age of the game really shows. Hide near a van, and you will see that it's front lamps and grill is merely a texture. Go near a door and you will see textured door knobs. Generally I play without subtitles, but here I had to turn them on to understand what was said.

Even with frequent deaths and the resulting repeating of segments, I finished the game in around 6-7 hours. There are challenges for each mission for those that want to prove themselves. I merely obtained one star for the training ground, and didn't bother to unlock further stars. It might be great for those who want to prove themselves, or just don't have access to other games that often (i.e. kids), but with my sizable steam backlog I didn't want to waste time on them. I would rather experience a new game."

9465,"This was a favourite back when I played in on the PS3.. There's not much of a reason to get it on PC unless you're going for a story mode. Multiplayer is obviously dead. 

Wait for a sale but one of the best story lines in COD. Too bad MW3 couldn't be as good."
9466,I love this game so much. It's still worth buying in 2018. So much nostalgia. But the fact that someone would buy this game and install it to just one man army noobtube in 2018 is the most pathetic thing I've ever seen. Go get a job.

9475,"I'm too lazy to right a long review, but buy it! Buy the f*ck outta it!! Buy it so much that Steam will even get triggered somehow! Great campaign, there's special ops so your mates can join the party and pretty good mulitplayer, I mean I suck at multiplayer, but you may not. I tried this game out on a Lenovo laptop and it handles amazing! It's a great game!!"
9476,"Love the game, childhood memories.

The campaign was good. It explained the story and gave you a variety of missions to do, all of which were unique.

The Spec Ops... oh my, the spec ops. The absolute best part. They are so fun to play, especially with a friend. I got all stars by playing veteran, and dang some of the missions really require you to keep restarting, but it's worth it and it's still fun. (a majority of my hours are from spec ops)

The multiplayer is okay. There are some lobbies that are just hacker lobbies, which I dislike. It may sometimes take away from the game, but a decent amount of lobbies are clean so it's not like the whole experience is ruined.

I would say a great game, especially for sale. Buy it then."
9477,Its 2018 and we still have this problem .Every time i enter multiplayer just a black screen pops up with only sound playing i don`t recomend buying the game until they fix the problem
9478,"VERY Good, sad, and intense campaign.
Fantastic story, and plot twist.
Music is phenomenal and visuals are really good too!
The gameplay is relatively the same as the previous CODS, the arcadic-like shooter in which you have to have quick reaction time. Very linear as well.
The Multiplayer is also VERY fun... even if it's broken.

9.5/10 Highly recommend if you like COD Games, and have played COD 4."
9479,"The game gets older but the community stays 12 forever.

Still fun but the golden times from 2010 and 2011 won¬¥t come back"
9480,Game is great. Multiplayer on here is suprisingly still alive. Most of the part TDM but anyone can get past that. I  highly recommend this game. for nostaliga sake.

9488,"I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a good first person shooter. This game goes truly above and beyond. It is an all time legend in my opinion. The maps arent to big or small (besides rust which is straight up chaos), the gameplay is intense and invigerating, the campaign is very well done, and so much more. Only thing that I wish was in the game is more customization for weapons. There is also the strong presence of hackers and modded lobbies in servers, however they are cracking down on hackers and if u find a server with a hacker, report, and move on to another server or join a different game mode. That's another thing I love about the game, is the number of different game modes. You got everything from a simple Team Deathmatch to Search and Destroy. One last thing, if you are considering buying, check your routers nat type because if it is strict u will never be able to get into a server and it is a long and complicated process to change the nat type. Cod Mw2 is definitely on my must buy list for those of you out there reading this."
9489,"The moment when someone called you cheating

9490,i cannot play multiplayer
9491,"OK game, a bit short, less then 6 hours to complete the campaign.
Not worth the price anymore, my recomendation is only for a good sale discount."
9492,Best game on planet earth like legit bad thing though is that everyone in multiplayer is a tryhard soooooooooooo good
9493,its an amazing game everything works great EXEPT the intervention WITHOUT FMJ it is basically a hitmarker machine. Other than that best call of duty in my opinion
9494,"COD MW2 is the golden boy for the COD franchise. Fortnite is so big now, but they call it the MW2 of the current generation, so that should tell you how this game was. Although time has passed, the campaign still holds up as my favorite campaign from any COD. This game came out at the peak of the HOORAH military shooters, and it delivers an amazing and surprisingly cinematic campaign. I would get the game solely for the campaign, but the multiplayer is also phenomenal. You'll still find a game, although I found a hacker here and there. Overall, it's still an amazing game and you should pick it up."
9495,"When i was younger, like 10 or more young, my uncle downloaded this game to my computer. At first I couldn't really get myself to play it, but then it happened. I remember that i couldn't stop this game after the first mission. I played theough the whole day. I was so shocked by the game and the situations, when the characters accidentally kill you and the other things. I was young and my native language isn't English so I didn't even understand the game, the dialogues etc. But it was the best game I've ever played since that age. A week ago i bought the game. It's still old but gold. It's better than the next gen games... I can't believe it. This game was made in 2009, and it's graphics are so great, the story is shocking even if you know what when will happen and even if you play it again and again after and after. The multiplayer is still active, i can't describe the feeling of the multiplayer. It's just like if you start it, you can't stand up from the chair and you want more and more games. There are no hackers. There are hacked lobbies BUT no hackers, only experienced players. Hacked lobbies are like servers with hosts and they decide that what game mode will be om the server, so if you press on a TDM game for example, and you get in a hacked lobby, you might play a domination game. This game after 10 years worth even the full price. If you want it just go and buy it, just believe me. But now I'm ready to waste tousands of hours from my life with this game. I hope i'll see you in game! It's a legendary game."

Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is the Second game from ""INFINITWARD"" Those hwo mad the Awsome.COD Modern Warfare game. 

This game is a wery good game, if you like first person shooter game,s . It,s got a Great Storyline In Singelplayer. 
And the Multiplayer is just as good as in COD MF. Wery high pace, and wery adicctive.
I think that COD MF 1 AND 2 Is the best. First person shooter games, out there. 

I Higely recommend this game.

9504,Best  COD ever to be made love it i could play it forever nonstop
9505,"An extremely solid campaign with a good multiplayer. I completed the campaign in one night just because it was so good. One of my favourite campaigns I have ever played, just because of the wonderfully written out and arranged storyline. It gets intense, trust me.

Best campaign ever, additional missions, and solid multiplayer. 9.8/10

It was so good that I have to say the campaign is great for a 5th time. That's how good it is."
9506,"Best game i've ever played in my life. Many tears, many happy moments.

9517,This game I bought so many years ago. Enjoyed the story mode and enjoyed multiplayer obviously since I have over 1400hours. That has to be an error wow.
9518,Spec Ops is good. Campaign is good. Multiplayer is a good nostalgia trip until you get hit by a grenade launcher from halfway across the map.
9519,Singleplayer hours. Best COD ever!

9523,"This is only a review of the campaign.

Bad writing and an over the top story make this game inferior to its predecessor in every way. It clearly wants to be taken seriously but it's hard to do so when you can seemingly activate slow motion at will when breaching doors. 

Harder difficulties are tedious to the point of frustration thanks to infinitely spawning enemies and what seems like infinite grenade spam. CoD 4 wasn't exactly super grounded, but it was way more realistic than the events that occur in Modern Warfare 2. 

I did like the 2 snow missions and Second Son quite a bit though."
9524,it good
9525,"You are better of downloading cracked game because there are much more servers there offical servers are mostly dead and you can only play team deathmatch on popular maps.

9526,Pretty much what i expected old time fun and that cod rage lol
9527,I am getting this for my desktop I have it for my ps3 and it runs smoother on my laptop than my PS3
9528,If this is a bad game then i'm the tooth fairy
9529,i'd reccommend playing this if your trying to have some serious fps and 3rd person fun!!!
9530,masterpiece
9531,"MW2. This was by far my favourite Call of Duty game. sadly, Now it is completely dead. If they remaster it I plan on buying it.
It really pains me to leave this game a negative review. I love this game, It is very fun. but it just doesn't have any playerbase anymore. So until it is no longer dead I have to leave it a negative review."

9534,Deep

9536,"Let's be real, most people don't play CoD for the singleplayer campaign.

Which is an absolute shame, because CoD:MW2's singleplayer is actually the best in the whole CoD series. The music by Hans Zimmer is one of my favourite soundtracks from any game or film, the story is incredibly compelling and, for some parts, genuinely emotional.

I have 100% this single-player a couple of times over the years. While the campaign is great, playing on Veteran difficulty is ridiculous cover-camping, trial-and-error, luck dependant bullshit that doesn't really require skill at the game, more than incredible amounts of patience. Unless you really need to 100%, don't bother.

Spec Ops is an enjoyable co-op experience, especially the sniper missions. However, from my experience 100%-ing this game mode, the hardest difficulty is also trial-and-error bullshit that does feel quite luck dependant most of the time (similar to the singleplayer campaign)."
9537,Yes and good and nice.
9538,"While not as good as the prior Modern Warfare game, this is still loads of fun, both in the campaign and the multiplayer."
9539,One of the best COD games to be produced. Nostalgic and never gets old. 9.5/10

9541,"still a great game with an honorable player base...
if you are used to modern CoD, probably not yours...if you played it back in the day on console like me, there you go the game is not dead :)"

9551,FOR POOP DOG!

Haven't tried the multiplayer yet but the campaing and special forces missions have held up strong all these years. 10/10 highly recommend as a fun shooter."
9566,"Good Game. Get it in offers. Multiplayer not worth it (it's very good, but now is dead and with a lot of lag if you are from far away U.S.) Singleplayer is good, the last campaign of modern warfare that's not a joke. 8/10"

Did try the multiplayer part of this game and can say that this game is not worth even a penny."
9576,"This was the very first steam and PS3 game I ever owned. even in 2018 the game is amazing. If you want to buy a game that is a fun shooter without all the futuristic BS, then this is the shooter for you. Also, if you have a potato computer, you might want to consider this game as it doesn't require high specs to play it in 2018. Really nicely made game. HATS OFF TO ACTIVISION!!!!

9577,cool fun
9578,This game worked for me once then did nothing but crash. i want my money back.

9583,"Good game despite its minor bugs. I game from work mostly as the connection is top quality there. When the game selects me as host it allows me to clear the game of the things that make it unplayable such as cheaters and lag. (Most players claim to be a good host or have a good connection, this is what I game on: http://www.speedtest.net/result/6887526429 )

Overall, MW2 is the best cod imo (under the right circumstances)


-----
 -> Cheaters (aimbot [player aimlock], wallhacking [seeing through the wall], texture hack [manipulated textures in-game which give you a viewing advantage])

 -> Lag and poor host selection (Lag means failing to keep up with another or others in movement or development).


To a player:
‚Ä¢	lag can cause your aim to seem `off` and result in a lot of hitmarkers
‚Ä¢	lag will cause your shots and explosions to appear late (delayed) on your screen - you may think you knifed someone and then a few moments later, you`re dead and you think BS. Either you, the other player or both of you had a lag which resulted in what you saw.
‚Ä¢	lag can cause rubberbanding (warping) and or player teleporting
‚Ä¢	lag can cause your players position to reset (while it appears as if you ran half a mile to a building, you could find yourself back where you were a few moments later, as if you did nothing)


So if you have a slow internet connection, it`s not a good idea to run background downloads or uploads while you play, or stream music or watch video content. If your internet is slow, downloads/uploads could be done overnight or during the day when you`re out. Music could be downloaded to your PC and played locally. Videos could be watched from another device like a laptop, tablet or phone (preferably on another network e.g. mobile data, neighbours wifi etc).

To summarise, lag is annoying and players should do all they can to reduce their chances of ping spikes as it`s possible to lag in any and every online game no matter how good the `server` is.

9586,"Very interesting story, nice gunplay and setting, visuals and audio are good.

You also have the opportunity to do side challenges after the campaign. Only issue I have here is that the balance on the higher difficulty of the campaign and challenges can be pretty bad and frustrating.

Despite the hate the franchise and developer get for being what they are, this product is genuinely good and worth your time.

8.5/10"
9587,"Mw2 is one of my all time favorite fps. When i bought this game a year ago it did feel the same but with more hackers and tubers. If they would've updated this game, nerfed explosion etc. A 10/10 but for now 8/10. I dont recommend this game for people who hasnt played mw2 before."
9588,"This game is full of shit.

I was Vac Banned without cheating a single time, and Steam support REFUSES to do anything about it.

I'm now on day 1253 of my VAC ban and boy oh BOY this game is good. You gotta be dem there TF141 with Mactavish and Ghost-y boy and SOAP! Or those Rangers always leading the way, fighting evil and stuff cause its America. There are other factions probably but I forgot them because they aren't as cool as ya bois in the TF141 and Rangers. Oh wait the Spetznaz were also in this game I think right guys? Yeah I think so. They're pretty cool too. This was also that game that had a bunch of controversy around a certain mission that we all remember. That was a kinda strange mission thinking about it, I mean you didn't actually HAVE to kill them. Was this the one where you're near Pripyat? OH no that was COD4. That was a cool mission cause it reminded me of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. Man those games were great. Well actually they were buggy messes but they were OUR buggy messes that we loved. The whole asthetic and story of that series was so cool. I actually started reading Roadside Picnic recently, which is a book that inspired that series. It's definitely an interesting read, especially for fans of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. Can't believe that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 just got announced right? It's been cancelled for so many years and yet BANG, an announcement out of NOWHERE.


But yeah MW2 is cool too.

9619,a bit of cheaters but overall a stable game to me.
9620,"I played this game a few years ago but I didnt feel like writing an interview until like now.

Honestly, Im not a fan of FPS games, I just play whatever and Im not some crackshot (more like a crapshot amirite?ehhhhh...heh....). I finished the campaign, its seemed pretty short, even when played on Hardened. The story was interesting though, because I did play the first CODMW and I liked how it got some characters from the first game instead of just starting fresh, and I enjoyed seeing familiar faces.  

Graphics: meh. For its time....not bad.

I played the multiplayer as well. I was shit. Or maybe people were hacking. I heard that people like to hack this game and I honestly just gave up after being killed like fifty times....in one game....when I was hiding.....in an enclosed room(....how the fu-)
Id recommend this game for anyone who likes FPS games. but you wouldn't enjoy the multiplayer unless you are a hacker and can kill everyone else."
9621,"Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best Call of Duty games. It has a stellar Multiplayer, and an amazing campaign that shows the intensity and desparation that would take place in the event of an invasion on US soil. Not to mention the Special ops are amazing as well. Buy it buy it buy it!"
9622,This game is the best. I enjoy first person shooter games but always went the battlefield route. Noticed this was on sale decided to give it a try and now I'm hooked. I recommend this game to any ADULTS who like first person shooters. 10 out of 10 if you ask me.
9623,"Was probably the best COD, but nobody is playing it anymore. Really loved the gameplay and everything about it. Recommend everyone to get this, even in 2019"
9624,"Still a good ammount of players online from all over the world.  They're still problems with hackers (aimbots, and ESP/Wallhacks) but you can still find a good match most of the time.  Play this instead of buying the next COD or Fortnite 2 or whatever.  Save this generation of gamers."
9625,"everyone is doing it, guys doing it with girls girls doing it with other girl,some get together in groups and do it, some go online and do it with complete strangers, some like deeper penetration when they do it,some people get scared and pulled right in the middle of doing it, sometimes when people do it for the first time they don't last so long, sometimes when people do it alone for too long their hands cramp up, some people just like watching other people do it, some people have Steady Aim and others just spray everywhere,some people like to do it hardcore, some people like to be all Chatty Cathy when they do it, sons of bitches do it so loud they keep up the neighbors, sometimes my dog likes to watch me do it, some people like to go into domination mode and that's some Freaky Deaky shit, I've heard there's already 20 million people doing it now so it's safe to say everyone is doing."

9631,"This is an absolute Call of Duty classic! It really embodies what the Call of Duty franchise is supposed to be: A militaristic, modern action packed first person shooter with endless content. Although I only have 21 hours on this game on my Steam account, I have played MW2 for years on my Xbox 360 and can say that it really provided me with hours of entertainment. This game is a true classic Call of Duty."
9632,Nice Game <3
9633,"This is from the greatest cod games

Story mode is just awsome, compared to new cods it is 100x times better

the game has no mod support and a multiplayer with full of maxed veteran players

Coop mode is nice, you can play solo or with a friend, but there are missions that need to be played with 2 people or meant to be played with 2 people"
9634,really good game. hard to lvl up but its a great  game
9635,good
9636,"IMO's the Goal with the multi! (I will explane i write because follower since COD the first of the serie and i have got a question for YOU: Which one's the best multi-COD? The worst? Last but not least.. best single campaign and zombies!

MULTIPLAYER: I always loved FPS multi .. it's the 95% of my multi gametime that i spend with CODs. 
 1) The best off, the mix of gameplay, fun, reality and game exigences, guns, maps ... imo this is! COD4:MW_2
2) Mister number 2 it's not so far away .. COD4: MW3!! Just almost the first but something gone bad with hacking and bugs
3) COD ! Yeah, have you never been playing the first  COD online? I still used 56k conn. hahaha the secret: SIMPLE, FUN.

SINGLE PLAYER: I found single totally different from multi .. good 4 train we says...
1) COD4 MWarfare for the idea to split  COD formula also into our age.. genial, i think COD was into a danger with the third, the fourth saved all ship!
2)COD 2: just this: lots newer cool thinghs, fog war an example, panzer well built...EMOTION!
3) COD Infinite WF: Yeah! I love the storyboard of infinite...the jackals are fenomenal, the guns are not a replica of advanced and the eso doesn t prepare you anymore coffee 4 you!

ZombiesLands: Appeared into COD 5 WAW this idea took immedi9ately step in almost the future CODS...
1) COD 5 WAW: tribute to the pioneers!
2) COD Infinite WF: Try it!!!
3) COD advanced WF for the story and the actors, attention to money wasting!

WORST of Multi:
1) COD Advanced WF: Chaos, money waste, ridicoulous gaming for usual runners ...nothing good!
2) COD Infinite WF: They had the chanche to ""hat trik"" but the multi is quite egual to the first: Horrible, unplayable, too arcade
3)COD 5 WAW: Never liked but this is more an opinion based on tastes...

Worst of Single:
1)COD 3 for been made onli 4 consolles... i never could play that!
2)COD 7 Advanced WF: Is that an original trama? NO! It's a B-movie with seeker grenades!!
3)COD 6 Ghosts: INCONCLUDENT.... no pathos

Worst of Zombie:
1) Advanced if you wanna play gratis (after buying outside the game) you can't, just they force you to buy lots add on that became basic if you want to play against hardkores fanatiks
2) Ghosts: It's a ... GHOST!
3) .. all others are fine? did you agree?

Hope to be helpfull for someone!"
9637,While it's not as good as it used to be...still really good. Best COD campaign.
9638,"[h1]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2[/h1] (also known as Modern Warfare 2 or Call of Duty 6) - a computer game of the first-person shooter genre, made by the American Infinity Ward studio and published in 2009 by Activision, set in the realities of contemporary conflicts. Its premiere took place in versions for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles and personal computers with the Microsoft Windows operating system. This is the sixth part of the series of Call of Duty games, and at the same time a direct sequel of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, based on the same story that was crowned with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. 

[b]During the single-player campaign, the player controls five different characters:[/b]

Most of the time, the player takes on the role of junior sergeant Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson, member of the elite international anti-terrorist unit known as Task Force 141.However, the player starts the game by controlling the senior private Joseph Allen. Private James Ramirez, member of the 1st Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment and John ""Soap"" MacTavish becomes a character guided by the player in the last three missions

[b]Campaign:[/b]
Each level is a mission in which the player has several goals. They are displayed on the main panel, which indicates the direction and distance from certain targets. When the player receives damage, the game shows blood on the screen. Player's health regenerates after a while. Tasks differ in their requirements - the player must, for example, come to a particular checkpoint, eliminate enemies in a particular place, defend a given target or place explosives on hostile installations. The player is accompanied by allied forces who can not be ordered. During the campaign, you can collect enemy laptops containing intelligence information.

[b]Co-operation mode:[/b]
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 offers a co-op mode called Special Ops, which consists of independent missions designed just like the final mission of Call of Duty 4. These missions take place in different locations from the campaign mode, but are not similar to those in mode single player games. In the Special Ops mode, at most two people can play on a local network or via the Internet. The attached scenarios include a race on snowmobiles between two players, cooperation between air and ground forces, gated fencing and the elimination of a certain number of soldiers at a given time.

Special Ops is divided into five separate mission groups: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta and Echo. Each mission can be played on three levels of difficulty. Successful completion of the mission results in giving the player stars; their number depends on the level of difficulty chosen. The more stars the player has, the more missions are unlocked.

[b]Multiplayer:[/b]
Multiplayer mode with Modern Warfare 2 retains the same system of experience points and rewards to unlock as in Call of Duty 4. Supported game variants are Free-For-All, Search & Destroy, Demolition, Sabotage, Domination, Team Deathmatch and Capture The Flag. As the game progresses, the player receives new weapons, equipment and accessories, as well as promotes in the hierarchy. Several new products have been introduced in Modern Warfare 2. The player can choose the types of support available, which is activated in the event of killing several or a dozen enemies in a row. Players after making a certain number of killings gain access to a tactical nuclear attack. The party that calls it wins the round. Another new feature is the ability to quickly select a new match host, if the previous one leaves the game. In some variants of the game, the possibility of playing from the perspective of a third person was also introduced."
9639,ahh
9640,Epic
9641,Best multiplayer ever created in the history of games. Play I W 4 x to avoid the hackers
9642,"A whole bunch of great coop missons (Spec Ops), still play it after all these years :-)"
9643,Too many screeching 12 year olds? Play spec ops instead. Worked for me.
9644,io
9645,"Got called a fagoot while being shot in the head by a guy who was hacking his game. 

10/10 - Great for making friends."
9646,"Turns out that the multiplayer is still active and hacker free(mostly), so I strongly recommend picking it up if you missed it, or just want a nostalgia trip."
9647,great game : )
9648,DO NOT BUT IT FROM STEAM - finally bought the PC ver. Steam's $20 price is rediculous. Gamespot has it for $10. Other's may be even cheaper.
9649,1
9650,"+rep Great game to connect with your long lost father,I found mine while playing on some random guys pc."
9651,VAC Banned for no reason for 1k days
9652,"One of the best first person shooter in the CoD series ever. Now, getting a bit old and the new great engines the graphics are still good. The feeling, the controls and the story. 10/10"
9653,"multiplayer amazing, campaign one of the most unreal fantastic things ever, doesnt seem to get old, speceial ops are litty, honestly though this is just great.( NEED SOME HELP WITH SOME SPECIAL OPS DM ME xx)"
9654,"After all those years still an unparalleled experience of fiction storytelling by the means of playable video games.
Probably the best first person modern time shooter with a meaning, incredible soundtrack and many memorable scenes with actually unique play elements.

This game aged beautifully. Still a gorgeous and fun experience. Easy to complete in one day's playthrough."
9655,One of the best in CoD series even 10 years after the release.
9656,"Although this was (according to me) the best Call of Duty in the series, Modern Warfare 2 is now 9 years old, and it's apparent in gameplay. I still start it up from time to time, but get tired of it fairly quickly. There are players in [i]some[/i] playlists, but certainly not in all of them. If you manage to pick this up on a sale, you would probably enjoy it, but otherwise skip this! (There are rumours about an upcoming remaster of this game, so I would just wait for that instead of buying Modern Warfare 2 now.)¬®

Disclaimer: Although steam says I've played 5 hours of this game, I have 250 hours in the Multiplayer-client. I have also 500+ hours on console."
9657,nice game!
9658,"The story picked up where Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare left off. The Modern Warfare 2 campaign takes you through a series of events from the point of view of several different soldiers that were hand picked for a special forces unit named ‚ÄúTask Force 141‚Äù. You fight through large and immersive environments all over the world including an airport in Moscow, suburban America, Russian Gulags, and a Favela in Rio de Janeiro. The gripping storyline twists and turns your emotions as characters develop before your eyes. The true beauty of the campaign is that no time is wasted, everything that you do is for a reason and is used to piece together the finale. Every mission is a highlight in the best constructed military gallery to date and it leaves you in anticipation for the primary protagonist and antagonist to come face to face and tie up the loose ends.

The multiplayer initially released featuring 16 maps before DLC added several more maps to rotation as well as classic maps Overgrown and Crash from Call of Duty 4. The original maps take place in modified versions of the environments that the campaign missions took place in. MOST of the maps are well designed and look good. The multiplayer features some of the most iconic killstreak rewards and air support ever in a Call of Duty title. The ‚Äúbrrrrtt‚Äù sound made by the harrier as a another kill is added to your streak or the pounding of chopper gunner were so satisfying; But nothing made you adjust your playstyle faster than hearing 120mm shells scream to the earth from an enemy AC130.I personally always felt frustrated with grenade launchers and explosives killing me when I felt like I had no chance. As I played the game I learned that there is always a way to counter another players play-style and with 24 primary weapons, 20 secondary weapons, 14 weapons attachments, 7 explosive equipment, and a riot shield there are plenty of options. For me it was the most enjoyable and competitive Call of Duty ever released.

I would love to see the game get remastered as the Call of Duty games in recent years have been lackluster.

This game should win best alternate history game every single year."
9659,"I first played through this game on the xbox during my middle school and early high school years. I can't even tell you the number of hours I've sunk into this game. No other Call of Duty stands up to it. Yes it has flaws, but I enjoy it anyway."
9660,best game
9661,"Amazing game, one of the best of the entire series. Totally worth buying when it's on sale."
9662,...
9663,Great story
9664,"Really Fun Game But If You Havent Played This Game By Now, You Have Very Much Missed The Hype, Why Are You Even Looking At Reviews For This Game. Click Install Or Dont, Game Was Good Back Around 2012 But Is Outdated Now!"
9665,"Decent FPS, decent COD for what the franchise has become now, but still COD4 was way better.
Buy on sale, or buy COD4."
9666,"fun but entirely broken, cant load multiplayer because it just freezes on startup"
9667,"WARNING!!! 
As of now the ""hacks"" are so heavy and toxic that it's not even worth trying to play. 
There are the hacks that won't even  let you exit the game at all forcing to sign out of the windows account or restart the pc. Suck that those autisti** retar*** shit** whoR** don't leave the game be."
9668,"Nostalgia - Modern Warfare 2 is simply the best Call of Duty that was ever made. The original community was the most fun part about the game. The S&D 6 man lobbies just to hit some trickshots, the 1v1's against some kid talking trash about your quickscoping, the modded lobbies with free prestiege all weapons, the memorable campaign, amazing stuff. 10/10 - Even now the Campaign still holds up, and the multiplayer (although filled with tons of hackers and modded lobbies) is still the same feeling."
9669,"Still pretty decent, killstreaks get out of control but still fun to play."
9670,Good times
9671,nice game gg
9672,"REMEMBER, NO RUSSIAN!!"
9673,great game
9674,Great fps game!

9679,Great game.
9680,"This game is still going strong with an active community. However, you will more than likely only get into the Team Deathmatch. The campaign is still great as always in the Modern Warfare series. If the game ever goes on sale for $9.99 (preferably lower) I think it is worth the asking price. The game is still loads of fun as it was when it first released and the campaign is still a blast to go through."
9681,"Cool game to play. The best COD in my opinion.
Campaign is awesome, Multiplayer is really fun.


10/10 recommended"
9682,you gonna learn to many thinks from this game
9683,"Best CoD made, with Black Ops 1 and Black Ops 2. Hope the Bo4 is grouse."
9684,"One of my all time favorite games. Not because of the game entirely. Mainly cause of the countless hours of fun I had playing with friends. I only have a few on steam but back in the day I must have played 1000+ hours. If you have never played this I dont expect you will have the same expeince with this or any Call of Duty game at this point in time. But they are known for a reason, and this game is a big reason why. 9 out of 10"
9685,Spent 311 hours on this game... Enjoyed every bit of it
9686,It's not bad.
9687,"I can't believe that I thought this game still has a very good player base. There are only HUNDREDS playing this game and if only you can changer servers like NA, SA, SEA, Australia, etc. It would be much better
"
9688,"for such an old but amazing Call of Duty title I'm surprised by the loss in support for older titles, i get it the games not the newest thing on the shelved but its till a fun time to be had i just wish the servers could be more populated, i had checked the numbers yesterday and less than 2000 players at peak hours, i prefer boots on ground FPS but its sad to see this game slowly fade. if possible reccomend this to anyone get them into the game again let it thrive and maybe show sledgehammer studios how a REAL COD should be made"
9689,The AI is horrible.
9690,"Still the best Call of Duty game ever released. If you want more out of multiplayer, check out what the XLabs Devs made."
9691,Heavily scripted boring campaign with little freedom or pacing on your own. Then again the COD franchise is all about multi player and not this single player campaign.
9692,the greatest of the whole series i guess .

9697,u wash ur hands with soap
9698,"Boring, oversaturated enemy AIs that make this a run and gun and that's about it. Very linear and just a subpar game. Play Arma instead."
9699,"Genre-defining classic. You should've gotten it in 2009. Shit was my childhood, don't bother anymore."
9700,"The last good CoD, probably forever."
9701,cool fps game. but its almost impossible for me to find a public match. Cool ass campaign especially it being made in 2009. better than most games nowadays. probably one of my favourite games out there.
9702,FUCK SERGEI
9703,"Where's the dedicated servers Infinity Ward?! 

Where's the servers shit head?!

Instead of responding with a quarky remark, Infinity Ward drowned in the toliet."
9704,"PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW!! its fun, granted you will be placed in custom servers more than normal games, but still fun"
9705,A Classic
9706,Good shooting game.
9707,I miss you
9708,"Not much to say really, It's MW2... But amazing to replay and still looks well today maxed out, Didn't notice how short the campaign truly is though, completed in roughly 5 hours total on hardest diff. Still worth it, Best CoD."
9709,but guys srsly the community was just a bunch of 6 year olds who stole there mums credit cards and 32 year olds still living in there mums basement.
9710,No Multiplayer games? worked fine 2 months ago but now no games in the lobbies? What's up?
9711,best cod campaign <3
9712,"This game is a must have for all fps fans. The multiplayer can be one sided though. Depending on your hardware/software. For instance a player with a $300 pc, would'nt have the advantage a player with a more expensive setup. I would recommend a gaming or at least a 6 button mouse for starters. It's the one thing I can think of that would explain why I log into the middle of a team deathmatch and get my butt kicked before I can even get someone in my crosshairs. I don't know if anyone else has the problems I have with seeing other players on the game. It appears that sometimes I get taken out before I even know theres anyone nearby, as if they can see me through the walls or around corners... 
   All in all I enjoy the challenge this game brings, also the rewards for playing make it worthy of the time spent."
9713,"A very well put together game, lot's of fun especially if you want somewhat easy achievements to boast about or just like the achievement grind. Spec Ops can be fun yet frusterating, and I think Hidden on Veteran is either impossible or you need the reflexes of a mongoose on adderall to get through it. Campaign is solid and runs suprisingly better than CoD4 for some reason. I get around 20-30 frames on CoD4, yet here on a game 2 years younger I can run a solid 50-60 fps. Guess it's just MacOS acting up again. I haven't touched on the multiplayer, and there is a reason for it. I can't run it. Whenever I try to load up the multiplayer, I get ""Fetching Playlists"" forever, and it doesn't go past that. Now I've noticed that my NAT Type is set to strict, so that is most likely the problem, but insofar I haven't been able to bear witness to One Man Army n00btubes or just any of the bad aspects of multiplayer in general. Pretty good game, 7.9 out of 10. If you want to buy, wait for a sale and grab it for like $10. Usually happens everytime a new DLC drops for the newest CoD game, so just wait a bit and you'll be fine,"
9714,"I love the story of the Modern Warfare trilogy and multiplayer is fun as well.
Score; 9/10"
9715,Multiplayer does not work.
9716,"8/10 - Have You Ever Played A COD Game??? , Yes?, Good , This Game Is Awesome , Allot Of Weapons And Its Really Fun Overall."
9717,Classic. Best CoD
9718,Its pretty good.
9719,Honestly the best Call of Duty of all time. The only games that compare to its greatness in the Call of duty franchise is Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3. Other then that everything after Modern Warfare 3 has been complete garbage. 10/10 Will always play again.... Also hopefully Black Ops 4 brings Call of Duty back to the good old days.
9720,Still better then every other cod
9721,"This game is up-to it's Mark, good storyline."
9722,this game is the reason why i dont have a gf and friends lol
9723,"Full of MLG N00B Tubers, the filth that use last stand and the scum of the Earth that use martyrdom. But has terminal (best map in any video game)

11/10 would slaughter innocent civilians and last stand again"
9724,The Best Story I Have Played In A Game
9725,"Well, last time I played, the online multiplayer was crawling with cheaters and other undesirables. Let's get that out of the way. Fortunately, there are mods to the game which enable servers, so you can avoid the public lobby games entirely. The campaign is the same shooting gallery as it always was, while Spec Ops is still a lot of fun.

I can't recommend the game to new or returning players, since the multiplayer experience was the main selling point of the title and that simply hasn't held up. Good luck to you if you buy the DLC!

The one instance I could possibly recommend this game is if you have a friend buy it with you and you play through the Spec Ops missions. But only if the game was on sale.

2/5"
9726,mastapiece
9727,Why the **** are machine pistols better than assault rifles
9728,better guns  gratter site disincce
9729,"I don't appreciate players whom are sweaty that plays multiplayer, sweats and goes tryhard mode with not randomized team. It's like a lady in labor, except her child would grow up as a greasy, obese, toxic, salty, cheatin, fucktard who spreads intoxicating gas throughout players. I never prefer this game. In Addition to my rant, the hitboxes, hitreg, and timing on this (Best Campaign) but shit multiplayer game is bollocks."
9730,I like dis game
9731,brady fuin bad
9732,It's like MW3 but 2 years older and not as good
9733,"Noob tube.
"
9734,this game is great controlls meh graphics fine it is a runable game for a 2006 computer/pc (witch i play on) and voice chat is fine and not much lag on old computers servers are perfect i recommend this game if you can't afford or play new call of duty games this is perfect for you
9735,"This game is absolutely OG. I still remember playing this game on my ps3 and quickscoping and trying to trickshot. In 2018 this game is not the same. A LOT more hackers than years ago but it doesn't matter so much. Story is amazing and I had good time playing it on veteran.

Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 is 8/10"
9736,"It's fun, but since VAC bypass is a thing, enjoy getting in a lobby with an aimbotter/waller every other time around."
9737,"HI 
BAY"
9738,"Like many other active users, I've been playing MW2 since it came out. This is the game that got me into FPS-style games and into Call of Duty in general. Nowadays, I play MW2 mainly for nostalgia and because I can still enjoy it as a classic FPS. Other than that there are two things to keep in mind when purchasing:
1. The game is almost 10 years old. The problems that come with a 10 year old game are to be expected.
2. The game is loaded with hackers, but more often than not, you get into a non-hacked lobby in which you can enjoy the nostalgiac MW2 experience."
9739,"when i first played this game on ps3 i had a relatively stable relationship with my parents. after i stopped playing it, i did not.

correlation or some bullshit"
9740,"So at the beginning of the game you know that you are falling into a shithole of a gaming experience. The storyline was terrible and it just followed the exact same thing which was just shoot the fucking bad guy, and to make it even worse I have to pay an extra 60 quid to play the end of the story (mw3) . do not buy."
9741,Game of the year
9742,Would get clapped by grenade launchers again 10/10
9743,Perfeito :)
9744,i think you should crack down on hackers and cheaters in all your multiplayer games the amount of cheating is just sick and disrespectful to gamers with real skill i hope the steam hq will see this and hope they do something about it thank you
9745,GIT GUD
9746,"This is my favourite Call of Duty. I like the variety in the campaign and the new attachments on the weapons of the time, like the heartbeat sensor. Also, seeing Soap McTavish in full tilt is pretty lit, and the game also carries on the whole ""jumping into a helicopter"" trend which is kind of a trademark. I guess this was the first game that brought America being invaded into the COD franchise, heavily inspired by the likes of Red Dawn and Olympus has Fallen, especially with a mission name like ""Wolverines"". Multiplayer was a brief experience, as in I jumped into my first lobby and was instantly ranked up to Level 55 10th Prestige everything unlocked with an ASSIST, which just shows which direction the multiplayer has gone since the newer games have come out. I play this game for the story exclusively, though, and will return to this for random playthroughs for a long time yet. 8/10"
9747,"9 years later, still the best Call of Duty ever made"
9748,pretty good
9749,I've been playing this game for years on peasant console race of the xbox 360 and I have raged time and time again from those noob tubers and for some reason I will always come back for more because this game no matter what is fun and broken but that is what makes this game special and great! I love this game has the best multiplayer in the series (my opinion) and it is pretty addicting to play!
9750,10/10 brings back good memories.

9752,"Very many shooting
Is good I can kill people

Very good"
9753,"The store page lists ""Co-op"" as one of the gameplay modes. If they are suggesting that multiplayer team deathmatch is co-op, then they don't know what co-op means. Co-op implies that the single player game can be played ""cooperatively"" with other human players. The original 1998 Rainbow Six had it , as did all of it's sequels. Battlefield 1942 (2002) had it, as did the other Battlefield games through 2008-2009ish. I'm not sure why this has become such a hard feature to find in a game. It is very frustrating. And since my wife and I bought this game for the sole purpose of playing it together, we are getting a refund."
9754,"Hiya guys if you cant get mw2 to work on windows 10 follow these steps,


The main reason the game dont work is that its a windows 32bit game and directx 10 is also 32bit 
All you have to do is make 32bit work on a 64bit system, follow these step on this youtube site first  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbV-PQycT8, this should work , if it doesnt do these steps aswell, open c drive go to program files the click steam then go to steam apps then common choose your game then click redlist find directx and run dx setup exe, also once thats done set compatability by going back to where the game is stalled in common right click your game and choose properties and set campatibility to windows 7 for both apps 2player and single
This will work 100% no probs :)"
9755,Very good game i remember playing this game with my brother on Xbox 360
9756,Nice
9757,Its still MW2 but give it a few years and it will just be like World at war with all the hackers and modded servers. Also do not buy unless its on sale.

9/10 its still a cod game

edit - 
game of the year 2019"
9770,"good game in all, but what makes my faveroute cod probaly the terminal map!"
9771,"I downloaded MW2 again after hearing about the remaster (without MP) to see what's still going on in this game. 
You can easily find a TDM lobby, other game modes vary. The hacker problem the game had 3-5 years ago seems to have solved itself, I haven't encountered any hackers in the last two days I played.

All in all this is my favorite CoD of all time, the game is still incredible fun and the MP is very balanced.
I don't have the DLCs so I can't tell what's going on there or if the activity is any better.

Still worth a grab today, 20 bucks isn't that much and you get an awesome Singleplayer, very fun Special OPS and a still active Multiplayer (the best of all CoDs).

10/10 would buy again"
9772,First COD game i ever bought. I bought it for the PS3 and now decided to play it again on PC.
9773,"very I M P R E S S I V E
"
9774,"Wow, what a game. Best in the franchise as far as I am concerned. In depth single  player coupled with a fantastic multiplayer.

Multiplayer servers for free for all and team death match are still dedicated and I can easily slot in a match which is still a bonus."
9775,"i need anybody that play special ops, add me plase. i need you all (:"
9776,"I love mw2 I think it's one of the top 3 cod's of all time, great game."
9777,Nice classic game. You can enjoy even today
9778,Great movie in which ... I played!
9779,"Outstanding story. Outstanding gameplay. Outstanding music. Great graphics for 2009. Spec Ops is amazing and fun.

What a fucking game. I know I only have 3 hours, but if this counted my Xbox hours on the game.

Holy shit I'd have over 500 at least.

10/10

This was at the peak of Call Of Duty."
9780,Love this game
9781,The best game. There is no better game.
9782,bery nice
9783,"Too many hackers, no bans."
9784,Classic. Playing through the campaign on Veteran is something every person should experience
9785,My first match of mp also got hacker. GG.
9786,It's Call of Duty.
9787,How do i play multiplayer mw2 steam pc it backs me out the game but great game.
9788,"A classic. Believable, fun, immersive. The best games in Call of Duty are the Modern Warfare ones. I hope this one gets a remaster."

9800,"This is by far one of the best Call of Duty games ever. It is a classic and if you have never played this are you even living? Unfortunatly i did not get to play MW2 when it was in its prime. But it is still fun to this day.

Pros- 
Like Cheese and Wine it gets better with time.
Great story that expands on the story of Modern Warfare and continues into MW3.
Spec Ops is still a fun challeging game mode to play with friends when you are bored.

Cons-
Cons are unavailable"
9801,Greatest cod
9802,"Game is still fun after all these years. Still stands as one of my favorite CoD's and is a huge nostalgia trip that's fun to boot up sometimes. Sadly, since this is PC, the multiplayer is kinda dead and I can't play my favorite gamemode of all time (S&D) too often. Besides the hefty price tag of such an old game I could pick up for half at GameStop and the aforementioned multiplayer, would recommend cause the campaign and co-op are still fun as balls."
9803,"The Best Call Of Duty!
Espero que lo remastericen"
9804,nope
9805,"Great game, Multipayer still alive in  2018."
9806,"More of the same pew pew games for 10 year old kids. No strategy, just shoot and run around like a prick. The game takes your hand and tells you where to go, what to do, and how exactly has to be done, and, sometimes, what buttons to press if you are stuck.  Next COD title may be come with the option to play itself."
9807,Best game EVER!!!!!!!!!
9808,üòÄ(„ÄÄÔºæ‚àáÔºæ)
9809,Fun
9810,"Worth every penny.
Played the campaign a lot of times before but it never gets boring.
Multiplayer is fine too, you can get in some matches pretty easily and everything is fine overall.
This game is just legendary."
9811,Needs xbox one controller support but great game
9812,Bloody good game still 5 years after i bought it
9813,"Very good classic game. 
Haven't really gotten any nodded lobbies which is strange cause' people at it had quite a lot. 
It has descent gameplay and guns frim which my favourite is the ACR. 
So yeah,  10 out of 10 warfares 

"
9814,"2100+ hours of playtime in MP. Definitely worth it. Sadly, there are hackers now and then, but even they can't stop me loving this great game! :D"
9815,"It has multiplayer, unlike the remastered one"
9816,Had me hooked by mission 2. If there is a snowmobile in BO4 I'll probably have to buy it.
9817,"its amazing
"
9818,"Oh the nostalgia, bringing back memories of screaming at my TV from a noob tube being launched from the opponents spawn... Never the less this game still stands up great today and I thoroughly enjoy playing it just as much as in the past. If you want to get into the Call of Duty franchise definitely start here, you won't regret it."
9819,"It looks good, it plays good, the story is intense and the multiplayer is inviting."
9820,"This is by far the pinnicle of the Call of Duty Series. 4K Ready (Ratings Far above any other Application of this time and era and still above most to date), 3D Ready, (Over the top 3D performance highest rating of all of the Call of Duty 3D Games.(When I say 3D I mean Stereoscopic 3D.)). 

The Story is simple and has been recycled over and over since. The emotional and visceral expierience is beyond compare and continues to pull me back even with the release of the new C.O.D. titles. This is the one YOU MUST HAVE! If you are a gamer you'll know the stories, They are all true!"
9821,"This game is full of hackers and cheaters,still MLG420BLAZEIT"
9822,"Reminds me of the good times when you didn't have to buy supply drops to unlock good guns
"
9823,it is good game
9824,Awesome !
9825,"gud gaym.
"
9826,"Hey, all of Call of Duty games are great !!! But this is second best on the World !!!"
9827,"Still as good as ever.

Matchmaking is still populated. Not too many hackers or noob-tubers, but people have gotten stupidly good over the years. Solid campaign, hilariously fun, challenging and distinct spec ops missions. I've played it twice on both PC and PS3, and the only downside on PC here is just the lack of splitscreen.

Weapon variety is solid ‚Äî every gun feels unique with its own strengths and weaknesses. Game balance follows the classic, ""Nothing is overpowered if everything is"" mantra. Which makes for some [i] very [/i] interesting metas, since every gun has an advantage to be absolutely exploited (I'm looking at you, Akimbo Rapid Fire MP5ks >:3)

The map design always has flow, where there are always multiple paths to take that cater to different playstyles, yet none of expose every other lane to constant risk of being shot in the back. It's also a super amount of fun to learn the power positions on each map, and fight for control for it, clearing out the defenders and holding up for it yourself.

Unfortunately, Team Deathmatch is the only gamemode that's practically possible to play. I'll miss you, Ground War, though if you're lucky you might get thrown into a modded lobby with 18 players.

The nostalgia is real. This game definitely stands the test of time."
9828,Is nice.
9829,">Went online to see if I could run this game
>Downloaded dodgy looking program
>Ran dodgy program
>Website said I couldn't run it

Games pretty good as well."
9830,gg
9831,Great Game!
9832,10\10 MASSTAPEICE
9833,IMO the best COD game ever.
9834,One Man Army + ACR + Grenade launcher + Blue dragon camo = Average TDM player
9835,"God, I miss this game. The good ol times where kids wouldn't scream ""I fucked your mom"", and when CoD wasn't P2W... 

Good times, really good times. Miss them.

200/10 would recommend. I hope the remastered will be worth it and not bundled with some bs futuristic P2W cod that nobody wants anyway."
9836,"One of the best Call of Duty games, but the PC port is a joke."
9837,Brings back the old days.
9838,10/10 would get tubed again
9839,Best COD game.
9840,Bloody terrible keeps frezzing for no reason and anytime I go onto muiltiplayer it keeps crashing even tho im running a i7 with a 1070 it still keeps crashing dont recommand at all :(
9841,no words needed.
9842,SUCKS! I can get it for ten dollars on my xbox 360.
9843,it will always be the best call of duty
9844,"good game, nice to see what all the praise is about."
9845,"Molto bella la Campagna. 

Interessante....."
9846,enjoying the VACation
9847,"one of the best games i've played before, highly recommend it, you don't need a gaming pc to run it, the graphics are cool, and this games was realized in 2009 still alot of people playing it in the multiplayer version, if you haven't play any call of duty game i think this game will be a good start."
9848,"Even after all that time it is great fun, epacially the challenges :)"
9849,"Remember, No Russian."
9850,This is one of the best part of Call of Duty series. It‚Äôs pretty short but the story is very good. Maybe you will die a lot (like me) but atleast you would‚Äôt be bored.
9851,"so now after completing whole story i can finally write a review. First of all the story isnt long, it takes about 8-9 hours to complete but even in this small amount of time the story throws you into something epic. If you like action, and when im saying iaction i mean that you stop shooting only when youre realoading, this game is just for you. there are two things that i want to point up, with first being the soundtrack. It starts playing right in time and all those emotions in it, it just does its job. second thing that blew my ming was variety of weapons you can play with and all those attachements you can find on them. The storytelling of this game is quite chaotic in the begging but then youll accept that it is how it is. Now for the story overall. I mean its not bad actaully its quite good especially when you play as a task force 141 member but what i didnt like about it was that it didnt tell you much of a story because you had to contrate on the shooting all the time. Im not saying this because i dont like shooting but because i think that the story could be done littel bit better (i know that listening to those intermissions gave you enough inte but you get it)

Now for the multiplayer. if you want to get into the whole cod thing get this game, its worth the money. but youll have to accept that youll be dying alot in the beggining cuz all those people with max levels and full loadouts will kill you.  But i didnt play mp that much so i wont talk about it that much

So to sum things up
game 7.5/10
story 8/10
Storytelling 6/10
weapon choice 9,99/10
action 11/10
Multiplayer 6/10

One shot one kill
"
9852,Pretty good gameplay ok story
9853,Remember. No Russian.
9854,its still a good COD game even though its old and i like the graphics
9855,not laggy at all one of my favorete games
9856,"Should i even write a review ? :D i mean.. this game is legendary, every single person should try it :)"
9857,This game is lit and so awsome to play.

9873,"Extreme Bass Fishing 2018 is the best fishing game ever. The casting in this game is just perfect, I cant wait to get back, sit on the river bank and cast line out. I just love the feeling of catching those bass. God Bless you Ubisoft for making a darn tootin fishing game 5/5

9874,"It's 2018 and COD is still lit! I spent almost all of my childhood playing COD and going to the gym, good ol days playing XBOX 360. I just thought I'd miles well buy this game back when steam had the COD sales and I don't regrest it at all. Theres not one person who does not know the existence of Modern Warfare 2, its pressence at the time dominated both PC and Console. With that being said if your looking for a good FPS game I highly recommend this, so fun man... I'm low key still playing Campaign though, I'm getting smashed online at the moment so practice makes perfect am I right. Cheers."
9875,"got banned i guess? was better before i got banned, now the gameplay is pretty shitty"
9876,this game is probally one of the best call of dutys in my opinion i love the story i got it when it was 10 and i porbally gonna beat the game over and over again cause its great
9877,Best of all times
9878,"One of the best COD games ever created. Great story, good graphics for 2009, nice multiplayer and Special Ops Co-Op missions. At this moment, there are a lot of tryharders in MP, but I don't think that's a minus because of the age of the game.

10/10.
"
9879,"Everyone CHEATS on the game. People either see through walls, kill you with one shot, have auto aim, can't be killed, or all thee above. This game is not what it used to be. I am suprised that they aren't using cheating counter measures. If you wanna buy this game for it's online play, don't. Complete waste of time."
9880,This game is a master piece and deserves it's remaster i remember when this game came out me and my dad would play it all the time.It's story is one of the best call of duty campaigns to this day with the soundtrack.I highly recomend you get this game if you never played it
9881,Soap is a total heart throb and that is a good enough reason to buy this game.

No spoilers though ;) I bought this game for $19.99 and it was well worth it. I've never been huge on CoD multiplayer, so I can't really give a good description of MW2's multiplayer experience, but don't let a dead/small multiplayer keep you from buying this game. Reccomended 10/10"

[b][h1]+Storyline:[/h1][/b] Continues where MW1 has left off. Dramatic, Intense & Plot Twist Storyline.

9899,1v1 me on Rust
9900,One of the best game ever made by far. Too bad it constantly crashes on my high end PC in 2019...
9901,"Briliant game, awesome story, great graphics, realistic and believeable warfare at a ground pounding level, lots of really interesting missions, I played it on really high settings on a GTX980 vid i7 CPU 8 core 5960 and 16g RAM and it plays sweet as, really great fun, took about a week to do the story campaign mode loved every minute of it, recommend the game highly."
9902,ohh
9903,MW 1 was the game changer with F'S.  MW2 was the perfection of fast-paced and hectic shooters. After this it all went downhill but holy Mary jesus of Istanbul this game was and is great. Everyone should have this because it truly is a classic. Perhaps the only CoD worth playing.
9904,I picked this game up because I remember how much fun it was back when it came out. I played through the campaign and spec ops and had a ton of fun so if that's why you want this game go for it. However when I went to enjoy some multiplayer and it feels like every match is just full of hackers so much so it's not really enjoyable. So if you're just buying this for the multiplayer unless you're just playing with friends it's probably not worth it sadly.
9905,"Masterpiece, no matter when you played it, if when it released or thru the years, it's still amazing. 
a must play game, can't wait for the remastered."
9906,ha yee
9907,"great game but the servers are shutting down

I know it's not good when you found ''hackers'' but any game has a defect


Price: Sale
Audio/Video: SUPERB
Need a good PC?: meeah not that good

Know i wait to buy Modern Warfare 3"
9924,"As someone who played it on console when it came out, I wanted to give it a nostalgia trip. So it's probably my fault it didn't completely live up to expectations.

It's very clear this was optimized for Consoles, as the PC port has some performance and stability issues. This game is from 2009, and won't run at 144hz consistently at 1440 on a 1080ti and Ryzen 1700x. This is probably due to mediocre single-core speed if anything.
Also the graphics options are a joke, Nekopara has better tweak options. Resolution, which isn't a drop-down menu- you have to spam click to get to the option you want- limited choices. Anti-ailiasing options, texture quality, shadows on or off, and that's pretty much all.

Some load triggers lag or glitch, and camera movement is severely limited during the cinematic moments, the entire reason I got this game again.

But the game is truly cinematic, the gulag assault is a work of art, the combat feels more ""realistic"" compared to Counter-Strike with single controlled shots being the method to target individual hostiles, spamming only for panic and close-quarters, and the FOV is so closed off as to be nauseating.

As for multiplayer, the community is lacking, only match I was able to find at Noon on a weekday being Team Deathmatch, seemed to be populated with hackers. The same broken shit is still in the game, like Scrambler, Heartbeat Sensors, Noob Toob spamming, so on. Multiplayer in MW2 is a grind, albiet a small one. The FOV in multiplayer is worse than in campaign, a lot of people I know have been VACd from COD for FOV increases.

Worth the $10 I paid for it."
9925,The perfect timewaster!
9926,campaign is above average while multi is bloody awful- just the way i remembered it.
9927,"Going into this I thought I'd be looking through nostalgia glasses, oh boy how I was wrong. The multiplayer surprisingly holds up well to any veteran of this game from back in the day. Plays the same as it always has. 

Only issue is the somewhat low player count. TDM or FFA are your only options but that isn't a problem for me. However the connections can be due to peer to peer from one side of the world to another. Either way my experince has been positive"
9928,probably my fav call of duty. Still very fun to play and has a great story in single player.
9929,The calling people hackers Simlator 2018. 10/10
9930,"This game is and will forever be my favorite Call of Duty game. This was the second COD game I played, the first being Black Ops. I never played the multiplayer until like a year after i bought the game for my ps3, and I always loved playing the campaign and uping the difficulty everytime I beat it, and colloecting the intel was a blast too. This game's soundtrack compliments it scenery and gameplay and is just amzing to listen to, Hans Zimmer did an amazing job of scoring this game. Overall, this is an amazing game and it is worth your money."
9931,"I know that primarily these games are designed for players who are very much into this sort of game.  Therefore, having played this and other simiar games, regular players are very good at this. And so to a certain extent I get games like this aren't really pitching to me, therefore whether or not I rate this game hardly matters.

I have no experience with this sort of game.  Always been one of those boring strategy and slow game fans (Civilisation, Football Manager etc.)  But I thought I'd give this a go as I fancied a change of pace and thought this might be fun (you know, like a game is supposed to be)

UTTERLY UNPLAYABLE. Now this may be down to my lack of experience but no matter what I play, missions, career style game or online free for all's... I get slaughted immediately and often so quickly I have no real clue what's going on. Again and again.  So hopelessly boring after a while.

Well it's probably down to my lack of experience I think.  I perservere and try to get better.  Well I can't.  Been playing this game for days and the online games are useles to me.  I die within 5 seconds, respawn, someone I can't see kills me within another 5 seconds.  I'm clearly playing against much better players at a pace I can't compete with.

The mission games, I just can't get passed the basic stages.  It's too hard, on the easiest setting.

Now I know some will think ""You're just hopeless at this game mate. Play something else."" And if the developers of this game have zero interest in attracting new players who have not grown up playing this sort of thing, fine, I know when I'm not welcome.  But this is not real war, it's a game, for people to buy, play and enjoy.  Some people are pretty rubbish at computer games, I'm clearly part of this group. But I could find no way of playing this game that didn't just immediately make me feel like achieving anythig was impossible.  Owned for a few days, now deleting.  Will not buy any more games like it.  Leson learned."
9932,0/10 no hentai whatso ever. would play again
9933,"Whenever i started up my game it continues on a black screen when I click ""Play"".

I also dont know how to uninstall games. 

If someone has any suggestions, please help."
9934,"Bought on sale and replayed the campaign. 
I have personally found that amping up the volume drastically improves the experience.
It's still the awesome CoD I know from years past."
9935,"The pinnacle of Call of Duty. A true gem for its time. It marveled literally everybody, has music produced by Hans Zimmer and was developed by the Infamous developers at Infinity Ward that created Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The absolute best successor to the original. MW2 features a unique and invigorating single player with a crazy and fun multiplayer. Everything is explosive, everything is gameplay. Everything is fun. It's addictive."
9936,"best of all Modern Warfare games 
it has also good co-op (spec ops) no lag like mw3 and i hope the remastered  version will have surrvival like in mw3"
9937,.
9938,BEST CALL OF DUTY EVER BRINGS ME BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD EVERTIME I PLAY <3
9939,Still Awesome.
9940,Always been my favorite CoD
9941,Still great and playable even 11 years after release !
9942,http://store.steampowered.com/app/10180/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_2/
9943,"Great nostalgic game, amazing singleplayer, fun spec ops mode, and a decent multiplayer with a loyal population that peaks well for the weekend, with a good experience to be had as long as you don't run into hackers which I haven't as of yet, but it is a possibility judging by the age of this game.

9/10 - Singleplayer
7/10 - spec ops mode
8/10 - multiplayer"
9944,First off I would like to point out I have heard and seen more people complain about hackers than actual hackers (I‚Äôve only seen 2 hackers) honestly I think this game is really fun and I might die a lot and might not be as good as I use to be but none the less I still have a lot of fun!
9945,"Very good game, as of 2018 it still functions very well and is mostly clean on the hacker aspect i got this game beacause that is what my pc can handle but still better than today's cods"
9946,Hinnang: 6/10
9947,"As a fan of a few CoD games (MW1, WaW, BO1&2, AW) I got this on a whim because everyone seems to sing praises about this entry. Can't say I see the appeal, at least in the multiplayer department. The maps are just terrible chaotic meat grinders with too many ways to get shot in the back. I'd say any merits this game has are just from the nostalgia folks had playing this nearly ten years ago."
9948,"stupid fking shitty game waste my time, i should have been with my lover not playing this piece of crap which has no meaning to exist on this earth but pathetically as a paper towel to wipe u ass clean"
9949,"one of the best shooters of all time, far better than most modern shooter games"
9950,Nice call of duty game (:
9951,i bought this only for the multiplayer and it doesn't even work. waste of money.
9952,"AMAZING GAME I LOVE IT
"
9953,Bringing back memories of quickscopes with last kill is a 360 with style 1v1's on rust
9954,"I don't recommend buying this game for full price, even the sale price is too much for a ten year old game. 

Edit: Okay, fine. ppl think i'm poor or something so ill add shit.

- Game is almost 10 years old

- Unsupported by IW and activision, so nothing is gonna be done about hackers

- Servers are P2P, so if you have a low upload speed you're SOL.

- If you don't play at peak times, there's barely any gamemodes to pick from

- and to top it all off, this game is still 20 bucks. It was $20 on console in the bargain bin at walmart like 5 yrs ago. DLC is $30 too. This game is good, but it's honestly better on console. Cheaper, more players, less hackers, etc."
9955,"the muiltiplayer is more alive than mwr lol

worth getting, lots of fun"
9956,just get it.
9957,Nostalgic
9958,"Good game, very shooter much campers 10/10"
9959,Love it convinced my friends to buy it and there are no modded lobbies or hackers so far on my end :)
9960,"This game is amazing so much better than when i as 10-11 years old playing this back on conolse... lots of great fun on this game even with only 1000 people on at a time.... plus who doesnt love a great story this game really is fun just for the campaign too, and i meant 700fps are also a big plus if you are into that haha. i run this on a intel i7 with a gtx 1070 but i tried this on my 400 dollar laptop and still got around 90-100fps too and that was with an intel i5 latop version too with an okay graphics card pared with 4gb of ram compared to my desktop with 16gbs of ram so this game can run on basically anything!"
9961,"this is all i used to play when i was 6 or 7 years old on the Xbox 360 and now experiencing COD when it was actually good on PC is one of best feelings in the world i think it is still on sale for 9.99!!!!! If you've never played cod this is where you should start....................................


HEAVILY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!"
9962,"Damn, Just Damn, freaking amazing story, THOUGH ITS REALLY SHORT AND LEAVES ON CLIFFHANGER! great multiplayer. only met a couple hackers who nuke everyone. I have potato computer and I can run this real smooth

9/10 -1 for hackers"
9963,"I wanted to remember youth, my first acquaintance with this line of games. But ... It does not start any more. A couple of years ago everything was ok, now on a clean system, installation from scratch - still will not start. This is the 2018th year."
9964,"[b]Graphics[/b]
    Overall graphics is decent!

[b]Gameplay[/b]
    Gameplay is smooth, different types of weapons, very good missions, you can play in any difficulty on campaign, has online! and still active servers, overall gameplay is perfect!

[b]Sounds[/b]
    Every character talks lol, dialogue is great!, sorrounding sounds are perfect

[b]Price[/b]
    You can buy this at full price but if your saving some many maybe you can wait for it to sale!

[b]RATING:[/b] [i]9/10[/i]"
9965,"don't listen to people when they say theres alot of hackers i've been playing for atleast 4 hours and only encountered 1, you can just leave the match and join a new one and play the game you love. would highly recommend still has a high multiplayer count."
9966,I wish this game was controller compatible but other than that its complete fun and absolute gore if you're into that kinf of stuff...
9967,yes-
9968,Exactly as boring as you can imagine.
9969,"This was the beggining of the end for Call of Duty. The sequel to a master peice shooter that created a meta for all FPS to come.  It's just as good as ever, and you won't mind the older graphics. This was the last time they got it right, when they still cared. Before the dark times. I won't lie to you, there's still hackers(I was one of them) but it only took a couple days for them to VAC ban me, i mean i have a hack that removes the Vac ban but That isn't the point. Come back to a simpler time, a better time...and remember...no russian."
9970,Best video game ever
9971,I hate COD but modern warfare ive always loved
9972,"I highly recommend this game for PC gamers with 4gb of ram. Great graphics, Campaign, and Multiplayer."
9973,"Totally thought that you could have local multiplayer like on console, only reason I bought it. It doesn't support controllers, and it's kind of lame if it doesn't have any of that. You expect me to get all of my friends to buy this game and then bring their desktops over here for a party night? NOT GONNA HAPPEN, Console version is way better, steam version is bad."
9974,overrated for sure but still a solid action game
9975,"Okaaaay... I bought this game for 10 bucks and I fucking regret it.

The singleplayer is not as bad as I rememberd it to be but it still isn¬¥t anything more then just a pimped up firing range.



The multiplayer oho the multiplayer... just imagine the most unbalanced game you¬¥ve ever played and multiply it by 10.

You are gonna get destroyed by ""bunny hopping"" underbarrel granade launcher launching 16 year olds in the first 2 minutes of an team deathmatch game until one of them gets an harrier wich then grands him an chopper gunner with wich he is going to spawnkill you for 4 minutes until he a) gets an nuke and ends the ""game"" or b) gets an ac-130 with wich he will continue spawnkilling you.



Don¬¥t buy it."
9976,Now that they finally sell these old games for reasonable prices all i can say is that THIS GAME ROCKS!
9977,good game but a pain in the butt to get the multiplayer to start up at times
9978,Looks and runs very well. Campaign is pretty short tho
9979,The best history of the all time ^_^
9980,yes
9981,The best CoD of all time. Needs more chainsaw
9982,"Best call of duty hands down, so far in my two hours and half I haven't ran into one hacker."
9983,Where creativity goes to die.
9984,"I don't even own it. how am I writing this, valve?"
9985,"This game is amazing. I don't really understand why they want to make a remastered version, this one is still good and lots of people play multiplayer. The story in singleplayer is cool as well, for me it's one of the best CoD there is (I don't really enjoy the Advanced warfare or any of the futuristic nonsence..)"
9986,Pew Pew Pew
9987,<3 I'll miss you mw2.
9988,Great game! Nostalgia all day! Still live and strong'
9989,The campain is working just fin but the Multiplayer just wont open for me it will just freez when i try to open it up.
9990,"great Call of Duty entry. This game is almost reaching 9 years old but the graphics are still quite up to par on PC. The storyline is intreresting, gameplay is smooth, and is all around a great game. Would reccomend, just keep in mind One man army and noob tubes. It still is what it was, but most of those dudes have left CoD anyways."
9991,good
9992,One of my favourite COD game
9993,Best multiplayer experience other than halo 3 and reach. Original mountain dew and Doritos game
9994,i am the melon
9995,"Campaign is fun and extremely replayable, multyplayer's a cluster fuck but whaddaya expect its CoD"
9996,the last best COD
9997,no controller abilities
9998,My favourite Call of Duty not perfect but the best one in my opinion.
9999,Really Good Old CoD mw 2 when CoD was actually good
10000,TANGO SUCKA
10001,"still good for Aussie players not that hard to get a game, only a couple fags noob tubing."
10002,"yes, a good game. recommend HEAVY."
10003,Best game ever. This is school COD
10004,"By far the best game in the franchise in my opinion. Before you say ""well Cod4 was better blah blah blah"" I wasn't around when Cod4 was big, The game I grew up with in the Cod franchise was MW2 and it still is yet to be beaten in my opinion now a description od the game.

[u] Modes    [/u]

1:The Story
following on from Cod4 the story just gets better and better with new characters like Ghost, Roach, Shepherd and not to mention any of the side characters, And a story to fit full of [spoiler] BibleThump and PogChamp Moments!    [/spoiler] definitely one to play through if you haven't so far.

2:The Spec Ops
Being the 1st instalment of the Cod franchise to include a 3rd game mode it, Which was risky in my opinion because how would people perceive it well. I didn't mind it, But that might be because I didn't really have anyone to play with but I think it would be good if you do have someone to play with.

3:The Multiplayer
Finally the Multiplayer where to start, well 1st of all camos this game added to Cod4 success with its camo system by adding tons more but the most popular Fall Camouflage, this was everyone's destiny to get not including a Nuke(25 killstreak) but you could only unlock after getting 250 Headshots which let me tell you for little oh dreggz over here was pretty difficult but I got it in the end, but all around a good Multiplayer aswell.

Overall Rating:

Story 5/5
Spec Ops 3/5
Multiplayer 4/5

would recommend!"
10005,Great singleplayer and multiplayer! Even though the multiplayer can be sh*tty most of the time
10006,HERE COMES ANOTHER 40MM WIDE EXPLOSIVE CANISTER OF ANAL
10007,"I run this game. But, pause the show logo.  plz this game error fix :("
10008,YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
10009,"[i]I was sniped by a guy named ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•snipers. I asked him to explain this hypocrisy. So he said ''He who snipes snipers, runs the risk of becoming a sniper himself. If you gaze into the scope, the scope gazes back''

10/10.

Anyway, worth it. Best CoD there is including CoD 2 and Bo2. Wish it was like back in the days. 
Worth it 100%."
10010,Dank meme
10011,I would legit write a ten page essay to anyone who thinks this game isn't great
10012,"This stupid game wont run on y mac, not becuse iits old itss fully up to date but it freezes whenever i try to start the game"
10013,actually good game i play all day veri nice no peopol sae is bad bot i em veri goud at thes game thakns for mak it
10014,"This game was pretty good. Not the best I can say, but pretty awesome. 

The game is actually very fast on mac, but rots out on the FPS in a few months. This is the reason it's not the best. But as I said, it's still awesome. 

The guns are awesomely powerful if that's a word, and requires at least SOME skill. In order to actually enjoy this game, you have to have skills from any call of duty from the first, to BO1. 

Also has a unique art to the game unlike all the games after B02."
10015,This game is so good
10016,"Do I even need to touch on this broken masterpiece? When you know the whole story about the development team behind this game and how it had absolutely no support, it really makes you appreciate the initial effort to this game. Because despite all of the things that should have made this game bad, It's still amazing. However there is some balancing issues in the multiplayer and a declining player base, but still easy to get into a TDM or Search & Destroy Match.
9/10"
10017,Maybe the best CoD before zombies infested it.
10018,"i dont like it, it has no zombies"
10019,"As someone who has never played a Call of Duty in my life until I got this game, I'm very glad that I played this. The game is very fun, despite it not being uncommon to find hackers. From my experience, the community has been very good and accepting of me, although there have been some bad apples. I thoroughly enjoy this game, and I highly recommend it to others."
10020,"Note: I only rated this ""Would Recommend"" on the basis that multiplayer isn't considered. Considering multiplayer, i ""WOULD NOT"" recommend.
I love this game, and I loved it for many years before i decided to give it up.

Single player was fun and a nice continuation of CoD4:Modern Warfare. Multiplayer was incredible and the enjoyment lasted years.

Multiplayer is virtually unplayable at the moment because of how pervasive the hacking problem has become. You will be DDoS'd, forcibly removed from lobbies if you perform well, and even have malware installed on your PC via a breach which allows remote access(without a RAT). Wouldn't recommend buying this game if you only plan to play multiplayer."
10021,1.6 Hours+ Played
10022,"Good game, maybe even the best of all CoD series"
10023,By far the best Call Of Duty game EVER! Ive put several hours into it and im about to put in more. This is definitly a buy. :)
10024,also recommending
10025,Best call of duty ever hands down. Multiplayer still extremely active accompanied by an amazing campagin.
10026,this is awesome
10027,The game doesn't even load up anymore
10028,"amazing
"
10029,"Reinstalled, Joined tdm game, got noob tubed and i uninstalled"
10030,"
895292"
10031,yes m8
10032,its aight
10033,"One of the greatest CoDs of all time, only the memories that this game brings.Still playing today"
10034,This game is very Intense and great graphics. It also has a very good storyline to it with the other modern warfares. I reccomend buying it.
10035,They managed to make a UMP feel identical to an M4 in gunplay.
10036,"Things change faster, they also more remain the same.
Boundary transform, new roles to join, but power always find a place looked up.
We bloody battle with the russians, we ought to know they might hate us.
History is always a winner to write. At the moment, I think we win.
But whenever you put down an enemy, they will find a worse to replace him.
Site changed, the reason to change, things changed.
Yesterday's enemy is today's new recruits.
Training them with you fight, pray they don't finally let this hate you.
The same rotten, not the same day.

Five years ago. In the blink of an eye, I lost 30,000 brothers. But this world is just fucking sit on the sidelines. Tomorrow's world will not be a lack of volunteers and Patriot.I think you can understand."
10037,Very much fun. Good game
10038,It is epic so far :)but buy mw1 first
10039,"I used to play this all the time on xbox. Well optimized and made me go on a nostalgia trip. Only thing I don't like is that you get banned for opening console, dead multiplayer, and the price for it."
10040,amazing game
10041,Still probably the best Call of Duty Campaign.
10042,The campain is epic my favorite parts are the ranger missions near the end man it makes u feel like badass and a grunt at the same time
10043,"It sucks, because i cant change language to English... Stuck with German! -.-"
10044,"Well let me tell you something brothers, buy this shit."
10045,"While it's not my favourite out of the COD series, Modern Warfare 2 is still a great game. The presentation is top notch and an incredible improvement over the first. The gameplay is a lot more challenging with more balanced enemy placement, even though the A.I. is still about the same (which is mediocre). Not to mention the fun though un-balanced multiplayer and the challenging and surprisingly well made side content in the form of Spec Ops. Only complaints go into the plot being a bit ridiculous towards the end, how the checkpoint system can really put you into some pretty rubbish situations sometimes and that some of missions just repeat COD 4's All Ghilled Up mission structure. Overall a great game and a great sequel. Great Great."
10046,"One of the best cods. Shame about the lack of servers, console port and locked setting.
Would love if it was more relaxed like COD 4"
10047,"Theres not difference at all if u are playing this game on Xbox, PlayStation or PC. Noobtubers will always be there."
10048,this good game 10/10 buy  again pls
10049,Best COD ever made both single and multiplayer.
10050,"This game isn't fun. Mainly becasue of the hackers who make it impossible to have a good game.

Now in truth there are two groups at falut. There are the guys who have spent so long with this game that they have such an advantage over a new comer or a casual player that matches with them are unenjoyable. And then there are the hackers. So many bs hackers. 

The single player is fine and if you have some freinds who will play in privat lobbies with you there is a lot of fun to be had. However, if you are just looking to re-live some memories and get a few fun online matches here and there I'd look for another game. Because it's hard for a casual non-hacker to have a good time in the online multiplayer."
10051,review
10052,this game is awesome
10053,yeeee boiiiiiiii
10054,Still has an active player base with little to no hackers~ buy if nostolgic and don't enter prestige.
10055,"Best Modern Warfare series!!!
BTW, don't buy this game if you want to play multiplayer, unless for team deathmatch and free for all"

10060,Good old memories...Best Call of Duty of all time!
10061,gr8 game m8!
10062,"the best COD out there

the gameplay are completely fun, if you love fps games then you definitely will love this game. this game is fast pace, that will make you thought ""kill or be killed""

the story are perfect *two thumbs up
that sacrifice, betrayal, murderer, psychopath, victory are *two thumbs up

graphic still nice on 2018

i love the soundtrack, especially ""enemy of my enemy is my friend""

9/10"
10063,"For some reason I always wanted to hate this game because everybody said it was the best in the series, and i loved mw3 too much too listen to them. But I saw it on sale a week ago and I thought I'd play it to see why everyone thought it was so good. Fast forward one week and holy crap this game is amazing. The story is incredible, the graphics look good, and the gameplay is just too much fun. If you're someone who's ususally pretty good at fps games, play on veteran on your first time. I made the terrible mistake of playing on normal which was way too easy and made the expernice a bit poorer. Also if your someone who only plays cod for the multyplayer then BE PREPARED. This isnt your average cod multiplayer, this is a mess, so many things are happening at once so dont be ashamed if you die ALOT on your first game. Oh and noob tubes. Overall I think that this game is amazing and I am pissed off at myself for not playing it sooner."
10064,the best gift for a man
10065,"Best COD ever made.
Multiplayer and co-op missions alone make this game worth buying.
Hacked lobbies suck and are kind of prevelant though.

Get it for $12 off G2A and it's definetly worth.

Remember - no Russian,

9.5/10"
10066,A great follow up storyline from Modern Warfare.
10067,The best Call of Duty game that has been made so far.
10068,One of the best COD's ever js
10069,"The only reason i bought this game is to play with my friends online and im not even able to do that (private matches).
I cannot connect to my friends game and they are not able to connect to mine. 
Game is full of bugs, dont buy it"
10070,This game made me a man. single player is still a blast after all these years.
10071,This game is old but gold ones
10072,i shot shepard in ssdd but it said friendly fire pls fix treyarch
10073,Best game
10074,Only people using explosives in this shit game
10075,"Just amazing! Buy it. I'm not forcing you, but it will be worth it! So much customisation and modding is cool to. It is also cheep. COD = Cool! :)"
10076,"Better than IW or AW
"
10077,Good game with great story one of my favorite gmaes but MP has too much cheaters and no real way to fully enjoy what once was
10078,"Fighting Russians, sounds like the US Military pretty soon."
10079,Probably the best in the series
10080,The only thing i liked was no russian mission and thats it. mp sucks and so does single player
10081,"I bought this game to play with my friend since we were both modern warefare fans. I personally liked MW3 better because we used to play it all the time on 360. 
I was skeptical at first of buying this game on pc with no controller support, but it runs great (with a good laptop of course). The campaign is amazing and the multiplayer is ok. Im tring to get ued to pc cod. 
My only complaint is that the sensitivity is very high and there's to way to turn it down to make my comfortable. That sounds like im a sterotypical guy who has a 3 ft mouse pad but im not, the sensitivity is very HIGH (like my relapsed friend).
Other than that this game is great!"
10082,"First CoD game series i've played at all, just epic. Both campaign and amazing multiplayer."
10083,best COD
10084,gay
10085,still the best cod game to date
10086,"Such a great game.

I honestly don't remember the story being so short, and being so straightforward. Its probably because I was still a kid the first time I played this game.

This game has the best credits I have ever seen. 

Multiplayer is alive and well, and I've only met one toxic player in 15 hours.

"
10087,"enemy ac 130 inbound, gg no re."

highly recommended :)"
10089,this game is pretty bad
10090,"I don't know what to say about the game,it's perfect.From the campaign and the story it's amazing,it really is.The campaign was fun ,5-6 hours of gameplay and that's it with the addition of Special Ops that you can play with friends its cool.
Now the multiplayer is extra fun,the weapons,the maps even the design is great.If you're looking for a fun game that is full of Nostalgia you should buy this.I give it a 10/10"
10091,"Loved the game years ago, love it now!!!"
10092,"Breath taking. If there is one game I could take with my to deserted island, it would be this one! 10/10

Edit: Got VACd still a good game tho"
10093,"get mad, the game.
hackers/triggerbots, the game.
hurt my hand pounding the desk, the game.



its alright"
10094,how do i get multiplayer to work using windows 7 ultimate wont do the updaate for multiplayer keeps stopping part way
10095,"The fact that the multiplayer plays just like it used to on the 360 makes me a happy boi.

Nostalgia levels through the roof."
10096,The best game in the series.
10097,ghfghfgh
10098,fun but i cheated so its boring
10099,"Its very nice
"
10100,"Boy, do I reccomend this game. It is hands down one of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had. Although, if you play against friends, it can be quite the friendship ruiner. Just make yourself any class with a grenade launcher attachment on your primary, the Thumper, and the danger close perk. Your friends will rage quit before you can say ""Noob Tube"". This is indeed a true story, but man. It was one of my best experiences with the game because my face was shining with glee while I was destroying my friends every last will to play games ever again."
10101,"
you would be better off playing on console or i w 4 x, if your newly purchasing the game like i have looking to enjoy the nostalgia of MW2 cause you havent played in years, what youll find instead is a server that you can only ever get play deathmatch or TDM on, SOMETIMES domination if your lucky but every other mode never has a game running, and the lobbies you do get into are filled with nothing but lvl 70 sweats who have been playing for years vs you the level 1. needless to say, your gonna get pub stomped non stop. its not very enjoyable nowadays, except for the campaign and i guess spec ops too. the campaign is still one of the best in the cod series"

hm...I think it's preety obvious that the game is heavily overpowered for my PC now, isn't it? :P"
10103,Maaan this game is still good but look out for ye ol tuber
10104,Best game
10105,"An incredibly dumb and annoying plot and in-game videos. Those are also too long, too loud, with images blinking like crazy in front of your eyes. Very annoying...

Also, plenty of weird melee and other interaction examples where you have to do some weird stuff, quikcy press some prompted buttons, etc. That stuff just spoils the game.  

Still a shooter: you will have an opportunity to kill many soldiers there.  

Overall, I didn't like it. Barely found patience to wait through the stupid videos that cannot be skipped and just be done."
10106,Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom...............................
10107,Great Game!!!
10108,yes
10109,"This game is usually a must play when it comes to campaign and coop missions, especially with a friend. Multiplayer is still alive, but hardly. Still, its worth getting it if you are a fan of MW2 and had played it before."
10110,"This is the best CoD in the frenchise. Even though it has missalined sights, some non-working suppressors and the noob-tube spam is infuriating too, it still offers a great amount of fun, and if you played it in the past, it can be very nostalgic.
10/10 for me, worth trying out"
10111,"Hans Zimmer did the soundtrack, what more do you want?"
10112,Just like my old times <3
10113,I am very critical of the call of duty series. Especially the new ones. But for 20$ this is a great value. Great campaign and multiplayer works nicely if you can find a match. I seriously wish the game had more pc players. Easily the best cod.
10114,"Really Enjoying it! Go on youtube to find out how to get a pad working,"
10115,i already play this game on ps3 it's not fun anymore
10116,"TL;DR
Great game (even the mulitplayer) ok campain

get it while on sail tho, it would be much better."

10124,"Game is fun as hell.
You'll get mad, you'll get real mad. You'll be salty enough for a *<i>insert generic celebrity chef</i>* dish.
You'll have a game where you get destroyed across the map for ten minutes, then back that up with some stupidly outrageous performance the next game, only to be told by someone that ""Ur kd is f*****G pathetic"".

The game still has a community after so many years, and the reason for that is that it's still fun COD, in spite of all the broken ass balancing, the game is just so much stupid fun you can't help butcome back to it again and again. 

Hits a solid 8/10 pinches of salt."
10125,I was the first to play and I remember very much.
10126,If you are looking for an old game to remember the good times this game is still there for you. still fast lobby load times and hackers usually are theere to level you up not to godmode and kill you. $20 is still rough if you buy this on kinguin its worth it!
10127,"I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!, any game like where there is Multiplayer and like a shooting game like this one, I'LL PLAY IT!!!!!"
10128,Best game of the year.
10129,"5/10

The game has great graphics and loads of different weapons you can use and pick up from fallen enemy and so in that respect the game has great depth. However, I found it to be very repetative. Basically, each mission is battling your way through waves of enemies and they keep coming and coming forever until you as the main character you advance forward. At this point your squad advances with you and then it repeats itself ...firefight... you advance... your squad advances... firefight... you advance... your squad advances... another firefight... you advance... your squad advances... until you reach the end of that mission.

It's basically one big massive firefight and so if that what you want from a game, a none stop firefight with not real strategy or pauses for breath then this is the game for you!"
10130,"Title's a bit misleading, this call of duty is pretty ancient warfare 2 be honest."
10131,A very old school game. Very fun in my opinion. You should buy it if you enjoy call of duty. In my opinion it's worth it. But think about it before buying it. Just cause it's an fps doesn't mean it's a good game. But buy it if u want to im just some nerd who likes video games at the end of the day. But if you really want to buy it then go for it. It's not my choice. Not that many players compared to XBox but it's still fun. It's a bit harder to snipe on pc but i enjoy doing that cause i think it's not fun running around 24/7 with an ar (Assault Rifle) destroying everyone. I enjoy games that challenge me a little bit.
10132,fantastic game
10133,Nostalgic
10134,One of the best CODs ever and always will be however i was slightly confused on why you cant use a controller but it doesnt stop me from playing all the time>_<
10135,Best game to give you nostalgia from all those 12 year old kids saying they fucked your mom.
10136,"Best CoD story. The characters are complex, the action isn't mindless, and there is a lot of it. It's basically playing through an insane action movie, and a phenomenal one at that.

10/10"
10137,"Despite what people say, this game doesn't have any hackers. The only hacker threats you have are people removing explosive ammo and changing gamemode to Domination.

10142,Love the game brings back so many memories. suprisingly the hackers are not even close to as bad as the ones on ps3 most likey because of the vac ban system the hackers also just like to do xp lobbys or any other thing apart from aimbot. I highly recomened the game.

10151,Got VAC'd for changing my FOV in the official game settings. 10/10.

10156,"excelent game, you don't need a NASA Computer for run this game.
the campaing its a master piece with epic and intense moments, the multiplayer its more fun you can find all kind of players like in 2009 when this game was launch in consoles, if you had this game on consoles yet you will feel nostagia.
Great game it isn't overpriced like Black Ops but it's worth"
10157,Excellent 10/10
10158,Worst fucking game ever don't play this game unless you're ready for a plethora of BS.
10159,Full of hackers in the multiplayer of the game. Don't bother with this and just wait for a remastered version....

yet it is very injoyable 10 out of 10 IGN"

10168,the best ever fps. needs a remake
10169,gr8 game
10170,Probably the best Call of Duty of all time. It has great everything.
10171,Breathtaking single player
10172,it lag to mush lamo jk
10173,Vacced and can still play 20/10
10174,Vision angle
10175,DO NOT BUY!!! I bought this last year and after playing if for only 5hrs the game will not start up and freezes on the intro scene before even loading the menu. It's useless. Save your money and spend it something that you can actually use! True garbage and no help from support to fix the issue.
10176,"Although the gameplay hour count on my current profile isn't that high for MW2, I have put 500+ hours in this game when you include my previous Steam profile. One word: a masterpiece. It took from Call of Duty 4 that which was good, and made it even better. On top of that, you have many new things like the Spec Ops section and the Multiplayer was overhauled."
10177,"Good like his older brother (4:MW), great campaign and multiplayer."

nice to play, but only for a period of time"
10181,lit
10182,I'm addicted. Old School COD at its finest. Few hackers but usually i just leave and be done with it. Enough people playing that you dont have to wait for a game
10183,"Don't even thing about going to the multiplayer anymore, it's full of cheaters, hard-tubers, modded/hacked lobbies and EXPLOITS...YES, MW2 MULTIPLAYER HAS SEVERAL DANGEROUS SECURITY AND PRIVACY PROBLEMS AND DEVELOPERS DON'T CARE AT ALL. This also applies to Cod4, MW3, BO1, BO2 and Ghosts multiplayers."
10184, right here bois at its best
10185,1337 hours on record. One of the best and most toxic shit ever played. Best multiplayer game out of everything i've ever played. A buggy as fuck masterpiece with it's ultra annoying weaponry. Better than sex.
10186,"Don't need a powerful pc, but the gameplay is so powerfully amazing!"
10187,"Now, some people may immediately write this game off and condemn it because it spawned an endless stream of ""move forward and shoot everyone"" games, infected other franchises with it's style, and created a skilless generation of gamers who refuse to try anything new. This may be true, but imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. There's a reason the game and style have been copied over and over and a reason the franchise has never deviated from this formula: it works very well in this game. I'm not going to talk about the multiplayer, it's been a while since I've played and it's hit that point where the only people who play are hacking or have been playing for so many years it's not fair. So, let's get into the singleplayer.

As you can assume from most Call of Duty games, the campaign is very short. This clocked in at about 4 hours for me, which to some may be considered a detriment and indeed would be for some games, but not in this case. It works very well because the gameplay formula is very simple at it's core, but the short 15-30 minute missions allow the game to keep things from feeling tired. Without having to stretch things over 10 or 20 hours, Modern Warfare 2 is able to play all of it's cards at precisely the right time to keep the gameplay from going stagnant.

The gameplay is pretty simple move and shoot style, as one would expect. Things are broken up by the occasional vehicle portion, or stealth mission (which is very well executed for a game that is not focused on stealth). Guns are abundant and varied (although not as interesting as other entries in the series) and allow the player to experiment and decide how they'd like to go about things. Objectives are not spoonfed to the player to the extent we've seen in more recent titles, objective markers are shown sometimes but a lot of the time I found myself having to pay attention to the dialogue to discern the best way to go about the mission. This is not strictly required, most of the time if you just manage to stay alive the game will play itself by way of your AI squadmates, but it's much more fun and engaging to listen to and execute the orders you are given.

The story is actually one of the most redeeming qualities of the game. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did and I don't believe any other Call of Duty or similar game has had cutscenes that I actually cared to watch. It's no masterpiece by any means, but it elevates the game above the simple war shooter that it is to on par with an entertaining action movie. On the subject of elevating the game, the soundtrack is also worth mentioning. I was somewhat shocked during the ending credits to find out the main theme was done by Hans Zimmer, but thinking back it's not much of a surprise. Very well done and lifts what could have been a cool action moment to an ""epic"" action moment. There are many other small things that are just done well that improve the overall quality of the game, and really makes it feel like this was still a labor of love before the CoD developers cemented themselves as mindless game factories to churn out annual releases.

The game is of course not without flaws. The difficulties are your traditional no effort shooter difficulties, with higher modes simply raising enemies health and lower ones reducing their accuracy to that of a toddler with a muscle spasm disorder. The game recommended ""Veteran"" difficulty, but I chose one lower (""Hardened"") because I assumed the aforementioned statement would be true. I was a bit too correct, and even Hardened proved to be an unfun challenge that made the game tedious and frustrating. I lowered to ""Regular"" and enjoyed the rest of the game. The ""red jelly"" hit effect is also a bit obnoxious, because it obscures your vision so badly you have no choice but to hide and wait for your health to regenerate. The hit marker also seemed inaccurate at times, but overall the game played well.

I would give this game a high recommendation at a sale price. $20 is a little steep for a game nearing 10 years old and with only 4 hours worth of singleplayer content, but at a $5-$10 sale price I would consider this well worth picking up. It's a nice experience that one can crank out in a day or two, and it's worth playing simply to experience it and understand the impact it's had on gaming. It's worth mentioning that the story is a continuation of Modern Warfare, so you may want to play that first or read a plot synopsis (I did neither), but it won't hinder your enjoyment much."
10188,"Simple !
Kill or be killed"
10189,This game is just awesome! I can find it so relaxing to play. Its old but its good. :D
10190,best game
10191,Best storyline ever. Wish it was a bit longer though
10192,get on rust then ya little s***
10193,"The best of all COD!
"
10194,This is my all time favourite COD game ever it has a amazing campaign and same with the multiplayer. Super easy to run with a modern PC worth the money.
10195,"I highly recommend this game for all gamers.
+Awesome campaign
+Beatutiful Soundtrack
+Multiplayer
+Voice Acting
-Campaign is too short
-Multiplayer lags
Game rating: 9/10
"
10196,"This game packs a punch  the campaign is good  takes itself seriously and the spec ops are alot of fun to play with a friend while voice chatting both gamemodes are top notch.........now for the multiplayer: there are horrible things that should have never been created :1-noobtube  2-painkiller  3-noobtube with dangerclose  4-FUCKIN EXPLOSIVES

yeah mw2 mp has a problem with explosives so op at a point where u die alot    but the all the maps are really cool except :1-estate   2-rundown   3-quarry

other than that guns are awesome al of them can grant u kills i mean ALL fo them except f200 (or was fn200 i dunno idc) 

it might seem wierd to buy it as there are better cods with more players but if u want to dive in and play with people so good that they probably played it 3 times in their life then sure go ahead its still fun to play and to unlock titles..................THERE ARE STILL PLAYERS BTW BUT U WILL MEET THE SAME PEOPLE REGULARLY"
10197,"Great game, 10/10.
Bring it back without the noobtubes!
Many thanks."
10198,"So this is the legendary MW2. The one every COD player will tell you is their favorite COD game in the series and just tell you it's amazing. They won't go into details, usually. That's the nostalgia glasses, because even though it holds up decently it's not as amazing as it was when it was that revolutionary sequel to one of the best modern FPS games of all time.

Well, MW2 is a GOOD game and at the time it was a GREAT game and worthy successor to MW1. The graphics hold up pretty well and the mechanics are solid, plays fairly smooth but the mechanics are lacking and a bit janky to todays standards. I'm one of those COD fans that really adored BO1&2 because to me, especially with BO2, they got the mechanics down almost perfectly and it's still my favorite COD to this day. I personally like MW3 more than MW2 and as such played it a lot more even though I played the heck out of MW2 on Xbox. I've played them all on my Xbox and PS3 but never bothered playing most of them on PC since they're outrageously expensive for what they offer, Activision also raised the prices of all the games to combat the loss in sales of Infinite Warfare and Advanced Warfare which is scummy as hell. I also don't like that Treyarch basically turned the BO series into one big joke with BO3. 

So that really leaves you with BO2 and MW3 as the last decent COD games, Ghosts showed promise as a spritual MW4 but was ruined by really stupid decisions in-game and others like releasing it on too many consoles instead of making it the first truly ""Next-gen"" COD game which spread the dev team too thin and the PC port wasn't great, the alien gamemode was extremely fun though, the only positive I can really give Ghosts.

Soon, MW2 will be 10 years old and it's starting to show but to be honest, I don't think MW2 is the definitive COD experience like everyone says it is. If you really want to get into COD you're better off playing MW3 or BO2, they FEEL a lot more modern and have a lot more modern options for your loadouts which is my biggest complaint with MW2, loadouts are boring, you're stuck with too many samey loadouts. MW3 did a much better job of this and still feels like MW2 without the ""noob tubing"" and nade spamming. 

Which puts me onto another point, this game has devolved into nade spamming and noob tubing because it's mostly toxic die hard players left in the game and the reason for noob tubing is that there are A LOT of laggy players with red connection bars per match because there's so few people playing. Often times you'll be one shot killed by someone who barely even poked their gun around the corner and then during the killcam it shows them come around the corner, dance in your face and then put a whole clip into you. So there's an obvious advantage to players who lag and even though it's not their fault, it ruins the game. There's also still a lot of cheaters in this game due to it not being maintained anymore, there always were quite a few cheaters in MW2 and this applies to the PS3 as well, SO MANY CHEATERS/MODDERS. You get into modded lobbies where everything is one shot kill (Including stun/flashbangs.) and the modder is invincible and causing mayhem. It's not fun dealing with it. And I don't want to disprove the people in the forums saying there are hardly any modders, but in my experience it was almost every other round for a while and then died off for a bit and then there were more modders again.

I think people's love for MW2 comes from the fact that it had one of the best campaigns, much like MW1 of any of the COD games and the fact that since there's so few loadout options available it makes the game feel more solid because there's less strategies. But that's honestly what kills it for me these days. It WAS good but I think people need to take off their nostalgia glasses. I'm not saying to move on but stop saying that it's the most balanced/amazing COD game ever made. It's a dinosaur now and while it's not awful it's just not as good as MW3 and BO2."
10199,lots of goodly

10207,"One of the best shooters of all time.  The most balanced COD multiplayer.  It was great until hackers took over which is typical for all COD games, but still the best."
10208,"The sequel to the world's most overrated shooter is... another overrated shooter. 

7/10 for a decent single player campaign

Sorry I don't care about multiplayer, so nothing to say about that.."

10220,"Amazing campaign, the story and the level designs are very immersive. The special operation missions are also amusing. Would recommend on a sale just for the single-player elements."
10221,"With over 100 hours in the singleplayer, I can definitely say this game is worth playing; it has a relatively decent storyline.
The multiplayer is still active (with over 1000 players) and I've never struggled to find a server. MW2 is probably the best Call of Duty game IMO, and the graphics are amazing for 2009.

100% recommend."
10222,CONTENT V NEY DELAU! <3
10223,fun
10224,"good game  back in 2009, shit game now

"
10225,"As great as it was on PS3
Amazing"
10226,"2017 am I still playing one of the greatest releases from Infinity Ward and Activision in recent game history.

I won't delve into the campaign because almost all of us here know exactly what and how the campaign was. As some other people did, I will focus on the multiplayer simply because it is the more attractive piece of the game.

The very first time I played this game was on the Xbox 360. This was of course after investing a lot of time into CoD4, the OG that started it all. After the unfortunate event of being in hacked/modded lobby and succomming to a negative-forever XP hack, I switched to this game hoping that the same thing didn't happen ever again. And for awhile, it didn't. Of course, once again I fell in love with the multiplayer gameplay. awesome weapons, and never ending fun. It was a new beginning of frustration, nusiance players, and above all, controller smashing-against-a-wall-or-table fun.

Now, getting into the PC gaming aspect of it, I soon realized I need A LOT MORE time behind a keyboard and mouse with FPS-type game. Regardless, I still love the game and even with 4.8hrs on record, I will never stop playing this game's multiplayer aspect. It is just too damn good to pass up on the reg and those of who fondly remember this game on Xbox, we will never stop playing."
10227,definetly an improvement to the first
10228,Best game in 10 years
10229,"I have owned MW2 on console since 2009. I finally bought it for PC last year and it brought back so many memories. I'm not going to write a nostalgia based review, instead I am going to explain the pros and cons of this game. First I'll start with the singleplayer. First and formost I recommend playing Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare before playing MW2 as MW2 is a direct sequel to CoD 4. Anyway The singleplayer is a rollercoaster of a ride. That is if you like over the top action. The game is full of amazing set peices and even though this game is from 2009 the graphics are still great. However the campaign can be too linear with its level design. That's not to say linear games aren't fun, it's that if you aren't a fan of them, then this campaign is not for you. The game is full of on rails sequences like the turrent part in the first mission or the chopper gunner part later on in the campaign. To be honest I'm not a fan of these sequences and they are my least favorite part f the campaign. They make missions seem like a choor as you have to take part in a glorified cutscene. never the less there were some sequences that I love like a part of the campaign where you drive a snowmobile and the sequence when you use a predator missile. The story mode also has characters that I geniuenly liked. Anyway now to multiplayer. Gameplay wise the multiplayer is one of the best in the entire series. The gunplay is amazing as you have an arsenal of Rifles, Sub Machine Guns, Light Machine Guns, Snipers, Shotguns, Pistols, and even a sheild that deflects bullets. The way to play is to either assault an area or defend one. Cover is key and you need to be on your toes. On top of that there are killstreaks. Any fan of CoD knows what these are, but to those new to the series a killstreak is a reward given to the player after the player achieves a certain amount of consecutive kills. The rewards range from a UAV that spots enemies to a chopper that you fly to a nuclear bomb that destroys an entire map and automatically wins you the game. The killstreaks are the best part of MW2 as they keep the game exciting as someone is piloting an AC-130 and raining death from above. As someone who was expierienced the Nuke killstreak, I will say that it is one of the most brilliant spectacles to see. A loud siren followed by a bright flash then a shockwave leaving the map a barren wasteland. However perfromance can be an issue as lag and frame drops can be common. I have lagged several times on the multiplayer. The game can sometimes be unplayable due to performance issues. A big issue this multiplayer has (on PC) is that the playerbase is shrinking. You are guaranteed to find a match of Team Death Match, but good luck on any other gamemode. I have played other modes on console and it pains me to only play team deathmatch on PC. While I have never expierienced a hacker in this game I would still be weary as an old game on PC is pretty mutch destined to have hackers. By hackers I mean people who cheat at the game with things like unlimited ammo and unlimited health. Anyway I still recommend the multiplayer. Invite so friends into a match and have fun shooting eachother. However you don't have to shoot your friends. There is another mode called Special Ops in which you and your friend will work together in a series of missions against AI enemies. These missions range from stealth to charging a collapsing suspension bridge. It is an amazing Game Mode to play with your friend. 


MW2 is an amazing game so I recomend it.

Pros:
Good Story Mode
Fun Mulitplayer Mode
Fun Co op Mode
Graphics

Cons:
Performance
Lag
Shrinking Playerbase (But still very active)


"
10230,it ver gud
10231,"As Call of Duty games go, this is probably the peak. The story has surprising depth and the multiplayer is killer. 

Just switch to your other weapon. It's faster than reloading."
10232,"Amazing game even now. I know what you are thinking, ""There must be like 40 hackers in every game"", well there actually isn't. And the game isn't dead."
10233,"its sick
"
10234,classic dommy mommy
10235,i love this game and you should love this game too and if you dont i will come to your house and take a screwdriver and jam it into your computer (just a joke do you really think i would do that f*****g dumba*s) #lolxdlit hahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha hue hue hue for life
10236,"Game is filled with hackers, but on the bright side you can hack aswell to balance it out."
10237,"good game
watch out for the multiplayer tho you can get easily vac-ced there even though you don't use cheats
gg fam"
10238,awesome game
10239,"Great! Very chaotic and fun also.Still very played.Some guns could've been nerfed cough ump54 cough spas12 cough aa 12 cough noob tubes.
But when they are used the multiplayer is complete trash.
Singleplayer is a masterpiece.I played it and it is very good.
SPOILER ALERT
Ghosts dies.I still cry everytime i play that mission.
But happily at the end of campaign you kill Shepherd
9/10
Great game,i highy recommend getting it!"
10240,"if someone is hacking in your game and they change your stats you get banned, its the most unfair banning policy ever"
10241,"I played this for a few years when I still played on my xbox 360. I bought it on PC as well but was disappointed by the fps cap in multiplayer. It makes the game unplayable for me and makes me feel sick to my stomach after just 5 minutes of playing.

It is, however, one of the best call of duty's out there. It's up there with cod4 and cod2. If you haven't played the single player before, I could recommend you to buy it whenever the game goes on sale. At least the single player is not fps capped."
10242,fucking bullshit.  The multiplayer is unplayable because it never stops fetching playlists.
10243,One of the all time favorite multi-player FPS!
10244,"Infinity Ward and Activision have built a great game, but they have no respect for their customers. The online servers are laggy all the time and you would be lucky to find a server not overrun by wannabe hackers that make the match their personal playground. In case that you are lucky enough to end up in a normal lobby there will be at least one player that uses wallhack and will make the game unfair and no fun if he is in the opposite team. All in all, the people behind this game have lost my respect and i will definately use Pirate Bay, rather than Steam if i ever want to play a new Call of Duty game."
10245,"this game is old but gold, there's a ton of veterans on it but i'd definitely recommend for someone who's good at cod."
10246,This Is Nice Game
10247,somebody toucha my spaget
10248,"1/10
fuck this game
worst lag compensation ever"
10249,"Best CoD to date. If you want simple and fun shooter experience, this is the one."
10250,"Hey dudes and welcome to my reivew of Calla Duty Modern Shootguy 7. Now if you know me then you know that I love the COD franchise more than my own kids. Everyday after a long day of working at two hour shift at 7-11 I like to sit on my couch and play some good ol' Mountain Duudy. The only bad experience I've had with this franchise is when I was buying a lootbox in the new one (Battlefield of Call) when I vomitted approximately 30 metric tons of Dorito powder and broke my Wii Romote. Anyway, I'm here to talk about Infinite Modern 2, which is known and praised for its unforgettable campaign. In the story of Call of Duty Funny Shooty you play as a bar of soap who teams up with Captain Rice to stop Vladmir Putin from winning world war 3. You go through many iconic areas such as the snowmobile level. That's it. The best mission is when you shoot up an airport after drinking seven shots of vodka and end up dying because Putin knew you were drunk the whole time. He then says his famous line ""Remember, no alcohol because that's a harmful chemical substance for your body."" I cried my whole emotion out. Anyway, the multiplayer is pretty neat because you can snipe people from the other side of the planet using two heartbeat sensor shotguns and also dropping 50 nukes from the f*cking sky. Overall Splatoon 2 gets a 9.1/10. For more on Call of Duty Shootin' Putie, stick here with IGN."
10251,Fun Game to play with friends! still alot of hackers but fun
10252,"Infinity ward employee: hey should we balance the multiplayer?

Boss: nah"
10253,"Would be 10/10 if it had trading cards, still, very good tho
9/10"
10254,"Remember when these old games came out?  Oh the ""Feelz"" any cod player would know the feelz you get playing one of many old time titles.  Now saying that this game worked fine the first time I played it on here(pc) however when I try to launch it the game crashes ...idk why but still if i'm gonna pay $45.00 including DLC price for this game i would at least expect a good foundation of a launcher.  That being said don't waist your money on this honestly purchase a newer title because it might have better laucher support."
10255,Don't get this game. It crashes and freezes a lot.
10256,foarte frumos
10257,Love it!!! Best COD made...
10258,Nice game
10259,"This game is amazing. It has a really enjoyable Story, Multiplayer and Special Ops."
10260,For those who want to relive 2009 in all its glory. 11/10 Would Noob Tube Again
10261,One of the best games ever!
10262,Nice
10263,fun
10264,"When you look at the total package, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is hands-down one of the best first-person shooters out there, and a truly amazing offering across any system"
10265,"10/10
"
10266,"Still a great game; super easy to run and looks pretty good.
Campaign is solid, spec ops are still fun and while MP has some hackers and slow lobbies it's not too bad either."
10267,pwoar
10268,i have always had fun playing cod!
10269,"Modern Warfare 2, Great game, contents, maps and gameplay. But also great graphics and good sounds. Even that there was so many cheaters the game make me spend good times with my friends. Played a lot scrim in private with my friends to avoid cheaters. But was good after all. Good old memories when I was in high school."
10270,i go to open the game and it changes my resolution really low and will never start someone please help
10271,"Golden age golden history wow wow 
Review came late but in 2009-2010 this game was 1 of the best fps on the market
COD will never be the same :("
10272,"First of all let me start out this review by saying this. This game is basically the reason that kids were trying to cross-map noscope for the last kill. And that is all you need to know. With the introduction of smoother sniping mechanics and a better multiplayer than any FPS at the time, MW2 was a smashing hit, and still today has incredible replay value."
10273,Decent.
10274,Too good to be old af game.
10275,perty gud
10276,I bought it like 1 year ago and i felt like a child again that sensation when you hear MacTavish¬¥s voice its amazing and the soundtrack hand down seriously i definetly recomend it if you havent played it already
10277,intervention + terminal = :)
10278,"is this game able to be played with a controller?
"
10279,"Pros: Pumped up Kicks and the airport shooting 
"
10280,"I've spent a total of 1300hs on WM 2 & WM 3. They are amazing. Much preferred over Black Ops and esp. Infinity Warfare. The campaign is awesome, the graphics hold up even years later and the Multiplayer is probably the best ever, with the exception of a few imbalances and the occasional undetected cheater. Highly recommended."
10281,"The singleplayer is forgettable and short. Adds nothing to the genre that wasn't better in the first game. Unless you are a completionist I don't recommend wasting your time on the singleplayer version of this game.

The multiplayer on the other hand is quite fun but it lacks dedicated servers. If you can get enough people together to play go for it."
10282,The Real and The Best FPS YOLO
10283,"Just switch to your other weapon.
It's faster than reloading."
10284,Yes.
10285,"I good boots-on-the-ground CoD game. The campaign has a pretty nice story, Spec Ops is pretty fun, and the multiplayer is still alive and kicking. This game does not need much to run - I got it to run on Intel graphics and modern GTX cards should easily get 100+ FPS at max settings."
10286,"""History is written by the victors"" 

-General Sheperd"
10287,Not as good as CoD4 but still a great CoD. You can find TDM matches still.
10288,"- find 5 Friends
- get matched against a Clan
- stomp them
- typing ""good Clan, ESL?"" at the end
- having the time of your life

Good ol' days!

"
10289,I can't play well but I can fuck your bitch.
10290,"In multiplayer, you can expect the following:

Noobtubes who brag about being superior
Cheaters who think they're being tough and saying in chat ""ez"" ""noobs""
Ordinary people who just want to play some multiplayer
If you're lucky (or unlucky) you get into an infected lobby by some chance.

I played this on my PS3 and it was beast."
10291,"First COD game, satisfied! Twenty dollars for both multiplayer and singleplayer, I don't have many hours in it yet, but I enjoy it and recommend it (I've heard the story is great). It still has a large amount of TDM players nine years later, as well."
10292,Really fun game throughout the day but at night time it's hard to find a match. 8/10 overall I've run into only 1 hacker since I've started playing.
10293,Great singleplayer campain and awesome (but probably not popular by now) multiplayer
10294,When I was younger I tried killing as many Russians in that mission as I could.
10295,Best game 10/10 bruh!!! yuh
10296,Hands down best campaign in the series.
10297,Fun but too many hackers
10298,The best ! Hands down been playing this on multiple console for the past 8 years.
10299,i love noob tubes
10300,"Epic campaign, played it several times!"
10301,"great fun in singleplayer part of the best COD storyline, multiplayer in cod is not really my thing, way to many quickscoping spawnrapers."
10302,One of the only good games I had on the xbox 360.
10303,bang boom amirite
10304,HOLY FUCK THAT WAS GOOD
10305,issa blassic
10306,"It was a really good, short campaign.

Would definitely recommend."
10307,"You'd think this game would be full of hackers and complety emtpy, only filled with hackers and noobs who lose the game for you. Well numb nuts, the humming birds sing with joy because you were wrong. The game is full of commited (I say commited, as it is a 50/50 between those who try and those who use OP weaponry) players. Yes, like every game there will be a sweaty try hard around every corner and quite possibly a hacker too, but players like that are quite the rare. Even if you do not like the multiplayer, buy it for the campaign. I kid you not, the campaign is even better than anything else this game offers. Already played the campaign and is just waiting for the game to be remastered? You are in luck the Music Man has a solution, it isn't a remastered version but trust me it will change the way you see the campaign. If not, I garuntee you that you steer away from this. I take no ownership of anything within this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLPR1jdpGoA . Check it out, if you do not like it then do not download it."
10308,"I used to play this back in my Xbox 360 days and it's still just as fun now as it was back then. Great campaign, great co-op missions and great multiplayer (minus those fucking noob tubes). Just a great Call of Duty game. I love it."
10309,Too hard
10310,"I have over 750 hours on the multiplayer for this game on PC during 2017 alone, not to mention my time on Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2009 and beyond.  The meager playtime you see is just for single-player.  I realize that this is an absurd amount of time spent on a game like this -- but if anyone's qualified to review this, it's this guy here.  Clearly, this review will be mostly multiplayer oriented.  However, I did finally check out the story mode in 2018, so here goes.

Here's my impression of the single-player story: SENSORY OVERLOAD.  This game has no pacing whatsoever, in that there is literally no downtime to kind of recollect yourself.  There are explosions non-stop, motion blur and shellshock effects everywhere, enemies swarming all over the place like the story itself, and so on.  From start to finish, it is non-stop action.  The levels are mostly decent, albeit the psychic enemies with perfect aim (along with the absurd viewkick) on harder difficulties can frustrate.  The only level I truly despised was the first favela mission, as dealing with the infinite enemies was a chore.  The optimization is mostly fine, except this is a straight console port.  No FOV slider, no PC specific adjustments, etc.  This game also seems to be CPU focused, so anyone with a weaker CPU (or especially streaming on 1 PC with OBS Studio) may face challenges.  However, this game's single-player is perfect for those who just want an obscene amount of mindless action.  I dig it.

This review's focus is on the multiplayer, though, as that seems to be what most people are curious about.  And after wading through the highest of the highs MW2 offers with the lowest of the lows, there are things people should know about this game in 2018, should they consider buying it.

I've played most other CoDs, and personally, this game's gunplay feels the best out of all the games in the series.  Guns shoot where you aim, even on most lag, and the player can use a lot of different guns and perk combinations while still being functional.  It really is true in this game that, ""If every gun is OP, nothing is OP.""  There are, say, only a few guns and perks I would advise against using, although the UMP/Famas/Intervention is king.  The former is true if you're like me, and staunchly refuse to use the dirtbag One Man Army/Grenade Launcher/Danger Close exploit.

This is the perfect segway to speak about the playerbase that still plays this game.  Let's get this out of the way.  Yes, there are a lot of players that will use the noobtube nonsense 100% of the time.  Couple with that, there are quite a lot of cheaters in this game, too.  They only serve to frustrate and get reactions from others players, who are just looking to have fun.  However, fortunately, there are also a lot of players just looking to play and get a few games in for that 2009 nostalgia.  The lobbies in this game truly are run by jungle law, as Activision (unsurprisingly, since they don't even seem to care about CoD WW2) doesn't moderate cheating in MW2.  Therefore, your experience in this game will be based simply on the other players in your game.  If they're not cheating, not tubing, and the host isn't on Dollar Tree internet, this game is still fantastic online.

Keep in mind -- this is a straight-up console port.  The optimization here is quite a mixed bag.  On one hand, the framerate is capped at 90fps, no FOV slider, ONE slider for audio, and so on.   However, the game does still run smooth on max settings (i7 CPU and a 1080ti), and I've only encountered a handful of crashes.  Not necessarily exclusive to console games, but just as important to mention, MW2 IS P2P-CONNECTION BASED.  This is a deal breaker for a lot of PC gamers, sometimes moreso than the 90fps cap.  If anyone is looking for a CoD with dedicated servers, MW2 isn't your game.  For others not put off by this, though, this game runs smooth enough.

The only other complaint I have is the DLC, which completely fragments the playerbase.  I truly wish Activision would do what they did with CoD4 and World at War, and package in the 10 DLC maps with the base game.  I happen to like playing the DLC maps, but the playerbase expectedly drops off significantly.  The silver lining here is that there aren't nearly as many cheaters that play in DLC lobbies, but at the expense of proportionately more noobtubers.  The dilemma here is this: do I play in regular lobbies with more players but more cheaters, or do I play in DLC lobbies with less people but less cheaters?  I ultimately have been choosing to take my chances with the regular lobbies, so I cannot recommend the DLC at this point in time.

But, really, this game is just so much fun online when everything breaks right.  MW2 comes with 16 maps in the base game (almost double what CoD WW2 gave us at launch!), tons of guns to unlock, perks to improve, classes to experiment with, and so on.  Although it's a mystery that people don't play Ground War on PC (unlike on Xbox 360, where there's usually a full lobby up), as well as some other modes, there still are many games with TDM, some Domination, and even some S&D too.  There's three conditions to having a fantastic time in MW2 multiplayer, in my opinion: no cheaters, no tubers, and no bad hosts.  Should these conditions be met, I can absolutely still recommend this game.

One disclaimer: I have not played the Spec Ops portion of this game, although I guess it's a good co-op diversion to sink some time into.  I guess.  I have no idea, so I would look elsewhere for opinions for this game mode.

Although I really love this game, I realize that MW2 isn't for absolutely everyone.  The player may need to have the patience of a buddhist monk at times to await the right lobby to actually play the game on fair terms.  However, when that happens, MW2 is FPS nirvana online.  And if the player doesn't care about multiplayer, then their experience gets a whole lot more reliable with the over-the-top single-player story.  Either way, MW2 is a flawed classic, but it's still a classic."
10311,"Forcehost, kick noob tubers, problem solved."
10312,"Ok so like I've always known that Call of Duty games weren't really the best for PC ports but I mean I really feel like they dropped the ball on this. In these sort of ways:

- Changing options and controls was a mess, why is it on the main menu there isn't an options tab anywhere so that I can enter and get out of the god awful resolution that makes it feel like I'm playing on my old CRT from 2005?

- Seriously where tf is my server browser, CoD WaW got that shit pretty good, so why doesn't this more MODERN CoD follow suit? Quick match is cool and all but I'd like to be able to find a custom server or some shit

- No developer console (ok this is kind of a personal pet peeve but i do like being able to fuck around with them in single player shit and all)

- There isn't a leaning function like they have in WaW (fuck you i liked that it was cool)

- Also the load screens and shit are almost as long as they were on my xbox 360 back when this was current when im on a fairly beefed up pc (at least one that should be able to tackle some shit from 2009 with)

All in all this shit is kinda way too late to be complaining about but idk if you wanted to go back and play an old CoD for some reason like I did I'd honestly stay away unless you weren't looking to fuck around on private servers"
10313,"hackers destroyed my MP so i can never rank up aoutmaticly resets me to rookie every time i log back on
single player is great but MP is fully of cunty hackers who need to suck shite and die"
10314,"I love it so much! Hands down, best MW game made! The story line is amazing and action packed, almost jerk-off worthy.

10315,If you don't like MW2 there's something wrong with you

10318,it's pretty fun
10319,"This game is hella fun even though it is a game from the xbox 360 days. The servers are still full with the same noob tubers, spawn campers and the ever so popular snipers from the xbox 360 era. Get this game if you are a die hard call of duty fan."
10320,"Pretty fun, although most servers are unpopulated now and a lot of the players use cheap tactics. Good campaign, would recommend."
10321,I liked this game so much I made a guide for it. Feel free to check it out.

[b]Probably the best COD Game[/b](in my opinion). 
Why? 
Simple and easy combat system in an ideal way. 
COD is not a realism shooter and therefore MW2 
fits perfect.

[h1]Pros[/h1][list]
[*] intense battles in the MP
[*] playable blockbuster story
[*] many good weapons to choose from
(as typical for cod)
[*] all weapons can be good
[*] a satisfying combat system
[*] more varied maps, than the cods after
[*] The weapons and perks were just right
[/list]
[h1]Cons[/h1]
The most servers are now dominated by hackers
and it's not anymore what it was 6 years ago,
when it was not full with kids or criticism incapable 
people.

I wouldn't advise you to purchase, except the story MW 2 has
no real play value anymore, the MP is not really to recommend
anymore.

10337,porn
10338,Anyone who says this is a good game has clearly never played Spec Ops on Veteran difficulty 0/10
10339,This is such a AWESOME!!!!!! game i love it so much AWESOME!!!!
10340,Good game.
10341,"Fav character, ghost."
10342,great game. the story is amezing
10343,Probably one of the best cod's ever made of infinity war
10344,"+ One of the most iconic Call of Duty single player campaign.
+ Immortal multiplayer (with its goods and flaws).
+ Spec ops fun to play in co-op with a friend.

- Online server are no longer under control, this means it's a mess...
- There is no fov slider, but a software capable of doing it is easily downloadable from Google.

Idk if I would recommend it in 2021, buy it just for the nostalgia and don't pretend to find decent servers to play LOL"
10345,"First off I dont have 8 hours in this game I have 1900 on multiplayer and another 8000 on xbox b4 I was a pc master race gamer.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the last great Call of Duty. (expect Blackops I & II zombie modes) Simply one of the most advanced (i think the most advanced till ghost) COD's ever released, All the COD's after were actually running older engines? or something important till ghost, this COD's graphics are to this day almost the best in the series and most realistic looking hands down outside of character models (campiagn im looking at you man why doesnt this thing have spell check is that how you spell that). It still holds some of the highest monthly player numbers out off all the installments of COD, last time i checked it was beating a 8 month old COD game in players, (albeit that alot of russians like this game for its russian scences in the campaign (maybe thats how you spell it). 
It is a game that supports any playstyle especially run and gun, and quickscoping, you want to run and drop shot dive around that corner and suprise someone? guess what the physics lets you, you want to see the smoothest feeling running and switching weapons and climbing transitions in the franchice? its got it. All of the perfect aspects of this game and its modern weapons (realistic and likely to actually be seen IRL) are what makes this game the newest COD you should ever play. And I've tried all of the COD's that have come after this and World War might be the only cod after this thats half way decent but most COD's after this one have overly-negative reviews."
10346,Fobby Dobby Kobby!!!
10347,I had fun playing this game.
10348,"WANT MY MONEY BACK
"
10349,"OK, I have to say, the people that have taken over Warface have no clue what the hell they are doing. And no I am not some punk kid. I have 3 patents and I love video games. I am also 63.5 years old. Do not try to buy Kredits. They will take your money and you get nothing in return. Very sad bunch indeed."
10350,really good But you when you use hand grenade 1 second later use it
10351,When i was 10 years old i saw my cousins play this and i was like let me try but they were to focused on it but i asked my mother if i could get it she said sure and i was happy got it for the xbox 360 back then but i like the PC verison much better runs smooth :) thats how i like it <3 have fun :D Live long cod players
10352,great
10353,"CoD: MW2

Noobtube, Camping, Nukes, & C4's

10/10"
10354,Is good game
10355,The game will be fun but hard at the same time i would defintly recommend it to others.
10356,"""Break's over, Roach. Let's go.""
- Soap"
10357,"360 NO SCOPE SIMOLATIR .... yeah thats all.
the story is pretty short but gud....
but the grapich on all ultra is not really special but it is still acceptable"
10358,For me MW2 was even better than MW1 but it felt way too short with 4-5h playtime. But still it has so many unforgettable moments and missions that made this game so special.
10359,"9/11
"
10360,"Let's recap the top 5 things I have heard during my 30 hours of gameplay. I do not know why it says I only have 0.6 hours...


1.F'ing noob tuber.
2. N word 1v1 me.
3. F'ing hackers (I have not encountered any).
4. (Insert phrase) your mom.
5. Kill yourself.


These are but the greatest memories I have had in this game. When it was first released and even today brings me joy that there is still this great community. So toxic at times I almost missed it. Not really though because you know (shoutout to my csgo fans, overwatch, rust, etc). Please take the time to enjoy this game and I hope that it's still got some spark 10 more years later."
10361,Its one of the best games i have played.
10362,"Call of Duty MW2.
Pros.
1.It has a ok campaign but if you want a really good campaign black ops is a bit better for that.
2.Good gameplay.
Cons.
1.No zombies mode.
2.A lot of hackers.
3.Campaign is not great"
10363,fuck this game
10364,"Felt like James Bond until I crashed a snowmobile into a tree then flew off a mountain and splattered on a rock.

10/10 cannot feel my prosterior."
10365,ABSOLUTELY NOT. SO AFTER MODERN WARFARE WE GET THIS? THANKS AIDSAVISION. WHY DID I CARE MORE ABOUT GHOST THAN I DID ABOUT ANY OTHER FUCKING PERSON IN THIS GAME. ALSO THIS GAME SHOULD BE CALLED CALL OF DUTY: CLEANING UP OUR AMERICAN MISTAKES EDITION. SHEPERD WAS COOL THOUGH. ALL I LEARNED FROM THIS GAME IS RUSSIANS ARE A BUNCH OF PUSSIES AND MERICA CAN DO ANYTHING. WOULD GET BRAINWASHED BY CALL OF DUTY MEDIA AGAIN. WOULD RECCOMMEND HIGHLY.
10366,They banned me for using esp
10367,"Definitely the best COD game, ha, WW2, good joke. Just has a different overall feel when in game, and the quick scoping: yum. Still a number of people playing, you'll get a game very quickly in AU, ranges from 2-15 people depending on the time of day. Not as many hackers as you would think, the casual waller here and there. Ya only going to get Team death match and FFA tho, if u want something else, go play another shitty cod. Huge issue upon install, took hours to open my NAT to be able to play, have fun with that. Definitely give this a download, ez game like 0 recoil on all guns. Have funüòÅ"
10368,I only bought this for no russian and the multiplayer
10369, e
10370,"Still a classic boots-on-the-ground CoD. Avoid all the lootboxes and bs, play what Call of Duty is meant to be."
10371,its a good game
10372,good game love it
10373,I really like this game as it is a classic.  I have not encountered many hackers on the multiplayer servers.  My only complaint is that the client now freezes upon initial launch of the game.
10374,"Listen up lads. This game is one of my favourites. So let's start with the campain.

The campain is 10/10, its amazings tells af good story, nice soundtrack etc.

The multiplayer maps are good, different som each other, and unique in their own way. It would be a 9/10. (Fuck n00b-tubers, and glock-18 akimbo), that shit is br0ken. 

Overall a great game with some nice features, BUY IT! and for god sake play the singleplayer campain, if u dare.

And if u dare more, 1v1 in rust <3, see ya <3"
10375,"I play from being bored, bought the game for 5 euro on price discount. Campaign is linear as hell, AI friendly units are deaf and blind, enemies on harder levels are godlikes. Story of campaign is total absurd, unclimatic, and generally fail. Multi is full of idiotic persons that cant cooperate for sho' but having insults for everyone. The laddering system in multi is somewhat good, but it have equal in every modern shooter, even F2P ones, so no revelation. Dont bother buying this game unless it is on serious discount of pricing"
10376,"Amazing game, 100s of hours playing it in multiplayer! Well balanced and FUN!! Not at all like all the new COD games. Those have only been a disapointment.. ;(..  COD WW2 is the best COD game since modern warfare 2, but it still has a long way to go to be as fun as MW2 was..."

10399,"Something about this version of COD is really fun. Apart from being an old game that requires low end specs these days, the gameplay feels smoother than other COD releases, especially when things get hot and you're in a 15 kill streak in multiplayer. Only thing is you're gonna stumble into hacked matches and whatnot. But they can be quite fun sometimes unless you're trying to be a purist in your statistics, but at this point it don't matter anymore. 9/10"
10400,great game . Good camping
10401,Good Game.  Must have great connection for online PVP.
10402,Still a great game even though people run around quick scoping. Still some hackers here and there and you'll most likely only be able to get into Team deathmatch since that's the only thing people play anymore.

10408,One of the best CODs out there to date!
10409,Best COD ever. Playing once a year for decade.
10410,Excellent multiplayer experience.
10411,"Best game in the series for me :), no regrets!"
10412,"After some hours of gameplay I thought maybe I could do a little review of CoD Modern Warfare 2.

I'll focusing the multiplayer, because I can't say much about the single. 
I've played it, also on the highest diffcult for the achivments, but all in all it's just a normal CoD Campaign and the direct sequel to Modern Warfare.

[b]ATTENTION[/b]
I'm just talking about whether the game is still playable in 2017 or not.

Let's start to talk about the multiplayer.
Some people maybe think this game is dead, but there still round about 1000 people who playing it. The disadvantage sadly is you'll find those people most in following game mods: Teamdeathmatch (and Hardcore as well), Free For All, Domination or Search and Destroy. Most of the other game mods like Groundwar or Capture the Flag are dead, or you'll find only 4 players who are searching for... whatever.

And if you find a lobby? How is the gameplay in 2017?

It's okay. On the one side you have some people who played the game since it came out and dropping killstreaks one by one, on the other you have people who just playing with the easiest mechanics to play the game, playing with the overpowered grenade launcher or in everyday language Noob Tubing. 

But is it playable?

Yes it is. You have the playertypes mentions above, but the lobby isn't full of them. There are still enough normal players around who just enjoy to play some rounds to feel the nostalic or just have some fun with friends. I've never heard someone using the voicechat, so theres no one who screams in your ear how bad you are. Just sit back, play some rounds alone or with your friends and have fun.

But what's about the hackers?

Yes, there are a few hackers still in MW2. But in my whole playtime I met less then 5 who hacked very 
obviously and if you're joining a hacked lobby, just quit and search for a new one.

All in all I recommend this game, when it's on sale.  I think 20‚Ç¨ are to much, maybe 15 or 10 would be better. Also it's not a game that you can play 24/7. But some rounds on the weekend with a couple of friends, messing around in Teamdeathmatch or Search and Destroy can be very funny."
10413,"I bought this game for the nostalgic value, but the multiplayer is almost unplayable. The game is full of hackers and even hacked lobbies. I bought the game mostly for the multiplayer because I wanted an FPS game where I can quickly hop into without waiting forever for the game to load (yes I'm referring to Battlefield 4). I read other reviews before I purchased it and I thought it would be okay. I guess I was wrong.

The campaign is still as ""meh"" as it was back in the day but the co-op challenges can be fun and I still prefer them over any zombie mode.

I bought this game during the autumn sale and I recommend anyone who wants to (re)purchase the game to wait for a sale as well, 20 euros for a game from 2009 is way too expensive in my opinion."
10414,Amazing single player campaign!
10415,My Fav COD game wated tons of life playing this game; having endless fun.

10424,Really really fun classic game. In my opinion it is the best call of duty ever. The only negative is I wish they would add full controller support.

10428,"Shit... Long time no see. I don't know what to say,  this is the shi."
10429,"Where is the controller support?!?!?

The only thing this game is missing is a way to use a controller. I played this back on the 360 days and it was at the time the most hyped game but also probably the most ridiculous online. Just like the campaing plot line, the multiplayer was a freaking storm show of ridiculous shit. The original MW was decent, a classic now, with few problems online back then but still kinda fun like a more action oriented counter strike. MW2 however, was a total freaking level up on the ridiclous shit of COD, not the tactical, or sleath or even the team based work. NO the up the game on retarted ridiclous over the top bash shit crazy action moments. 

Good Story

Online is rodonculous 

NO controller support?!?!

Only for fans, everyone else should start with MW1.

Also please can someone make this controller compatible? Like the mouse and keyboard is all pro and what not but COME ON, why no controller????? an update please"

10436,A solid game with a decent single player campaign for a CoD game and a crazy fun multiplayer that surprisingly still has an online presence. Much better with friends thought. Buy this game for the multiplayer or not at all.
10437,"Still living up to the standards of one if not the best COD ever made ^^. Great game, great purchase would buy it again.

Note: TDM, Domination, FFA and S&D are some of the game modes you can find lobbies at along with a few hardcore TDM, if you came for something else you wasting your money.

Note 2: Safe to say that DLC are not worth buying so stay away from them, the core gameplay with the basic maps is still amazing."

the ending makes u feel so badass         Best COD sound track            

cons 
after 8 years its $20 dollars games more than 6 years old should not be over $15 

the other con is personal to me only 

i updated steam one day and it wiped my campain status had to play it all over agian 

best cod ever 

shame the seires kept geting worse after MW3  
that game had some balls

10455,Nobodies playing this game. I got it soon after release. They ruined the servers and limited the amount of players. This is NOT the COD youre looking for. Id like my money back.
10456,"Classic. Loved the campaign of this game, as every other Call of Duty, solid shooting mechanics and action packed story with a great presentation. The SpecOps are out of this world, definitely the best part of the game. Loved the addition of gadgets from the predecessor."

10468,"Was a tad bit disappointed that the campaign was only 5hrs long (might even be shorter, as there was a few difficult parts I had to restart from and was afk for a few times). However, the story makes up for it and I'm glad I got it during sales, I mean its worth the full price, seeing how there is also multiplayer and special ops; but this is an old game, so good luck trying to find a multiplayer game, took me almost 10-20min - sometimes lesser to find a game everytime. 

All in all, a great game; and by far the 2nd last best CoD game (MW3 being the last), before it all went downhill. I've said it before, and I'll said it again - to me, MW2 is the best CoD game out of the whole CoD franchise. But like I said, get it during sales, because you wouldn't wanna pay a full $16 (unless you're splurging) for a <5hrs campaign, special ops & dead multiplayer. 

Overall 6/10"
10469,"This game is like a Transformers movie but without the Transformers.

10470,Unfortunately the game is fine but you can play a long time on multiplayer and a hacker can reset you back to zero and remove all your stats in a game you can't quit. If you buy this game I would only play privately with frriends.
10471,"One of the best games of all time, to bad they dont try to fix it. there are modders who better the game when i used a lobbyfix dll it fixed a big problem that for some reason the developers couldnt fix but it also got me vac banned i didnt cheat i just fixed the game. only dislkike because to many problems and unsupported devs they need to fix the games they have not release a new worse one each year."

Modern Cookware 2's story picks up where the original ended, putting players in the apron of a boots-on-the-ground falafel chef stationed in Afghanistan, who is whisked away on a globe-trotting adventure in a mission to become the world's best falafel chef. This tale is full of twists, turns, betrayals and of course, falafel, and if you were at all drawn in by the narrative of its predecessors you'd be remiss to miss this one out. Of course, no review of Cooking Mama is complete without mention of its renowned multiplayer gameplay; in this regard Modern Cookware 2 turns the intensity dial up to gas mark 9, with a plethora of  new cookware, kitchens, and ingredients, chefs new and old will be satisfied with the rewarding cooking experience which is easy to pick up but difficult to master. In summary, Modern Cookware 2 is one meaty package with plenty of content to sink your teeth into for months to come."

10489,nice game.but how do i want to use my own controller?
10490,"I currently live in Germany and this game is only in german available,and low violence lol,wtf whats wrong with this fucking country
"
10491,"Wow, just wow! I just finished the story mode of the game and wow! The game is amazing. I loved pretty much every detail. The storyline was fantastic and fit right into the gameplay. I loved this game and officially name it my favorite from now on because i teared up quite a few times. I would reccomend this game to anyone who is 15+ and can handle both the bloody violence of war and who is willing to have their stomach turned upside down by a violent terrorist attack on the innocent people in an airport (There is the option to skip this level). Overall, amazing! I loved the game, loved the story, and I love what you guys do Aspyr! Keep it up! 9.9999999/10"
10492,"good game, fairly populated for its age, not that many hackers"
10493,online action was okay at best .

10496,Great story line and graphics.  If you dont own it - buy it!
10497,When I didnt have Black Ops I would play this game even though there are a lot of hackers now rip. I still recommend the Mutiplayer and Campaign.
10498,"I probably curse the most when I play this game. The multiplayer pisses me off just like the good old days. The matchmaking is quick and smooth. Having cash explode from my corpse on death brings back memories. I got this on sale, but i think its overpriced for being as old as it is, plus the dlc."

10514,It's a love/hate relationship
10515,Believe it or not people still play the multiplayer in MW2. Plus the single player and spec ops are great.
10516,"Don't be fooled by my hours played. I never played the campaign on PC. This game is where it all started for me. Rushing home from middle-school just to hop on Xbox and play with my friends. This game was my childhood and the gateway drug to my addiction for video games. I've spent countless hours and although I get noobtubed and face the occasional hacker, I still love MW2. For the most part, everyone who's still playing this game wants to relive the nostalgia. So there aren't that many hackers or cheaters. But if you're new to CoD, don't be afraid to be at the bottom of the scoreboard. Relax, and just try to unlock those attatchments and perks. 
TLDR; Not that many hackers, Easy to join games (TDM), Intervention w/ Sleight of Hand Pro."

10580,"Although people complain about the noobtubers and occasional hackers, this game is, in my opinion, one of the best call of duty games. The graphics are spot on compared to games released in that time period, such as world at war. The guns look amazing and are quite satisfying to shoot. I feel the gameplay is well made and responsive, and the multiplayer is so much fun. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPS's."

10598,"Best CoD, simple as that."
10599,"It's a classic. Like seriousy, it's on sale right now go and buy it! The story is like a videogame orgasm(Never thought I would say that.huh) And the mutliplayer is actually still pretty alive, but for mostly tdm. Some other servers are totally dead but it's ok.

The campaign is actually pretty good and I can't really say anything about it. Just the normal CoD problems (dumb AI, unnecessary cutscenes, corridor gameplay, unnecesarry stealthparts, railmissions and so on).

Multiplayer:
The multiplayer makes fun but is way to unbalanced. The streaks are way to OP and grenade spam was probably invented by this game (you can have grenades, a grenade launcher on your weapon and one as a secundary) but everyone can play with this or like this so yeah. 50% of the players have hack and playing makes no fun. I wouldn't  recommend buying it even if your PC is very slow but you should better buy BO2, BO3 or something like that because these games are way better.

10622,Good game
10623,Got called the n word into my 3rd match
10624,Such a great game
10625,"Whew, it's been a while playing this game and I've waited with a review for this until I've become unbiased enough to actually claim whether this game is good or bad. Roughly 3000 hours spent on this game (It's much, I suppose, though I know people with way more) and it's safe to say I've gotten a decent dose of it and seen what's in the game.

Modern Warfare 2, the sequel to CoD4: Modern Warfare, which was a masterpiece in its days. Modern Warfare 2 soon became this too, a masterpiece for the casual and professional players and those who only played games for campaigns. The firefights you'd have as a rookie Soap fighting your way through the tight corridors of the cargo ship in the Bering Strait to the stealth mission as Roach up in the siberian heights. This game takes you through most of it and doesn't hold back. The campaign is simply amazing, it retains the intensity and brutality of Modern Warfare and shoves it all in your face. Throwing knives, Claymores, Breaching Charges, it has everything. As you make your way through the campaign, you can't help yourself from creating a special bond with the characters, whether it's a good one with Ghost or Price, or a bad one with Makarov or Shepherd.

Multiplayer in this game is probably the biggest aspect, as many people are troubled over it. This game has its flaws and there are a lot of them. If you haven't played Modern Warfare 2, you'd probably still have heard of the noobtubers and trickshotters in this game, which most people despise. People tend to shun the russians and generalize them by saying they all either cheat, use g18 akimbo or noobtube.  Those are the biggest flaws of this game, but there are more, hidden flaws within the game that most people might not notice. One fairly well-known bug with the Holographic sight is that it affects weapon in a strange way. In the FALs case, it gets stronger, with a infinite (or sharply decreased) bullet drop, resulting in a two-shot kill even on the biggest maps, like Wasteland or Fuel. Or perhaps you want to put it on the M16A4, where you'd realize if you compared it with and without the Holo, that it decreases the spread on the weapon, giving it more accuracy. I can list many more problems with this game, but that would ruin most of the fun, wouldn't it? 

My whole opinion on this is that every game has its flaws, Infinity Ward just made the flaws very small and insignificant (most of them, at least) while the bigger flaws like G18 and noobtube stand out way more. The game also did gross on ~$250 000 000, and they spent $150 000 000 of it on advertising the game, rather than actually working on it, if they could've prioritized better they could've have made this, awesome game, even better. A masterpiece throughout time, a gaming canon. Yet this didn't happen, due to poor advertising and publishing by the two companies responsible, Activision and Infinity Ward.

I love this game, I really do, but I just can't help criticize it due to all the mistakes and flaws it has. You will find some hackers if you play it nowadays, and the tubers and g18's will always be there, but if you try to thoroughly enjoy the games and times you have without them, you will love this game."
10626,Best C O D game ever //
10627,Best COD of all time!
10628,Very nostalgic game but I wish it had a 64bit version to run better.
10629,"This game is awesome if you like to click on folks to acquire killstreaks. My only real problems with this game largely surround the community. Here I will briefly mention the fact that the player base consists of a small 5% of players who don't know how to do anything, but use a noobtube. Which sucks, when you consider that using noobtubes is like a disease, and those who die to noobtubes WILL switch to an explosive class of their own.

The hacking is really not that bad, most hackers are really obvious, especially if you know how to spot different types of hacks. My main problem regarding hackers is the paranoia. Everyone is always seeing hackers everywhere, which results in alot of false accusations/ finger pointing.
Here's a guarentee: If you are a good shot and manage to get a Pavelow/Chopper Gunner/What have you, suddenly everyone is on your ass and calling you a hacker. Something about getting a positive K/D while not using tubes which attracts a lot of salty people. This can be a little bit frustrating (I will say it starts off as an amazing compliment) for players, like me, who don't really have a life outside of clicking on people in a virtual world. 

That's really where my complaints end, though. Aside from explosives (not barring Danger Close), this game is truly great. The balance has every gun be usable, because everything in this game has a time to kill of less than a second. Resulting in a truly twitchy experience. Oh yeah: Quickscoping is fun. Pew Pew. The Intervention sounds like a lazor gun.

Most of the game modes are unfortunately abandoned, barring TDM and sometimes FFA or SnD. I've heard Domination also exists, but Ive never managed to lobby into a game. TDM usually has 2/3 different lobbies, but backing out of a lobby does usually bring you back into the same match."
10630,"Personally, the Campaign and Special Ops modes were the highlight of my nostalgia for this game, and for me the game is still as fun as it was when it came out. It also seems the multiplayer is still slightly active in Australia, so if you still enjoy the chaotic sh*tshow that is the online multiplayer then you're in luck."
10631,Miss this game
10632,You are an OG if you played this game i can never get enough always brings back good memories
10633,Still one of my favourite games. Great game that still holds up today.
10634,Remove noob tube and one man army.
10635,its a call of duty game but its old the community isnt as toxic as any of the new ones
10636,i can play this game all day long
10637,"Good game, boring story. Sometimes very static."
10638,yesssssss
10639,"Suprisingly, even after nine years or so, this is still a pretty good game, not to mention that the multiplayer is still functional.

It's a step up from 'COD 4: Modern warefare' and definetely lives up to it's expectation."
10640,Some may hate and some may love.. and I love this game! Now first of all one man army and nub tubs are gay and can make us all uninstall sometime and brings us back. This game for the time had a amazing story continuing from the first and good graphics and knew what they were doing for the pc community. 10/10 -IGN
10641,Best cod of all time. still playable to this day.
10642,"If the campaign's story was shaped better and made more sensible, and if the online Perks were just a tiny bit more balanced, this would be a near-perfect game, no shadow of a doubt. As it stands, however, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is an utterly stellar achievement that knows exactly what its audience wants, and delivers in abundance. Truly, this is the biggest game of 2009."
10643,Fun game

10650,I like the story. Suprised when some characters from MW turned out to be alive. I was so excited that I bought the game as soon as it was released. Since then I've been playing it occacionally. The only down side is that there are alot of hackers and what not in the Multiplayer mode.
10651,this is a great game
10652,"What is there to say? Pure unadulterated, chaotic, stupidly nostalgicly fun!"
10653,Very fun and still playeble
10654,IT JUST PERFECT..
10655,do i recommend this game? f**k yes. The  most interesting and exciting multiplayer  ive ever played
10656,Always a good game to play with others.
10657,The game is actually hard.
10658,after all these years this game is still the best game i had ever played

10660,Hard multiplayer :///
10661,1v1 me on rust
10662,Its the best Multiplayer-Game that i ever played.
10663,The best Call of Duty Series who's released
10664,good game
10665,"Although the game is dated, the game is still populated and fun."
10666,"This is by far the best game I have ever played.
I originally bought this game because it was just 20 euros (I'm not an adult) and my pc was quite shitty though I even bought a new gaming pc for the latest games but I just keep coming back to mw2.
There are two things I dislike about this game: it is quite unbalanced. Alot of noob tubing and painkillers (tubing means using the grenade launcher attachment too much. It delivers a 1-shot kill so theres not much you can do if someone shoots a grenade at you. Painkiller is a deathstreak that gives you an absurd amount of healt 10 seconds after you spawn.)
Also the player base is kind of dead. There are usually in my timezone about 2000 players online. Its enough to find a game in a few seconds though so I wont worry about that too much. There are quite some modded lobbies and servers (I join on average probaly every five hours of game time a hacked lobby). That can be quite annoying but sometimes fun if you join the right lobby.

I heard people complain about the amount of hackers. I have only countered about 30 obvious hackers in my entire carreer. (about 500 hours combined with my primary account)

The campaign only is also another reason to buy the game. The story is just so well made and the music is just priceless( not litterly).

Im sorry for the possible English mistakes I could have made.
Thanks for reading this review. :)"
10667,everything

10676,nice
10677,"Amazing! Everything you expect when replaying the game singleplayer. As for multiplayer, there are plenty of people still playing, but mostly on team deathmatch. If you don't mind the game mode then I would pick up this game."
10678,its a good game and a great long story mode i recommend you get it if you want like i said its a great game.
10679,Excellent story line with amazing co-op missions with friends. Recommend it.
10680,"got through the starting mission and everything looked great, ran smooth, graphics were awesome, however i was unable to get my controller on my computer working for it. I have windows 10 and it works for game modes in browsers and everything else so how can I get it to work here?

10685,"Graphics 8/10
Controls 9/10
Story 7/10
Community 6.5/10
Performance 9/10
Pros:
This game is what Call of Duty should be like (with minor things added/removed) those pesky supply drop's don't exist in this game and you can experience the full game without spending a dime (besides buying the game silly) Graphics are pretty good but would I say they are good as Shadow of War, Doom or Watch_Dogs? No. But t is better than CSGO's and Team Fortess 2 (Games from Source Engine). Controls don't hurt your arms after a few games but sorta annoying to do a few things. Game runs great few lag then and there.

Cons:
 This game like most communities are cancer full of 12 year old's saying I F*cked ur mom Xddddddd A way to stop this is to ignore it (like I'm doing with Cuphead) The Story I easily forget but only 1 memed mission *COUGH* No Russian. 

Final Thoughts:
If you are looking for a Call of Duty game that is current then this is your one if your are looking for the greatest Call of Duty then you have a few options World at War Black ops 1 and 2 and maybe 3 if you like zombies so yeah pretty great game would I call this the God of Modern shooters? No. But I really suggest this game"
10686,Great game!! Recommend it for everyone!!
10687,"Ah the memories. Had some great times playing this game! 
Barely any hackers if you're looking to get this game for online! 
"
10688,They still ban on this game? Tf
10689,best cod <3
10690,sexy
10691,"gay game many tubes, do not play pls"
10692,Old but gold
10693,Best Call of Duty ever made
10694,"I loved this game. By far was my favorite game (multiplayer). I hope they remaster this so we can play it with much more players again. With almost 1000 hours played on multiplayer, I would definitly recommend this especially if remastered."
10695,This and Black Ops 2 are the best CoD games.
10696,It's cod from 2009 it has to be good.
10697,I have to say that this game is overall good.the only thing that i missed is fov in the options but they already made a mod for fov.the game is good there is no competition for that.some people count it as the best other not.the campaign is pretty good.i cant say its the best in the trilogy but its pretty good and you get to kill Shepherd.the multy is...is...ok i cant say its the best but its ok. the snipers are op and kinda hard to use.the only thing i hate this gamefor is the sprint.when you start sprinting and hold the forward button and then stop holding the sprint button it continues to sprint until you stop moving completely or crouch and even while you sprint and press the shoot button it doesent start shooting until you stopped moving.except the sprint i have no problem with the game.i recomend it actually.if you dont want it for 20 euro though you can buy it from a video game shop.because i got mine for 20 lev.
10698,Really good game for ¬£20 its a bargain as people are still playing it in 2017 :)
10699,"I've played every Call of Duty since COD4. Always complete the campaign on Hardened and then move on to Multiplayer. I've just recently completed this campaign on Hardened and I feel compulsed to complete it on Veteran. This never happened to me with a Call of Duty game. The Enemy of My Enemy has to be my favourite mission, the news of betrayal and your comrades being killed, being stuck between two armies and the incredible soundtrack simply makes it the best mission. This is the peak of Call Of Duty."
10700,"multyplayer lvl 1 - ""I hate this game. So many snipers!""

multyplayer lvl 4 (got intervention) - ""Omg I love this game, this is the best weapon!""
definetly worth buying.

10/10"
10701,"Best Call of Duty there is. Despite coming out in 2009 there is still a lot of people that play it. Usually it's around 50/50 chances of running into modders/hackers in multiplayer but they mostly aren't the douche bags that just have aimbot or something they're the kind that make the game more fun. Campaign is also very fun, Special ops is also fun as well. Fun for multiplayer as well as single player."
10702,"[h1][u]Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2[/u][/h1]

[h1][u]The Good[/u][/h1]

[i]+Extremely enjoyable and replayable multiplayer.
+Some of the best killstreaks ever in the COD franchise, including the nuke.
+Introduced Spec Ops mode, a fun co-op mode.
+Really fun weapons to use online.
+Decent weapon balance for the most part.
+Still active as of Nov 2017.[/i]

[h1][u]The Bad[/u][/h1]
[i]-One man army noob tubes.
-Spec ops needs a partner for some missions.
-Multiplayer maps range from awful to good and no one plays the DLC.
-Campaign isn't the greatest in the series, you could give it a miss and not be bothered.
[/i]

[h1][u]Conclusion[/u][/h1]
[i]While this game has it's flaws; it remains very fun to this day with people still playing online. The weapon balance is good in the sense that you can do ok with any gun, however noob tubes exist. Overall it remains my favourite in the series and is definately worth a play.

Note: my low play time is because the play time shown on reviews is from single player, i have over 30 hours in multiplayer over PC and Xbox and i completed the campaign on Xbox.

10703,"Much satisfaction.WW2= My grannys Ass
"
10704,This game is so good it killed Ghost years before it was even published.
10705,"Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was a good game back in its prime. It held amazing competitive lobbies in Search & Destroy, Domination, GroundWar and Free For All. I see gamers from around the world put their best foot front show casing their skills they've developed playing the game & some that just played to pass time with friends. As time went by the respect for each gamer faded as the community grew between 2 types of generations the primes vs new gen. As a gamer that played this game at its prime have seen this game hit its lowest and stayed at its lowest. I still recommend this game to everyone who is looking for a good time but as this game isnt a challenge no more. There's been talk of this game being remastered i can say with confident if they ruined Call Of Duty 4 Remastered then there is a 99.99% chance they will ruin Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Remastered. Even though this game is broken leave the game broken because its the very broken parts of the game most gamers enjoy, unpatched glitches wall bang spots etc those very things make this game fun & give it a chance for others to enjoy."
10706,Bought this game and got to say that it is best cod ever made. Theres a lot of player. I have bought bouth map packs for mw2 and im happy with it. There is a lot of players playing and maps are really good. Recommend buying bouth map packs if you are planning to play mw2 because it makes multiplayer so much better.
10707,"It's too late for someone to buy it,but it's a very very very very nice game."
10708,This review is not available in your region.
10709,"A Classic!!!  10/10 
Remember no Russian"
10710,i like modern warfare generation.
10711,Best game in the world tbh
10712,10/10 brings back nostalgia <33 I miss playing on favela :(( I hope it gets remastered
10713,Great Game
10714,"Very good game beat in four hours but they should add bots because you just can't play multiplayer forever it's going to get  boring, but cant get a mod for MW2 to add bots in offline so im still going to rate it good but I think they should have added bots."
10715,When Call of Duty was good. Amazing game. Expansion packs were both worth every penny. Because of hackers and the small player community the game has gone down hill. Will always be one of my favorites. Right up there with World At War and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Honestly wish i could go back to how these games used to be. Some of the best gaming memories i have were from these old Call of Duty titles. Maybe this new Call of Duty will pull away from all this furturistic bs. Although i don't think they will ever be able to recreate how these games felt. R.I.P. Old Cod
10716,The best cod in the modern warfare series in terms of story and gameplay. I personally found the multiplayer meh when I did play it on console
10717,yeah fuck you i didnt want the nuke anyways
10718,"im only here for the game award
"
10719,is pretty guud
10720,Hackers
10721,"used to be fun but the hackers took over and mulit sucks now, get it for story only
pros
+ great story
+ great weapons
+ great killstreaks
+ good maps
cons
- hackers
- cheaters
- aimbotters
5/10
10/10 on console"
10722,"It's... just... beatifull.
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was my first Call of Duty game i ever brought. (Sorry but these little kids raging at this game made this game look really bad.) I played it thinking that ""it would problably suck anyways and would be full of noob kids who rages at everything"" but no, it suprised me.
It was so well designed that you felt like you were in there. After you play about 2 missions, ""the game"" leaves being a game and becomes something more. I have finished this game 3 times, and if they ask me ""Would you play this game again"" i would say ""Fuck yes i will."" It's really hard to find games like this these days. The games that makes you wanna play again or more every second. The games that makes you laugh, scare, cry. The games that becomes one with you.
Call of Duty Modern Warfare series is amazing. And im planing on buying 1 and 3 to understand the story better.
If i have to rate this game out of 10, i would break the rules and say 100/10.
Buy it and trust me, it really worths paying money to this game."
10723,"One of the most crappy games ever, one of the levels allow you to kill civilians, wich is one of the most messed up pices of **** ever. Just go and f* y*.
A lot of pointless killing, blood and gore. Who thinks pointless violence is fun need to get checked.
In some of the missions the numbers of attackers just dont make sense, the imersion of the game gets spoiled by a lack of even the remotest tactical thinking. Some parts are well done, like ice and weather, but overal I lost my interest at  1 hr mark. ( this does not apply to multiplayer )"
10724,u should buy this gem. i sold my waifu to buy this and it'z gud
10725,way better than console
10726,best cod
10727,"Star 69 Veteran, Fuck me."
10728,"Still has the same issues it had back in the day. Still no native support for FOV changing, still capped at 90fps, still P2P, still no dedicated server support.  

However there is still a MP community active, and while cheaters definitely exist they are not common enough to completely ruin the experience. Solid game after all these years regardless of the issues. Would not recommend due to the insane price tag."
10729,Best cod by far.
10730,"its friken gr8
"
10731,Better than half of the new CODs out there...
10732,"This game is 8 years old now. The last time I played this was around 4 years ago. 4 years later and the community still use the following phrases (with lack of grammar included):

""fuckin noobtuber""
""camping mother bitch""
""i fuck ur mom""
""hacker""
""ez"" (said by players whomst'd've ranked last)
""bg noobs""

These are the most important phrases that bring a tear to my eye, not in sadness or rage, but in rememberance.

I was so happy to realise people still toggle after you spawn kill them with an AC-130.

The joy I have experienced this past week can only be explained by playing the game. So, if you haven't played this since, I encourage you to celebrate the release of this game 8 years and 3 days ago. I assure you will be happy to rejoin the community, just to get another taste before this game gets remastered and becomes trash.

PS: People still have mics about as old as this game which makes it even more authentic.

11/10 - Only game that makes me laugh when people crash my game and disconnect me from servers. Thank you, IW."
10733,"Very nice game! 
Good story and very good multiplayer, a little different from CoD4 but decent.
I hope we can get Modern Warfare 4"
10734,"Grab the UMP-45 and go ahead and rekt some noobs in this game, EZ."
10735,Good game
10736,"awesome campaign, must have/play"
10737,"Definitely one of the best three CoD ever released (and the best one, in my own opinion).
The story is captivating, and has moments and characters that reverberated in the minds of CoD players. It will be a fun, although short, time.

Even better: you can still play the multiplayer. It has more players than Infinite Warfare and Ghosts; enough to find Team Deathmatch and sometimes Domination lobbies. The multiplayer is without comparison. The amount of innovation that went into it is unparalleled. The guns are varied and all feel unique, in a way that makes you want to use them all, giving fresh life to the game.
Unfortunately, there are noob-tubers, but there are more games without than with, so it doesn't completely ruin the experience.

It's so cheap and so much fun that it's a no-brainer to buy it. I am glad I get to enjoy this game 8 years after release."
10738,The solo campaimg was so beautiful üò¢
10739,Still the best CoD no doubt
10740,Noobtubes
10741,"Best Call of Duty ever made. Had easily one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experience at release, and is still enjoyable today. Sure, there are definately some hackers, but other than that, it is still very much fun. Definately a must have."
10742,The last truly good CoD
10743,"Its okay i guess it was hard to jerk off to it but it worked out!
10/10 would recomend 
Rule 34 artists welcome"
10744,S'aight.
10745,"This is my first to play first person shotter game, but this game is very old  and fun"
10746,Typical Modern Warfare. Honest players can't get ahead due to a majority of the players using hacks and cheats in order to make themselves think they are good. No wonder this franchise is rapidly becoming a big joke. Play any of the Battlefield games made by EA in which they keep gameplay fair and balanced.
10747,"So nostalgic. Easily one of my favorite CoD games.

As of today, the playerbase is still somewhat breathing, even though the players are mostly assholes who only use explosives, and there are hackers here and there, but its easy to still have a fun time.

Private matches are really fun if you can get them to work, and are great if you wanna have a fun time with friends, and Spec Ops operations perform the same, but with only 2 players.

Story mode is fun, even if the game itself isn't realistic, its one hell of a nostalgia trip for anyone who has played the original game or trilogy.

So, to sum it all up, its a great game from a Call of Duty standpoint. If you are not a fan of CoD, you might still like the arcade like feel of this action packed FPS. Keep in mind that the game has aged a bit, but it still looks pretty ok in 2017."
10748,What an amazing game.
10749,classic
10750,"so good that I finished the whole campaign in one sit and 6 hours.

I feel ""hardened"""
10751,"THE BEST COD, got it when it came out and last year got in on pc, always fun playing."
10752,"I purchased the PC version of CoD MW2 and can't complete the first mission.  The idiotic one where you climb a 80 degree ice cliff fifty feet high with a pair of ice picks.  This was clearly made for consoles, but using the mouse controls for the PC, it is impossible to climb that effing cliff.  If you have a console then enjoy the game.  I have tried to climb that cliiff at least forty times and I finally reached the halfway point before plummeting five thousand feet to my death.  What a waste of time and money.  If Activision and Infinity had included a skip function at least I could have started at the top of the cliff, but you can't even mission select until you have finished the game at least once  I have played MW4 and MW3 dozens of time.  Never have I encountered such an effed up mission like getting to that ultra nationalist base in the Altay Mountains.  I am one POed Steam and Activision customer.  As a veteran PC gamer,  I am buildiing a state of art PC full tower gaming machine and COD MW2 will NOT be on that new machine."
10753,"Well, ... where do I start? This game is retarded beyond saving. Fistly this game contains wappons hat are destruktiv. Theyre like thinking its cool to kill and murder and anihilate just for fun but it is actually not so cool in real life. Second this hour is just the minute to relize the relay arnt working promptly on this shetty game. U play like a lil shed that doesnt now how to operate nether a toilet nor a gon that fires like flames, and im not talking about dragonforce ot any otter dragon shet.

This game is clearly a 7/10 but it laks bobs, therfore i will wait for a update."
10754,Separated the boys from the men...
10755,Ok.
10756,very niece
10757,"100% unadalterated nostalgia, i remember playing this when i was younger and it is still just as good, so buy the game, and remember... No Russian"
10758,the last of best call of duty
10759,"awesome campaign but terrible multiplayer, so pretty much every Call of Duty exept for Ghosts, Infinite Warfare, and Black Ops 3, those games are just horrible"
10760,"Friend bought MW2, I was pumped, got hammered, played MW2, next day had a VAC ban. 

No clue why, but still worth it."
10761,"DONT GET IT, me and my friends were playing, and i get reported for hacking (i dont know how to hack or even anything about it), also the game in general is not like that consle feeling, so who ever is telling you that is lying, lastly if you are looking for a cod game to play but for lower end pc get WaW, it might sound funny because its no longer supported, but its 20 dollars for EVERYTHING. People will say there are hackers, but every lobby i was on for muiltiplayer had a barely any hackers (at least from what i saw), also for (WAW of course), there is the nazi zombies for when your bored, with all 4 maps and custom maps from ugx mods or zombie modding.   I WILL TAKE THE SHIT STORM OF PEOPLE TELLING ME TO GO DIE IN A HOLE FOR PLAYING WAW I DONT CARE, I AM JUST SAYING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE BUT IF OTHERS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE THAN BE MY GUEST AND SUGEST IT TO OTHERS, I DONT CARE, 


AND IF YOU DID NOT CARE EITHER ABOUT WHAT I THOUGHT, YOU WOULD NOT BE READING THIS SO YOU CANT SAY ""FuCk YOu M8 no one cares what you think"".  thank you and enjoy not buying mw2, because it really is worse than the shit my cat just took in his litter box."
10762,:))
10763,One of the best call of duty games out there! :D
10764,Every single second there was an action. Best story all the time . Graphics were really good. I wish CoD always keep continue on this scenario and this series. Do not trust Shepherd.
10765,"call of duty MW2 wont let me play onling on my mac it used to but not any more plz help me staem i really want to play this game again plz i beg you to help me

"
10766,"what kind of this game, you let the best character die"
10767,"haha, this game brought me together with some amazing people...."
10768,"Memorys man, I don't suggest doing online unless you got patience and can deal with noobtubes"

10777,"Pretty fun game. Classic COD. The campaign was a lot of fun, and an improvement over COD4: MW. I tried the multiplayer as well and truth be told, I enjoyed it for about the first 5 hours or so. But then I was put into a hacked server and one kill led to a jump to level 94. Not fun. I want to earn my rewards. It ruined the whole experience. Enjoy the campaign, give multiplayer a try, but move on."
10778,"I just love it. Even to this day there are 800+ people playing, and it's 8:30am, proof that this game has stood the test of time."
10779,Yeah god game just like MW2
10780,I do recommend very much. Very good FPS game :)
10781,is very good if u want to shoot people in plane and shot missile

Still gets recommended from me."

10784,Great story qnd good graphics üëç
10785,one of the best game i've ever played
10786,"The only CoD I bothered to fully prestige. Everything else was pretty much downhill from here. Got it on pc so I could fully prestige again.

Story was loads enjoyable and the multiplayer is my favorite out of all the the cods."
10787,gud game
10788,TRICKSHOTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
10789,meh
10790,This is the last good call of duty game
10791,Nice game
10792,"Definitely the best Call of Duty game to date. Multiplayer matches are easy to find for team death match, domination & search and destroy, but most other game modes don't have anyone playing them. Good community overall, however I've run into several hackers, but it still doesn't take away a significant amount of the enjoyment that can be had from this game."
10793,best cod game oat just make sure to download eye w four x the steam servers are dead asf and its generally a better way to play the game
10794,"Reviewing just single player, it's a fun romp. The action movie equivalent of video games. Lots of explosions and a plot that sort of makes sense."
10795,Gameplay 7.5 Story 6
10796,"BEST COD EVER! I had this on the PS3 but now i have it on the pc!!!!! On console it now has alot of hackers but on pc it does not have any. This is because of the EasyAntiCheat. when people download hacks such as aimbots for mw2, EasyAntiCheat notices and banns that player. AND THERE IS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ONLINE!!!"
10797,I personally reccomend this game its lot of fun now that the cheaters left...
10798,"A great game in the series ,if not the best.

The Story is really fun ,even if it's not your first playthrough, and it's not to long ,but not too short at the same time.

The coop is fun ,especially if you have a seasoned friend to get your through it.

Overall:9/10."

10814,Great game
10815,"This game hits me with the feels, the nostalgia.  All time classic CoD.  Sadly, I don't think multiplayer is very big, but the spec ops was cool, and the campaign was legendary.  It's got the standard CoD campaign gameplay, with it's epic set pieces and action.  I won't give any spoilers, but every time I see that one scene, I feel just as hurt as I did the first time."
10816,It good
10817,"is very gud
is very bad"
10818,WHY CAN'T WE USE A CONTROLLER LIKE WTF???
10819,"Best Call of Duty game out there. I usually play free for all mode. Best maps for me are Scrap yard and Terminal. Stacking Killstreaks rule. Quickscoping is fast and effective. Downside is idiots with noobtubes and OMA. Other than that, I love this game. Have 6000+ hours in on Xbox. Unfortunately this game on Steam does not support using an Xbox controller. I like using mouse/keyboard for gaming, but I like to play this game lying in bed and I'd prefer using an Xbox controller for that. All in all 5 out of 5 stars!"
10820,"The campaign alone is enough to make this game worth the purchase, but there's also so much fun to be had in multiplayer. Definitely a strong recommendation."
10821,"Great game! Takes me back in time, when FPS weren't all about DLCs. However, I personally enjoy the storyline of the Modern Warfare serie, the multiplayer isn't what it used to be anymore. 

For singleplayer fans a special experience. A solid classic! 

"
10822,"Amazing graphics, firefights, and story."
10823,"If you want points and reasons to buy this game then here you go:

1) It's a timeless classic.
2) The general flow of the game and its intensity adds to the replay value.
3) The classic killstreak grind adds to the replay value.
4) Using a keyboard and mouse adds a challenging aspect to your experience.
5) It's classic simplicity and basic in game mechanics, makes you have a much better gaming experience.

But other than the plagued Grenade-Launcher attachment, this game is flawless because I haven't had an issue with hackers; doxers or game tamperers in general. 

10/10 Classic. #WillNeverDie"
10824,Love it!
10825,"   THE best Call of Duty campaign, hands down. This is the one people remember, this is the one people STILL talk about to this day. You just can't top this."
10826,Probably will remain my all time favorite FPS team deathmatch game. The different weapon combos along with awesome maps made this game a lot of fun.
10827,"YES, it was a great game Back then - Although it had its Flaws.

NO, you should not Buy it - Because 5 Hrs Campaign isnt worth the Buying Price, and Multiplayer is dead. 

Also, I do not Support Companies like IW or Activision ravaging good Franchises to death for A few Dollars. 

Would Still play CoD if the listened to the Community 10 Years ago. 

Still won't Listen."

10836,10/10 best qwick scooping
10837,"In my opinion, the best Modern Warfare, and Arguably the best COD. It has a much better campain and spec ops than MW3."
10838,By far the best Call of Duty game when it comes to storyline and pretty good on graphics. Much better than MW3 storyline.
10839,"Twelve-year-olds still play it, but now they're better than me because of seven years of experience. Single player is good, though."
10840,9/11 must buy
10841,SO DOPE
10842,"Man, When This Game First Came Out, This game Is Worth Getting From CoD 4's Campaign It Is Great There And It Still Follows That Storyline.

Spec-Ops: That Was A Pain In The Ass Sometimes from fighting regulars to defending BMG's to kicking the juggernauts asses.

Multiplayer: Not Much To Say Here :D"

10855,"[u]CALL OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE 2[/u]

Please note this review only concerns the single-player campaign

Similarly to COD 4: Modern Warfare, I was pleasantly surprised that not all COD games are quite as dumb as I may have thought. Modern Warfare 2 is a big improvement on it's narrative predecessor in multiple ways. The gameplay mechanics are similar, but have been polished, and it shows. First person animations also improved, if only a bit. Like COD 4, MW2's gunplay is basic and doesn't require too much thought, but the set pieces and intensity rival that of a Hollywood action movie (only being limited by video game graphics, of course). 

The characters and development have not improved much since COD 4, unfortunately. Although characters and development were already [i]just okay[/i] before, it would have been nice to see the writers create some relatable characters and/or make already existing characters even better.

Once again, the music in MW2 is absolutely spectacular, but this time it's even better! The addition of Hans Zimmer's (known for Pirates of the Caribbean and The Dark Knight movie trilogy, among many other well-known movies) work in this game was another pleasant surprise and it works incredibly well for the tone the game sets out to create.

The plot is again cliche, and a certain plot twist involving one particular character was seen by me a mile away, but nonetheless, the plot does give the amount of motivation necessary to play through the game.

Like COD 4, this game, being as old as it is and with only 5 hours of a single player campaign, should really only be $10 or $15, so wait until it hits that range if you're thinking about buying.

Update - Sept 27, 2020
After reading this Steam Community post recently, I believe I unfortunately got that ban because of an RCE exploit that is actually still in this game today. https://steamcommunity.com/app/10190/discussions/0/1640919103667399921/

I can't in good conscience keep this review as recommended with a serious issue like this being in most Call of Duty games. 


Original Review
Got VAC banned for being in a modded lobby that matchmaking put me into, as of writing this review it has been 2575 days and I'm still banned. 10/5 graphics alone."
10874,"An outstanding game, even arguably better than the recent CODs. You can't go wrong with Modern Warfare 2!"
10875,lotta hackers
10876,"It's already a popular game. If you still haven't played, wait for a discount."
10877,"This game is totally awesome, y'all are right this can't be compared with CSGO, IT IS BETTER lol"
10878,yes
10879,"Good game, but hackers and exploiters infest this game"
10880,"This is a great game that I really hope is remastered for multiplayer at some point.

I can't recommend playing it currently as the game has a MAJOR security vulnerability (Remote Code Execution)

I was playing this game and suddenly a hacker had joined the game and was able to control my PC opening browser windows etc, only way to stop it was by closing down the game.

This could be highly abused by people that know what they are doing silently install software, steal account logins and watch what you are doing without you knowing etc.

If Steam or Infinity Ward cared about the security of their users, they would take the servers down until they patch the game."
10881,"Call of duty series is a huge franchise of war games spawning from WW2 games to depictions of fantasy modern era war, and later version dealing with future tech. This game is obviously taking place in the moder war era but the question is it a good game. I will be reviewing modern warfare 2 with a pro/ con style and ending with my conclusion.

Pro:
     The single player has an amazing story. The story is a thrill to play and has some very ""edgy"" moments that at the time was controversal but I appriciate that they didnt patch it out. It made the bad guys more of a reason to hate and was no joke a fun mission to do. The rest of the game the player changes characters from SAS and rangers, each character plays a pivital role in the story and do not feel like a generic soldier.

      Amazing music. The game has some very emotional and fitting music in the game. I can not say much but it is definantly worth listening to, thank you hanz zimmerman.

      Graphics look amazing. The visuals are very breath taking from the a snow storm to a gernade explosion. The particles the game has add to the immersion, like the leaves falling or the wind blowing up trash or debris from a wreckage. Character models look pretty good, especially in cutscenes.

     The spec ops bonus mode is fun to play. To the addition to modern warfare series is the addition of the spec ops mode. They are challenges that take experiences from the main game and test players skills. Depending on what difficulty or how fast completed, depends on what star ammount the player earns. The stars are used to unlock additional tiers of spec ops mode which get harder the further gone. Also some spec ops mission are coop only so those are best played with friends since communication is key to success especially on veteran difficulty.

Con:
       Multiplayer is awful. Since the graphics are so amazing, this can be a distraction. The enemies regardless if they are wearing sniper cammo blend in very well with the graphics because they share the same color scheme. Yes it makes sense in a war but it can lead to many deaths that could be avoided. To add to that, the game has many many hackers. Thats to be expected but it is a disapointment that the multiplayer is still active and no matter what lobby I am in, the experience suffers because hackers kill indefinantly. I got 5 hours on multiplayer and had no fun besides doing a private match with a friend. That leads me to my next issue with the multiplayer, the private matches. Its not fun to go to a private match and not have the ability to goof off with friends like in black ops 2 or black ops 1. The guns and attachments you earned in the multiplayer transfers over to the private match. This cripples the experience with friends because it forces everyone to play the multiplayer to earn their gear and go to private matches to have fun with 1v1 snipers or just combining guns to just have a good time.

Conclusion:
       The game is good, that i will admit with all the pros i did mention above but the fun to be had with friends is very limited. All the spec ops mission can be done in coop but only a few are manditory coop. The story was a blast to do from start to finish and veteran proved to be quite a challenge. I would say I like to recommend the game to new comers since the game provides much fun to be had with friends in spec ops. That mode provides interesting twists on missions players experienced in the campaign or a twist on a similar mission from modern warfare 1. Like I said prior the campaign here is a blast to play from start to finish with it's over the top action shooter with a military coat of paint. Do try to get this game mainly on a sale since the playerbase is small. That is obvious since the more popular call of duty games are the ones that are the newest because the fan base goes for the newest games since they are currently active by the developers and will likely have less hackers and higher player counts. A good discounted price will certainly help justify a purchase because the fact that the multiplayer is probably the rougher experience in this game with many hackers and lower players meaning you will see more hackers often."
10882,"I was interested if this COD will be fun and playable like it was almost 10 years ago. I am not a big fan of the latest games from this franchise, but back at the day - I was having a blast playing this game. And guess what? It still rocks. 

SP campaign is a high-octane rollercoaster ride and it still feels like you are a starring role in some Hollywood action blockbuster movie. Full of special effects, slow-mo scenes, vehicle driving, and stealth missions and of course tons and tons of great shooting - the gameplay delivers that well known COD look, feel and play. It can be overwhelming at times, but that is what you can expect from these games.

Spec Ops are a welcomed addition to the game, as the challenges will be taken a step further. They are designed in that way, that you will always crave for more of them, and kept pushing yourself to be a bit more precise, faster and smarter.

MP is the foundation of this game, as it is polished to the max, but still stripped from those things that ruined many (but not all) of the COD titles that followed this one. And the best part - people are still actively playing it! 

All in all - this package is one of the finest packages that you can find if you are an FPS player. Well worth the money, even after all these years."
10883,"Bought this for buddy and I, you either get dropped into a laggy ass server or you get put in a lobby full of hackers, seriously. Don't spend $20 on this. Buy yourself some Taco Bell or something."

10902,"first of all the multiplayer on this game was amazing when it first came out, I would play it all the time with my pals every night. now, though, its filled with hackers and shit not really a point to playing it but HOLY DICK ASS play the singleplayer it has a vibrant color pallet filled with tons of action packed moments and a fantastic soundtrack by Han Zimmer (i think thats his name)... i would buy this on sale for $10 or less but it is 100% worth it!"
10903,"Campaign is great, multiplayer has a small but dedicated community (haven't seen any hackers yet despite people saying there are), great soundtrack, and no loot crate or supply drop bs that plagues the new games"

10911,The only other CoD games I've played were CoD 1 and 2 which were somewhat realistic.  This game however is cheesy AF.  It's basically a combat-fantasy game with hammy writing.  Don't buy if you want something even remotely realistic.  It reeks of console couch jockey.

10918,The multiplayer is really glitchy and most of the time you either get kicked from a match or you just dont even connect. Singleplayer is fun but i dont wanna play just singleplayer. 0.5/10
10919,I just came here for the multiplayer.

- Great story
- Great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe

Cons:

10929,In my opinion Modern Warfare 2 is the best call of duty out here. I played it when it ws released and i still love the game. The community is still very active and it isn't hard to find matches at all. There is also almost no hacking/modding. LOVE IT <3

10938,"Eh. They fixed a lot of things and it‚Äôs not a bad game but it didn‚Äôt hit the spot for me.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
Following from MW1, whole bunch of shit happens and war breaks out. You know the truth and have to stop the bad guy. It‚Äôs a simple plot and they actually try giving the characters motivation and goals to act on (Shepard especially). The problem is that the plot goes all over the place, doesn‚Äôt bother explaining itself half the time, and is a mess. World At War didn‚Äôt have much of a plot but it was simple to understand the context of each mission by the briefings. MW1 was ‚Äúthey launched a nuke, hit them back‚Äù. Every mission here just introduces another thing and moves toward it. At one point, a nuke is launched and it‚Äôs implied why it was fired but no one actually bothers to acknowledge it aftewards or really even mentions it. The villain explains his motivation in a line at the very end and the other one just dissapears after another line at the end. It‚Äôs just really all over the place.
 
[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
It‚Äôs COD. Regenerating health and two weapon slot first person shooter. The places where you shoot and the guns available are really varied and usually you have options on how to progress. The game looks good and the colors really make it pop. However, it does tend to overwhelm the senses. Enemies come at you from all directions so it‚Äôs often the case where you have to duck behind cover and wait because someone is shooting you from a direction you don‚Äôt know and can‚Äôt tell because if you poke your head out to look, you‚Äôll die. Plus, even if you didn‚Äôt get shot immediately, the enemies blend in with the background and even your teammates so half the time you can‚Äôt even tell who the fuck to fire upon. This happens all the goddamn time and it means you have to go SLOWLY from point to point making sure you follow your teammates (who move slow as shit) or spawns are going to fuck you over. 

It‚Äôs functional and it does improve the game play in areas, like the fact that there are no unlimited respawning enemies. However, the amount of times I had to go back and just hide because I couldn‚Äôt see who was firing at me just made me super frustrated.

[h1]Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)[/h1]
Looks good for it‚Äôs time, ran great, no crashes, and lots of options. No issues here.
 
[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]
It‚Äôs not bad. I just didn‚Äôt have fun like MW1. World at war was functional and I ran through it but this was just annoying at parts."

10955,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2

Great campaign, great multiplayer (used to be, now some hackers invaded it), great co-op missions. Had lots of fun, alone and with random people. But i did play a few missions with an old friend of mine.. well we used to be friends but now i barely play with him. Also, there used to be something outside of Steam where People could randomly play MW2 / MW3 Multiplayer. It was a few years ago, i liked it and everyone else did too. So yeah, now MW2 is something i don't play any often. Maybe when i wanna continue with my YouTube Channel then maybe i'll come back and record the whole campaign, otherwise i'm unsure of my next plans with the game.

10972,"You are wondering, is this worth $20? I mean - it's from 2009! I can just get PUBG for 10 bucks more !!1!. Let me start by saying, if you have a midrange modern PC (i5, rx 480, 8gb ram) this game will run maxed out at 1080p over 60fps and it is a sight to see. Honestly feels like a completely different game from the one I played in 2009 on my Playstation 3. Of course this is also a game that should be enjoyable on Intel integrated graphics, like in your laptop. You buy this game because it holds a special place in your heart, it was and is your favorite (or maybe top 3) COD's of all time. Yes there is still an online community. You should be able to find 10-20+ lobbies at any given time. Ping isn't terrible, but you try hards might cringe at 100ms ping but it is perfectly fine for the avg casual person. I've only run into one hacker, it's easy just to leave the game and join a new one. Newer COD's have more hackers. Last time I played this game I was in 2011, and back then all I really wanted to do in campaign was beat it as fast as possible. Go back and play it again, pay attention to all the little details, pick up random enemy weapons. It's a relatively short feeling campaign that I beat under 6 hrs but appreciate the story waaaay more. It will make you want to go and play all of the MW's again. Spec ops missions could take twice that amount if you want to get 3 stars in everything. 

This is not a bad game in 2017. sure not the golden years but plenty of fun to be had."

This game has so many standout moments of such immersive power, there really is no other experience out there to touch Modern Warfare 2‚Äôs controlled and entertaining atmosphere. At least not in the same genre! Modern Warfare 2 really ticks all of the right boxes: varied gameplay, immersive story, engaging gunplay, superb multiplayer, and the list goes on... An absolute must-have-classic-shooter for all gamers who enjoy shooters.
However, a quick heads up, the multiplayer is pretty stuffed up with toxic players, and modders due to it's age and lack of service from Infinity Ward. Just sayin' ;)"

All in all, please buy this game! Infinity Ward deserves the purchases for such an awesome game. Peace out!

(Edit) i don't know about how people get banned from modded lobbies or if they've seen any hackers in this game, but keep that in mind when buying. i currently have 28 hours playing mw2 multiplayer and have not experienced this, but keep it in mind before purchasing this game. :D Hope to see yall in the game."

This game is still playable but the online mode is full of hackers, modded lobbies and there is hit delay. (You will mostly notice this issue playing TDM. You cannot solve it because of P2P connection, look for iw4.x to play on dedicated servers)


If you liked MW2 buy it. It has good campaign + Spec Ops  Missions (Co-Op)

UPDATE: Cheaters can now freeze your game, block ""escape button"", ""alt+tab"" or ""alt+F4"" preventing you from leaving the match  and they can also open your web browser forcing you to open any website they want thanks to new modding tools.

I suggest you to set your config_mp.cfg, located in MW2 folder, on ""Read Only"" before playing MP to prevent cheaters from changing your settings."
11007,"If it was not for the ninja perk, it would most likely still be a big competitive game. MW1 and MW2 are the two best multiplayer COD games of all time, I cannot speak for the singleplayer.

To clear the topic ""Hackers"",its broken into 3 categories as you all know: 1) Hackers that use wallhack/aimbot/kicktools just because they don't have the BALLS to play the game normally and with a legit way 2) Hackers that use modded lobbies to boost some peoples XP and actually focus on making some people happy and improve their experience on the game and last but not least 3) Good players been called hackers for a ton of reasons but mostly because they can actually move their mouse and have a decent game sense, lmao.

Overall still a great game despite lacking player count in multiplayer. 9.5/10
11061,nostalgia
11062,"The best call of duty game in my opinion.
I'm not really into the big reviews so I'll just keep it simple.

Pros:
+ Very good campaign with very good storyline (You should play the first MW game)
+ Good grapchics
+ Good multiplayer
+ Good sound effects
+ Good Spec Ops campaign to play with your buddy.

Cons:
- The single player campaign is short.
- If you are playing on Veteral get ready for many instant deaths from the AI.
- Get ready for some 360 MLG quickscoping in the multiplayer (So stupid..)

If you are not get ready for some rage moments in the multiplayer tho."
11063,"It¬¥s a classic in the COD franchise. For me it still feels like a new COD. There a lots of people still playing it online, with an average number of 2000 players daily. 

"
11064,Game is fun. Brings back the memories of pwning noobs....and also raging from classic bullshit.
11065,"The last good CoD (at the time of writing). Decent singleplayer campaign, amazing co-op campaign (seriously, buy this game with a friend and do the co-op, it's one of the best I've ever played). Fun multiplayer, but I don't think there are people playing any more. If it goes on sale for ~$15 or less, definetly worth picking up!"
11066,wowowowowowowoow
11067,if your looking for a cod with an amazing story line and great online matches this is the game for you!
11068,Best cod ever made.

11071,listen guys... I only have 140+ hours because I play Michael Myers with some friends... I DONT ACTUALLY LIKE THIS GAME !!!
11072,"I like it playing it with low end pc, but can have 60+fps on online! resulution and lowest settings will give u improvement if u lag ."
11073,"Remember when CoD was good?
""Um it's still pretty good today"".
I know, but, I mean, when it was at its best?
""Hell yeah! The original Modern Warfare trilogy""
Yup.

11075,nice
11076,well played it for a bit back in the dayz 11/10
11077,Trash game full of hackers (that got me vacced)
11078,"Shorter than expected, but overall a very good game ! ;)"
11079,"If you want to play this game, you have to:
 
1. Download the localization.txt, because the developers don't let you donwload it with the game.
2. Download some zone, because it doesn't let you play the game.
3. Find and download ""gamefonts_pc"", because it is black screen of death.

Actually, I can't even run the game."
11080,"Truly wish hackers were ""taken care of"" on multiplayer. I guess once they take our money, why bother."

[h1]How I founded out about this game?[/h1]
Better question would be how could someone not find this game when it was released! This game was everywhere. Litteraly everyone asked me if I heared about the second part of the legendary story! ""Of course I did!"" was my answer. 

[h1]Review Of ""Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2"":[/h1]
Oh boy, where do I start! This game is so good. First part Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare was stunning, second part is AMAZING! Firstly you get to play with Private Ramirez in Sergeant's Foly's sqad but trough the missions you can also find yourself playing as Roach under Soap's command. In one mission you can even play as Soap himself! Game has to offer plenty of interesting and rather dangerous missions. It has 3 Act's and each Act has 5 to 6 missions or less. But do not play it on Recruit or Regular. Missions will be boring in that way. You will just kill enemies, rush trough the mission and write a negative review of the game saying that it was short. That's not the point. If you really want to experience this game you should play on Veteran or Hardened. Make sure to pay attention to details. Developers really did a great job with graphics. What else this game has to offer is the question you are asking yourself. Well don't forget about Spec Ops feature! Spec Ops is a new game mode that allows you to play with you friend or alone if you like. Similiar to Singleplayer in Spec Ops you do not have Act's. In Spec Ops instead of Act's you have Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta ops and in each Op you have missions. In Spec Ops mission you can get maximum 3 stars. If you want to earn 3 stars in all mission you will have to play on Veteran. While playing you will also notice new weapons. Some weapons have been improved and some are brand new. All in all Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is one of those game's that you must have if you are FPS type of gamer! 

[h1]Pro's:[/h1]
[b]+Game has to offer plenty of missions.
+New weapons.
+New game mode.
+Good in game mechanichs.

11085,L‚ô•ve this game !!
11086,The Best Call of Duty.. Damn I miss This Game
11087,"Ah, the moment CoD went downhill. After a very good CoD4 it came out this. They ditched the dedicated servers and mod support which completly killed what was good in CoD. They started forcing DLC's and more and more kill streaks, perks and other stuff to make it as casual and easy to play as possbile. What was once great in CoD was completly showed away in MW2 and made only worse with tittles after it.

SP is still playable and ok to relax, but that's with all CoD games.

MW2 was the last game i've ever payed full price and the only game i regret buying to this day."
11088,"It's an okay single player game but the multiplayer is totally hacked.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXsUJg8ZHMc"
11089,"Story was great, and it lines up perfectly with MW1. The team did their research on EMPs and stuff.

However, it would be better if there was a bonus mission (like in MW1: the Mile High Club) instead of that museum of living artifacts."
11090,"This is the last good Call of Duty game. Even discluding the multiplayer, the campaign is probably one of the best experiences I've ever had. Nothing put me more into the action then Sgt. Foley screaming at me to do stuff. Quality game."
11091,fun
11092,"pretty good,sad we'll never get another cod game that's as good as the mw or black ops series"
11093,cancer pos got vacced for no reason
11094,will get them next time!
11095,I would name Modern Warfare 2 as one of the best COD games out there. It has the smoothest gameplay and a engaging story with a nice plot twist. I definitiely recommend this game!
11096,The best game under the Modern Warfare flag. Absolutely love it.
11097,I cant join any servers every single game it says unable to join dont waste your $20 on this bs game
11098,dope asf
11099,great game!
11100,good
11101,"Yeah it's really fun but there are some occasional hackers and modded lobbies here and there which can be annoying, but overall it's a really fun game.  üëç"
11102,kokot
11103,back in 2003 infinty ward realesed a brand new game and it was call of duty
11104,"Great game! Just a great all around war story. 
All the different modes & weapons make for a enjoyable experience."
11105,"I bought the game recently (about a week ago and absolutely love it). I had this on the 360 when it came out and since moving to PC found it at a good price of ¬£7.99 (not sure what that is in dollars) on CDkeys. I remebered why everyone including myself loved this game. Its an absolute classic. Singleplayer has a great story and can been very challenging on the higher difficulties. The multiplayer is amazing and still has a lot of people playing depsite the game being about 8 years old. Of course there are some problems with the multiplayer that I will now talk about:

‚Ä¢ There are some weapons and perks in the game that make it very imbalanced at times (UMP 45 silenced, commando, one man army and grenade launchers A.K.A the noobtube)
‚Ä¢ Although you're bound to find them in most games, there are hackers and in this game they are much more common and ruin games completely
‚Ä¢ You'll find probably every few matches that the host has just absolute trash connection and the game just lags too much (not a huge deal really if you know how the quit button works but can be annoying)
‚Ä¢Dropshotting. Now a lot of people probably dont't mind but i find this to be the most Bullsh*t way of getting killed and I find just ruins fights completely

I mean they're the big negatives (that I find in the game) and there are many great things that outweigh these things. I would certainly recomend this game to anyone if it is going cheap. 

9/10 one of the good installments in the golden era of call of duty

EDIT:
Right evreything is great like I said but man lose ends on veteran can f**k right off. Possibly the most BS mission with dumb checkpoints and is just ridiculous"
11106,very good video game never gets old :)
11107,best campaign of any cod game
11108,This game is very good and awesome the rating should be 4.5 stars cause not that good well worth it on sale!
11109,"servers are dead, dont waste your money"
11110,"""The Russians ain't gonna let this massacre go unanswered, its gonna get bloody.""
- The worlds most british man.

RAMIREZ! DO EVERYTHING!"
11111,"A good game riddled with hackers and modders. 

It's sad that people feel the need to mod lobbies and then kick you if you're playing well. 
Almost every lobby I play in where I get high killstreaks I ""lose connection"" to the lobby.

I cannot recommend this game because of the playerbase and the people that have decided to ruin the fun for everyone else."
11112,Game Of The Year
11113,Sometimes all we need is a bit of Michael Bay in our video games.
11114,can you get a headshot with a predator missle?
11115,"Reminds me when I was a teenager back in the early 2000's gaming with my buddy at his house where his dad used to buy us Four Lokos, MDs 20/20 and we would just chill all night kicking ass and my buddy would rage and smack kids offline good times back then for sure for sure. I'm glad I finally got it for PC."
11116,"BEST GAME I PLAYED IN A LONG TIME
"
11117,"Multiplayer is full of 80 year old virgins who like noobtubing, hacking, camping, and running around with a knife acting like their the shit. TDM comes down to A: who has the better hacks B: who has the better camping spot.
Only have 10 hours in campaign but i have 40 hours in multiplayer"
11118,"The game is really good, I just don't fell good playing, because it hasn't a support to controllers and I am terriblee playing with mouse and keyboard, but it is very reccomended for who don't have this problem"
11119,i can only say it is best game in call of duty games :D
11120,good game
11121,Yes
11122,I mean if this is your first time encountering this game on any platform I would formally like to apologize for the lack of joy in your life.
11123,Game is very fun but campers and stupid noob tubes are noobs they need to die but still game is fun :)  i think best cod ever
11124,Rapest
11125,"The servers is down, not recommended"
11126,call of duty is the stupidest fucking game ive ever played lol. my gaming laptop cant even run it and there are no servers for rich people such as myself. also is it too much to ask for some good wine around here xddddddddddddddddddddhjhsd√ºsivus+epogi+jgbj+djgsoigs+idb+fgh√ºeraihe+fihsd√ºvs√ºovse+√ºeq√º+a√ü¬¥√º#√º1e+d
11127,The best cod ever :)
11128,"Quick scope, hackers and whiners with no social skills.. luvly.. spent 100 hours with it"
11129,HAX
11130,Needs more Model 1887
11131,best cod game ever made
11132,HHHMMMMMMMMMM NAAAA
11133,"its fun 
awesome campain
etc"
11134,"Call of duty modern warfare 2, is like going out with a girlfriend for a second. Nostalgia will run through your veins as if it was blood, but after the while, your eyes will open again to blemishes that made you break up with her, in the first place. You know she is not worth the money you spend on her and you know she is not good for you, but you still crave to find that hit that made you love her in the first place. 

Overall, Call of duty modern warfare 2 is a fun game that you should plainly buy for the nostalgia but isn't worth 19.99 you can do what I did a buy it for 7.99 on cd keys."
11135,nice
11136, Needs zombie mode!
11137,"a big fuckfest
Gameplay - 8
story - 7
music - 6
graphics - 7
multiplayer - 8
price - salllle

7 out of 10"
11138,"This is the best Call of Duty ever made!

The campaing is perfect with its action packed missions and awesome story. The soundtrack is a masterpiece composed by the legend himself: Hans Zimmer. The characters are awesome with Captain Price, Soap, Makarov and Ghost. Still today this has one of the biggest plot twist in a video game history.

Multiplayer is extremely fun because how unbalanced the game is with its Akimbo G18, Danger Close One man army Noobtubes, Akimbo Shotguns and the unholy Commando perk. This has the best Emblems and Titles in any cod and this has the best weapons like the ACR, Vector, TAR-21, UMP-45, AUG HBAR and RPD. And this has one of the best maps in cod series like Terminal, Rust, Highrise, Favela, Underpass, Scrapyard and Invasion. But always gotta love the Commando, Stopping power and Marathon ;)

Special Ops is really awesome too, but its lacking zombies and survival :((
This cod has the best Special Ops missions to this day because how fun they are. 

Please Infinity Ward, PLEASE remaster this


But the real reason this is the best cod ever is the infamous 022 

11/10"
11139,"Used to be good, but it's practically impossible to find a proper host for lobbies, which makes the game unplayable."
11140,"I beat this game on Veteran and it felt extremely rewarding!

My first CoD game is as good as ever."
11141,A very nice game even in modern days. The campaign was just awesome and the multiplayer really makes you have a go at trying your best. A lot of skill is required with both single player and multiplayer as veteran is hard as hell. (As always.) The multiplayer I did find frustrating as the enemies did kind of blend in with the environment and you can't really see them in windows with shadows. I don't know if that is just me or not but it usually gets me killed. A side from that graphics are good and all in all really great game in the cod series.
11142,"COD is a awesome game.

Only dislike is the hackers spoiling it!"
11143,"this game has amazing optimization, trust me. i can play at over 80 fps on my fucking officelaptop


gg"
11144,Love the game. Honestly. But not so much when I join TDM and it sends me to Domination on Rust with people modding because thats literally the only lobby in the world since its now impossible to open your Nat type because its 2017. 10/10 would buy a possible remaster.
11145,would be better if it had controller support
11146,the BEST shooter forever :P
11147,Good story and fun Coop. Remastered story was also pretty fun to re-experience.
11148,"The thing about MW2 that really gets on my nerves about First Person Shooters, is that it doesn't make you feel like you're in war. One guy can take out about 80 other guys to sum it up. But what I like about the Modern Warfare franchise, is that it's more character driven than any other COD titles. The gameplay is fun, and from what I've seen, there are no glitches or any lag. Overall a good game."
11149,"A great Call of Duty game. The capaign is short, and I wish it would be longer, because many of the missions are just so fun, and the story is great. I would reccomend this as one of the best COD games I've played."
11150,Boring
11151,"This games is super FUN!!!!. ...TO ppl who want to play COD must try playing this one.,,
This is the best old school cod u will fine/play!!!"
11152,cool
11153,Old and broken
11154,pica pra carvalho men kaka
11155,"It's the same old Modern Warfare 2 that it's been for years. Most of the people you come into contact with are friendly. However, there are lots of hackers out there who cheat the game with aim bots and wall mods and all kinds of stuff. Be ready to experience that along with lots of people complaining about it. One of the most annoying things that ever happens is when someone force hosts the game and then kicks you out when you're kicking their butt."
11156,Have many good memories on this game//definatly worth buying for the campaign
11157,Okay.............
11158,"An awesome continuation of the campaign.  The ending....oh man, the ending was great!"
11159,succ peepee
11160,"very epic game, only recommended if your an elite gamer!!"
11161,this game sucks dont play
11162,Best cod game ever made but subhuman cheating loser fucks have completely infested multiplayer and ruined it. Also there's literally a vulnerability where people can get access into your PC google it if you don't believe me it's called RAT or RCE. Google mw2 RAT or RCE exploit. Steam literally should not be allowing games with exploits like that to exist on their platform until they are fixed. Wtf. We know cod devs don't give af about their old games but steam should at least care about their users.
11163,"I liked the game, but i played through it on xbox 360 and PS3. I just want to refund the game now but i cant because of steams crap idea of a within 14 day refund policy"
11164,MW2 is just like any other game... accept it has my heart with the Intervention it beats ballista and DSR-50 it also has a heart beat sencer idk what it does but it looks cool when you trickshot with it :)
11165,Classic :)
11166,"One of my favorite FPS games.

I fully recommend this game! 

Good Storyline,good optimization,good graphics + The Specs Ops.

Multiplayer mod has many cheaters but its fun with them right ? ;)"
11167,"Got this game for free, Want my free back."
11168,"Great game, just as I remember it from when It first came out. Stick to the Single player only and play for the campaign as even without playing it, it will be infested with hackers and modders.

Otherwise great blast from the past, wouldn't buy full price so wait till a sale roles around or buy a key from a trusted marketplace."
11169,"very hard to go atleast 2 games without a hacker, or atleast hope they are on you team so you are not getting shot through a wall they magically knew you were behind and so on... please only buy if campaign is your concern and listen to the reviews.. i was dumb not to.. RIP COD MW2.... F You hacker scums... cancerous fuuuuvcks"
11170,"The classic Modern Warfare 2 is still a must. In 2017 however the online community is quite small, it rarely breaks 1000 people at a time. Some people hack but its not as common as you might think. If you used to like this game you should definetly buy it, its a blast of nostalgia. 10/10"
11171,mw2 + dedicated servers on steam..better imho
11172,good
11173,"This game has one BIG MINUS: if you use g18,tube(also hacks and etc.) or just strong player there is a chance to be kicked. There are so much noobs and low skill players who always will try to kick you 'coz you are too good for them.Basically game is really good,best part of CoD."
11174,lovely game <3
11175,reminds me of the good old days <3
11176,good game
11177,Still one of the best Call of Duty games out there
11178,"Ive had so much fun with this game if it were multiplayer 1v1s or the AMAZING campain, Its all around great and original. The graphics are a bit old but graphics dont matter to me still an amazing and solid game. The one thing i disliked was i found a hacker and he maxed prestiged me so i deleted some files and restarted but thats the only hacker ife seen in a year so its not bad. All and all this game is just classic and amazing."
11179,if god has been good to you type amen

11194,Nice game
11195,"good story, online is done for"
11196,"Well, where do I begin. This was one of my favorite games that I ever owned a few years ago on my Xbox 360. I decided to relive those childhood memories and pick this game up for my custom built PC. 

Wow. I totally forgot how amazing the storyline is in this game. Not only was I fully engaged throughout the whole thing, but it also ties in the storyline from the original Modern Warfare. 

I also probably spent the most time with the multiplayer while owning this game on the Xbox, and I have definitely relived those nostalgic memories after playing this game again. If you have never owned this game, or have been thinking about buying it for a PC, I would highly recommend it. 

Excellent graphics, excellent storyline, and an excellent multiplayer leads to an excellent game. One of my favorites in the whole Call of Duty series even 8 years later."
11197,Fun story. If you can't tell i'm a pro reviewer.
11198,this message to steam WHY THE GAME IS SO EXPENSIVE AND ITS TOO OLD 2009 AND THE SAME TO MW3 40DOLLARS OR MORE AND 2011 THERES SOME PEOPLES WANT TO BUY IT LIKE ME AND OTHERS SO PLS MAKE MW3 ABOUT 8DOLLARS OR SOMETHING AND MW2 ABOUT 6DOLLARS SO PEOPLES WILL COME ALOT AND WILL BE HAPPYFUL BECAUSE OF YOU OR PEOPLES NOT GONNA BUY CODS OR PLAY ANYMORE ! / the game very good you should buy but not on steam G2A better or when steam will do what i said make it 6dollars will be very good price
11199,This game is good for new players..but beware with the hackers
11200,Ive played it for a little bit. Its okay but would defiantly not put thousand of hours to it.
11201,"One of the best mulitiplayer FPS of all time.  It is flawed, and there are hackers, but it runs better on PC than any COD since.  This is a hall of fame game for me."
11202,"The campaign is decent, it's everything one would expect from a Call of Duty campaign. The multiplayer isn't dead yet, so you could play that if you're willing to fight people who haven't stopped playing since day 1. The special ops mode is still a lot of fun to play with a friend. Overall, it's worth the $20 dollars if you can get a friend to buy it with you."

11232,"MW2 is a complete package when it comes to gaming. The campaign is wonderful, the spec ops are fantastic, and the online multiplayer is brilliant and engaging. I was amazed at how alive the online multiplayer was after 8 years. I have never had troble finding a game! I was also suprised how few modded lobbies there are. About 95% of the online lobbies haven't had hackers in them! For an 8 year old game, that is fantastic. I couldn't recommend this game high enough, even in 2017. I think this multiplayer experience is tough to beat. IT IS SO GOOD!!! 

On a side note: why do the DLCs still cost $15 each.That was their release price, and that is RIDICULOUS. They honestly should be free (Like COD WaW) since it is so old."
11233,yes.
11234,"Got Vaced on it, but still enjoy it"
11235,"Singelplayer: Rip everyone
Special ops: :)
Multiplayer: Fun but there's a lot of hackers and  cant get my nuke :<"
11236,"its so broken, not even bob the builder can fix it"
11237,"So... i know I'm a little late with this review and that pretty much everyone is on the Activision is evil train. But despite everyone saying MW was the last good COD game is in my opinion wrong, MW2 was still a pretty fun game in it's time... The Singleplayer story was awesome(as to expect from pretty much every COD singleplayer campaign) and the Multiplayer had a lot of fun stuff and variety for you to spend hours upon hours on it. But there is a down side to it too. The introduction of the new type of servers mayde so it was hard to keep cheaters at bay, which in turn ruined a lot of games and support for this game was pretty low.

8/10"
11238,awesome game
11239,best purchase ever but i got it from G2A.com cause it was like $10 cheaper but other than that its amazing ive missed this game so much. very pleased to be able to play with all these other players as well! see you out there guys!

11246,"second iteration in a series, what to say besides it follows in its  1st one footsteps, 

i think cod are simple MP experience that everrybody can jump into, with simple controls, but for me it is foremost a great campaign experience, the single players stories in CODS, must now cost a fortune, as it ressemble a movie now...

COD = interactive movie : gameplay that supports a story
older games = GAMES! : stories that supports gameplay..

11256,"Super fun game, but noobtubing and a lot of hackers ruin it."
11257,"This was the last CoD game I really cared a lot about. I played the single player quite a bit, going after achievements and enjoying the locations, played oodles and oodles of hours in the co-op, trying to get the best rankings I could on those fun little missions, and thought the weapons were grand. The storyline was engaging and exciting, and though the single player campaign was pretty short, I did like it and it was pretty memorable.

The multiplayer is similar to CoD4's, and it seemed alright, though I didn't play much of it as competitive gameplay rarely appeals to me.

I haven't had much interest in CoD as a series after playing MW3. I know I completed the first Black Ops, and I completed MW3, but neither of them really enthralled me, and I lost touch with the series. I might revisit it someday, but MW2 is good stuff, and I do recommend it if you like first person shooters and challenging online two-player co-op missions separate from the single player, that may take a fair number of tries for you and a friend to pull off."
11258,Great game
11259,good
11260,Tubes 4 lyf
11261,"The singleplayer is great, really loved the story. The multiplayer on the other hand is not what it used to be. There are more and more cheaters every day and joining a clean lobby has become a rarity. Too bad the developers or people from Steam won't develop an anti-cheat system which would get rid of such players, but then again, people at Valve only care about money.

I wouldn't recommend this game if you're a fair player (no camping, rocket launchers etc.), but I would recommend it if you really suck so bad at other games and want to be a hotshot with cheats."

11275,"I played MW and MW2 back to back...so some of the missions are kind of a blur. The mission with Ghost and Roach downloading intel at a safe house in the mountains was a bit difficult for me. I got caught in an area between stairs and doorway that would literally get me killed multiple times before I was able to catch a break, then ultimately die somewhere else haha. After that though, it was smooth sailing. That was the only area that I really had any issues moving about in, and that could be due to my lack of experience with PC gaming. Still quite new at it. Overall, fun game and triliogy that I would recommend others to play."
11276,Throwback from when consoles ruled!
11277,"NO dedicated servers, complete fail and now the online is dead, good luck finding a match"
11278,Better on console not as much on pc.
11279,"So far great graphics. However, in single player in the campaign, every mission I need to use ""4"" either laser pointer or guided missiles it doesn't work. I need to close the game and restart the mission, it's really annoying"
11280,Cant kill Shephard no matter how often I press F to throw the knife
11281,"Classic favorite with great detail and action packed campaign, have bought this game 3 times (console and 2 steam accounts)

Multiplayer was fun in the past years but as of now its pretty lame. VAC is seriously having some mentally challenged team members or a very flawed system as innocent people like myself have been banned while playing multiplayer. I unwillingly joined a hacked lobby while playing regular match making that changed my ranks around and boosted me up to 2nd prestige level 70. 

I attempted to contact steam support about this but was told ""Steam does not support this game, contact the publisher."" I went to activision and what do you know, does not support  this game either. 2 days later I logged into steam and was told I was vac banned. funny thing is, that probably wasn't even the reason I was banned. Your rank isn't even saved on a server, its just some hex files that can be tinkered with to change your rank to anything you want as long as you know hex. I changed the fov, like you can do in nearly any pc game and fov or third person hasn't been considered or marked as a cheat flag in gaming console cvar lists. As it's been said many times mw2 was a console to pc port so the fov was set for people sitting a distance away from a tv, not close to a computer screen like we are. all those cvar lists are free to the public, I visit the left 4 dead 2 cvar list almost every single day because Im always having new ideas to tinker with on a left 4 dead 2 server I run that has 8 v 8 survivors and infected. 

but apparently VAC thinks its permanently ban-nable for changing the fov after I did some research online. MW2 is infested with lobby hackers, cheaters and people managing to use nukes when they don't even have 25/24 kills ( I've seen someone with 12 kills call a nuke) players who if you shoot them your bullets reflect and kill yourself and people who hack into lobbies to do ""Boost lobbies"" or change around whatever settings/maps or etc they want. join matchmaking in team death match - end up in a hacked domination lobby with disabled perks. VAC has pretty much said they support hackers since nothing has been done about them, there's tons of free VAC bypasses on the net, I looked them up and guess what the bypasses do? ""Force the VAC banned client to be host because a host can't be kicked, both banned and regular players will be able to join said lobby in regular matchmaking"" VAC needs to either stay the fuck out of call of duty and leave us all alone or fix their system. I honestly don't care about ranks, all they do are unlock some weapons and titles. rank has nothing on player skill so why does it matter if anyone changes it? if their not god moding, unfair nukes, or aimbotting why does it matter?  fov just makes the game look better, allows you to see clearer without guns being held 1 centimeter from your face and helps you not feel like a pair of bulky floating arms. VAC even says ""Go buy the game on another steam account"" I've been banned so I can just blow some pocket change on another account, ""cheat"" again and not do what I was banned for here so I can get away with whatever im doing. Sounds great VAC sounds great. Or they can do the damn job their paid for and actually find a working way to ban real offenders who are ruining whats left of the community. knowing VAC their just going to sit back and act like nothing happened, so we need to get the peoples voice heard here, we need a petition to get some changes in VAC cause this bullshit isn't working"
11282,"COD is just not meant for PC, the game is very fast paced that right when you spawn, you are dead, its just bad, don't buy this game for PC. Get another game, like Insurgency or even Arma or Squad, Battlefield also works, but COD is just not meant for PC. It's just not fun, trust me, this is not a realistic style shooter, its more so a violent bloodbath and its made for Console, not for PC."
11283,I LIKE DES
11284,"This game has me nostalgic about my childhood, i could come back to this game in 20 years and still love it to death. The multiplayer progression is just so good and addictive. The storyline is put together so well."
11285,Best game
11286,"Miss this game, loved how it was unbalanced and all the glitches you could do.
(getting out of maps, like Karachi).

11287,yeS
11288,Immersive multiplayer experience that can provide you with tons of hours of fun! Good mechanics and weapon balance.
11289,nostalgia
11290,"Campaign is as classic as it gets. Feels like you're playing through an awesome action movie. Did not really play the multiplayer since I got it now, but I have fond memories of it back in the day on the 360. Definitely not worth it at full price though and even 50% off I'm not sure."
11291,"Best Call of Duty of All time, MW3 too. Nostalgia at its finest! If you played this before when you was a child then get it again now!"
11292,i am vac banned and i can still play
11293,awsome
11294,"NO one plays this.

11295,"In my opinion this game needs better community and more weapons.I have played it almost 200 hours.the game isn't actually that bad.but I bought this game for the following weapons:models 1887 akimbo,Intervention,Barrett 50.cal and the ACR.so far I haven't run in a glitch.I especially love trickshotting on this game.the maps were fantastic.especially the following maps:5.scrapyard 4.terminal 3.favela 2.Rust 1.highrise.the graphics are very good.my rating for this game out of 10 is:Gameplay 10,singleplayer 10,multiplayer 10,spec ops 9,weapon armory 10 and maps 10.my rating for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is 20/10 best call of duty ever."

COD 4 has more of a community."
11307,good multiplayer game
11308,"Best CoD ever in my opinion, multiplayer is not really dead, there are still a lot of players. There are a couple hackers here and there, wallhacks and aimbotters but pretty rare, I recommend this game because it's my favorite CoD, lol."
11309,"I started playing this about a week after it came out on Xbox 360. It was my favorite game for a few years after that and I've always loved it. I bought it years ago here on Steam but hadn't played it much again until recently. I do not own any DLC as owning DLC limits your player pool for matches; but my experience has been amazing once again. I do not have trouble finding matches, and I've been having more fun than ever playing. 

I will always recommend this Call of Duty because of it's multiplayer format. This is an Arcade style FPS but modes like Search and Destroy do have more tactical aspects to them. Multiplayer has many different playstyles available and in my opinion this is the greatest Call of Duty multiplayer experience available. 10/10 multiplayer."
11310,"One of the best COD, no jump-$H!T here!"

So please message me my money on paypal I need to pay for my premium account on TheHub please refund me my money it is a terrible game on PC let me have my money i dont like the lage and nobody will like this game and its not worth $20 it should be free please refund me. This message should be #1 on top trending. This is the longest thing ever not including my penis Please refund me on my MW2 game that i purchased and i want my money back so i can afford premium.

11315,Really great game! Love the co-op part! Almost a classic.
11316,"Still after too many new cods, mw 2 is one of the best , both in story and multi"
11317,"So i have played alot of Call of Duty when i was younger on console and i thought it would be a cool idea to pick this game up to play some MP and have some fun.. But to be honest..after only playing the multiplayer for like 2hrs i can already say that its a total shitfest of noobtubers, campers and the oh so infamous lag. I've not really seen any hackers so far but i just cant recommend the muliplayer for PC, on console its in my opinion much better. Though i must say the singleplayer and spec ops are fine like they have always been, the story is pretty good imo. Anyway if i ever want to play a CoD title for the multiplayer again i think ill just pick it up on console since it's alot more chill and fun (and the game isnt dead on there).

All in all i can still recommend this game, just not for the online experience."

11323,Visual fidelity of the game is very high. Gameplay mechanics are great and storyline is easier to follow compared to COD 4.
11324,"My favorite of the Call of duty Franchise. Played so many hours of the spec ops mode with my buddies on our xboxs into the wee hours of the morning when I was younger. The campaign is the best of the MW story arch, and [spoiler] once the Russians invade the US, sheit gets real.[/spoiler] It aged alright but im holding out hope for a remaster, for old times sake."

11329,"I have played the online part of this game for 530 hours.

Recently installed this after leaving it dormant for many years. I wanted something fast and accessible, but smaller than Battlefield and less intricate than Squad.
This is the best CoD for me, because it has what made Cod4 great, and expanding on it, with some of the best maps in the series. True, digital crack when it was released, and the graphics and gameplay still holds up, not being too gimmicky but using some goody ideas.

Matchmaking in this isn't great, but in 2017, it seems like the ones left playing have decent connection, so it works just fine.

Only thing missing is a ""Search all game modes"" option (to scan for the few players still playing) and a classic style AKM."
11330,10/10 you should get this game. The single player story is great but i would hold offon the multiplayer until a remasterd comes out. This is by far my fav game in the series and you should get it. And remember....no Russian
11331,"As it says in the title, this game is part of the Modern Warfare series. So, the game is realistic to some extent with the storyline sitauted around a war which is happening now. The game is basically self explanatory so it's up to you whether its good or not. 9/10, I think its a nice game."
11332,"Acr's, Noob tubes, one man army, commando, AC130 ABOVE and TaCtIcAl nUkE's

It is still a true MASTERPIECE!"
11333,"Its the best call of duty out there , the community its kinda dead after all these years but still a  nice game overall."
11334,"Modern Warfare 2 Review 
Disclaimer: Multiplayer has its own platform therefore I will review that else where. Also I havent done special ops yet so I will update this.

Campaign (No spoilers)
Pros:
*Interesting story that will make you want 3 (I have 1 and 3 on my friends console)
*Lovable characters.
*Challenging missions (Veteran)
*Runs high FPS (for me)
*Cliffhanger and other stealth missions are fantastic. Mostly Cliffhanger with the new concept of -Heart beat detector      -driving and -climbing

Cons: 
*Intel has no purpose except 100%
*On Veteran near the end of Loose Ends (act 3) the mortars are a pain in the ass and your teammate doesnt really help with the crowd of enemies in front and some flankers in behind
*When Riot Shield isnt used it doesnt block the area of your body where it is placed (most likely the back)
*Last mission it is very luck based if your teammate hits the enemies or not.
*The enemy of my enemy on Veteran is EXTREMELY difficult noting that enemies will target you and drop what ever they are doing if you are in the open.
*You always seem to be the target of the enemies instead of your army.
*Takedown is pain. It is horrible.
*The only easy day was yesterday is.... easy
*Quotes get repeatitive and annoying.

Special Ops: 

SOON

Overall: 

SOON"

11343,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a game that truly lives up to the title of ""Game of the year"". It carries itself with the style and swagger of a blockbuster action movie, it remains fully commited to making the player feel exhilarated and satisfied every step of the way, and not once, not ever, does it ever slow down. It's one of the most superbly games ever developed, and is packed full of content and awe-inspiring gameplay that only somebody with standards higher than human comprehension could feel cheated.

If the campaign's story was shaped better and more sensible, and if the online Perks were just a tiny bit more balanced, this would be a near-perfect game, no shadow of a doubt. As it stands, however, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is an utterly stellar achievement that knows exactly what its audience wants, and delivers in abundance. Truly, this is the biggest game of 2009."
11344,the campaign is F#CKING great but the MULTIPLAYER IS BROKEN AND IS SH#T

11347,"get back to the last good Cod game 
"
11348,"This is one of my favorite cods back in the day, and it still is... kind of, playing multiplayer tainted my memories of this game soo much i feel like something is wrong, but yeah, campaign is amazing and a great follow up to call of duty 4: modern warfare 1, special ops is awesome too, but unless you got some friends, good luck playing it co-op as there is no matchmaking for it, and there is multiplayer, as i said, i have huge memories playing it back in the day, but now, the amount of pros on the game tainted my memories soo badly that i cant enjoy it as much as i did in the past few years, theres soo many level 70 and max prestige players on the game that it can be a nightmare, and to make it worse, they are the only players on the game, this is also the first cod to have matchmaking instead of the classic server browser that the old cods on pc have, and the first in the series to have custom killstreaks, (no, i do not mean put attachments on killstreaks.) cod 4 mw1 and cod 5 waw only had 3 killstreaks, and you were stuck with those killstreaks, cod 6 mw2 had 15 killstreaks, and when you reach level 10, you can choose which set of killstreaks you want before you go into another match, (3 killstreaks) other than the nightmarish playerbase, and the lack of players, its a good game, multiplayer is the most unbalanced in the series, because of one man army grenade launchers, but it is still fun to play, also, the 2 map packs include some cod 4 maps if you are feeling nostalgic, not all of them, but i thought i point that out."
11349,"One of the best games ever made. Don't be fooled by my hours played... I have 33+ days  and 125 000 kills on the xbox version. 

You might want to avoid buying DLC on PC version though as you wont find any games."
11350,"Amazing game. Loved it since I got it. Singleplayer story is a decent entry to the Modern Warfare series, though a bit clich√© at certain points. About the multiplayer, it's pretty nice, if you ignore the screaming kids shouting you out for camping if you stay in the same building for 2 minutes. Singleplayer: 8/10, Multiplayer 6/10."

If you want a great gaming experience thats fast paced and fun... this is the game for you. If you want a game with a great story and compelling charecters... This is the game for you. And if you want  a game with great multiplayer and plenty of replayablity... this is the game for you."

11360,"Before you get mad for me saying to not recommending this game before I say anything THIS GAME IS AMAZING 

If you're just coming here for the Story than buy this or the MW2 story mode remaster but if you're here to play the multiplayer don't. There is a free MW2 game called Iw4x and it fixes all of the problems of MW2 and adds lots of new feature. You can get this for free and its very easy to set this up. If you already own MW2 on PC then you can also get IW4x on it. 

Just get Iw4x lol"

I HATE USING A MOUSE AND I THINK THAT ITS REALLY SHITTY OF STEAM TO PULL THAT. ""Oh you're trying to experiance child hood euphoria? TOO FUCKING BAD U NEED TO SPEND $50 OR ELSE USE A MOUSE AND KEYBOARD."" God damn!  Thats the one problem I have with this.

11385,"Back when cod games had a sparking shine of quality.
This is how you do a sequel, you take what worked in the original, improve it and fix those annoying little things that plagued the first one.

The Campaing is amazing, the story makes sense (well compared to every cod game they made since black ops 2).
But not only that but every level is unique in it's own way, you will be fighting isis in a school and then you will be placed in a stealth mission on a snowy base, so you can just massacre inocent people in the next mission.

Not only that but because every level is so different to any other, it makes things look fresh and actually wanna make play the game (i'm looking at you cod ghosts).

And the characters are good?? what?? they made a cod game with good characters and good villans?? what is this?

The Multiplayer is among the series best, no supply drops, no stupid micro-transactions or shitty maps (ok, maybe 1 or 2)
you get 16 maps, (compare that to Inifinite warfare and it's 11 maps).
They are cheaters? yes, they are, but not as many as people say, i have encountered 3 or 4 in my first hour of gameplay.

The Special ops are a very nice addition, at first they are easy, but then they became twistedly hard and fucking insane, if you really want to test your ability then you will have a great time.

And for 9.99 on sale is just a steal, seriously it has WAAY to much content compared to newer cods, if you want to start playing cod, or you have never played any game of the series, start with mw2, it's the series best cod so far.

[u][h1]Detailed Review[/h1][/u]

First COD that I ever finished on Veteran! This game was a hell of a adventure, it's one of the best Call of Duty's that I ever played, don't found a unique bug, glitch, etc... After all this years still have a active multiplayer and have a extremely good campaign, what I could ask more? More.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 it's a great game, the single-player it's extremely interesting, however you will definitely end him fast, cuz the campaign isn't biggest one. However litlelary looks like a action film where Stalon or Schwarzenegger happears, all the environment that the game creates, almost passing to you that the end of the world is coming, is kind of cool and makes you feel better the experience that the game probably wants make you feel, however like I said, the campaign isn't really big, and you can easily end her between 6 to 8 hours without any problems, of course that depends in what difficulty you choose to play. I have around 17h and I started a camapaing on regular (stopped in the middle) and finished one on veteran. 
¬†
 After analyzing the camapaign, we can easily see that this CoD focus a loot the multiplayer, that's without any question really good, however in this moment, as waited with some cheaters. The multiplayer experience that Modern Warfare give to the players, it's definitely one of the bests, you can be playing for hours and hours and still don't get bored and if you get bored, you can just call a friend and go play the Spec Ops in co-op that will make you still play some kind of story, however with a friend in your side. The unique problem that I have to appoint that in the end, I can understand and don't critic, it's the unbalanced matchmaking, I was just a lvl 10 playing with lvl max with prestige on max, sooo can be hard for someone that don't have experience with FPS games. 

 The graphics of MW2 are good, however in the audio/visual area what really it's out of the box are the cutsceans, they are amazing, the music it's intense, make us feels every single second, and when we put the animations, uhhhh its brilliant. Like I said when I was talking about the single-player campaign, the game give us a extraordinary experience, and when we add this music and this cutsceans, I will say again, it's like a really good action movie. 

 This COD, for me, was definitely one of the most fun, like I said the multiplayer is really good, and don't really makes u become bored after playing hours and hours, and when we add the single-player campaign that's intense, the minimum of time that I belive that a COD fan will play this game is 30h, in a row. 

 In the end, MW2 give to the players a small and good campaign, with a lot of intense moments and a extremely good multiplayer, that gives one of the best experiences of all times.

11391,1v1 me on Rust bruh
11392,One of the best in the franchise and one of the last good ones! An absolute masterpice with an amazing storyline and very addicting multiplayer of its time. It's a very worthwhile game for every true CoD fan!
11393,Old but gold!
11394,"This is the game that famously created a huge controversy back in 2009. In the 4th Level, ""No Russian"", the player has the option to shoot innocent bystanders with no in-game penalty. Understandably, this created a huge protest among the police and the general public. But I feel that because of this controversial level, the developers were able to rise into instant fame and the game broke a couple of sales record back in 2009.

Setting this aside, this has to be one of the best Call of Duty games ever created by the developers. The graphics looks great even in 2017 and the gameplay is superb. Highly recommended for all FPS fans."
11395,The only good COD game XD
11396,"Nice old,classic game"
11397,Da para passar o tempo ^^
11398,good old game . done right at its time. great 1st person shotter
11399,nice uniforms
11400,"I played this game on xbox 360 and this version doesn't let me down, The port is really well done and it runs good in my computer which is a low end pc (is a laptop) with intel hd 3000, so its pretty good, also the servers are still up sometimes laggy but they work and i can count with my hand the amount of times i encountered a Hacker, so is pretty clean and sweet game just to remember the old times! Recommended 100% if you want to play cod again or something like that."
11401,Tango Suckaaaa!!Ôªø
11402,Trains
11403,"good as i remember, campaign and multiplayer 10/10"
11404,7/10
11405,"c 00l
"
11406,awsome. i love it .... i still play this game in 2017
11407,"It is a very good game, it may note have the best graphics - considering it is an old game -. Yet it has a great selection of maps, Co-op, a Story Mode, and a voice chatting system ( even though I don't use it, I like to turn it on al listen to the little kids scream and rage when they lose/die)."
11408,Imo the only good cod game
11409,Good game
11410,Make this happen again !
11411,"F*cking remaster it already. (WITH MULTIPLAYER INCLUDED PLEASE.)

Story - 10/10
Multiplayer - 9/10"
11412,One of my favorite Call of Duty games. :)
11413,Trickshot simulator 11/10.
11414,"I'm gonna start off things by saying this is a good game to get; however, the only good part for me, at least if the campaign. The Special Ops mode was kind of pointless and overall, it wasn't that fun. The Mulitplayer has erally good gameplay, but, when I go into a TDM game, it sometimes is a hacked lobby. What I mean is that instead of TDM, there could be domination or demolition. Also, the people who play the game are complete assholes. Now, I'm not saying that everyone is, but I'm saying that most people are. They will sit in a corner with a claymore planted at each entrance of a building while aiming down the sight waiting for you to come, or for you to get blown up by the claymore. Also, there are a lot of people that will be using ther Grenade Launcer attachment on their gun, which will get very annoying if you are trying to kill people. Overall, this is a good game, but the people who play it make Modern Warfare 2 much, much worse."
11415,"Too many hackers,but i love this game....R.I.P. Favela"
11416,Its Cool Epic Story
11417,It's the pinacle of the CoD franchise.  Story is solid and multiplayer is great if you have a group of friends that will play it with you.
11418,"Can barely play the multiplayer because of strict NAT type. I play other games and have open NAT type, so it's this game's fault. Really wish I could play it without constantly getting kicked. Campaign works perfect though."
11419,"This is so much more easier and better to play on any computer that will allow you to do it, I have and Lenovo Brand Windows 10 Laptop and I have this game on Xbox 360 and Steam and I think it's just better on computer if you are used to playing any kind of fps games on a computer. I would highly recommend getting this game on your computer or laptop any day of the week üòéüëçüèΩüá∫üá∏üíª‚ù§Ô∏èüéÆ"
11420,"Activision and VAC anti cheat don‚Äôt to care for cheaters in this game! If you are buying this for the multiplayer you will have very bad time for the next reasons:

You can't choose the server, the game forces you to play automatically to a random server and sometimes you can log into a ""modded lobby"" which means that there was a cheater modifying the game values, including ""x ray"". So you think you can exit and log to another, no you will log into the same server again. It‚Äôs very frustrating.

Cheaters and non-cheaters play together! It‚Äôs very garbage how there is not a system (not even VAC anti cheat), I assume Activision only cares for its freshest products, even if this is one of the most popular versions of COD they will not give a damn, about the massive quantity of cheaters, doesn‚Äôt matter if you try hard to be skilled and play clean, as there is no system at all, to keep away the garbage.

This game is forgotten, and you will rarely have a decent match without cheaters or ""modded lobby"", it‚Äôs very frustrating, annoying and disappointing. This game is a nest for cheaters, it says it‚Äôs VAC protected, it's a lie because I have seen players with hundreds of hours since the VAC ban, this game is ruined by those cheaters And nobody cares, I don‚Äôt recommend you to buy this for the multiplayer.

However the single player is epic!

I thumbs down for its multiplayer mode, buy something else, don‚Äôt waste your money and energy, let die this game already, don't give them your money, they don't care AT ALL, get something more recent with real anti cheat protection, like overwatch or whatever."
11421,pew pew
11422,Nice game
11423,classic.
11424,"Mano, sem palavras para dizer o quanto esse jogo √© foda...melhor COD ja feito sobre guerra moderna"
11425,"(Yes i know i only have about 5 hours on this game, i speed through campaigns)
I always thought Call of Duty was a game series for children. My brother played it, i didnt have any interest in it. Untill i first played COD world at war. Great game. Then i moved over to the Modern Warfare series. I first played Modern Warfare 1, and then this. In one word, GREAT. The campaign was amazing. The whole story, the people, it really sucks you right into the game. I had a great experience playing the campaign. Never played anything like it. I am now a fan of the COD series. I will play all other warfare series games. Maybe not Infinite warfare though."

11436,real good
11437,"good game with good story for singleplay best of warfare trilogy

BUT IF youre buying this for multiplay then dont
buy newer COD games 

and i dont think i have to mention luncher, camper, etc... stuff about it"
11438,Played every aspect of the game for several hours and can honestly say i loved it to bits.
11439,All time favorite call of duty
11440,"Best game ever made 
"
11441,i love this game and i like playing these older call of duties way better than the newer ones
11442,Best siak korg kene try
11443,When i try to play multiplayer it dosent load the screen turns black and never loads can anyone help?
11444,I mean do I really have to state the obvious !
11445,When the call of duty was good
11446,:)
11447,more fun then cod ghost
11448,easy to say this is one of the best call of dutys!!
11449,"First military game i really had in my livrary, i got what i was expecting, really fun game, interesting story, fast paced Multiplayer.
As i have Arma now, i'd say it's pretty casual for military game but if you are not into such slow paced games like Arma then i really suggest COD. :D"
11450,"when i launch single player and the story intro, the game is choppy and freezes every few seconds, and will eventually crash. I'm using mac and it didnt give me a message saying it didnt support my computer so i dont really know whats going on."
11451,Cool
11452,Bad
11453,"After finishing the SP Campaign I can honestly say in terms of set pieces, action and Graphics this game gets a 10. With that said the storline really is a major let down with it jumping from one scenerio to another with no cohesive logic and a very confusing story. Infinity ward seems to have not put alot of effort in the story and more on the shock factor which many will agree is way overdone. Aside from that the SP Is also very short and can be completed in 6 hours. One saving grace is Spec ops mode that adds a bit of fun with mini missions thrown in much like the last epilogue airplane mission of the last game. Overall I would recommend this as a rental for anyone that only plays Single player...for those who play MP For hours its pretty much the same game with more weapons , different maps and perks where you can rain down havoc if you get kill streaks regularly."
11454,Finally played again after ~3-4 years and immediatly got hit with a grenade launcher across the map 10/10
11455,The end all of C.O.D. games.
11456,Very nice
11457,"The multiplayer of MW2 can only be discribed as the ultimate clusterfuck of videogames

-videogamedunky

but the singlepayer is nice af!"
11458,"issa good
"
11459,"Very good, very fun, I like it"
11460,Throwback of my first online FPS experience. I think that even to this day (June 2017) it holds to itself as an excellent game. I definetly recommend this game.
11461,Good game
11462,"Still a great game, I enjoy this one very much.

The campaign is bassically a cheesey action movie, pulls it off well. The multiplayer is a shitstorm of grenade spam and hackers, just how I like it. And the game mechanics are clunky and dated. Special ops is also great, it just ports the single player missions to a two player mode. Pretty fun missions.

10/10 would fuck again"
11463,Great Game (Im having Trouble With the Nat)
11464,"This Game is terrible. 10 year old game and people still camp non stop.

Hackers everywhere, hardscopers and every lobby i play the Noobtube is banned.

Absolute trash spawns aswell and overpowered killstreaks.
"
11465,Always fun to play
11466," Call of Duty:MW2 is a really a good game(I don't have DLC and never play multiplayer.But Spec ops have. play with friends).Image you are solider in the battlefield and have amazing power that can automatic heal yourself and your every shot can fuck physical law. But yup. Still a good game. Music nice, graphic nice,gameplay(campaign)is good and the stroy is nice. Yeah. Btw, fuck you shepherd

11467,yeah its good
11468,"very good
"
11469,Still fun to this day
11470,I just turned 6 years old so I'm now considered this game's target demographic.  This game is now older than a good amount of its playerbase.
11471,you can actually kill people unlike the first one
11472,Great game
11473,throwing flashbangs and noobtube simulator
11474,"The campaign is ok, but the multiplayer is broken and full of hackers. This game honestly hasn't been good since 2012."
11475,is a great game but dont get hacks or you will get a free VAC. Ban :P
11476,Great game as always
11477,This is by far the best Call of Duty series. I love this game so much. I started to play on PC and I moved into Xbox Live where trickshotting community has began in 2010. Also the best community back at the time. This is pretty much my playground and whenever I play this game I always remember my moments as a child. Such an incredible time to be alive! <3
11478,"Great story, multiplayer servers dont work tho :("
11479,"Best COD game to date! always loved this game singel-  and multiplayer.

I have played this game a total of about 1000 hours on PS3 and a other steam account."
11480,good and legendary
11481,"It's a classic, everyone needs to try it, though when I started playing in 2011 it was on the Xbox 360, now there are many hackers playing. But it's still the game it was in the good old days."
11482,the best call of duty.
11483,"Chanllenging and fun, has been upped since its release!"
11484,good
11485,One of the best games i have ever played. I mostly play multiplayer but the singleplayer characters are lovable
11486,–ø—Ä–∏–∫–æ–ª.
11487,"Classic First Person Shooter and my all time favorite game.

A good story with some semi-realistic elements

Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe have set the record for what a musical score should be for moderned  military themed stories and works of fiction, in short; Intense and memorable."
11488,;)
11489,"Brilliant game, but multiplayer is dead."
11490,"(This review only covers the Multiplayer aspect of this game)

This game is fucking horrible in almost every way.

The guns are overpowered as fuck, notably the ACR, UMP45 and FAMAS. not to mention the damn shotgun secondaries that one-shot over 50 meters.

The explosives are ridiculous. you can kill someone with one Grenade while being 10 meters away from the explosion, and thats not even counting danger close which lets you kill someone if they're anywhere near the direction you shoot in. 

We have perks like Commando, which lets you melee launch across the map, Stopping power, which allows every weapon to kill in half the time. or what about One Man Army? the perk that gives you an endless supply of all the shit I jsut mentioned.

But the hitconnection is so damn good and all the guns have such a great feel to them I can excuse all of this.
Best CoD mp experience you can probably have on PC."
11491,Spent many many hours playing this legendary game!!
11492,"What a game really.Thought the online is crap now,the story is very good and i totally encourage u to play it!"
11493,Awesome game. Activison being good.
11494,"The game can be good and in most parts it it, the campagin is great, spec ops for the people who like to mess around and multiplayer has its moments. Some games you can find a fun lobby that every ones running around and its hectic, other games have either hackers or people sitting in the same corner for the entire game. Campagin is a sold 9/10. Multiplayer tho is a 5/10. Games good for reliving memories."
11495,"Pleasently surprised to see how many people still play, and how fast you're able to get into a game. It's just like I remember it, and nothings changed; not even noob-tubing and one man army-ing. 8.79 / 10 buy it on sale."
11496,its okay i guess
11497,"Great game! I love the campaign.. Thats it, just but it already"
11498,RAMERIEZ REVIEW THIS GAME
11499,very gud multiplayer
11500,alrighty - high graphics but i suck at this game soooo
11501,"My favorite COD Game has the best storyline and i love the characters
if you get the option to buy this you'll regret it if you pass it up!"
11502,lots of fun and not very hacked. i saw the low graghics settings and then I yacked
11503,Good OS game best
11504,Good
11505,"Getting a little old, servers are dying. Still my favorite out of all the COD's.
R.I.P. MW2. Almost gone but never forgotten."
11506,this game vey amazing.. i really love it..
11507,"I got my first and only Vac ban a long time ago because I downloaded a hack trainer off the internet and used it against everyone I played with. It took Valve a week before they realized I was doing it.

MW2 was the best COD, but it's pretty much dead on PC. 

Sorry guys. I did it for laughs."
11508,always a good throwback
11509,MW2 is the best CoD I've ever played. This is the reason why I bought it again (the first time was for the ps3). But I don't understand why Infinity Ward doesn't remaster MW2 and MW3 and/or doesn't create MW4.
11510,This is amazing?!!!!
11511,"Best Game Ever, But i Got Vac Banned :)"
11512,The best COD ever made hands down. Nostalgia overload.
11513,"For anyone wondering, yes, It still is as good as you remembered it. Hell even better! 

The only thing I could fault is the lack of dedicated servers. You'll find yourself playing Team Deathmatch 99% of the time!"
11514,"Nice game i used to play this back in 14 but now i came back to it and its soo weird to have to wait 5 minutes for a lobby
"
11515,love mw2 fav cod and played it non stop on ps3 and old proxy server days on ps3 before it was patched best times damn i miss them days so much
11516,NICE GAME!
11517,"Pros:
Great story with action and plot twists
Special ops are a great addition

Cons:
Noob tubes everywhere in multiplayer"
11518,good game
11519,"Vac banned for joining a hacked lobby , very nice üëç"
11520,"One of the best Call of Duty's out there. Not too futuristic, not too ""past'y"", just right."
11521,"The singel player is rather okey, but multiplayer is unplayable due to wallhackers and aimbots, thus I don't reccomend this game.

I have played this alot on multiplayer part of it."
11522,"This game is just a Legend, the graphics are for the release date GREAT and the Story bruh, just PERFECT!"
11523,"Oh boy
Cap Price
Soap MacTavish
Ghost
Roach
Oh Task 141 Force
Amazing Campaign 10/10"
11524,"This is my  favorite COD of all time. 9/10. Only reason I leave that one number out is because of OMA tubes and the amount of cheaters that run around on this game today. Don't get me wrong, its playable but you will eventually run into someone running wallhack/aimbot. If you are looking for a more clean MW2 experience (also without OMA Tubes!) I would recommend checking out the alternate client ""IW4x."""
11525,"I used to play this game 24/7 on my old ps3 one of my FAVORITE games ever and I loved doing the ops missions with friends, for sure a game that I would recommend. #R.I.P Ghost, the campaiagn has an overall very compelling story too."
11526,"best cod ever, Hope soon be remastered (y)"
11527,"never forget playing this on my Modern Warfare 2 Edition Xbox 360

oh how times have changed. yet the more things change, the more they stay the same."
11528,Greatest cod ever made!!
11529,"Good as ever. Modders are hardly seen still which is lovely after such a long game life.
I would reccomends this game for the nostalgia alone."
11530,"This is hands down the best Call of duty game out there, it still has players after all this time (granted you will run in to a few modded lobbies and a multitude of ""Noob tubers"" but it is still fun. Long live Rust!"
11531,"get it
get iw4x (rocket v2)
done"
11532,"Great game overall, but could need a rework / remaster."
11533,nice
11534,"Good game, made me rage for 2 hours on Veteran)"
11535,still one of the best CoD's ever. :)
11536,wat1
11537,"Best CoD ever, we need more players, this game must live!"
11538,Fav cod game
11539,"more than 100000000 hours on my ps3 xd

doubletap
barrelroll
fastreload
and all that shit..
love this game xd"
11540,Excellent game.  Enjoyed thoroughly!
11541,10/10 would tube again.
11542,good game
11543,:(
11544,"One of the more fun Call of Duty games IMO. Campaign is good, Spec Ops is fun and gets difficult at times and this MP is crazy. It is definitely not balanced but I enjoy the killstreaks, guns, maps etc. enough to play anyway"
11545,"A very fun and enjoyable COD game to get into, though sadly theres not many around to play, so joining a lobby can be quite a hassle."
11546,"*multiplayer*
this game is fun and addictive but if u like waiting for ages to find a host, laggy matches, bugs, unballanced weapons and broken mechanics go ahead and buy it. cs 1.6, which is 17 years old still holds better than this thing.
2/5"
11547,Still the best Call of Duty to date! No controller support for those looking for it though. Multiplayer is still active even today.
11548,"ya
(.Y.)"
11549,"oh the memories this was so great never forget ! 

10/10"
11550,"hey dudes, this game is pretty good, but before you play it, make sure you have a half-rack of Mountain Dew Voltage, and just any extreme amount of unhealthy junk food, because only the dankest of N  E  C  K  B  E  A  R  D  S  are allowed to smoke Shrek's Swamp weed, and make ogre puns without looking like an autismlord / having a negative k/d / having 0 willprower wen it cums 2 grils

Make sure you bring the joint the size of the Empire State Building, and don't forget to call him a hacker boiz."
11551,Best CoD till this day
11552,"In my opinion this is by far the best of the Call of Duty series.

The story carries right on from the first Modern Warfare title except that now Soap is the older, experienced guy leading you through the game much like Price did in the predecessor.

The Russian invasion in this one is very reminiscent of a certain famous film. By the end you will be screaming out ""Wolverine!"" and feel like you are the Swayze himself.

Infinity Ward impressed us multiple times in the past but this is their shining moment in my opinion. The story is awesome, the ending is satisfying, the gameplay is that same classic Call of Duty gameplay that is famous for being action packed and making you really feel like you are in a movie.

This is an excellent first person shooter and mustn't be passed up."
11553,Best game of call of duty but there is something wrong on multiplayer there are too many hackers so it's impossible to play it
11554,"Well, let me get this straights. This game is fine for me, but i can't launch the game because of the problem."
11555,last good one
11556,"My issue isn't with the game as much as it is with Steam ever ending annoyance at making it difficult for me to start up this game. It's a police state around here. I attempt to speak to them in writing but they make it extremely difficult and just want to toss me under the rug to the developers. Poor way to run a police state, Steam."
11557,"It's like huniepop , but with ghost."
11558,BEST CALL OF DUTY TO GET FOR 20 BUCKS
11559,"I love this game, I played it growing up and I'm glad to be playing it again! I recommended it to 2 of my friends and they love it 5 Out of 5 Stars for sure"
11560,best cod ever made if you disagree meet me at rust and we'll settle it like men
11561,Good game. My favorite mission is No Russian.
11562,lit
11563,"Hands down, this is one of the best shooter games ever made!

You always feel so excited when you rank up, unlock weapons, camos, titles, emblems and killstreaks since it pops up text explaining what you did and what your reward is together with music which really makes you heart rate go up in excitement.

Example: You play on the map Afghan and stand on top of the hill and you see enemies coming from behind and you get scared like a b**ch and jump down from the cliff. BAM 
- ""Challenge Completed!  Jump 30ft and die (500XP)""
*MUSIC PLAYS* 

- ""You've been promoted! Private First Class""

You respawn and... get spawnkilled by a knifer
- ""Challenge Completed! Get stabbed by an infected player. (1000XP)""

You play like shit for the rest of the game and in the last minute, someone calls in a nuke and ends the game.
- ""Challenge Completed! Get nuked by the enemy (1000XP)""

Doesn't matter if you play good or like total garbage, you will still rank up pretty much whatever you do (but some challenges can only be done once).


I love this game! It's my most played game in the library and I keep coming back to play it many years after.
High replayability, and the campaign + Special Ops are awesome too! (Special Ops supports CO-OP!)

It's too bad that many game modes have died out due to too few players in the playlists, really miss spawnkilling on demolition and playing Headquarters Pro :/ (Yes, sorry, I'm one of those people).
But Free For All, Team Deathmatch and Domination are always available :D

Be aware though, there's many players who use wallhack (see you through walls) and aimbot (auto aim). 
In cases like this, you can just leave the match and join a new game mode temporarily and get back later and hope that you get into a new server without the cheaters.


If you like shooters, then GET THIS GAME! You will get tubed, you will get quickscoped, you will get ""rekt"" and you will be called noob for whatever reason, the players have slept with your mother infinite times and every game ends with an ""ez"" or ""owned"" and you will get NUKED every now and then, but it feels f**king great!

Highly recommended game!!
11/10 EZ REKT!"
11564,very good 10/10
11565,"A campaign from back when COD was a powerhouse, and actually told good, well made blockbuster stories.
Is very short however (I played on the second hardest difficulty and finished it in 4:30 hours)

8/10 - A great but short blockbuster of a campaign that has memorable characters that you will actually care about

"
11566,"Great game to handle conflicts with the good old '1v1 Rust, nife only' matches."
11567,Nostalgia Warfare 2
11568,"So, yeh, ehmm. I use sniper"
11569,This is the best call of duty game i have ever played multiplayer
11570,nice
11571,"This game might be old but is a very solid game. Really good game expect for last stand and noob tube. I would recommend to buy this game. The cons are they are starting to be modded lobbies which sucks but not too many hackers and modded lobbies in my experience. Good game must buy. 
"
11572,kir√°ly g√©m
11573,I would recommend as being almost as good as cracking open a cold one with the boys.
11574,"Easily the worst COD game ever made. Bar none. And ive suffered through Many bad ones, Like Modern Warfare 3, Ghosts, And Infinite Warfare.. Good god.. The only reason this is still praised is because of nostolgic basement dwellers who played the game when they were thirteen and see what a steamy pile of donky shit this game is but deny it and use ""Fun"" as criticism. Using fun to try to make a factual claim is almost always wrong and you should avoid it. Its only Ok when you use it in a way like ""I found it fun"". It shouldnt be ""The game is fun so everyone who says its bad is a liar"" Because FUN, ladies and gentlemen, Is based on opinion. People find Overwatch fun. They made it game of the year 2016 because it was ""Fun"". Well you know what? MANY PEOPLE DONT FIND IT FUN. ITS THE SAME WITH THIS GAME. ""FUN"" ISNT VALID CRITICISM. This one may not have Supply drops, This one may not have purchasable weapon skins. You know what it also doesnt have? Any gameplay value whatsoever other than a constant grind to rank up and presige. And when it all ends youre left with **NOTHING**. Not only that, but it makes a poor attempt at trying to be a stupid action movie sequal to the beauty that was COD 4. When did soap turn into 007? Why does it have that poor excuse of a plot twist at the end that really honestly made 0 sense? Oh yeah cause its developed by Infinity Ward. This game is udder cancer and i wish i could refund it. *spit*"
11575,One of the best games you will EVER play
11576,gud gamem
11577,good with hax
11578,"At least its better than G-Squad!

                     9/10"
11579,I like it
11580,game
11581,Maybe the best cod.
11582,"only the story is good.its boring..and doesn't worth for 20 bucks,plus you will play only on 3 maps in multiplayer"
11583, n
11584,This is a very fun game and i love the story very much except when Ghost dies screw Roach
11585,"Very overrated, but still good. Also the coop is surprisingly good."
11586,"I always like this modern warfare 2.
The multiplayer was quite amazing than call of duty 4 Modern Warfare. With not only al-asad men's
Swat teams, militia, Ranger, etc.
Special ops (new mode) unlike arcade mode in call of duty 4 Modern Warfare, not only scoring points, survival, detonate or diffuse, etc, it was like a campaign of call of duty 4 modern warfare and Modern Warfare 2 Mix, same and different with multiple friends
"
11587,Good for us aussies since we have dedicated servers!
11588,Good game!
11589,5 stars out of 5
11590,good stuff
11591,Nice game
11592,Pls
11593,best call of duty ever
11594,"NOTICE: I've had about 10 hours in the multiplayer, don't play the campaign since I used to play it over and over whenever I didn't have xbox live.  For some reason it doesn't display the amount of hours you put into the multiplayer so just leaving this here.

Talk about a nostalgia flashback, this was one of the first call of duty games I ever played and I absolutely loved it.  So glad to see it's still alive and kicking in 2017 espiecally on the PC.  If you want someone to know what a real Call Of Duty game is just show them this or CoD4, however CoD4's PC Playerbase isn't doing so hot.  As for the multiplayer on here there are about a peak of 2,000 or more players on everyday and that's sure to increase this summer once the summer sale starts.  This game is usaully 50% off so do buy it.  My experience so far has been great and I do come across the occasional wallhacker but I have yet to seen any aimbotters or extreme modders.  The modded lobbies I've been on just enhance your experience by auto transitioning to maps, having longer rounds, and moddifing the game modes and even adding game modes from other call of dutys.  You can even join private servers and such following some of the guides on the community hub.  I've been looking for a good arcade shooter for a while now and realized all this new stuff just doesn't cut it and decided to go the old school route and thank god I did.  This game has aged incredibly well and I definetly reccommend you buy this over any of the call of duties made after 2011."
11595,Fucking let me hack in peace
11596,This Game is Amazing i have 400 hours on this game and loved every second of it.
11597,"The game itself is good, really good. However, if you want to play multiplayer, God may help you. Servers have been fully hijacked by cheaters. I won't be surprised if there is a way to get a virus from playing on a server due to security issues.

I consider it totally dead on PC. If you want to play the singleplayer campaign, you may go for it, but the game is really overpriced and the price doesn't change at all, even during the summer sale."
11598,Was a nice game when I bought it. Years later I can still go back to it and have fun playing it.
11599,i want a refund now please
11600,"This game was fun back in the day on console and is still fun to play now.
Pros:
Fun with friends
Nostaligic
Great campaign
Fun co-op missions
Cons:
Hackers
Graphics(Game is from 2009, good for its time.)
Some guns were left unpatched when it was in its prime
Noob Tubes

Overall this is a fun game if you and your friends wanna mess around, or just play casual COD.
"
11601,"got VAC because I had Google Chrome open...


wtf"
11602,Best CoD game ever created. Still playing it in 2017 and planning to still play in for the next few years. So much more fun when you have custom launchers like IW4-x and Rocket v2. Too bad Activison shut down 4d1... rip 4d1... best custom client.
11603,"With all the controvertial things like ""No Russian"" and even a few other moments in the series i feel that it is important that people recognize and handle these 'evils' despite the fact they may be only parts in a game they do have feelings over the player; but to hide human beings from events like this that have happened, will happen, and sadly in some cases may be happening now i consider it a very powerful tool to teach that it is wrong without putting any real people in danger and realizing whats necessary to prevent such real events rather than succumb to some fabled hysteria that some soccermom conjured up. 

As an individual who understands these aspects i thoroghly applaud the makers and distributors of this masterpiece"
11604,Best game ever. They should remaster this.
11605,amazing
11606,Gud game I dont see any cheaters and other than Noob tubers its a great experience
11607,"Ok so... Yeah play this game if you like any non-hardcore FPS.

10/10 it's 2017 and I still noob-tube with One Man Army and Danger Close."
11608,fukn lit
11609,Modern Warfare 2 is good. Just not the best out of all of them  ..in my opinion
11610,I bought it with a russian version can i chang it to english .. :/
11611,"if your into epileptic mods, weed and LSD hacks, 10 year old kids jumping off highrise to noscope, and joining losing teams 10 seconds before the end of the match, i know just the thing for you!

""im not fat im skinny, skinny people dont sweat when playing cod""-random kid in lobby
420/10 would join hacked weed upside-down russian lobby with mexican kids again"
11612,This game is amore.

11614,"Well well well another xbox360 hit, anyways if you wanna get this game or are thinking about getting it for any reason just know the muliplayer is just about dead ive stopped playing multiplayer over all there are no people on.. EVER. On the other hand singleplayer is great recoment for those gamers who like a good single player! (IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET IN A MULTI LOBBY)"
11615,"Love this game, filled with noobtubers tho"
11616,"(Before we begin, I've played 700+ hours on my secondary steam account, and around 3k on my x360.)
Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was a game that will live with infamy in many peoples hearts. 
Through great memories, struggles, and just overall raw memories of playing the game; it will forever be remembered.
The campaign takes place in 2016, and is a continuation of MW. I'm not going to summarize it, because I really REALLY want you to play the game if you haven't.
I played the shit out of MW2. I had to re-buy 2 disks until I bought it digitally, because I played it so goddamn much.
MW2 had an extraordinary MP mode, and I still play it to this day.
I say this with 100% certainty and the ability to back myself up, Call of Duty:Modern Warfare 2, is the best Call of Duty game. Ever. 
There will never be another CoD game, as good as this one ever. And the day the servers shut down is the day I commit suicide.
Now, why is MW2 the best?
The Campaign was LITERALLY the most immersive experience, (other than ME:Catalyst), that I have ever played.
It jumped you right in to the shoes of roach and ramirez, gave you a gun, a good story, and let you shoot things.
That may not sound that great, but tust me, it is. Play the campaign and you will see how good it is. The snowmobile mission is worth the $20 on steam, alone.
The story didn't make any huge jumps, and it didn't have any holes. It re-introduced things from MW very well, inlcluding cpt john price.
Speaking of Price: He's the bad ass every game needs, but he doesn't feel like a cliche.
Listen to this quote and try not to get goose bumps.
""The healthy human mind doesn't wake up in the morning thinking this is its last day on Earth. 
But I think that's a luxury, not a curse. 
To know you're close to the end is a kind of freedom.
Good time to take...inventory. [...] Out-gunned. Outnumbered. Out of our minds. 
On a suicide mission. But the sand and the rocks here, stained with thousands of years of warfare... They will remember us. For this. 
Because out of all our vast array of nightmares, this is the one we choose for ourselves. We go forward like a breath exhaled from the Earth.
With vigor in our hearts and one goal in sight: We. Will. Kill him.""
As frustrated as I got, as rage-filled as I might have gotten, the multiplayer was beautiful
It's still beautiful.
No, the Noob Tube isn't balanced
No, host migration isn't fixed
No, the guns aren't the most balanced thing in the world
But, it's still a shit ton of fun.
Every single mode in MW2 has something new to offer.
Every single gun has a new way to use it and things to unlock.
Every perk has its use, making it very difficult to choose them.
Every map has its own play style with its own guns to use.
Just talking about the multiplayer is making me giddish.
I met my longest friend, Matt, in a S&D lobby 8 years ago, and hell, we still talk and play CS:GO all the time.
This is what really got me into gaming, and if it were not for this game I probably wouldn't own a computer, I wouldn't know Matt, Reid, or Rob (my 3 best gaming friends, and best friends in general), and I would be a helluva lot different.
Thank you IW for making an incredible game.
Thank you Activision for, well, nothing, but thank you.
And finally, Thank you Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, for being an incredible, inspiring, and life chaning game."
11617,Best COD yet just dont get vacced on it cause youre too lazy to unlock everything like me
11618,bots mods are extremely difficult to install and play
11619,GG
11620,It's a classic game.
11621,In my opinion one of the finest FPS multiplayer experiences in recent years
11622,"Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is a first person shooter which was released by Activision in 2009. It is currently being sold on steam for GBP¬£19.99. The game features a solo campaign mode, a ""Spec Ops"" mode which can be played solo or co-op and finally the Multiplayer mode where players can play with up to 17 other players online.

The game's menu is easy to navigate and the settings are easy to change to your liking. Even though the game was released in 2009, the graphics still look very well polished in some places and seem very ahead of its time. The game runs very smoothly on my PC in all game modes which is great for a game released in 2009. 

Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2's campaign is a thrill seeker from start to finish. The game throws you into the thick of modern combat showing off various different locations around the world. While going through the campaign you will learn the in's and outs of the various different weaponry that is provided in Modern Warfare 2. Some aspects of the campaign will be able to be repeated in the ""Spec Ops"" mode with or without a co-op partner. 

The online multiplayer is a massive draw for Modern Warfare 2, and even coming up to nearly  8 years after it was released it still hosts a large amount of online players enjoying and playing the game. There is a host of various different game modes, maps , weapons and kill streaks for you to choose from. The massive variety in what you can do online in this game means you will find something fun for everyone. 


The game features a full host of guns varying from explosive weapons, all the way down to classics in the Call of Duty series such as the Desert Eagle. The guns feel smooth and great to shoot and despite some people who argue that there are balancing issues in the game (for example the ""UMP 45"" remains a very strong and accurate gun and some players would argue that the developers never addressed the issues or ""Nerfed"" this weapon), the online play is still great fun and any gun can work with the right amount of practice.


 The fast paced action and nature of this Call of Duty makes it a cult classic.Some people may argue that the price should go down due to the age of the game, but in all honesty if you are looking for a first person shooter which you could spend hours at a time playing, there aren't many better than Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2"
11623,Best CoD game ever
11624,God for mid end pc
11625,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. Officially announced on February 11, 2009, the game was released worldwide on November 10, 2009 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows. It is the sixth installment of the Call of Duty series and the direct sequel to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, continuing the same storyline, with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 ending the storyline. It was released in conjunction with two other Call of Duty games: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Mobilized for the Nintendo DS, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Reflex, a port of Call of Duty 4 adapted by Treyarch for the Wii console.

The game's campaign follows the Task Force 141, a special forces unit fronted by Captain Soap MacTavish, and the United States Army Rangers as they hunt Vladimir Makarov, leader of the Russian Ultranationalist party. The game's main playable characters are Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson, of the 141, and James Ramirez, of the Army Rangers, with Captain MacTavish becoming playable later in the campaign. An expansive multiplayer mode is featured in the game, with several new features and modes that were not seen in its predecessor.

Development for the game began in 2008, when it was still known as Call of Duty 6; eventually, the full title was revealed. Modern Warfare 2 uses the IW 4.0 engine, an improved version of Call of Duty 4's IW 3.0 engine. Infinity Ward was inspired by real-life conflicts when developing the game's campaign mode. They initially tested the game's multiplayer mode by playing an in-house beta version of the game. Teasing of the game began in March 2009, with short trailers being released for the game and, eventually, a full reveal trailer. The game's multiplayer was revealed shortly after. Two downloadable content packs were released for the multiplayer mode, each containing four new maps.

Modern Warfare 2 has been critically acclaimed by various gaming websites, attaining a 94/100 aggregate score on Metacritic, with praise stemming primarily from its in-depth multiplayer component. Within 24 hours of release, the game sold approximately 4.7 million copies in North America and the United Kingdom. In addition to its release, a comic book series based on one of the game's characters was also produced, entitled Modern Warfare 2: Ghost. Despite the game's success, it was subject to some controversies, with one surrounding a playable level that had the player carry out a terror attack on an airport.

Over the years the Call of Duty series has set the bar for immersive, action-packed, cinematic FPS gaming, and no matter what camp you're from there's no denying the franchise's influence on the industry. When Infinity Ward moved from the classic World War II setting and blazed new ground with Modern Warfare we saw the first obvious split within the world of Call of Duty. The series dropped its historic focus, created a new cast of characters, and began treading on new ground by taking the first-person shooter genre to new locales, and pushing the boundaries of what military games are willing to show. With Modern Warfare 2, the sheer amount of hype has been practically inescapable, with preorders alone setting it up as one of the biggest selling games of all time, the addition of even more multiplayer modes and features, and the game's new Special Operations mode has set Infinity Ward's lastest up as the game to beat this year.

The real question: has it been worth the wait, and can Modern Warfare 2 live up to the precedent set by over half a decade of Call of Duty tradition?

Modern Warfare 2 is by far the least traditional of the series, with the core package broken up into three main pillars of gameplay. Single-player fans have their main campaign, if you're down for more co-op gameplay either locally or via online connection you've got the new Spec Ops mode, and Modern Warfare's groundbreaking multiplayer is back, and truly better than ever. There's an overwhelming amount of content to experience, but with each mode being 100% standalone in nature, you're getting three completely different experiences all in one. That, however, also plays a huge factor into how your final opinion of Modern Warfare 2 as a whole turns out.

First and foremost is the single-player experience. As the anchor of the Call of Duty world, campaign mode is back, and it's intense. You'll instantly get a sense of just how far the improved engine has come when you're thrown into the bustling streets of Rio de Janeiro's favela, the ice-capped mountains of Kazakhstan, the dusty roads of Afghanistan, and other unexpected locales. On the visual side of things, Modern Warfare 2 is an obvious step up over Call of Duty 4 and World at War, with a stronger emphasis on complex terrain in the environments, weather effects, destructible objects, and the overall sense of action and chaos that comes with so many visual improvements. This is only complemented further by the increased attention to sound design, with the effects of many returning weapons being re-recorded,even more in-level chatter amongst your allies, and a truly captivating score by Hans Zimmer which builds based on specific in-game moments. Modern Warfare 2 feels like an action movie through and through, with the production values alone dating Infinity Ward's last game, Call of Duty 4, quite a bit.

At the same time, the single-player campaign has its issues. For starters, it's short. I've been playing Call of Duty 4 steadily since its release, and my first completion of the Modern Warfare 2 campaign came in at just under five hours on regular difficulty. Playing through on hardened will add another hour and a half onto that. Modern Warfare 2 is definitely more chaotic this time around ‚Äì partially due to the new visual effects and upped production values ‚Äì and with the improved enemy AI and tough scenario design you'll be fighting for every checkpoint. One of the larger visual changes to the game's heads-up display this time around is the blood splatter system. In previous Call of Duty offerings you'd get damaged, the screen would start to shade red, and you'd be required to seek cover before your vision returned to normal. Modern Warfare 2 employs a new system, actually having a thicker blood layer added to up the realism. There's been some discussion on whether the splatter is too distracting, and in my experience with the game it's far from an issue. You'll be able to take more hits on easier difficulty settings, so while a few well-placed shots will drop players on hardened or veteran modes the added splatter is an acceptable trade-off for more overall health

Thankfully many of the glaring issues from last time around have been fixed. You won't find unlimited enemy spawns in areas, there's always a waypoint icon on-screen showing you where to go or who to follow, and the amount of in-game chatter from your team is simply astounding. It isn't often in games that you'll hear your squad call out specific areas on the map and have it mean anything. When your friend shouts, ""Two tangos behind the yellow station wagon!"" you'll actually see two enemies behind a yellow station wagon. It's a pretty engaging experience. You'll still have random issues with friendly AI, specifically with blocking your movement or deciding to walk in front of you mid-firefight, but for the most part it's a better experience than the first Modern Warfare."
11626,Classic. Love this game
11627,Best Game I Ever Played *.* !
11628,"[b] Literally the most asked questions [/b]
Is it still worth it?
>Yes, If it's on sale.
Is the multiplayer dead?
>Nope, There's still 1,500+ players each day. They mostly play TDM though.
http://steamcharts.com/search/?q=call+of+duty

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I highly recommend to get this game if it goes on sale. An 8 year old game you'll probably still enjoy."
11629,"The first COD I ever purchased.

Back in 2009 -10 the community and matches were amazing. 

23 out of 10.

Would time machine and play again!"
11630,good game but can get boring after 60 hours
11631,"Good game, made me do an account here. Still waiting for dlc maps to go on sale though."
11632,"ahh. the good ol' days. No jetpacks, no supply drops.

This game will cure your Exo-Induced cancer."
11633,I found a sex doll in the bathroom one time in the campaign.
11634,"Campaign and Co-Op are really fun, but if you're looking to buy MW2 in 2017 it's probably for the multiplayer. I live in North America so keep in mind this is just my experience, if you're in a different country this might not apply to you.
 
Anyways the multiplayer is still alive. You can easily find games of Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Search and Destroy. Other game modes like ground war, ctf, etc are pretty much dead and impossible to find games in. Sometimes you'll get into a modded lobby where the gamemode changes (for example you are looking for a TDM game and you join a server but it's on 9v9 domination), which usually happens at least once a day if you play for like 2-3 hours. 

There are quite a lot of hackers though. Mostly people just wall hacking and sometimes aim botting, which is annoying and ruins the game honestly. In my 120 hours played, I've only ran into 3 people who were using hacks that actually made the game unplayable (using a LMG with FMJ and literally just sitting in the middle of the map killing everyone through walls with a aimbot). To be short, yes there are hackers and you will probably run into them at couple of times a day, but most of the games you'll be in will be fine. It's also really easy to tell if someone is hacking, just look at there profile and they'll more than likely either have a bunch of VAC bans or be like level 50 with 5 hours in the game.

Overall if you're thinking about getting this game for the multiplayer, I would say it's worth it for the $20, the hackers are annoying but again, it's not like every server is full of hackers, don't let those idiots stop you from buying this game."
11635,Amazing My Favourite COD Ever I Know There Are Cheaters And It Faced Some Controversy But Still Its Fun I So Wish They Remaster This!
11636,best game ever
11637,Toxic community
11638,I don't remember why I got banned. But I am.
11639,"gudgame
"
11640,Worth buying just for the campaign.
11641,"- The best call of duty version
- 10/10 Gameplay
- Death Roach and Ghost is a very sad scene"
11642,Do you really need to look at the reviews before buying a call of duty? This was the first call of duty that I played which hooked me on to the series until they release that dog shit that was call of duty ghosts then I stopped buying them. Even though I am a bit excited for the new ww2 one I feel it will just be more of the same so I probably won't buy it.  Anyway if you haven't played mw2 you should because it's great.
11643,"the balancing is completly fucked. but overall, its good multiplayer. anyone who wants to get into cod, should start with this one. good story, not too reliant on the previous modern warfare, and after a while you get used to people using overpowered weapons like UMP, g18, grenade launchers and the killstreaks who are super op on every but 2 maps. the singleplayer is fun and has good story and the coop missions are the tits! but the singleplayer and coop has next to nothing to do with the multiplayer. in multiplayer you will get murdered by someone using the ugliest and shittiest weapons known to humankind over and over. but this game is the ultimate call of duty experience. and if youre sober, dont play multiplayer. its most fun if you dont give a shit. how well youre doing, doesnt matter in this game."
11644,Best CoD SP game out there..
11645,The grenade launchers gave me PTSD...
11646,very good game but it has many hackers and it dont has many missions so it is boring..
11647,I enjoy the game a lot but there is a lot of input lag.
11648,wowzers
11649,"Got VAC banned for hacking myself to 10th prestige, 10/10 would get banned again."
11650,"One of the most memorable game in the history of Call of Duty.

Maybe even the most."
11651,"Legendary game, but rly why would you sell it for 20eur? Are your rly that money hungry? Its outdated game with a lot of hackers and modders in multiplayer, ofc lack of palyers in general. from 20+ available game mods in multiplayer 1 or 2 are only played witch is sad. Yes its not game's problem but when you sell it for 20 eurs i expect at least some decent cheater ban system or smth. As a first time COD MW player i sure like this game and when it was at its strongest years it was fun but now its waste of money tottaly if not hackers than pretty good players will make you quit this game pretty fast and yeah i you wanna play single player mod with 6 hrs worth gamplay and pay 20 eur for it, go ahead. 

Have to say that i still found this game fun, i think with few friends this game in multiplayer is still playable, BUT NOT 20 EUR WORTH !!!"
11652,"I played this game back when it was the best.  Got it on sale last week, seems to be dead online.  I can never find anyone playing this game.  Still worth it for the story.
RELIVING THE GLORY DAYS!!!"
11653,Well... well... well... I must say something before I begin my review. Go and buy it and do not hesitate!!! This game is hands down the best cod game. From the story to the mechanics this game is not a 20$ game for sure. It is at least a 40$ game. The story of the game is full plot twists and the gameplay is action-packed. I must say that this game is one of the best games I have ever played and the story really makes you think. I strongly recommend it.
11654,"Do you like balance?
Do you like good maps?
Do you like sniper rifles not being used for sniping?
Do you like secondaries stronger than the primaries?
Do you like that shotguns are stronger if more inaccurate?
Do you like that claymores can jump if you angle it correctly?
Do you like getting stunned by stun grenades for a few decades?
Do you like that only 1 sniper rifle is worthy of being called good?
Do you like that secondaries have less recoil if you are wielding 2 of those?
Do you like an almost fully automatic 1 shot kill sniper rifle used in any range?
Do you like that if you shoot a gun then you give vision to the enemy on where you are?
Do you like that you can dual wield SMG's but be more inaccurate than you at the toilet?
Do you like that you can see in your killcam that the enemy who killed you had just spawned in?
Do you like that a fully automatic secondary machine pistol firing at 2,000,000,000 RPM is dual wieldable?
Do you like that there are cheaters that will kick you if you kill them while they are attempting on doing a ""trickshot""?
Do you like that in Spec Ops if you are playing at the Veteran difficulty and you get hit by a bullet of any weapon you flinch to space?
Do you like that you have to use a perk called ""Stopping Power"" to be able to deal enough damage to 1 hit kill someone with a sniper rifle?
Do you like that there is a killstreak that requires 25 kills but will instantly win you/your team the game no matter how hard you were losing?
Do you like infinite ammo on 1 shot kill high explosive extremely wide radius grenade launcher used on rifles where you don't use the bullets in?
Do you like that there is a killstreak that only requires 3 kills and it gives you vision on everyone on the radar except from people with Cold Blooded Pro?
Do you like that in your killcam you can see your enemy switching into their secondary as soon as they spawn in because secondaries are stronger than primaries?
Do you like that there is a perk called ""Steady Aim"" that decreases inaccuracy while not aiming or scoping making the sniper rifles viable at shooting while not scoped at close range?
Do you like that Steady Aim also makes the 2,000,000,000 RPM secondary machine pistols highly accurate making it dominate every gun in the game?
Do you like that silencers do not decrease range but rather decreases damage? It also makes sniper rifles not deal enough damage to 1 hit kill.
Do you like that a 44. Magnum Revolver or a Desert Eagle can not 1 hit kill someone at point blank range to the head?
And don't you just love the players with over 8000 hours ingame but has about 2 hours in the singleplayer/Spec Ops?
Oh, and welcome to Modern Warfare 2."
11655,"One of the most memorable FPS campaigns I've ever played. Every set piece is gorgeous and packed with action. Controls are simple and very responsive. Story is exciting, full of twists, and has an excellent resolution. The soundtrack is my favorite part: excellently paced and provides a tense and often bleak atmosphere to the events.

A must play for FPS fans."
11656,Itz ok nigga suck my ballz
11657,this game is fun.....graphics almost better then GTA 4.....recommend u guys to play
11658,"Wholy cuss no! Do not get this. 

      Worst multiplayer I have ever played, many hackers and terrible, TERRIBLE map selection, not to mention the awful and tedious level up and prestige system. Single player and spec ops are okay, but nothing special, you want a semi decent COD game get Black Ops 1. It still has problems, but has better maps and a much more enjoyable level up system."
11659,full of nube tubes and campers but aprt from that very enjoyable.
11660,Finished the campaign in 4 hours....
11661,"Campaign is awesome, multiplayer is not. Always showing my NAT type as strict, when my connection is fine, and I'm stuck on ""Fetching Playlists..."" and loading my online profile. So stupid. If anyone has a fix, please reply. Otherwise don't buy this. Not worth 20 bucks."
11662,Don't buy this for Mac.  It doesn't open and crashes in 3 seconds from opening.  Unplayable.
11663,i give this gam a smooth/10 ver good
11664,tyhrtgtrgrgrg
11665,"Still worth buying . I haven't seen any hackers . They are some campers and skilled players with 700hrs but you can always find a lobby with newbies
"
11666,Gernade launcher simulator
11667,Feels as good as i remember but i requested a refund cus it just has too many cheaters plus people found out how to get past VAC bans apparently on this game. If you want to play the campaign i'd recommend it if you want to play mulstiplayer and dont care about losing or doing bad then i would recommend it. Some lobbies are alright not all have cheaters but it just happens too often for me to even try to play online.
11668,"Its really my fault for assuming controller support without checking...

Still its a kick to the balls and a waste of my money so I'm annoyed.

Controller support should be easy enough."
11669,"Best COD, shame this futuristic s*hits are more played than old school CODs."
11670,"Just a few games in and I met a handful of cheaters. Older game, so it seems like multiplayer is no longer monitored."
11671,Its a great game but i wish there was controller support
11672,"Granted there wasnt any dedicated servers, it was fun. The campaign chewed up some 8 hours of the 490 hours accumulated. I want to say I legitimately prestiged maybe twice? then because of the lack of dedicated servers, I get queued into one of the hacked servers and ended up with max prestiged just by connecting. Avoid this game unless youre some kind of call of duty fan/asshole  (:"
11673,I personnally can't play or sdjaust the brightness properly (help maybe) but still very addicting.
11674,a fun game with my favorite campaign
11675,"11.3 hrs on record
last played on 5 Dec, 2009

outdated :("
11676,HI :)
11677,This is cancer! Cancerous campers playing cancerous game! But it's ok i guess...
11678,"Such a shame this game doesn't have full xbox one controller support. I accept that most people play PC games with mouse and keyboard but there should be proper controller support for this game - especially as it was very popular on PS3 & 360 at the time. I am aware of the controller confirgeration option but unfortunately I cannot seem to make my controller work almost half as good as it once did on the 360. 

I bought this game for a bit of a flashback to the old days but ended up not wanting to play it at all."
11679,Wow
11680,"Sukurac prava igrica hehe

11681,nice game
11682,Looks and plays very nicely even on older hardware - worth the ¬£9.99
11683,Full of hackers. Gameplay is good and engaging but I miss COD4 :)
11684,"A very good game. Lots of shooting and chases. A lot of good and bad characters. The end surprised me, definitely recommend this game to all my friends."
11685,Retro.
11686,mlg!
11687,"dont play this game for the multiplayer anymore, there is no server browser, which may seem like a minor complaint at first, but its actually horrible because of long wait times (other than tdm), peer to peer connection which sucks balls, and hackers get to rome around freely unpunished, because anticheat is nonexistant. i would not recommend this to any call of duty fan,  if you truly want to buy this, only get it for the singleplayer, as multiplayer just sucks"
11688,"Finished in 9 hours on the recommended setting? Too short a game, i think."
11689,pew pew goes the nazi
11690,"this game is absolute fun and annoying as hell. 
Noobtubes will always get you, but the juicy quickscopes are very nice."
11691,Great fun for the whole family
11692,One of the Best if not the best game of the Call of Duty franchise.
11693,Still better than the recent call of duty series. What a wonderful game!
11694,Best Story and multiplayer in COD history
11695,WHY WOULD THEY MAKE IT NOT CONTROLLER COMPATIBLE!?!?!?!
11696,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!
11697,the most awesome multiplayer game ever ever
11698,"is this game controller friendly
"
11699,Still an enjoyable game
11700,absolutely incredible
11701,"9/10 great game. Campaign is especially great. The multiplayer in 2017 is meh, but it used to be amazing in it's hayday. Nowadays it's quite common to see people hacking or to end up in a hacked server. Bad consequences can even come to innocent people when they are automatically put into a hacked server. It can alter you player stats and unlock all game items. :( really can be quite annoying. But, the game is no longer as popular as it once was; most of the player base has moved on. Overall though, I would give this game a solid 9/10. The 2nd best Call of Duty, right behind COD4, the original Modern Warfare.

tl;dr
Singleplayer: 9/10
Multiplayer 6/10 - hackers can get annoying, mostly retains COD4 experience"
11702,best CoD ever
11703,"Amazing game

*Great Graphics
*Runs smoothly
*Animation is great
*Great sounds

I recommend you buy this, NOW."
11704,9/11 would play again
11705,"  I really like this game (both singleplayer and multiplayer) and it's amazing to see that the people is still playing multiplayer in 2017.
  Also,it doesn't have so many cheaters like MW3."
11706,One of the best
11707,"Still VACed , Still hacking"

11711,"One of the most fun multiplayer games back in the days.
Now overflooded with hackers sadly."
11712,Gut game i suppose
11713,It has a really good campaign and multiplayer that can live up to modern warfare 1 (call of  duty 4)
11714,best game but cheter try play with your freind i play it only for troll :p
11715,Super fun game
11716,"For 20 bucks you get a multiplayer full of cheaters and pirated servers. If you want to pay 20 bucks for a SP campaign and some coop missions it might be worth it, but the multiplayer is trash.

The reason the multiplayer doesn't work is because pirates and crackers managed to get custom private servers working in the gaming, so more than half of the servers are hosted by computers using a pirated version. Pirated versions means that you can cheat and hack without repurcussion since you can just change the CD key if you get banned. There's also no punkbuster or VAC to prevent cheaters from the Steam version so it's not worth it.

A big controversy about this game is that it was the first COD game to feature headless servers and player based hosting. Which means that there are no server admins, the lag varies a lot depending on the host computer hosting and the position and ping of that computer. It was a system that worked very well on consoles, but on PC it's just an insult. COD4MW used to be able to connect to servers local and dedicated and there were admins in the different communities. The COD4MW multiplayer experience isn't so rich of features like MW2 so it's a shame that MW2 is unplayable."
11717,"Cod mw2, people say it is the best cod, I disagree but it is still a great game.  The story is great and really fun.  The spec ops was really fun as well.  The multiplayer is not for me.  It can be fun sometimes and other times, boring and frustrating.  I would buy it on sale and play it for the story and spec ops.  There are very little people playing multiplayer and it is full of hackers.  7/10"
11718,"This is one of the most captivating campaigns I have played. I played it start to finish on veteran and I can say the game is well worth the cost for the campaign alone. In addition to this, the multiplayer is still somewhat alive and you can usually find a full lobby. Great game 9.5/10"
11719,Very good game!
11720,"For me, definitely the best CoD game they ever made. They took original MW and improved it. The only mistake is that terrible connecting system (I would strangle that man who devised it). Co-op and multiplayer are simply great. It is still worth playing even in these days."
11721,If you're playing for some multiplayer experience not this game instead if you're playing for the story then buy this game or the Call of Duty Trilogy Pack way more cheaper.
11722,"Loved to play this game a lot ago. It was kinda revolutionary like CoD4 but it's already that unplayable..
Hackers everywhere, the tube spam is way too intense already and amount of cheaters is undescribable.
Would love to get this game to where it was without those s***'s."

11728,fun
11729,"Used to be good, but online is just full of hackers nowadays so the multiplayer is ruined. and there's no report system, so there's nothing you can do about it"

11748,It's not as great as the older CoDs or Black Ops.
11749,"Fantastic, my favorite game of all time.

-Great character movements(fast and able to quickly rotate positions)
-Balanced(entertaining to use) weapons

If you Watch FaZe Clan, Optic Gaming, RED Reserved and others, you will know that this is the best game for trickshotting and hitting awesome sniper clips!:)"
11750,"Somehow still a favorite of mine. I really enjoy the campaign, it really shows how talented the old infinity ward was and how great the new Respawn studios are at creating memorable set peices,"
11751,Never quit the franchise!
11752,Best game of all time
11753,hackers and noobtubes. 8/10 good game
11754,This game is amazing. The sniping is the best for its time and you can always find a gun for you. it is very fun and time counsuming. I highly recommend it.
11755,"After all these years its still a lot of fun to play.

Just don't bother with the multyplayer mode.  Even if you can get on it you would not want to as its hacked to peices.  

Pros:

Good story and charactors.
Heaps of action.
great music and effects.

Cons

Hacked multyplayer mode.

I give it a 5/10"
11756,Didin't know my mum fucked so many 12 year olds
11757,"This is such a great game, let me just start with that I absolutely love this Game, The graphics are exeptional, the gameplay is almost perfect, and the atmsophere in the campaign really gets to you. Overall I find this game a true piece if art, it is a true shame only 700 people are playing multiplayer."
11758,"The best game from the CoD franchise, but still, it's a CoD game, not a revolution of the FPS genre."
11759,best call of duty for its time-definitely a classic! if you've never played this one i'd strongly suggest it if you're looking to buy :)
11760,"Kinda ok, very cool"
11761,Still better than flyin soldiers.. Over 400ps on mp svs..
11762,still a good game recumended xd 420/10
11763,"Gun. Shoot. Die. Respawn.

4/10 Would smash again."
11764,"no gold camo, ghey"
11765,"Bought it only for the campaign.

I say worth."
11766,a really good game tbh. not that bad of a plyer base considering this is really  old
11767,i like this game for trickshotting.
11768,THESE NUTS
11769,"Played about 10hrs of multiplayer and got to level 26. Met only one blatant hacker. Campaign is great and the public multiplayer is still great ( about 500 people playing on weekends). People only play tdm, ffa and domination though so if youre looking for variety of game modes this isnt the game for you. Overall great game and worth getting on sale for around $10-12 i wouldnt pay $20."
11770,i wish i can use controller but still a really good game love it
11771,"all you need is an M4A1 with a grenade launcher an an AT4. 
10/10 best game
cyka blayt rush c intervention noscopes P90 no russian"
11772,uhh it's fucking sick bro
11773,Are you ready for 360 noscope
11774,best game ive ever played tho
11775,"Decent CoD, not as good as 4. Multiplayer is still decently alive. People say there is a lot of cheaters, but I haven't come across any, yet. Spec Ops is decently fun, as long as you have friends to play with. Get 4 or WaW. Both support mods and are vastly better."
11776,nice game
11777,NUKE INCOMING
11778,"This is my favourite game from the Call of Duty series.
But the most i love the campain.
"
11779,Its pretty lit fam
11780,"This is the follow up to the Modern Warfare Remastered review. I liked the MWR part of the story more than this one, but it is still a good 8/10. Multiplayer is pretty good if it isn't hacked. This is my favorite COD series (Black Ops has 3 and 4 which are not great). Overall 8/10 and is worth $10."
11781,<3
11782,XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
11783,"For me the 3rd best CoD campaign
but the mulitplayer is full of noobtubers..."
11784,√Ä
11785,ez katka
11786,My name jegg
11787,Pretty fun. A+
11788,This was my very first Xbox game a long time ago. As the 360 became obsolete I found it very difficult to relive the old days of MW2 even struggling just to find a match with more than just one other person. My decision to buy this game on steam is something I will never regret. Even to this day the campaign stands well and the mulitplayer (although noob tubing is out of control) is still going strong. The weapons are great and the upgrading and unlock system is satisfying. 10/10 I will always recommend.
11789,i fucked this game like i fucked myself in other words it was good. fucking myself and the game
11790,One the best COD games!
11791,makes me wet
11792,"Perhaps one of the best parts of the Call of Duty series.

10 without recoil out of 10"
11793,"I probably replayed this game more than 10 times (excluding the times i had this game off-steam)






I have no regrets"
11794,"exceptional game
i quite like it alot
pls buy the devs need money they are poor
i swear they are poor.
would u donate to poor bangladeshi individuals? no? lol neither would i, but you get the idea - the devs are bangladeshi children"
11795,"best game to join with hackers,  i joined a lobby got max prestige and everything unlocked.


10/10"
11796,"Back when this was popular it was great, tons of people to play against. Co-op is still super fun, story was intresting."
11797,"Got very memorable characters in the campain, and has a great story continuing the story from COD 4

Great Game"
11798,"I have 1,000 hrs on my PS3.

I still haven't nuked.

10/10 nube toob is a great alternative."
11799,'' You are now banned from Valve anti-cheat ''
11800,"My Favorite COD game, played lot of Multiplayer back when it came out."
11801,"Singleplayer and Co-op ONLY review

+ Good (but heavilly scripted) action scenes. Some great ideas.
+ weapons and movement are great
+ fun Co-op missions

- scripted, no dynamic AI to speak of
- lousy story...really bad
- features stripped from this that were in the previous game

If you don't mind how shallow the scripted world can feel, then the shooting and action is really quite good.
"
11802,"Honestly this game is really fun
just don't like how people play this game
always use the broken stuff"
11803,The best call of duty to date. Miss the good ol days!
11804,amazing
11805,blyat
11806,"Ramirez, Get that S.O.B
Ramirez, Check Your Fire
Ramirez, What the Fuck are you doing?

Attempting to improve the experience of a futuristic CoD game.

Ramirez, Stop, Just Stop."
11807,"I'm not looking to sink hours into a multiplayer game, so I did not touch the multiplayer mode. I hadn't really played a lot of CoD, until I picked up a bunch of them on sale, and I just played this to get it out of my backlog. 

The campaign is really good. I mean, really good. Solid Tom Clancy-esq story that picks up where Modern Warefare 1 left off. Intense action, your ears are almost as important as your eyes. Huge levels, getting attacked from all sides. I had a really great time during this game. A really great FPS. 

That being said, the campaign is about 5 hours long, and since I enjoyed the campaign so much, I almost finished it enitrely in one sitting. So... that should be factored into your decision. Personally, I'd rather have an awesome 5 hour game than get tired of a game streching out its content. But I don't think people buy CoD for the single player experience. 

The second controvery I remember from when this game comes out concerns on of the missions. [spoiler] You, as an American secret agent, infiltrate a Russian terrorist group. And you shoot up a Russian shopping mall, killing civililians. You can choose to not shoot civilians, or you can shoot them, but you can't stop the massacre. And at some point, police will respond, and you will need to kill them.  [/spoiler] People who are upset about that stage are making a good point - it's fair criticism. You will get prompted as soon as you start the game about ""a level which may be offensive to some."" It gives you the option to skip that mission, without penalty. And there truthfully is no penalty - you get an achievement at the end of every level, except that one. 

"
11808,15/11 IGN will play again
11809,LOve this
11810,I'm saying it's a great game because otherwise people gonna get mad.
11811,It's still a very fun game but the only complaint I have is that joining with friends doesn't always work.
11812,what the hell kind of name is soap
11813,"worst fucking game on steam I've seen... I legit cannot even launch it, and have gone through all fixes. Nice one retards."

11815,When I caught my son playing this game he was SHOOTING PEOPLPE AT AN AIREPORT!!!!11!! Don't let your kids watch it! 2/2
11816,One of the best games i ever played. Creat Muti-player game single player was good.
11817,"im not good at online PvP but it's worth the effort and money
i've played this campaign countless times and i still love it
even though i played the Modern warfare games out of order
(MW2-MW3-CoD4:MW) is the order i played them"
11818,This is arguably the best call of duty game. The magnum pistol is sadly underemphasized. Gameplay and maps are incredible. Nothing compares to Rust.
11819,For a 8 year old game this is still a awesome game to play always enjoy playing this game definitely for a type of person that likes shooters this the game for you.
11820,"DANGER CLOSE + ONE MAN ARMY PRO

Good game, good playerbase still."
11821,Multiplayer 8/10  Campaign 9/10
11822,It was alright.
11823,good game
11824,"Great game I would recommend the SP but MP is extremely toxic, few people, and lots of hackers."
11825,Good first person shooter. Practice for simulated war.
11826,"Got banned for getting 51 kills and 8 deaths on TDM 8 years after the games release, they said that I was cheating, wallhacking and shit, but I was a console smurf, I knew all the spots on every map, yet I got injusticed, but I hope no one else does,  it's a good game really"
11827,"Call of Duty in its prime. Fun to play, with all of the features you know and love in a Call of Duty game."
11828,"Best game, vac doesn't stop you from playing, pm me for more information"
11829,Last good game of the series.Single player was OP.Multi was fun.
11830,"This is the best game i ever played and also one of the first games i played on steam when this game first came out. I have so many memories with this game i wish this game was new again so people would be actually playing it. Got almost 1,000 hours on multiplayer. Highly recommended."
11831,I like it but when i went on steam and went to play it said i didnt own it when i purchased it already dnt know what to do
11832,Noice
11833,The best cod of all the series!!! I recommendo to every one that likes FPS.
11834,i feel ashamed.
11835,Very nice
11836,Great Game :)
11837,Don't buy game if you want you're xbox one controller all messed up while playing the game I was configuring my controls for 6 hours and still couldent get them right. I have requested a refund twice..

Runs great on most systems and still has a stable player base.

Also no RUSSIAN"
11840,Unbalanced
11841,great game
11842,"DON'T BUY THIS la(g)ame. I cannot play two matches in row without host migration or lost connection or lag, freeze etc. Finaly, found good team, play one match and then: connection lost. MW3 is way better and stable. 

Activision, please shut down this pain of the game or give us better support. Still, you sell game old about 10 years, and it's not cheap, in return we have shitty servers."
11843,Playing this game is like bicycling without wheels. Lots of fucking cheaters.
11844,Nice
11845,this game trash lol
11846,spent my teenage years on this baby. Thanks for the memories <3
11847,this game blows
11848,"how can i get a refund?

'"
11849,"[h1] Full of hackers, but still playable [/h1]
note that the multiplayer and campaign are launched seperatley so my multiplayer hours aren't what you see on this. I have 107 hours right now in multiplayer and I love it. The only COD I need.

It's definitley not as fun as it was. Considering you're likely to encounter at least 1 person cheating in any lobby you join. It very much is still playable though. Still a lot of fun and a lot of nostalgia to it. I played hundreds and hundreds of hours of it back in the day on Xbox and got max prestige. The community overall is pretty toxic and like I said full of hackers. So, if you don't mind that and still want to play I say go for it. I'm enjoying it a lot. No need to talk about the gameplay really, its MW2.  The cheaters are but a minor inconvience to deal with in order to enjoy one of the best FPS games of all time."
11850,"Pretty standard gameplay thats been done in all the previous call of duty games. Storyline was pretty average, not very exciting but not boring. Campaign takes about 4.5 hours to complete."
11851,fucking good
11852,Great
11853,good game
11854,"Graphics are awesome and gameplay is great. should have kept these maps for MW3
Would be nice if they combined MW2 and MW3 together"
11855,"For me It could be a fun game...
IF there wasn't kids in Multiplayer who just spamming the crap out of Noob-Tube or kids who are crying because of it.
But if u can manage to get into a lobby where are hardcore (not so pro but still) players are playing (NO Noob-Tube) then u gonna have fun. Besides this its a fun game:

- Shiet loads of guns.
- Fair amount of killstreaks.
- HUGE amount of emblems and stuff like that.
- Good maps (besides few, sadly the good maps like Highrise is rare (especially in Domination))

And....  WE WANT FAVELA BACK!!!!"
11856,Great Game
11857,i got VAC BAN :3
11858,"Well, I think it is a very hectic game and the spawns are horrible. There are too many hackers and not enough room for a new player to get better because as soon as you spawn.... BOOM you're dead. I thought i was just getting bad games until I finally realized that this was the whole game. I have 4 hours play time because I was trying to give it second chances but I realized it was a bad game. Steam will not give me refund."
11859,One of the best games for fun Coop missions to this day!
11860,:)
11861,"I received this game from a friend and I love it. The quality and graphics are amazing, but the screen of playing is too small. Overall though, I rate this game 9.5/10."
11862,"Since the day i got this game, i promised that it will always be the best game that ive ever played...
many games come and go, but this..this is a masterpiece! i mean its just perfect!
..the Multiplayer s lit af (  damn i still remember those nosleep weekend nights like yesterday..Ranking up, Supply Drops, GamerScore..uh life is good! ), and the storyline was beyond the awesomeness!! it was the first from its type to make me depressed enough to complet it in all defeculties just to killl the sh*t out of that f*cker called ""Shepherd"" ( ..sorry, cant hundle my self when it comes to betrayal! ).
i also wanted to point on the soundtracks, the word ""Legend"" aint the big one for Hans Zimmer, his beats is just..Flawless!‚ù§
‚ù§all the love and respect to all who had a hand in this‚ù§"
11863,This is by far the best call of duty game ever in my opinion
11864,"10/10.
Best COD so far"
11865,Well i Just Didn't like it
11866,10/10 Call Of Duty Game
11867,for me its the best call of duty ever created but the playerbase it's dead and full of hackers.
11868,"Very fun game, the best cod that has ever been made."
11869,Still the best in the series.
11870,Fukin sick
11871,campain is great. but too many cheaters online to even find 1 lobby with noone hacking.
11872,A definitive multiplayer experience that you could run on a toaster.
11873,Noice game. Lots fun. Much classic. Very modern.
11874,"The good ole days have come have passed and buried themselves among the sands of time. I long for the days of trickshotting and 420noscope. I enjoy one man army noob tubes, and i love getting killed by hackers. I love you Mw2."
11875,It's hard to find someone in this game anymore :(
11876,"The fact that you have to contact game support all the time is really annoying
hate the NAT thing
the game is awesome but it's ruined by bad support"
11877,The thing i have learned from this game that 90% of all prestige 10's are boosted
11878,Not bad.
11879,Game is fantastic!
11880,"Without doubt, the best Call of Duty game ever made. In no other game can you connect with characters in the way you can in MW2. Multiplayer also, in my opinion best ever."
11881,Amazing game for its time and still fun today.
11882,This game is so much fun!
11883,one of the best COD's ever released.
11884,The last really INTERESTING nd FUNNY CoD.
11885,I really enjoyed this game with a friend when it came out. Great storyline and really enjoyed the multiplayer!
11886,">be mw2
>be the most stereotypical American game ever
>MUH FREEDOM THEY'RE TAKING AWAY MY BURGER MUST DEFEND MY BURGERS!!!!!"
11887,"The game that made the COD  line up,  great story great shooting blast of fun and multiple scenarios very simple maps and objectives but it's from console  worth a buy and game has side modes survival which are more fun to me.
Graphically ok fast combat and free feel shooter aiming not clunky or slow a real shooter feel.
Buy this!
"
11888,Great game can play with a low spec PC
11889,Nostalgia..!!
11890,I got banned
11891,I personally began to get fond memories of the first modern warfare when I saw the original fan-favorite characters from cod 4 and I recommend this game without a doubt so go and get it now

11896,like the good old days
11897,"Awsome, fun game. Would recommend!"
11898,Superb game but be aware of cheaters and moded servers!
11899,"can't even connect to shit
why is this even on steam
it's been like an entire generation
pls."
11900,nice game
11901,"Best call of duty ever!, its so fun, long campain, awesome multiplayer and awesome players. The waiting time to join online takes abouth 2 min, but its fine its not too long. I really love the game made many friends and hope to see some of you guys on! :p"
11902,2nd worst community after Ghosts.
11903,Pretty gud game
11904,"I was more social on this than my entire time in middle school. When other people speak of the ""good times in school"" they speak of partys or sports games or crushes. I speak of 200-25 Domination matches, across the map noob tubing and 1v1s on the colosseum that is Rust. I have over 1,000 hours in this game, across 3 accounts, and I honestly do not regret a single one. This game has its ups and downs but few can deny that it and its brothers COD4 and MW3 changed the FPS genre for good. Its smooth, balanced (mostly), and downright fun. There is no greater rush than being 1 kill from a Nuke and trying not to f^&k up. 

To this day, I will still fire up the ole UMP45 suppressed just to reminace the good ole days.

Own this game."
11905,"This game is absolutely amazing and nostalgic. It's so amazing to play a game about actual warfare and not robots, machines and other ridiculous. I love the feeling i get playing this game. The perfect selection of weapons, to the calm sweet community. 
That was until I was falsley VAC banned. I never once installed hacks, mods nothing of sorts. I never got a respond when i repealed my ban. The only thing that could be even close was i installed what the game gave a link to install to fix the closed NAT network error. It did fix it and i was able to play with way much better ping and more players were on each game type, not even a day goes by and I get banned?
I love this game but they screwed me over this time, I wish I could play this game more but overall is a great game but I'm not too sure if i recommend it."
11906,"im a fan of call of duty you know? Like im one of those guys that played COD his whole life! Ofc on xbox and ps4 
so i went to go play the multiplayer. Ive never been so Upset in my life! Believe me when i tell you i almost cried and sent steam a nasty email about how i cant play it and their is no guide for it. BUT im a loyal cod fan so Ima just wait for some advice or a better computer!
"
11907,This Game is great
11908,"-easified
-cheesified
+nevermind"
11909,Modern Warfare 2 does not live up to a quality successor to Modern Warfare.  Multi-player is horrible and extremely limited.
11910,1v1 all your friends who piss you off on dust
11911,"222 hours played on multi. This game was the essential FPS back in the day.

I haven't played it recently but I remember extremely fun moments. It's a nostalgia pick and wholly better than the new CoD's"
11912,"What can I say about Modern Warfare 2.. 
This game was made perfectly, seeing very few patches and updates from launch.
This game had a fun (pub) side to it as well as professional side. 
There was no COD I liked mroe than MW2.

If people still played this game I would gladly drop my current game (Conan: Exiles [Check Conan Review for More] ) and run back to it! Still a great game!"
11913,iz dis aa gaim ? how du yu pley eet
11914,"Im so glad to be playing my favorite Cod series it was an awsome game still is thanks for putting on Steam.
"
11915,"mw2 multiplayer is the fucking worst, the most overpowerd weapon in the game is given to the players that are the highest level, so its like taking from the poor to give to the rich, it fucking sucks. And the graphics make it so the enemy is like invisible. not good"
11916,good game you may need too work on your quickscopes tho
11917,The best in the series
11918,The best modern warfare game ever.
11919,.
11920,Grate game one of the best cods out there however if your a console gamer there is no controler support so if your not good with a keybord and mouse like me you might want to wait or get it on ps3.
11921,Great game! It's a great follow up on the previous story
11922,"As the second iteration in the infamous Modern Warfare Series, I personally believe that it was revolutionary for Call Of Suty with mulitple different Kill streaks. With a Massive amount of guns and attacthments. Making the Mulitplayer a badass game to play. 
In the case of the singleplayer. I havent finished it. I just don't have a computer strong enough to handle the explosions.

I would still get the game.
"
11923,It's pretty lit fam tbh
11924,Incredible game!! Cannot wait to get mw3!
11925,nice game!
11926,Awesome game
11927,I really like this game
11928,"Lot's of nostalgic hours in this game, playing with friends for days on end.  One of my favourite entries in the franchise, right up to the point where it got swarmed with hackers and noone could play. Definately feel it was worth the money I had spent back in the day but today you're basically buying the singleplayer and COOP missions so, maybe during a generous sale..."
11929,Ewryr
11930,"Regarding the campaign, it continues the narrative from Modern Warfare, which is by far, one of my fondest memories of playing an FPS. This sequel is a solid followup, you grow to care about these characters, even if the scenarios they find themselves in are a bit contrived.

I would recommend this if you are a fan of Modern Warfare, the CoD series in general, or just looking to scratch that military FPS itch. 

"
11931,"Never change Infinity Ward, never change"
11932,Great Game!
11933,its ok but there are problems with host and a little bit chitters in this game but its generaly ok
11934,its real good just there are lots of modders please get rid of them and make these games good again please
11935,Verygood game but its community is dying I recommend playing with your friends it hilarious
11936,A great game! I love the colors!
11937,RIP multiplayer. i hope somebody fixes it.
11938,One of the best rated games in the series. Worth the price even for the single player.
11939,Can someone gift me this game pls
11940,great game if you have friends great for private game and stuff but if u get it get it on sale lots of hackers in the game so dont get mad if u run into them
11941,"Although the game is good in terms of performance and smoothness on my late-2013 MBPr 15 inch, there are two major problems that I've encountered in the game:


1. In the campaign mission ""Exodus"", if you die and respawn, you don't have the laser designator, without which it is impossible to pass the mission since there comes a part where you need to tag two anti-aircraft guns with the designator. The only way to pass this mission is to not die (very very hard - basically impossible).

2. In multiplayer, I've found it very hard so far to find games. In fact, I haven't found one stable lobby. But that could be down to my internet connection and NAT type.


All in all, it is hard to recommend this to someone since it's $20 for a few missions of the campaign and spec ops. Overall, COD 4 is a much better and more stable option than MW2."
11942,"Still a great game to play with friends 1v1ing on Rust or hop into a Free for All lobby and still play with some pretty legit players, every now and then you'll run into some hacker but most of them are chill and don't abuse what they have, back when this game was in it's prime i would play it almost everyday on console, however i've always favored Call of Duties games on console this in it's current state is still really good.
 I would recommend checking out G2A or some third party site to snatch a cheap copy of this game."
11943,"Classic COD, but don't bother buying this game unless you don't mind having your rank modified by a hacker and ultimately being banned for it."
11944,"Oh the good old times. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2... the time when COD made GOOD games.
Well the game is overall fun and has alot to do. Mainly Multiplayer but still, i repeat '' FUN AND LOTS TO DO! '' 
I have played the cracked version for a long time and playing it with old good players who still run it is fun.
"
11945,Very Very Good
11946,Not bad
11947,:)
11948,"Classic old school CoD, love it"
11949,General Sheperd is a bit of a prick not gonna lie.

11951,"TDM is back, wow, now game is amazing"
11952,"Seomthing ive been thinking about for awhile now is how blatantly pathetic major game studio ratings go with the hype of games. Let me get down with you guys on steam, as I tend not to post stuff like this on facebook. But more on here, where people actually give a shit. Anyway


Way back when COD Advanced Warfare came out, anyone remember how the major game mags and sites all rated it 9/10 or just flat out fucking amazing? Like, you never saw one bad review from the big guys. On any call of duty game, or any game thats in the spotlight. Why? I think, its because there afraid of telling someone ""Your game sucks""

All these major reviewers are afraid of never getting the chance to review a game with that company again, thus pushing themselves to give it a high rating due to the fact that they dont want to lose credibility with that publisher and studio.

It just boggles my mind, how so many people rated COD:AW with such high ratings, but almost immedietly the general public shat it out and spit in its mothers face. We all knew it was gonna suck, and be something that we didnt want, yet all those big named companies praised it. Im just sitting here looking at statistics and shit. Just baffled by how such a new and hyped game just doesnt show the numbers.

Look it up on steamcharts. Statistics show that COD: World At Fucking War has triple the amount of people playting it than COD:AW and MW remaster has COMBINED. Doesn;t that kind of say something? Why doesn't the producer shut out its community so much to the point that a game that was released almost 5 years ago it doing better than a game that came out late november of 2016?


I dont know, something that im sitting here boggling my mind with. Wondering why a company like that just goes and does whatever the fuck they want, because they know they will make a profit even though its not what the players want. Kids just pool there parents money into it, and frankly thats what is keeping the series alive. Ive been re-playing MW2, and I actually paused the game on day 6, mission retake the white house. Like, that shit could actually happen. I paused and I sat back and wondered just what the world would come to if something like that actually came around from russian forces. Firing an EMP into our airspace couldn't be stopped. Once it explodes thats lights out for electronic devices within its range. 

Then, you have the newer ones. The ones with jumping exo suits and shit. Like, when I played through the campaign on BO3. It felt more like a arcade shooter then anything. I didnt enjoy it from the story, I simply aimed and shot, then skipped through cutscenes because I couldnt give 2 shits. But with MW2, I ran through the streets of a state ive been in before. Ive shot up a fucking airport. Shit like that happens in real life, and I felt more connected to that then I ever will with a story. More modern weapons, no lazers or anything. I hope you get my point though. The more modern COD games were special and enjoyed because we the players have seen, and some people even live in the places they base the story off of. I know I shouldnt play COD for the story, but since its there I expect something more than a guided TDM against bots. I need to actually respect the chatacters and there backgrounds. The first time I played MW2, when sheperd betrayed you, little 13 or 14 old me was baffled. I sat back in my chair with my xbox controller in hand and just thought of all the things that ive done in the missions before this for commander. Then he just goes and kills roach, you the player and ghost. Using your character, but also using you as a player who went through all of it before. It shocked me as the bullet went through ghost's chest, and all the sudden im staring down the barrel. Its simply something that isnt in the newer CODs, and I guess since I grew up playing those types of games, I expect to have something like that every time. But its seems as though in the last few years that the companies who make these games simply dont care about what has happened in the past. Ever since BO3 and a little bit of BO2, the storyline aspect of the COD series has dwindled. Leaving more players in the dust asking for more.

Just a little rant that I had to get out to whoever the hell actually goes through the activity page. 
I might put more stuff out, stuff thats gaming related that i wont post on facebook."
11953,call of duty is the stupidest fucking game i have ever played lol. my gaming laptop can't even run it. and there are no servers for rich people such as myself. also is it too much to get some good wine around here xddddddddddddddddddddASFSKEGUISUUFKFUCKFORJ43K4KK43P4K

11959,The memories...
11960,best cod game in my opinion
11961,The best episode of an Epic Trilogy. Movie Quality.
11962,"THIS.  GAME.  ROCKS.
Infinity Ward's CoDs of yore are awesome in how you jump right into the levels and start PLAYING; Treyarch's are much more story-driven, having to wait through initial level setup cinematics, well also during.  
This game made 2009 for me, good times.
And the sound design is MAGNIFICENT.  As an aspiring game audio guy, I love going to the museum to hear how solid the interactive sfx is handled without Balfe's killer soundtrack filling the aural roomspace - simply stunning sound and music, I can't sing its praises enough.
10/10.
"
11963,"Still very good, hackers are surprisingly uncommon, but definitely there. dont buy the dlc tho, itll segregate your multiplayer matches to only people who have that same dlc"
11964,"do i need a gaming pc, because i cant play multiplayer but i can play the campaign and re-downloading it doesn't work"
11965,kkk
11966,"The amount of bullshit I had to go through to get all the achievements in the game was infuriating. But the game was fairly enjoyable and in my opinion the best Call Of Duty game in the franchise.

I rate the overall experience a 7,8/10. Ghost didn't deserve this"
11967,"Runs well on my potato of a computer. The only things that would make this better, was if there was a survival mode and people who actually played multiplayer.

11970,"An interesting follow up the perfect FPS game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 continues the story arc of the antaginis 5 years after the events of the first Modern Warfare game. However A LOT of infomation gets left out, such as 'who is this new bad guy', 'how did Captain Price get locked up in a gulag', and 'why does General Shepard betray the 141'. Apart from this the game offers the good boots on the ground experience we got from the first MW game.

11971,You shoot people and have fun
11972,How to open nat?????

11975,i got VACed for no reason plz help
11976,"Dont buy it , this game is the shitiest of all cods , if you like to snipe forget about this game , if you are sprayer who likes to fight in close quarter maps then its for you  ugly fast action  with absurd shit like  having to shoot twice with a sniper rifle , usless perks etc , but the worst of all its full of cheaters and people who are modding the game online , of course if you wanna hack you will need to pay some money for a cheat , the are no servers list , the game choose a player as host and the host can disconnect and ruin the game  the connection its terrible and sync as well etc, crap game.."
11977,"Love this game, no matter how old it gets, it will never be boring to me. I could play this for countless hours! Deff a good game for someone looking to play something new if you don't already own it. I would reccomend to any fan of Call of Duty! Hands down the best Call of Duty ever made."

11987,"In my own oppinion the best Call of Duty game I have played , and it is likely is going to be one of the best games to go back to and have some funs. :)"
11988,"Best Call of Duty game of all time, that is it."
11989,i think the game is old but it is still cool
11990,"Enjoyable fast paced combat where i feel reaction time means everything, this game in particular out of all the call of duty games is at the top in terms of fluidity of the weapons,graphics,fun factor and overall performance on many systems. This game created an intervention in which so many new features such as what is now known as quick scoping became a enjoyable concept that could be used to test your overall skill in terms of accuracy and the positioning you took to get a vantage point over your enemies. This is truly a great game i reccomend you try if you ever get the chance to as it was a pinnacle of the gaming community at its timepoint with its great innovative features and impressive gameplay, it really created something new unlike so many of the new call of duty franchise pieces we have today that merely try to rinse and repeat what Infinity Ward had created in the past. Great game a timepiece for sure, thank you have a good one!"
11991,"The countless hours I have played on this game on xbox was extremely fun, getting this game on pc was a really good idea too. It still has a decent amount of players playing it now, and there is a problem with hackers, but it's totally worth playing. The campaign is one of my favorite in the cod franchise, and I personally think it's got the best campaign in the whole franchise."
11992,Great game and the singleplayer is awesome but the multiplayer doesn't work well anymore after the most popular game mode (TDM) stopped working on 2/13/17. Until that gets fixed dont waste your money if you are hoping for a lot of play time.
11993,"This is a solid game which is still extremely entertaining in 2017, for those who've never played this game before; PLAY IT!"
11994,gg boii
11995,"If you never played this game you might not like it because it is unreasonably balanced, although it's a hell of a good time.
Even with the Bullshit factor this game is still GOLD to me. I recommend it!

8.5/10

My only complaint is that there are not alot of players remaining... less than 100 because TDM doesn't work anymore, Please fix this!!! Free For All is fine and so is Domination."
11996,masterpiece
11997,"This CoD and Black Ops 2 are my all time favorites. On the Xbox 360, I had 52 days time played and accumlated 142 nukes. Even though this one did have alot of frustrating game play functions/glitches like Commando lunges, One Man Army, Danger Close noob tubes, Javelin drops, automatic AC-130's, care package marker knifing and probably a few more, I still had an absolute blast with this game. I just wish more people played online so I could get intot something besides FFA."
11998,"Nobody plays online, I've searched for multiple matches 15 minutes at a time and have found no game. Not worht the 20 bucks to just play a short campaign."

12000,10/10 game love sniper fighting my friends
12001,"If you're looking for a solid MW2 multiplayer experience you'll have to install a mod that supports dedicated servers (the mod is great by the way). Otherwise you'll have to use the crappy P2P connection and you'll more than likely never find a match. Story is of course good, and this is probably the last Call of Duty that is actually fun to play (well, and Black Ops). I highly recommend this to people looking for a good multiplayer experience (with the mod of-course)."
12002,Where's my exo suit?
12003,"They removed one of the best maps in the game (favela) for stupid reasons and they didn't make it come back to PC yet. What's worse, the servers are down for almost a week now, literally all of them, 0 servers 0 players. I didn't oay this game in order not to be able to play it... No one should buy it until they fix all of these issues, and I wouldn't even recommend buying it afterwards."

The campain is awesome, it's futuristic, yet, in modern times.

The multi-player is great! Aside from the few hackers and Noob-Tubers I come across with.

Private Multi-Player is fun and challenging, there is a bunch of different modes and settings I can't even list them all.

All in all this is the best COD ever made, and no other COD can replace it


Just remember, nO rUsSiAn"
12011,"I didn't like the story but alot of people did. But i'd say dont get this for the story.

Multiplayer is full of hackers (thx for boosing me to lvl 70, i don't have to level myself now :D) so dont get it for the multiplayer aswell.

Does this Game have a coop? Well idk. Just don't get this game ;) CoD 4 is better anyways, get this one if you want a good game ;)"

12017,"Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Review

Modern Warfare 2 continues about 5 years after where Modern Warfare left off and actually the campaign itself isn't that great. The first Modern Warfare's campaign was exhilarating and visually stimulating. Lastly though it had some poignant things to say about war and it's eventuality of it. As it progressed, things became increasingly dire. However all these things are present in Modern Warfare 2 kicked up to an 11, but without half as much substance. All of this is fine, but unfourtanately not only is the campaign laughably short, but it's story ends up feeling like a side step of what would become a trilogy of games. The campaign also suffers in the way it's structured. It's all about balls to the wall action, which is fun, but feels as if it's inherently at odds with what Modern Warfare 1 did. 

After all this you might think I might hate the game, but I did enjoy myself. I don't tend to think too much about what a game brings thematically, since I believe that gameplay is king, but in the case of there being 12 or COD games. I'd say that for the most part if you are buying them for their campaign then Modern Warfare 2 and even 3 should be the last ones to buy as I do feel they are the weakest in the series. Not by much since they all try to dazzle you with setpieces, but the other's fell more consistent and fun than Modern Warfare 2 or even 3

I played this game on a GTX 970, Windows 10, I7 3820 Computer and it ran well for the most part, but just like the old COD's, this game does stutter when it saves or loads, which is odd. Other than that it ran well, and didn't give me much issues. I hesitate to say the game is beautiful, because besides the always impressive locales and setpieces the Modern Warfare series feels like the weakest of the bunch when it comes to artistic design. At least I mean to say that it stays mostly the same after the first Modern Warfare. Unlike Black Ops and Black Ops 2, which fell like they have a more distinct visual style that helps it in terms of selling you that the graphics improve with each title. 

I really can not reccomend Modern Warfare 2 for the campaign alone and I'd even say with the multiplayer. I'd feel you would have much better bang for your buck with Black Ops 2. Of course this is just my opinion, but in a sea of COD games I do feel there are better than Modern Warfare 2 or 3 which unfortunately don't hold up all that well with age."
12018,yes i do love this game and the multiplayer is perfect but just a while ago the servers just didnt work for me and i wont connect to any game on any gamemode it allways says 0/0 players online pls fix that but else great game even today
12019,This game is not fun anymore and the shit thing is i cant get a refund :)
12020,I'm not recommending it because i don't want my friends to have as much fun as i do while playing this game. #420Blazeit

12028,"Grenade Launchers and hackers. Other than that its Call of Duty, you know what to expect. I cant help myself but to like this game through nostalgia and call of duty just being a fun casual shooter to not take seriously. Trying to find TDM and joining a hacked Domination lobby/10"

12033,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, 

In my opinion this is one of the best Call of Duty's ever made. I always played this game a couple years back on the XBOX360. I quit playing and a couple days back I saw a video about MW2 and I just bought the game.

I already played 27 hours of multiplayer and finished the capaign. I just love this game and I will play this game for many many hours. (I already played this game more then I played IW (100 euro's) version.

Lets hope this years Call of Duty will be good again!"

Player will blending in with amazing narrative storyline plus hollywood grade soundtracks while shooting, chasing, and escaping.

The shooting part was great but there is problem with difficulty logic, on Hardened/Veteran difficulty all enemies has 'aimbot' for player movement, increasing of shooting accuracy to player. On Additional of your teammates on singleplayer campaign despite with their rank 'Captain' or 'Sargeant' WILL not able to shoot enemies properly, Bad AI Teammates on Hardened/Veteran difficulty though... 

Still, one of the best FPS games out there mate, worth to play 

Don't let the Bandwagon-cod-hater cloud your judgement xD"
12040,good old days
12041,"The more things change, the more things stay the same.

Infinity Ward is back with Modern Warfare 2, the sequel to their critically acclaimed and commercially successful, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The story continues in this installment as we see the return of familiar faces.

Story: Modern Warfare 2 ups the ante with its story from its predecessor. The campaign follows a special forces unit who is lead by Captain Soap MacTavish (who you got to control in the previous game) and the United States Army Rangers, that are  after Vladimir Makarov. He is the leader of the Russian Ultranationalist party which follows in the footsteps of Imran Zakhaev (who was the antagonist in the first game). The pacing of the story is near perfect. As usual, the first mission involves throwing the player into a training pit where he or she gets to learn about the controls of the game. And from that point on, the game resembles something like a Hollywood blockbuster film. There are loud and bombastic action set-pieces, dialogue which develops each character's personality and above all, memorable scenarios and characters. Sometimes you have to take the stealth approach to missions. Other times, you go loud and guns blazing. This delicate balance of missions is done superbly. All the story missions should take you just over 4 hours to complete.

Graphics: Modern Warfare 2 was released in 2009 and it still looks great today. There is much detail to be found in the textures, characters and environments of the game. While the special effects such as fire, smoke and rain do a great job at immersing the player into the digital battlefields rendered by Infinity Ward. The graphics are used to great effect to accentuate the themes presented by the game, such as hopelessness and peace.

Sound: The sound design is once again, done fantastically by the programmers at Infinity Ward. Each gun when used, sounds impactful as bullets pierce through the air. You can hear the thunderous roar of cannons as they are blasted into the enemy. Likewise, the voice actors have done a tremendous job in bringing life to their characters. Ghost is one of my favourite characters as his cynical and cool demeanour is complemented by his country British accent. Every emotion exhibited by the characters, whether it be happiness or sadness is exemplified by the excellent voice acting and is feels authentic to listen to.

Gameplay: The same fast-paced and addictive gameplay of COD 4, returns in Modern Warfare 2 with some slight adjustments. No longer can you lean left and right to sneak a peek at enemies and shoot safely. I believe this is decision was for the best to discourage camping and to push for gameplay that is faster and even more frantic. Additionally, when you are shot, not only is there a red arrow which tells you the direction of the shot but also an additional splattered blood effect which appears on screen. As you keep receiving shots, more and more blood appears on the screen and I think this is a cool feature to let you know to take cover. Again, like COD 4 it feels very satisfying to land a kill in the game as the controls as smooth and snappy.

Overall, Modern Warfare 2 has been the sequel I had hoped for. Everything that was in COD 4 is cranked up to the nth degree with graphics, gameplay and even story improvement. There is also an additional Spec Ops mode which lets you team up with a buddy online to tackle special missions designed around environments found in the campaign. This is the near perfect FPS and is a must-play.

9.5/10."

12060,This game is fun... It's old but it gives me a feeling of what was popular in the years just prior to when i started gaming
12061,Good b ut noob tubers and campers can fuck off
12062,"Game is basically dead. 50% of the players are hackers/cheaters which ruin the game completely. 30% of the players are veterans of the game and will penetrate you. The last 20% are the sort of ok players who just want to have some nostalgic fun playing a legendary game. In terms of game modes which are still somewhat active, it's either FFA, TDM, Domination and S&D. That's it, If you don't like any of them, you are practically screwed. Funnily enough, nukes happen basically every game which takes away the feeling of actually getting one. The offline capabilities are pretty good. Campaign is fun but I don't really care about spec ops as I've never been interested in it. Also, this game doesn't support mods (UNLIKE EVERY OTHER COD) and doesn't have controller support (UNLIKE BASICALLY MOST COD GAMES ON STEAM). Honestly if you are considering to buy this game, you should either buy it only for the singleplayer, have 15 other friends who play the game so you don't have to get into public lobbies and play in a private one or, you buy this game on a key site i.e G  2  A as the ¬£20 or ¬£10 on a sale is definetely not worth it over a game which is filled with cheaters, has been abandoned by it's devs, has a VAC system which doesn't work completely, and put it simply, been destroyed by the community which makes all of the honest people who just wanted some fun like me, miserable and makes us want to return our money."

12075,"game is still ok, not as good as original call of duties, they went ham with stupid killstreaks here and noob tube etc and also quickscope is op as FUCK. also watch out for besiege clan modders, they remove stun grenades and force u into 9v9 domination chaos mode"
12076,"Excellent port. Didnt even know 4k was an option for a 2009 console game.

Excellent story. Fun to play. ~5 hours campaign. Contains sub plot about defending Washington from foregin invasion, an underrepresented concept in games. Pushes boundaries with No Russian. 

10/10."
12077,good
12078,"still holds , not balance , not futuristic and quite unrealistic . but hell of a fun ! this and black ops 1  are the best cods in my option , had 350 hours played back in the days . if you thinking to give it a try, go for it ppl still play it, and hackers are to min.(everyone is expecint remastered version this year , lets hope this is true )"

12082,"Bite Size Review - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2

The Good:
-The single player and coop modes are still really good
-Graphics hold up pretty well, and it would still run well on old systems
-For $10 (on sale) this game really players well and is fun

The Bad:
-Multiplayer (though still alive with players) only consists of veterans and hackers
-I beat this game on veteran on the 360 way back when, now adays though I kind of recognize that there is a problem with that difficulty setting

The Verdict:

There is not much to say about this game. As many people know this is one of the best Call of Duties every made - the single player is great, the coop mode is great if you have an interested friend, and the multiplayer is great if you can find a game without and hackers in it. On sale for approx $10 if you are a fan of CoD or shooters you can definitely get your moneys worth from this game."
12083,"Give us a remastered version!

Edit:

Things I personally like to see changed in a COD MW2 remaster:

- No Tube, Thumper, RPG or AT-4 (Why the AT-4 you ask? Because if noobs can't use the tube or rpg, they will use the at-4)

- NAT-type open/strict bull shit gone! - Dedicated servers

- NO Deathstreaks; the fact that someone sucks doesn't mean someone else has to pay for it

- Perk system fix: for example; when using Ninja Pro, you are also not visible on a heartbeat sensor... no one needs that

- Favela map back in Multiplayer

- Killstreaks choose ability: for example; if you have the UAV and a Harrier, sometimes it would be nice to use your UAV for choosing where to put the harrier.. gotta use the harrier first...

- Protection for your killstreak; for example that your Pavlow can't be shot down within the first 20-30 seconds

- No Spray & Pray weapons, like the G18 akimbo and AA-12 shotgun

- No camping (if you have played I W 4 M or now I W 4 X, you know the fix they have for it)

- Last stand or Final stand? Fuck off! It only says that you are a noob because you need a 2nd chance to get the kill

- TDM rounds that can take longer then 10 min or more then max. 7500 points

- FFA rounds that can take longer then max. 30 kills


Possible adds:

- More game modes, like Quickscope only, Gun-Game or Zombie

- Other maps from old COD's like Carentan from COD1


Agree with my list or maybe have some possbile adds? Let me know in the comments down below!"
12084,Its sad that I paid 20‚Ç¨ for this game. I mean it's a classic and a good game but if you charge me 20‚Ç¨ make sure to ensure and work on your ortection against hackers. Every second or third game someone is hacking.
12085,Still haveing a blast playing this game!
12086,"Multiplayer doesn't work.
I either get into a lobby with ping over 300ms or
a lobby with Russian hackers valve is too lazy to address.
The game used to be good, USED TO.
Dont buy it whatsoever, wait for a new cod instead.
Valve is useless at dealing with hackers nowadays."
12087,"[b]""History is written by the victor."" -Shepard[/b]

Modern Warfare 2 is my personal pick for the best game in the Call of Duty franchise, and arguebly one of my picks for the best FPS game of all time. I have so much history with this game. I've put so many hours into the multiplayer back on console, and just beat the campaign for the 4th time. This was also my second Call of Duty game; My first being kind of an obsure one: Call of Duty 3 on the Wii. I still remember playing this game for the first time like it was yesterday, and it just blew me away. It was once I played the game after growing up a bit where I realized how great this game really is.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
- The graphics have aged like fine wine. I always like to use this game as a game that has aged really well. The graphics on max settings still look great. It looks nothing like a game released in 2009.
- The campaign is fantastic. I would know because I've played it 4 times. It has some of the most memorable missions in CoD. My personal favorite mission is a close tie between Enemy of my Enemy and Second Sun.
- The campaign can be challenging on a higher difficulty, actually requiring you to use cover. Yes, using cover in a Call of Duty. I know it sounds bizarre. It's also rewarding to play on a high diffculty because you get achievements for every mission you beat. I beat the game on Hardened, and will possibly play through it again sooner or later to get the Veteran achievements.
- Spec Ops gives you some neat little missions to play after beating the campaign. You can even play through them with a buddy!
- Voice acting is pretty good.
- The characters are great, and memorable.
- The game is so well written. It is a very quotable game.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- Multiplayer is a mixed bag. It's pretty broken. Let's be honest. Noobtubing is way too OP. The PC version is also said to be riddled with hackers that can get you VAC banned by giving you level 70. So Multiplayer is actually dangerous to play on. I have 6 hours into multiplayer and have actually not ran into many hackers, and I haven't been VAC banned. Most of the reviews that claim this are old, so maybe they fixed their anti-cheat or something.
- There's no FOV slider to increase the disgusting 65 FOV. You can increase your FOV in SP and MP using third party programs. There's a guide on how to accomplish this [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=154105687]here[/url]. I personally use 80, because 90 makes your arms look like they're 5 feet long, which looks odd. If you're worried about being VAC banned online for ""cheating,"" I've used the FOV changer in MP and I haven't gotten banned yet.
- This game is still priced at $20, with the game+DLC being a ridiculous $45. It's 8 years old. That kind of money for an 8 year old game is laughable.
- Singleplayer and Multiplayer are two seperate Steam games, which can look awkward. I don't know why they didn't do what [url=http://i.imgur.com/gm7pGxS.png]GTA V did[/url] with their singleplayer and online mode.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Modern Warfare 2 is a great game. I always just loved it. It's a game that I can play any day of the week, and still have fun playing it. The campaign and spec ops is worth a purchase alone.

Should you buy it? [b]YES, but only on a sale. $20 is too much for a game this old.[/b]"

12100,"Coming back to this game after so many years, I am jolted with nostalgia. The first Modern Warefare game that was released back in 2007 was an amazing experience, especially when playing with friend. February 2009 when this game was announced I was psyched to play the multi-player and the co-op missions. The new COD titles are okay, but when compared to MW1 and MW2, they pale in comparison."
12101,"The simpleness of Modern Warehouse, the upgrades of Modern warefare 3. Can't go wrong."
12102,"ok so in mw2 you play as a soldier but not any soldier an american soldier who is supr cool and an elite soldier because he is a good soldier and is a very good soldier who can kill alot of people because good soldiers kill a lot of bad soldiers because the bad soldiers are evil and shit and they are russian but the civilian russians are not bad because they are civilians and they dont kill anyone but this guy called makarov shoots up an airiport with his pals but he shoots u 2 but ur actually an undercover agent working for the america and your name is PFC allen but you arent fucking important at all because you already died wtf nobody cares. ok so then they have to go and torture a black guy so they can find a white guy who sells guns because the black guy is the white guy who sells guns assistant so then this guy called john ""soap"" mactavish leads you on the mission because he was the guy u played as in the old game and he still has the gun from when price threw it at him to kill makarovs dad then soap shot the soldiers and zakaehv and it was really emotrional because gaz diedd but gaz is actually ghost who is really cool and relateable with the kids because he has a cool mask which looks like a skeleton so why isnt he called skullduggery pleasant ffs. ok where was I ok they find out that they have to go find a  guy in the gulag so they go kill rusians in the gulag but not the guy in the gulac who is important because he is important and he's actually captain price and when soap finds price he's like ""this belongs 2 u sir"" and then price is like ""soap we will have a nice shag later okay"" and then they run out of the gulag but the gulag is falling apart so they attach themselves to ropes and they fly out of the gulag because the ropes are attached to helicopters and they are attached to the rope so they escape from the gulag then it explodes like BOOMRHIOPJAE0PFOHIAEO0PRFHIJEAS90DHR0 and it is really cool like a micheal bay movie. ok so then cockroach and price go to winter russia and they have to stop the nukes like last gaem but this time ghost says ""price the nukes are gonna blow up in spaec"" then price is like ""goed"" because the nukes blow up the rusian helicopters which causes them to DIE because they forgot how to use parashoots. but then keith david and rameriz are in america fiting the russians because makarov started ww3 by killing a shit ton of ppl in the russia so america is like ""ok lets bomb washington D.C.""  but there are still soldiers in D.C. so then the ranger theme starts playing and its really good it goes DUUUUN DUUN DUN DUUUUN DUN DUN DUUUUN DUUNN DUN DUN DUUUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNN and then they get orange sticks that make green fire and they wave them around and the america doesnt bomb washingtom D.C. because they like the colour green and then coropal dunn says ""sir when are we gonna go to moscow"" and then another guy says ""idk but we will burn it down wen we get there"" and they go to moscow and fucking fuck it up big time then meanwhile the SAS goes to Afganistian BUT at the same time they go to Endor and then on endor they are ambushed and then ghost is like ""ambush!"" and then metal circles come out of the ground and start blowing up but cockroach dodges them cause he has time slowing power and then he starts shooting all the cyka russians like pow pow pow and bang bang bang and they die because guns kill because they shoot bullets which will kill u because they are very sharp and travel at a fast speed when they are shot so they go into markerovs house and ghost is like ""this place is a bloody goldmine"" so they start stealing makarov's Personal logs which say ""I sided with the railroad in fallout 4"" so if they show the logs to everyone they will realise makarov is evil so then they goto the helicopter BUT THENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN SPOLIER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOLIER SPOLIER SPOILER SPOLIER!

12120,The Best COD Series
12121,best game ever made.
12122,I think that this game is as good as i was when i played it on console but on pc looks even better 10/10 from me.
12123,"Still lives up to how much fun I had when I played this game many years ago on the PS3.

Campaign is just a simple story, (Good Americans and Brits, Russian Invasion, Betrayal and a chase on an International Terroist), nothing really too special but each level has something new to bring in terms of gameplay. The campaign is short, but has a lot of replay value with collecting hidden 'Intel' and clearing the game on the hardest difficulty being 'Veteran'. 

Spec Ops is like a group of bonus missions that have various unique objectives, for example wave defense against enemies and stealth evasion to an objective. Spec Ops is especially good with a partner. Spec Ops has a total of 23 missions and are ranked based on difficultly in groups; ""Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta and Echo"". 

The multiplayer aspect I thought would be dead by 2016. But when I picked this game back up... there are still plently of people and small communities looking to grow with hosting servers. The Notably 'MW2 DediGamer' which are a set of host located in Australia for us Aussies. MW2 had a hectic multiplayer and still is today, with a crazy variety of weapons, perks, killstreaks and more. 
(I myself have over 100 hours on the steam version, but I played the multiplayer most during its prime)
As always multiplayer is prone to hackers, lag etc. But it still is a fun game espically having not played this game for many years. 

Overall 8/10 This is a game I have enjoyed for many years and is definitely a classic of 'Call of Duty' games. 

Definitely would recommend this game if you have not played it before, or if your just interested in Call of Duty. This franchise has been up and down lately, but the older games are some of the most golden. 
Pick it up when it is on sale!"
12124,My favorite COD game of all time I have been playing it ever since it came out
12125,"Its a great game with an amazing campaign, amazing music froom Hans Zimmer, and spec ops. I like the multiplayer other than the fact that the hit detection is trash and how there are alot of other flaws with multiplayer.
8/10
p.s. the multiplayer is so rage inducing that i dont under stand why people like the multiplayer."
12126,"One of the better CODs out there.  No space-age garbage, mediocre campaigns, and hectic multiplayer that's poorly paced."
12127,its a really great game the only problem is when i move my mouse a little bit it does a 360 turn even with the slightest movement and i dont know why i would really like to play this again its well worth the money but only if you can sort out the problem im having
12128,good
12129,noice game

12170,The best game I have ever played.The story is amazing.I feel worth to buy it
12171,its good like top 3 cod games
12172,"     I was a big Call of Duty fan since Modern Warfare (Call of Duty 4) but never actually got around to giving this game a shot. I HAVE NOT played the multiplayer and everything stated will be directed at the campaign.
    I was scrolling through my Steam library and decided to give MW2 a shot when I remembered Call of Duty games have single player modes as well. Thats right, after thousands of hours I was going to give COD single player a shot. I had extremely low expectations as I figured these games were certainly tailored to the multiplayer FPS crowd. My expectations exploded within minutes of starting the game. 
    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's campaign mode is absolutely amazing. Not only is the combat one of the best FPS experiences, the story is great, and the level of good ole' fashioned fun is absolutely sky high. This is one of the most fun campaigns I have EVER played. The variated of levels, forcing you to use different styles, and the high speed thrill ride of a story will have adrenaline pumping through you like a Miller on Packer sunday. 
    One of the negatives (and it's true- it is a large one) is the length of the game. I started it one night, and had finished it by the next morning. I believe it was a measily 8 hours or so long, but I stayed in my seat the whole time excited for the next level (my piss bucket got full that night!).
    Since playing MW2 I have played a few other COD campaigns and they were also good. I don't know if it is because it was my first, but this campaign is just plain amazing. I would without doubt recommend you try the campaign."
12173,"IMO, one of the best Call of Duty's of all time. Singleplayer & Multiplayer is definitely a A++
Such classic! Brings some good nostalgia..."
12174,Multiplayer problem..hmm
12175,"2017 and still fun to play! Also a decent number of players.Not like before,but there is a decent number of players."
12176,"Memory lane, best game ever."
12177,Best cod so far! Hope they remaster it but dont change the core!
12178,"MW2
Here are some short and bold words for this game:
*Get the game now
*Hackers are rare so far for me at least
*Save money here and not on Infinite Warfare
*Servers still work

12179,This game is.. O.K.
12180,"Good old classic COD, with very few cheaters on multi compared to many of the other installments. Recommended for those just looking to play a good solid fps."
12181,This is one of the last great Call of Duty games made.

12187,almost 8 years old and still one of the best game i have ever played my only complaint is that the mouse contorls are kind wonky but that is only a small complaint

 the only prob is that you can not use a f****** 
controller."
12189,"After 7.5 years, this is still the best Call of Duty multiplayer experience you can get. It may be unbalanced, maybe there are some hackers/modded lobbies, but it's just really [b]fun[/b] game. A lot of people still play it, sou don't worry about finding a lobby, it takes about 3 seconds for me to get into a lobby on TDM or FFA.
And about the campaign, the Modern Warfare series has a great story to offer, so it is worth to play through. Not talking about the soundtrack, Hans Zimmer is a god."
12190,how do i disable the campaign's speed run option
12191,old but gold

Nice shooter game. Even though it's old, still remains gold."
12193,"My only problem is the multiplayer, the gameplay is good fun but the matchmaking is trashier than a 12 year old's comebacks."
12194,"Good game, ruined by bugs on the Mac version. Three missions in a row which had to be repeated one too many times because of bugs (like being stuck on calling artillery/air support, not being able to shoot). Modern warfare 1 was bug free, so this is surprising."
12195,Awesome.
12196,Best game
12197,"best game ever , old is gold"
12198,"My childhood.
This game introduced me to first person shooters and will always hold a place in my heart.


It runs great on pc btw, I figure that's why you're down here in the reviews.
"
12199,"So Modern Warfare 2 is on PC and I've never played it so I decided to pick it up since I've heard it's pretty good. Looking down at the reviews however made me a little worried as it said the game was filled with hackers. Surprisingly though, I haven't really run into one yet. I would say it's due to where I live if it weren't for the fact I live in a somewhat populated area. I have no idea, but everything works extremely well. I wouldn't pick up the DLC however because the servers take you and mix you in with the other people that have bought the DLC. However, you won't be able to play on standard servers (a.k.a the majority of hte MW2 community) and will have a hard time finding a match. Matches aren't the hardest to find if you look in the evening. Overall, wonderful experience as far as gameplay. Each gun has the right amount of ""oomph"" to it. If you are interested in getting MW2, I would recommend it."
12200,amazing game 10/10
12201,FOR THE MOTHERLAND LULULULULULU AIRSUPPORT REQUESTED! CAPTAIN WE NEED SUPPLIES! CAPTAIN I NEED TO SCRATCH MY BACK! CAPTAIN TWO THOUSAND SOLDIERS AWAITING YOUR COMMAND! WHERE'S THE CAPTAIN?!
12202,"MW2 is one of the best franchises (Modern Warfare) , one of the best FP Shooters, and probably one of the best games hands down.
Great Campaign and Multiplayer. Although MP is full with noobtubes and hacked lobbies, I still appreciate the game by itself.

I have played this game waaaay too much (not on steam). 

I know several people or game critics may disagree (like totalbiscuit) but I really like it as a fan and as a non fan too."
12203,cool stuff! ^^
12204,i wish i can get a refund :( bad lag and hackers everywhere.... dislike
12205,This game has given me hundreds of hours of enjoment.
12206,"Good game,good story,good multiplayer.

8/10 Not a bad game"
12207,"Thought this game was a very exciting game when it came to campaign and multiplayer, this game ultimately was the start of Call Of Duty's downfall. With balls to the wall action which replaced the theme of being another soldier on the battlefield to being a lone wolf super soldier that is usually only viewed in games like Halo, and Crysis.  The multiplayer is even more broken, but is still fun."
12208,pretty good
12209,great game!!! but is there a way to use a controller for this game at all?Thanks
12210,"PFUIi
IHH
BAAH"
12211,"I have played many CODs (campaigns) and this one is certainly among my favorites. The various locations and missions are great, the graphic is still very good and immersive. Highly recommended even today."
12212,"how to disable low violence plise helpp :((
"
12213,The best Call of Duty game.
12214,To many hacker but fun to play with freineds.

12218,"Great game I like to play with my friends even though they suck at the game and i just keep beating them but you know, gotta have something to do. Also the best Call of Duty campaign i've played so far.




Still great"
12219,"Old FPS game which still holds up. Very fun. I highly recommend the multiplayer aspects over the story, but both are great."
12220,They don't make them like this anymore :(
12221,Op  one of the best games ive ever played even after 7 years its still the best
12222,One of the best game I have ever played!
12223,"Absolutely the best game in the series of the CoD'e, because it is something that is not present in other parts of the series. 

This ""Intervention"" sniper rifle, and amazing quickscope. 

I do not have enough words to tell you how much this game masterpiece."
12224,IM REALY REALY ANGFRY IG OT VACKED AND I DIDNT DO ANTHIGN>>> PLEASE
12225,"One of the Best Call of Duty game I've played so far. Although it's a tie between Call of Duty¬Æ: Black ops¬Æ and Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2, this game will always have a place in my heart. To see a remaster 10 years after in 2019, I'm already sold. Thank you Infinity Ward for such an amazing game, hopefully you can make up for Infinite Warfare¬Æ in 2019, but other than that, MW2 is my favorite.

edit 11/29/2020 Thanks for MW 2019! truly a masterpiece game."
12226,"good game,has good gameplay"
12227,This game stole my life back in 2009 and 2010
12228,"Quickscoping, after all this time is still a blast.
Sue me."
12229,I wish it was 2006 again so  that I could appreciate how this game was so good
12230,"It's a pretty fun game, but it's too many damn hackers. Thanks. I can recommend if you get into a good lobby, which happes only occasionaly."
12231,Best Multi ever
12232,very nice graphic stunning gameplay and rich sory also makes me sad :( a little
12233,wow god game <3 man < nic work
12234,"Disregard the amount of hours you see played here! I had another account from a friend where i have played over 350 hours. 

I am returning to this game mostly for Spec Ops which is by far one of the best coop experience in the gaming world even at this moment. 

Definately worth buying and playing. Enjoy!!!"
12235,"I bought this game to replay the singleplayer portion of the game since I used to play it a lot when I had an Xbox 360 and I wanted to experience the nostalgia of playing through it once again. And I have to say, it sure delivers on that and more!

I played through Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare right before jumping into this one to better understand the story and of course to re-experience CoD 4 as well. During the 8 hours I spent completing the campaign of Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) on Veteran I never once got bored, this is a game filled to the brim with action all the way throughout the campaign and there's never a dull moment, this game had my adrenaline pumping and my heart beating like crazy during a big portion of the game.

I am not going to get into any details about the story here in this review since it would take too long, but the story is a story of betrayal and most of the story takes place during a war between Russia and the US. You get to play as multiple soldiers during the campaign and as such you get to play with different teams of soldiers as well. 

I found this game to be a lot easier than CoD 4, I played both on Veteran but I found MW2 to be the easiest one. CoD 4 just has a lot more difficult missions and scenarios compared to MW2. That said, this game is not afraid to give you a challenge should you choose to play on the higher difficulties.

If you are thinking of buying this game for it's multiplayer alone I would stay away, the game's multiplayer has a very low player population and a lot of the players still playing are cheaters.

I found this game to be an amazing experience and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters but I would highly recommend that you play CoD 4 before this one, it is not required to understand the story however CoD 4 is an excellent game in it's own right and you will get to know some of the characters in MW2 during CoD 4 (MW1), that way you will already be familiar with a lot of the characters when jumping into MW2."
12236,"It's hard to see the majority of people wanting to play any other multiplayer shooter until the next CoD is released, such is the quality of what's on offer here.  The single player is short but so exhilarating, some excellent actions scenes and the story line is believable enough. Multiplayer is very good too(never had lag). I'm not sure if you're aware or not but there was a atttempted boycott of this game by mostly the clans and modders"
12237,"This game is little bit older, but still so awesome! :D
I've had some great times with this game and a lot of good memories.
For me this is the best game of COD series!
"
12238,love this game
12239,"still fun, took me back to the days of 360"
12240,"Best campaign of any shooter I've ever played (haven't played loads, but still). Was pleasantly surprised. Fast paced and interesting missions across vastly different scenarios. 

This the first COD game I have ever personally owned (yet I've played the multiplayer on consoles at friends), and I must say, it is definitely a good entry to the franchise. I don't think I'd go any older that Call of Duty 4 or newer than MW3 though, as after MW3 from what I've seen and played at friend's, it sucks. Anything older and you'll have to work around the jarring mechanics of ancientness. 

This game was probably the highlight of the COD franchise, this and MW3, in my opinion. #MakeCODGreatAgain"
12241,"I think you need to maps, weapons to be free because they came out of recent games that are very demanding and the weaker with the purchase of COD games should be everything for free !!!!"
12242,"Remember when Call of Duty was about a badass smoking a cigar? Yeah, that was a long time ago."
12243,Best call of duty ever
12244,"Best Game Ever made.

well ok, at least best cod ever made :p
really hope for a remastered edition.."
12245,WTF I GOT FALSE VAC THIS GAME SUCK DICK WTF
12246,"Probably my favorite COD game of all time! the maps/guns/perks/killstreaks are second to none! i decided to pick this up since it was fairly cheap and give it a go and to my surprise the servers are still pretty active however i just wish my 3rd person team tactical game mode was still popular which its not havent even played a match in it yet , But o well still having a blast!  Also would be 10x better with FULL controller support."
12247,Great story and multiplayer
12248,this game is still awesome... the best cod game ever
12249,"Very good cod multiplayer is fun and the campaign is good
"
12250,Best Cod
12251,still rules
12252,Spec ops lags
12253,Great game really fun to play no troble with my accout or purchase or anything just plays like it should
12254,"Only just purchased for this account, I've logged hundeds of hours into this game. 

This and CoD4 are far and away the best this franchise has to offer. Its true that there are occasionally hackers, and noob tubers, but many are gone. There are still about 1000 people playing this game. The game itself still has servers, as well as some privately hosted servers and facebook groups. Its alive and its fun."
12255,Officially the last call of duty release I actually enjoyed. And the last one who's campaign I didn't turn off after the first mission either. This game still holds up well 8 years later and deserves a remaster more than any other game being or been remastered. If their going to keep pumping CoD games out then they need to revisit this style!
12256,Best COD in my opinion!
12257,thanks for the vac ban
12258,this game is god tier
12259,nice game
12260,allahuakbar
12261,f0weeroo  roioweiwwowguwhwwuhwurhwihrw  weirwhrwruiwuwh euweuiwefhwfiwuwiuwfiwf
12262,Easily top 3 best CoD games of all time.
12263,"all oif it but it needs bots for offline multiplayer
"
12264,"FPS Perfected. It would not be a stretch to say that CoD‚Äôs initial try at a modern FPS not only set the groundwork for how big the franchise is today, but has also inspired the genre to be as big and as multi-player focused as it now is. Out of all the games on the CoD list, this will be the one you‚Äôll least regret (purchased full-price or otherwise). 

From a single-player standpoint, IW finally stuck to telling a single narrative and it worked. It was the first game that, to me, felt like a purposeful story. Characters were made to appear more personable, but don‚Äôt really stand out until later on in the franchise. Team AI hardly got in the way while also being useful, and enemy AI was firm but fair. Although it would be unfair for me to criticize the game for its monotony in killing hordes of enemies, it would have been nice to be able to do so in more creative fashions (i.e. more AC-130-like levels and levels that required more driving or strategy). Luckily, this is expanded upon in the franchise and was still more than I could have ever asked for out of a game that‚Äôs almost 10 years old. 

But the obvious winner and the main reason why this game has more players on it than the latest instalment of the franchise (Infinite Warfare) comes down to its multiplayer. Nostalgia aside, the maps, weapons, and well-designed perk systems still hold up and are emulated in your most cherished FPS. The challenge systems for weapon attachments and XP were also a nice touch, including the implementation of camos and golden weapons. Even though the graphics aren‚Äôt on par with today‚Äôs titles, there‚Äôs still enough content in there to keep you engaged. It just bites that the prestige system was only on console systems and the latest remaster - but I still won‚Äôt buy the darn cash grab. 


Whether you buy it to relive the glory days, or you‚Äôre buying it to see what a genre-defining FPS is like - there‚Äôs no reason to not have this title in your library."
12265,fantastic
12266,Fucking best cod.  No other cod compares to this besides the first one.
12267,Awesome
12268,amazing
12269,Gg
12270,GET IT OR ILL BAN YOU HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12271,Tak.
12272,fantastic game
12273,Good game
12274,"If only because Battlefield won the battle against Call of Duty,it doesnt mean that the COD Franchise its gonna stop from existing.COD is a great game and I dont want to end like this,from my opinion."
12275,Its okay
12276,"So many hours spent on this, both on single and multi player. Of course, when I say singleplayer I mean mostly spec ops with friends... So much fun the spec ops, who would have thought that simple coop play against ai would make for such an interesting game mode."
12277,rage simulator 2017
12278,My favourite of the CoDs. Great batshit plot out of one of Tom Clancy's wet dreams. Tight shooting mechanics and just satisfying to play.
12279,This Game may be one of the best call of duty games ever made and beats the new ones in almost every way because who doesn't love to be invited to clan try outs from creepy old men in free-for-all lobbies and to buy hacks and levels from only $19.99.
12280,"[with 160 hours of gameplay...]


Great community, very minimal if not any hacking 

Not overly competitive and outrageously aggresssive multiplayer 

Great maps, 


Excellent graphics for its day, and it still shapes up nicely



I hope they remaster this!"
12281,gooood game
12282,perfect cult game
12283,"There was a time where this game was the best FPS in History, Now it is filled with Cheaters, Hackers with Aimbot/Wallhack and has a Dev team that no longer gives a f**k. Thanks, Activision!"
12284,I bought this game 6 years ago when I was 10. I had a lot of fun and called a lot of people faggot. NICE!
12285,One of the best cod games and there r still lots of players in multiplayer. Still worth buying.
12286,"-no spaceships
-no robots
-no jetpacks
-simple movement game
-great mechanics
ONE OF THE BEST COD EVEERR TOTALLY WORTH TO BUY
9/11"
12287,Back to the days when COD was good!
12288,"Couldn't even load up THE MULTIPLAYER!!!
like wth"
12289,"Take it from a dude with a 8 ks ratio on battlefield, and a supreme cs go player. This is fucking shit?!
Totally unbalanced, filled with hackers.

Treyarch get your shit together ffs."
12290,"The new CoDs are really bad and I still hope that one day will a CoD come that is like MW 2.
I think it is the best game of the series (next to Modern Warfare).
And so this game is pretty cool and good, I love it.
The story is genius and I like so many levels that I could play the howle game again.
The Multiplayer is still playable.
10/10"
12291,"The game is good and the campaign is fun, but there are a fuck ton of bugs that make multiplayer and campaign impossible to play. It was a good game on the Xbox, but playing it on Steam has not been as pleasant."
12292,Best F*cking Game
12293,Amazing Game! Recommend!
12294,10/10 love it
12295,Very good game
12296,"Garbage. Straight garbage. The amount of sad and salty people with no skill is overwhelming, nothing but hackers left and right. It's like they all got picked on in school and this is their only retribution, to hack a game from 09' to boost their tiny epeen. Where the fuck is the VAC system???? Does Valve not give a shit about games, unless they make them? Don't buy it, you will only wish you spent the money on a different game. 

Side note: I played the fuck outta this during my peasant days of Xbox 360. I bought this for the nostalgia, but soon realized it's filled with all the modders that valve bans from their games..."
12297,"By far one of the best FPS games out there and one of the best CODs.I'll start off by saying that i've played nearly all of the call of duty games,but this one........this one is something special.The campaign is really well done,a lot of action and some really sad moments,the graphics not that great but hey,it doesn't matter that much here.This is by far one of my favorites FPSs out there,but not when it comes to multiplayer,there are a lot of hacked lobbies and of course a lot of CHILDREN wich is my biggest problem here along with the matchmaking where it puts you with prestige players at lvl 70 from the start,i would say buy it for the campaign."
12298,5 stars
12299,the amount of hackers is over 9000
12300,"One word: Ghost

10/10 would kill the bad guy again"
12301,this so awesome games and weapon not bad at all
12302,"This game was so awesome! So much better then Battle-Field, it's plain and simple and doesn't have confusing mechanices. I wish i have an extra two hands so I could play with myself!"
12303,ONE OF THE BEST COD GAMES
12304,"Even better than CODMODWAR1.

More guns, more gadgets, more weapons, more modes, more story, now has CO-OP missions, improved multiplayer, TACTICAL NUKE, more customization across the board.

A step forward.

""No russian."""
12305,Pretty good gameriino!
12306,RIP Ghost :(
12307,"Great Game...7.5/10, however the game has player hosts. And as you an amagine some people play this game on cardboard boxes so the game is often very laggy. But other than that this game provides hours of enternainment and fun! Enjoy...This is for campaign and multiplayer...But mostly multiplayer"
12308,Approved by a duck
12309,this game has the clasic call of duty vibes
12310,Its a good game and there isnt any modders online!
12311,"i would've said yes, but i not see supplie drops and jump suts. finish your game nex time valve!!! >:("
12312,"If you want to buy this game for the multiplayer don't bother.
The game doesn't allow for dedicated servers but instead a p2p system.
This results in everyone in the match having alot of lag except the host.
And not only that the game is filled to the limit with cheaters.
The store page advertises Valve Anti Cheat but I have played with alot of players who are already VAC-banned and no one I have reported for cheating has received one.
So unless you are already VAC-banned and have a terrible internet connection I would skip this one."
12313,Really good game even today nothing like the trash we have now like infinte warfare  really good game Overall score 9.8
12314,"My all time favorite CoD game, I love absolutely everything about it. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves playing fast pace FPS games. The single player campaign is also breathtaking and adrenaline pumping. Unfortunately they don't make CoD games like this one anymore."
12315,"This game has the worst maps ive ever played on and I can see where MW2019 got it's inspiration from, fuck this game, fuck Scrapyard, and most of all, fuck campers."
12316,"The game is fun, especially the Multiplayer. One of the best CoD Multiplayers of all time. Still reccomending after 7 years"
12317,cuck of doody 4: midurn gheyfuqstoopid
12318,Hey......itsb pretty good..
12319,"Probably the best Call of Duty of all time, and honestly one of the best games to be released in the past decade. The story is absolutely fantastic, soundtrack is great, multiplayer is challenging and fun (and addictive), the graphics hold up well and really everything is just great. I really have no complaints at all for this game. 

An almost legendary game, and a must play (although I suggest playing Modern Warfare first so the story makes  sense)."
12320,"How to play Multiplayer

1. Equip Scavanger
2. Equip Akimbo G18s
3. Equip UMP with FMJ
4. Equip Stoppping Power
5. Equip Steady Aim
6. Have Nuke as the only killstreak
7. Find a game that is near you
8. Proceed to kill every enemy you see
9. Activate Nuke
10. Win (Now repeat from 7 until you stop playing)"
12321,This game was really fun but there are a lot of noobs so if you wanna destroy some noobs i recommend this game to you but if u want a game with some stinky tryhards i recommend black ops 2.
12322,this game is a clasic buy it its veery fun
12323,"Ohi there

Double Akimbo

Force people to uninstall"
12324,"I highly recommend this game, 
The story in the second part of trilogy is absolute fantastic.
The graphics is okay, but it could be better.
Nice multiplayer but it need more maps,
Nobody buy's the DLC with more MP Maps so don't even try clicking ""Add to card""
Ah, yeah, the sound effects is good too.
8/10"
12325,"Best COD by far 
It deserves to be remastered"
12326,"12.31.16 Great game. The game does contain Aim botters, Wall hackers, and sometimes even lag switchers. Although as of yesterday, I use to recommend the game even with its dying community because of its nostalgia, and now it seems I've ""cheated"" and was VAC banned. Now as for what I've been banned for I have not received and information about as of today, therefore, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone buy this game for any amount of money to put a VAC-Ban stamp on your account. Wouldn‚Äôt Buy again 3.5/10"
12327,"It's a really good fps game but the players is ruining it. Hacked lobbies, hacker players, Noob Tubers they killed this game. And it's not playable now. It's waste of time and money."

12332,"Well, a lot of noob tubers but heck, a fun game."
12333,"This is an old classic i love this game. I used to play this all the time with my friend on his x-box 360, but i moved away and xbox live is really expensive so many years later i bought it on sale for $10 which is a good deal. I dont really see any hackers but there are a lot of good players you won't have trouble finding a game if its TDM and FFA and domination most other gamemodes are dead and no one is ever playing it. I would recomend you try and get it on sale though for the fact that it is usally $20."

Now that I no longer have the Xbox 360 and Xbox LIVE GOLD, I purchased it for the PC and it's PHENOMENAL!!!
Try to work on the ""Crashing"" of joining Mid-Game and it taking a while to load... Other than that, it's still fun as the Consol version!!!"

12351,"best cod ever

12352,"Hacked this game in 2012, got the VAC ban a whole year after I stopped playing. GG Valve."
12353,hackers make online multiplayer pointless and had to change a lot of system files to even get the game to run. not worth the money. just play on xbox or playstation
12354,the campain does not seem to work
12355,"this game is cool. im not as die hard of a fan as some people, but its definitely fun"
12356,"just downloaded mac osx version and unfortunately  in the wolverine mission set  keep having problems with the drone control module not working properly and being unable to close it....weird sort of object hanging fault....so i cant offer a review further than that as unable to play any further into the game at present....pity....ill keep trying but currently rather disappointed to have such a good game hang in this fashion, just hoping its a random glitch and wont happen again after complete reboot"
12357,this is why i was vac banned
12358,"Hands down the best Call of Duty game, and the only one I feel legitimately nostalgic for. Modern Warfare done right"
12359,Really good game... Miss it!
12360,"Multiplayer is boring as hell, no community servers, forced FPS limit of 90.

This game will get you VAC banned, do not play it."
12361,"All but a few gamemodes are dead and you won't find anyone playing. The servers are so limited with only P2P and no option to adjust the rules. The matches are super short and not fun. The community servers are so so much better, but you need a server browser. And installing that on a VAC secured game is just asking for a ban. 
This game is great, but the official multiplayer is garbage, not worth the money."
12362,i kinda like it
12363,Invention is pretty cool imo and it's in a lot of montage parodies which is kinda dank tbh 9/7
12364,  This game was the first game on Steam I have ever purchased. I was familiar with the game already because of friends and such. But when I purchased it for myself I was amazed by the thrilling campaign and stunning multiplayer gameplay. The weapons operated so well in such realistic fashion. This is an amazing game and you should definetly try it out.
12365,"so i thought that revisiting my favorite COD was a good idea...
played 3 games and all of them were full of hackers
childhood ruined
10/10"
12366,"I've had some great times with this game and a lot of good memories, however, the scene died pretty much out (also due to the yearly CoD releases). The only reason to get this game is 'cuz nostalgia' or you're going to a LAN party where people are going to play it.

"
12367,breddy gud
12368,not infinite warfare but still good
12369,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best games of the series to this day! Multiplayer is still alive mainly just on TDM though with very few hackers

12383,"this game WAS a good game, The game's is a good game campaign wise only critique i have on it is sometimes it can be a little repeditive now for multiplayer if you want it you wont get it, multiplayer in this game is dead you will be lucky to find a lobby some times there will be some but its usually late at night and only tdm and i dont think the campaign is worth 20$ it was a good game but now its just outdated."
12384,"Infinity ward should've looked to the past to make new games.
Am I right?"
12385,"best cod ever
"
12386,great fun and chaotic
12387,Amazing If you can run the game. Highly Reccomend the game
12388,ye is pretty goud
12389,"Great Game brings back Nostalgia, but the story line is very very short. Multi-player is great as well but there are a few times when you'll join a game with a hacker on your team or the other team and it basically ruins the gaming experience. Recommending the game is a 60/40 for me i love the game but i cant deal with hackers. Future buyers beware of the hackers, other than that its a really fun nostalgic game (Honestly best Call of Duty, Still waiting for the remastered)."
12390,"This game kept me playing for years. I have tried most big multiplayer action games, but few stick and most get tiresome after a week or two. I have given up on newer modw games, they are basically random games. This one should be the ideal of how to make a good multiplayer shooter."
12391,Masterpiece of a game! Brings back all the good memories:)
12392,"If stay without politic points, it's one of the best games. It's like action move, you need keep attantion (focus) all time. Cool game's atmosphere. Completely different missions. The co-op mode is very good, but only for two players."
12393,"The BEST CoD im my opinion. I had a good time with this game, until the hacker entered the game..."
12394,wew
12395,a very good shooter with a modern setting  10/10
12396,Nice Game
12397,Very good game 10/10 Don recommends.
12398,Adlist they used to do good games///....
12399,It is by far and still the best CoD-Version I've ever played.
12400,Hackers..
12401,This game is literally worse than cancer.
12402,"I really loved this game, except the fact that they did the wrong thing with the servers.

Other than that, I can simply say that I skipped my class in high school just to play with my friends.

That how much I enjoyed to play this game.

But the dream was ended after this game."
12403,The same stupid and pointless game that it was since 2009.
12404,"10/10! very very good game for a very low price! I used to play it on xbox 6 years ago in high school and it was a lot of fun.  Bought it again last year on steam for that nostalgic feel. Still the Graphics look excellent. If you think about it, the graphics must have been out of the world in 2009. 
Campaign mode is epic! good story and good shooting. 
special ops mode is also good and after 6 years i still couldn't beat the E-level juggernaut (with only explosives).
Multi player mode is extraordinary. The guns feel smooth, little to no recoil, very easy to control, the sound is excellent, especially the AK and the ACR. Now the noob tubes and hackers are not as rampant as they were when i played it last year. So it's probably a good time to play now!"
12405,"best game ever

"
12406,Best Call of Duty of all time. I can't believe people still play multiplayers.
12407,"The CoD I liked the most. 
I had it a while back, then I got banned for hax when I did not have any. Jumped to a pirated version, with freaking dedicated servers, loved it even more. Now having bought it again, I realize that the original game (Not AlterIWNet or 4DO) actually sucks. No dedicated servers (no way of knowing the server you are going to be playing on, usually with ping over 100), moreover no mods, no votekicks, no favela map (unless you create a custom game), not to mention the hardcore tab is just awful (15 sec respawn).
I recommend buing it and not playing on licensed servers, get a serverlist patch and enjoy the forbidden glory of dedicated servers and silly mods like h&s, zombies and stuff."
12408,MW2 Multiplayer never gets old...
12409,(g)old :)
12410,This game is great. On my old Steam account I had 2000 hours on this game and I enjoyed and passed most of my childhood with this amazing masterpiece. Finaly i choose to get this game again. Almost no multiplayer players but the single and the co ope challenge worth it.
12411,"This is from someone who originally played the game in 2009/10 on Xbox 360 and I'll Review my Favorite Game of all time!
(Note: I play this game solo)

Single Player: Even beating the Campaign over 7 years ago, its still an Action Packed, Emotinal Roller Coaster. Its short, but very sweet. I beat it in around 5 hours and it was a decent challenge on Regular Difficulty. Feels too hard on a higher difficulty. Anyway, playing through the campaign again felt like walking down Memory Lane, remember every mission from the past, but still managing to be an emotional shootout. Overall, its definitely worth a few hours to play this amazing, very well paced Story.

Spec Ops: Fun but could be better. Something that would make me enjoy Spec Ops is if you can search for random people, because as of now, none of my friends have this game. So I can only play Spec Ops solo, and its fun for the first few missions, but thats about it

MULTIPLAYER: The juicy part, I used to be addicted to multiplayer on the 360 and its still very enjoyable today. I do think the console versions of MW2 are better, but its still great fun to relive the experience. The game hasn't aged too badly, there are still a few annoying things people did over 7 years ago. Still some nube toobs, a few campers, occasional hacker. Typical stuff for MW2. But its still fun leveling up again and trying out the old classic guns. It feels really good playing this COD knowing how important and fun it was back then. This is Call of Duty multiplayer at its most fun! 


OVERALL (9/10) 
Very fun, nostalgic, not too annoying, and still entertaining today. This game is definitely worth the buy if you want to relive your old MW2 memories, or if you want to experience Call of Duty in its prime. There is still a decent community to this game and its great that there still is"
12412,"Amazing game, if call of duty could continue the series then yeah."
12413,"the best call of duty series
this game deserve remastered"
12414,"This is one of the best call of duty game I every played.
Good wepons and good Character my favorite is Captain Price.
And good graphice.
"
12415,I actually regret refunding this game. It was my first actual CoD game and was pretty fun. I can now understand why people wish for another boots on the ground CoD game.

12418,can quick scope noobs ez
12419,"Don't buy this game on pc,but if you want to play mw2 just get it on xbox 360 because people cant aim for sh*t everyone just uses noobtubes and knifes,or they you either and just you akimbo machine gun pistols because they cant aim."
12420,Amazing multiplayer and have been addicted to it since i bought it. Campaign is also very good and found it to be one of my favorites. Although i have ran into some hackers during my time playing this game but normally they don't become that much of a problem; They either have high XP for everybody or just that one guy who shoots the air and kills random people. If you can get past those people once in a while then you'll find this to be one of your favorites too.
12421,-Impin' Ain't Easy-
12422,Amazing game I love it but a lot of hackers so watch out
12423,"multiplayer is awesome

12430,TIs tha bomb digity
12431,10/10 one of the best games from the cod franchise.
12432,"played a bit , its alright"
12433,This game is pretty good. It's a little old now but if you haven't played this and you like first-person shooters than you'll enjoy this one. Be aware of hacks because it's infested with them.
12434,This game is daddy.
12435,Can't even join lobbies without exploiters or people that kick you for using non-snipe rifles
12436,Not overflown with script kiddies... yet. Stick with the Call of Dutys with private server functionality to punish cheaters or play with friends!
12437,Would still be good if it was updated.

12443,Most Classic game ever
12444,3  words for this game:  Best COD Ever!
12445,Multiplayer is cancerous but the campaign is still worth a playthrough.
12446,"with not as many hours as i wanted ingame, it was still the 2nd best call of duty i ever played but it will never top  CoD2 the old war style was just amazing to play :)"
12447,Great game to play on PC fast paced gameplay.
12448,"finished the story a couple of times.
its amazing"
12449,"col

12450,Why doesn't this game have controller support?
12451,Badass as Fuck.
12452,HACKER CENTRAL
12453,"This along with CoD 4 is the best that call of duty has to offer, they may be old but they are still gold. 

If you buy either this or CoD 4 today though, you can rest assured that servers will most likely be flooded with hackers, as there's no check on cheaters or hackers on these games anymore since they aren't as relevant to activision anymore. But both games still offer a great action packed story, along with an array of Spec-ops missions to do either on your own or with a friend. 

Wherther story and spec-ops missions is worth the 20$ price tag, can be debated. Many of us old this game dear for nostalgic sake, but for that price there are no doubt games out there that offer more play-time for your buck."
12454,good game
12455,My absolute favorite CoD game!!!
12456,"This game, in Multiplayer, is based on luck, better ping and mood-breaking frustrating mode. For example, yesterday you were good, very good. God damn, you killed people like you have MG3 without recoil. You got best killstreaks you wanted. Next day! :D Dead, dead, dead. You're dead. Your team is dead. Everything is dead, but enemy. Seriously. Some players played the game too long. Their aim is almost like you could fight with aimbots and wallhackers. There's no point in using Cold-Blooded perk with Ninja perk, they will see you and kill you easily anyway. Once you killed people like massive serial killer, now you are killed like animal. And this is frustrating as hell.

But I recommend this game anyway. Singleplayer is fun, Co-op is fun, Multiplayer is fun if you have strong mood.

PS: Steam is playing quite racistic blocking Mac version for Poland, Japan and Russia :P"
12457,"Briliant graphics for a game released in 2009, awesome gameplay, weapons, equipment and characters. More campaign and spec ops levels would have been great; the only downturn is you only get to play the  american and taskforce 141 campaign, not the russian campaign :'(
4 out of 5"
12458,"The best game by far in the series.

12459,"This game is my favorite call of duty ever, awesome gameplay and a great story!"

12464,"Do you know what you must try? While you are playing multiplayer, you should be listening to deadmau5 <3 try it...;)"
12465,"The best multiplayer FPS, bar none. 

I miss this game; its successors have left it a graveyard filled with hackers and eventually entirely empty, but it still deserves recognition as the peak of the Call of Duty series. (After this, it was all downhill.)"
12466,"This game costs a piece of you. It's a great game, but be prepared."
12467,"This game is pretty dang good. Though, the steam prices are always dogshit. Pick this shit up on some janky third party website for like $4 or summin"
12468,"ITS SUCH A GOOD GAME
"
12469,"I'm one of those people who appreciate cliches and movie references in a game. Forget Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down, this story beats both of those out of the water. The story continues on the path of the newly created Task Force 141, which is lead by US General Shepherd. Soap McTavish returns as the co-founder of TF-141 along with Shepherd on their hunt for Vladamir Makarov, a ruthless Russian mercenary responsible for the events of MW1. Overall, good storytelling for a typical, high-powered, action game.

10/10

12470,This is a S*it game. I got into multiplayer and got vac banned from the game because there was a hacker in the server.
12471,MW2 looks way sharper & better than MW3.. Why?

Thank you very much !"

[b] Great Campaign and nice Multiplayer! [/b]


[i](My shown playtime isn't right because it doesn't show the multiplayer playtime!)[/i]

[list]
[*]The Campaign is epic. I played it Hhundrets of hours on my PS3 because I liked it so much! It is very catchy and well made.

[*]The Multiplayer is a masterpiece! You get (mostly) good teammates that will not try to troll you. If you think there are not enough maps, you can dowload some DLCs .

[*]The Gameplay is very smooth. The story is epic with some unexpected turns. The graphics are great. I haven't noticed any bugs yet. 
[/list]

I would give it a [b] 10/10 [/b]!"
12478,BEST COD
12479,"In my opinion one of the best Call of Duty games, if not even the best one.
Definetly a great game even in 2016"
12480,"Thi is without a doubt the best call of duty in the series with cod4.From the story to the multiplayer everything is just magnificent except all the faggot kids running around with grenade launchers but that's just a small problem compared to the new cod games it has turned from a modern military shooter to a really unserious game with pink camos and weapon variants that you can only get from you guessed it supply drops that I repeat you need to pay for and you cod (children's online daycare) fanboys out there don't come to me and say that you can get supply drops just by playing,it is true but the chance of getting a fucking weapon is like 1%.And if you want to buy a good gun in infinite warfare you need to play over a hundred hours to get one fucking gun.And don't get me started on mwr it's probably a good game but it's such a dick move from activision to bundle it with infinite warfare and say you need to pay 80 dollars for one game, and as much as I liked cod 4 I won't buy it cause I am not going to sponsor activision's bullshit.My recommendation just buy the old cod 4 or mw2"
12481,One of the best multiplayer experiences ever made. Set the new standard for FPS.
12482,"I played for a little while and it was great! But after a few hours of playing the game stopped working, now everytime i try to oplen the game it sends me to a black unresponsive screen that i have to force quite everytime to get out of. Please fix this if you can. 5/10 rating."

I didn't want to drop $80 on the newest CoD because I didn't know if I was going to like it, and I think jetpacks are stupid.

The story is actually not too bad, but super unrealistic: just like all CoD games.

After playing this, I went on to purchase MW1 and MW3. Needless to say, it's a fun game with hacker and 12 y/o free muliplayer."

12503,I like COD:MW2 the best. I felt it was like playing through a movie. COD:MW3 was OK but it seemed the maps were shorter and more linear. MW2 was the most intense of ther series. Great Game!
12504,Great game Im ejoy it Alot The story is great (i am new to CoD so dont take it to hard) ive heard that CoD is going down  to much futuristic shit This is an example of good shit I would recomend it:)

12512,"A lot like CoD4. 

The campaign is fine, but the multiplayer has hackers, which ruins the game. The multiplayer maps you start out with make poor use of space, and unlike in CoD4, where small maps had room for all ranges of weapons, pretty much everyone in MW2 uses medium range weapons. So less diversity, still hackers, but the game doesn't have all the mods that made CoD4 interesting, plus no admins.

Just not worth it."
12513,dont like the game on pc wish they had a controller thing where you could play with a controller but you cant so its fine but love the games
12514,"A great FPS, a classic that I love, I can't complain about this game!"
12515,"Seriously one of the best games I have played in a long time. Sure, the multiplayer is fun with all the hitmarkers and quickscopes but the singlplayer is one of the best singlplayer FPS experiences I have had in a long time. The game has some bugs but they are easy to overlook and nothing game breaking. I really recommend this game and it will be a game staying dowloaded in my library for a very long time."

12520,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK. After a few hours spent in singleplayer, I decided to try the multiplayer. It worked fine at first but ever since that first session it will no longer boot. Have tried all 'fixes' discussed in the steam community but nothing fixes the issue. No updates ran on my computer. No drivers require updating. Reinstalled numerous times. The multiplayer program simply will not start. Crashes upon opening and requires a force quit to close every time. 

Contacted Steam to request a refund. They refused as I had spent more than 2 hours in singleplayer, despite the other half of the game not even functioning.

DO NOT PURCHASE. MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK. GAME IS NOT AS DESCRIBED."
12521,its a realy fun game!!!! all i have to say... i am a little pissed that modded lobbys are patched and there new vac system IS FUCKING CRAZZY but a realy fun game
12522,This is a fantastic game and has really stood up to the test of time. There are a few hackers but this game is so smooth and ballanced that it is still really fun

12524,it lags alot

12527,pretty good no hackers so far
12528,"Filled with hackers and noob tubers. VAC bans literally anyone who isn't cheating or hacking but doesn't bother with the actual hackers. The game is still filled with noob tubers... Honestly I wouldn't buy this game, unless if it happens it's on a really good discount and you want to waste your remaining money"
12529,Really good game in the call od futy franchise  One of my favorites to be honest
12530,"Excellent game love it. But was only able to play this game a short while then was banned by VAC for no reason. When i asked steam why they said that VAC detected a cheat. I have never cheated in a game and mill kill to death ratio in this game should back up my story but steam thinks that their VAC program is perfect and this does not happen, so who am to defend myself against a company who is in complete contol of your games. So its no use me trying to defend my case. Its a great game otherwise, and i hope that no-one else has had the same trouble i had. I have heard of this happening to others and they had their ban lifted, but why hasnt mine, especially if this is the only game in my list that has a VAC ban on it. Makes sense doesnt!? Godd luck to anyone else who own this."
12531,‚Äå
12532,"A very good game. So here's a list of pros and cons for this game.

Pros:
 - Amazing Singleplayer Campaign
 - Beautiful soundtrack.
 - Vast amount of weapons to choose from in the multiplayer gamemode.

Cons:
 - Loaded with glitches, especially in the multiplayer gamemode.
 - Lack of mod support, dedicated servers, or FOV settings.
 - Lots of noobtubers."
12533,"Amazing Campaign, Amazing Multiplayer, graphics are amazing for its time  LOVE IT!"
12534,One of the best off all time
12535,"The best game ever I played with (in the category). The story of the game (with the mw1,2) is very exciting, amazing. I dont understand why there is not a movie adoption yet from this  game.

I only can recommend for all who like the fps."

12540,Suprised I didnt run into any hackers yet. My first time with mw2 and I understand why people praise this as one of the best.
12541,Great game. 8.5/10 Gotta love quickscoping with the intervention.
12542,"PEOPLE ARE STILL PLAYING THE MULTIPLAYER!
By far the best CoD to date. Have been playing in on xbox 360 since the day of release and then quit for awhile since not many people are playing it but the pc version still has plenty of people on it. You can always find a game for team death match very quickly and even search and destroy and others if you will wait. Best multi player on a first person shooter to date. The problem with the new ones is its way too complicated, this keeps it short, simple and fun. Amazing game"
12543,"My graphics card is non-existant as I'm gaming (ikr lol) on an hp work laptop, but yet with my potato graphics card, this game looks crisp as day. 10/10 Would advise you buy this if you're not into the typical PC FPS (CS:GO)"
12544,"This game is still a beautiful looking game. With newer and supposedly better looking games coming out every year, this graphics and playability of this game still stand, and replaying this will give you chills."
12545,"One of my favourite Call Of Duty games, if not my favourite."
12546,Mƒõ se call of duty modern warfare s√©rie l√≠b√≠ a u tohoto d√≠lu je takov√° klasick√° call of duty kampa≈à a multiplayer se mi taky l√≠bil.D√°v√°m 7 z 10
12547,Good times
12548,"Best call of duty ever for fun ,because mw3 is a little better in shooting. I still prefer this though :-)"
12549,Best game that has ever been made..:)
12550,like if you cried when ghost died
12551,"This game gave me a free vac ban! :) Some idiots hosted a modded lobby :)))))))

10/10"
12552,"Don't mind me, I'm just doing this for the Steam Awards badge."
12553,"Still the best of all COD games.
The multiplayer was fun, better than in COD MW, and the story was a sequel to COD MW.
The story is full of action and thrilling.
This game is the example, how it can be made, but nowadays everything is made short and without passion..."
12554,I wish the game can let me use my Xbox 360 Controller in the game.
12555,"Multiplayer always funny! It was my first steam game. Campaign is good and intensive after the first mw. 
The multiplayer is the most funny of all CODs."
12556,By far the best!!
12557,I would reccomend this to people whom are new to FPS games. This is honestly a nice game.
12558,I h8 black people simulator
12559,It's the same game as way back then .
12560,"JOGO MUITO BOM PRA CARALHO JOGUEM, CAMPANHA FODA MULTIPLAYER MELHOR AINDA SE VC SE ACHA BOM EM FPS JOGUE ISSO"
12561,This is my favorite Call of Duty game ever. Very fun.
12562,"i had already played mw2 all the way through to the end all but the multiplayer version and i had it on another computer thus somehow i lost the game and lately i thought do i or don,t i now its in my steam account just couldn,t go without playing the call of duty games they are like a classic genre of the gaming community. always great to go back and play again and again.this game is great the story is good just had to get it again."
12563,best game ever
12564,Was so good at the 1v1s on rust they banned me to keep it fun for everyone else
12565,It's fun when you don't get spawnkilled on a rooftop outside the map.

12568,One of the best CODs.
12569,Best Call of Duty multiplayer ever
12570,They don't write games like this any more.
12571,"Ah the memories, Me and my friends loved this game while we were growing up and we still play it today. This has got to be the game that defined Call of Duty for many of us and because of that, we got a game that stuck around for around 3 more years and was still awesome. Noobtube One-Man armies, Classic sniping, Perks, and NO EXO SUITS OR SUPPLY DROPS WHATSOEVER. Whatever Activison and Infinity Ward did with this game really paid off. This is  a game that i would recommend to anybody. This game deserves a remaster, it really does. I really hope Activison and Infinity Ward does something like this game again so that we may play like the good old days again."
12572,"The number of times I redid the campaign on this game on my Xbox 360 when it came out is higher than the number of times I have taken a shot of vodka while playing CS:GO. This game is a masterpiece and shows how plot twists can really fuck with your head in a video game campaign. The multiplayer all be it is a little annoying with having no buffs or nerfs of certain weapons (couch, cough, noobtubes) but regardless it is easy to let time simply slip away while playing"
12573,Personal favourite of the franchise. Too bad there is only a few people still playing it.
12574,"Should definately throw this up there for the ""i'm not crying"" award. If you've played the game you know what I'm talking about."
12575,"old school stuff

12586,Best COD game
12587,"If you haven't heard of modern warfare 2 yet well: *Where have you been insult*

Game is amazing, The campaign was awesome, though content warning: There is civilian murder, which the game gives you the choice of seeing/experiencing or not. Campaign continues the Cod4/Cod4 Remaster story line and you can enjoy the memes this campaign creates after experiencing the memes and story.

As for the coop spec ops: If you want some solo or coop PvE missions, these are pretty good, Though if you play alone I will warn you on the hardest difficulty option you better have like a stressball or like... an extra wall... If you catch my drift hahaha. I found it great, the coop is amazing with a friend to play with, you can be brothers in arms in 33 missions to enjoy and deploy!

As for the multiplayer, mw2 multiplayer is within alot of peoples most favourite multiplayer and even thinking about it is nostalgic. The multiplayer may be empty and lonely in your area, I haven't found many games in Australia but there is a bot program you can look up tutorials on youtube and ask about in the forums that lets you play offline multiplayer bots if you really wanna catch a fraction of the feel of this game's multiplayer glory."

12595,"Good old shooter and good old times when I was younger.
Alot of time after school, trickshots for fun, that was nice.

Still hacker and loser noob tuber online but when you rape them, everything is fine. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

The game is fun, can makes you angry sometimes because of the camper/tuber kids, acting like there are good. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

I can recommend Modern Warfare 2 - buy it when its on sale.
The NAT-Typ is a big problem, On Youtube there are alot of Videos: how to fix the NAT-Typ problem and how to put it on ""Open.""

7/8 out of 10 for a great game and for good old memories. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)"
12596,Great Multiplayer shooter for the FPS fan.
12597,very fun game
12598,"Gripping campaign, and solid multiplayer experience.  Highly recommend Sabatoge and Hardcore."
12599,"MW2...
One of the best Multiplayer experiences ever made. 
Even in 2016, this game is still incredible. This, in my opinion, was the last truly great Call of Duty. Even now I would still recommend to pick it up as there is still an active online community."
12600,good campaign
12601,"Played for 7 years, could only nuke once in Rust.

Probably my biggest achievement in life.

12614,Still better than infinite warfare
12615,My favourite COD
12616,"Great game, great mechanics. Multiplayer is great but there's less than 500 people at one time"
12617,"pretty good multiplayer, it doesn't reward campers , but every so often you run into a hacker."
12618,xD For Game
12619,it was good
12620,Better than Infinite Warfare and BOIII.
12621,"Voted for WHoooaaaaTTTT??? steam award. Because for those who played this when it first came out, we all remember what happened in the campaign. (not going to spoil anything)"
12622,What AN AMZING GAME OMG!
12623,1v1 me rust

"
12625,"One of the best CoDs, always down for a bit of nostalgia!"
12626,modern warfare is  the best trilogy ever created and the best fps
12627,Very good game. I have been playing it since it came out.Did not get old yet.
12628,this game.... childhood!
12629,"A timeless classic, so timeless that they're made a retouched version just to sell the latest sequel."
12630,so much old memories playing this game came back to it and still people trying to do trickshots of planes but didnt have to wait long to find a td match snd match and forgot how good the story mode is even though its not long enough still one of the best
12631,"great game, best cod ever made!"
12632,"Probalbly the best CoD ever made. Very addictive multiplayer, and a good singleplayer.
9/10"
12633,"Still a pleasure to come back to it, after so long."
12634,"The oldest and still the grate FPS game of ages. This is the only game that you have a good feeling when you kill a player in multiplayer using only a knife, especially if you play maps like Favela or Rust. How whants to play an old based ground FPS ... this is the best of CoD. Enjoy!"
12635,greit gym
12636,What a game
12637,best cod ever!
12638,.........
12639,Best game!)
12640,Jugs in favelas while playing spec ops at extreme difficulty. I'll never forget.
12641,Already being called as a hacker !!!
12642,Best game ever
12643,i love this game but it¬¥s sad that not many plays the game.
12644,"Good game when it first came out, good game still today. Hopefully it gets a remaster. Everyone needs to come back to this game!"
12645,shepherd did nothing wrong
12646,"This game has to be one of the best game i have ever played i use to play this game back when i had a ps3. Lots of people play this game the community is ""fine"" havent seen any hacking so dont worry about that all out a fun game"
12647,Really bestest game on call of duty franchise
12648,"They dont do CODs like that anymore, a complete package and timeless classic."
12649,"Its a really fun game with not half bad graphics for when it came out and the multiplayer is almost as good. The special ops mode is really fun, and it is best played if a freind. The campain is EXTREALY story rich, and its better if you play the game before this came, COD but the game catches you up if you dont have it. In all, its a good game!"
12650,"""History is written by the victor. History is filled with liars."""
12651,"I have very fond memories of this game, and i love playing it even though it is old. 10/10"
12652,"I love this game! So far, it's the best army game I've played."
12653,"let's get crazy, let's kill them!"
12654,"Amazing game!  Fantastic story and a multiplayer that will keep you coming back for more.  If you are looking for a good Call of Duty game be sure to pick this one up it is pretty cheap and well worth the money!

10/10"
12655,i LO0VE THIS GAME
12656,"The single player story is awesome. It picked up where Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare left off. With the 2-player co-op mode, you get to play with your friend to complete missions. Multiplayer contains more choice of killstreak. From remote-controlled missile to 10-second nuclear strike, multiplayer has been more fun than the previous game.

The multiplayer, however, isn't that great. It has poor matchmaking system and also doesn't have a game browser. The lag can be quite troublesome. The ping is stated as bars instead of approximate number. Hackers is the biggest problem of all. They can unlock every killstreaks, challenges, weapons, and attachments for you. This is a problem in the future gaming community because it will just lose players and Infinity Ward may stop supporting the multiplayer game in the future.

I rated this as negative because the multiplayer which is what making the game fun is badly implemented. It would be more stable if there are dedicated servers for rent to continue the fun match while maintaining a good connection quality."
12657,If you are wondering servers are still up.
12658,"I recommend this game only if you are playing with mouse and keyboard, otherwise it is just a hassle to play with a controller."
12659,"What happened to People's Interests? This is a definition on a good Multiplayer War Game. Unfortunally, People today are only interested in the newest. Not me, I'm staying Old-School :) And also, I'll never get Tired of hearing Kevin McKidd as John ""Soap"" MacTavish!"
12660,Never forget Price
12661,"In the modern day, I feel that Call of Duty has gone on far too long, but this game is what made the series for me. I understand noob tubes are annoying in multiplayer, but it still has the best multiplater ever. Not to mention, the single player is an amazing story with tons of twist in turns. This game will stand the test of time forever."
12662,The best cod of all!
12663,Best COD ever made 10/10
12664,Brings me back to the good ol' days. Now these days its filled with hackers. Game: 9/10 Hackers bring that to a 2/10
12665,"One of the best Call of Duty games that still plays and looks great. If you don't get a lobby with hackers who wallbang and spawn trap, it's a fun game."
12666,"Old game, but I don't care. I entered the Call of Duty world a LOT later than everyone else, and I was advised to start the experience off with MW2. Well I'll tell you right now, this game took me by the heart, threw me around the entire planet and left me hanging multiple times as I was switched to another mission, only to fulfill itself with a load of flawlessly placed plot twists that all made sense in the end. I even had to replay certain parts just for the sake of experiencing it at it's finest. I love this game and whoever contributed to the storyline, somebody find them and bring them back for the sake of the FPS Gaming industry."
12667,Still better than Infinite Warfare
12668,"Fun game to play, Got lots of great memory's from this game while i still was playing on the console."
12669,MY favorite game is this
12670,Probably the best COD singleplayer campaign of all time.
12671,"This is, together with the first MW, the best game EVER made. Don't let my game time fool you, I played for 40 days on xbox live."
12672,Legit cancer. 10/10
12673,Extremely nice and enjoyable game.
12674,Best game in the series!
12675,Best COD of all time
12676,Just remaster it
12677,this is classicka? obzor for grebaniy steam(4y)
12678,Best game ever just factor out noob tubeing and hackers
12679,"One of the best fps of all time, no doubt. I wish i could play it for the first time again."
12680,Better than all the new COD games.
12681,Good game would kill civilians again 10/10
12682,Best cod game ever
12683,8 years old and still worth playing :)
12684,"CoD:Noobtube? the greatest multiplayer?

Many call it the greatest multiplayer but those people never tried older CoD's, campaign nothing special though and quite short.

If you like to participate in a noobtubing battle or get an endkill with a mlg pro 1337 flick noscope shot definitely buy this.
I do love the game a lot though."
12685,Inarguably the best COD game in the franchise!
12686,better than the new cods but full of hackers as activion gave up on it after releasing the new crap.
12687,So cool!
12688,"This game is great, a must buy. With the flaws of unbalanced multiplayer and spec ops not being as addicting as zombies aside, the game is great. The characters are probably the most memorable out of the franchise, the multiplayer is the most insane yet satisfying I have ever experienced, and the campaign is mouth watering just agaze of the gameplay. The game was definitely what it hyped itself to be. Each mission had a purpose and didnt need a cutscene or explanation for its existence. Almost no filler!! Personally, I liked spec ops and wouldnt change the multiplayer at all. My only personal compalint is only that MW3 and the latest CoD games dont live up to what Infinity Ward 2009 and before made and why CoD was more than just your next Military FPS. Hopefully one day we can get another memorable story, character based, action packed, joy ride of a Call Of Duty game like this one again. But, at least we still have this. I give it a strong 9/10 

Graphics 9/10
Gameplay 10/10
Story 10/10
Multiplayer 8/10"
12689,10/10 game. If you dont like death and you like saving lives peacefully and diplomatically buy this shit
12690,"By far the best Call of Duty, they need to remaster this if CoD wants to get some life put back into them."
12691,"Best COD multiplayer, but infested with hackers"
12692,An amazing game thats survived the test of time. Its amazing seeing that people still play this.
12693,this game taught us that you doesnt need a fucking jetpack and futuristic weapon to be an awesome game
12694,"Cons.
1. No mics in lobby [i dont get that]
2. auto aimers and modders in search and destroy
3. very small community
4. i've never played campaign on xbox online multiplayer a ton
5. nothing like xbox
6. save your money. had to log 5mins in campaign menu to leave review exposing how horrible yet another COD multiplayer game is trash thanks to modders.

Just played 4 hours of online. Going to uninstall.
Bought on sale for $9 and looked to see if anyone was online in the community hub before i bought it.
Search and destory is full of modders and auto aimers that you can't report.
They talk alot of trash about killing you 0/50 and say ""git gud""

Well i'm asking for a refund, reviewing this game and saying that this along with all of call of dutys old games is full of auto aimers that destroy and completely crap on the emersion.

DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU WANT AUTO AIMERS TO CAMP YOU IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY THEN SAY ""GIT GUD""

also use ^1-9 to color your text and display name."
12695,"me and my friend defeated a whole army of russians and saved virginia through holding on to a gas station.


can we get our medals of honor now?"
12696,cod mw2 is best cod
12697,Got VAC banned from the game for something I didn't  do. I am not pleased. I owned that game for years.
12698,By far the best call of duty game. A game i can always come back too and still have fun. Just a really great game
12699,ONE OF THE BEST CALL OF DUTY GAMES EVER
12700,Dope AF!
12701,I got a VAC fo doing nothing would buy it again 12/10
12702,Classic.
12703,This badge is featured on your profile.
12704,Very nice to come back to an amazing game after all the new cod's
12705,Was a PC darling before 2 but 4 then turned it into the most popular video game in the world.
12706,out of  10 matches played only one hacker  so pretty good
12707,"One of the best CoD games of all time.

Campaign: 10/10
Special-Ops: 9/10
Multiplayer: 9.5/10"
12708,THAT WAS COOL
12709,if you liked the 1st modern warfare this is a must buy
12710,A real good time
12711,Hi folks this is a great game to play with weebs
12712,"Still one of the best cod games I have played, World at War is the other one"
12713,everyone's using an ACR. they dont know other weapons exist.
12714,ten out of ten would buy over Infinte Warfare
12715,"In my opinion this is the best Call of Duty game I've played. It is the sequel to the amazing Modern Warfare and surpasses it in numerous ways. 
The singleplayer continues the story of the familiar characters in new interesting missions. The new villain is quite believable and we get to know him up close, which helps us to hate him some more. Also there are new guns, new locations and interesting characters, all adding up to an engaging campaign.
The multiplayer is an even bigger improvement, adding lots of real weapons with many attachments and a slightly different perk system. All the gun classes feel usable and quite balanced. The maps are big and a lot of them are quite memorable and interesting. Even now I can easily find a team deathmatch lobby, but it's easier if you disable dlc maps.
There is also a coop mode with some pretty interesting missions you can enjoy with a friend."
12716,"The best COD game in the series, hands down!"
12717,"One of the best CoD's ever made, highly recommendabe ^<^"
12718,BEST OLD TIMES
12719,Classic Call of Duty - The good cod's !!!
12720,"Nice game, but short. I finished the campain mode in only 4 hours. Still worth the price."
12721,cool
12722,"Such a great game, the story line is immersive and the graphics are absolutely stunning for the year this game came out, I'd suggest this if you want an action-packed FPS!"
12723,"su campa√±a,üòç de lo mejor :v"
12724,"A timeless classic. The single player campaign continues to be one of my favourites, and I can play it endlessly."
12725,Amazing!
12726,Awesome one of the best cod games
12727,lit game. 10/10
12728,oh shit 360 noscope :D
12729,It always will be the best
12730,sick
12731,best call of duty ever
12732,Multiplayer which never gets old
12733,Nice graphic
12734,Just like old times
12735,I kinda miss this kind of multiplayer.
12736,Best call of duty ever made. I've been playing since the day of release and i still love it. Easily worth the small cost for the game. I know almost every other call of duty player loved it as well.
12737,"The first cod I bought, the first cod I loved, the only one that I would choose... Even with a VAC ban!"
12738,"this game keeps coming back as a key point in my gaming life, whether its the brutality of ""no russian"" or the gripping story that reveals the darkest thoughts, this game set a bar that the rest of the series has never been able to compete with."
12739,"honestly i love this game and everything about it, cant wait for the remaster"
12740,"I really love this game, and even to be old i still like to play this games and i fill like a child"
12741,"I love this game sooooo much it is still awesome to play
"
12742,sickest game of the year 2k16 10/10
12743,"Campaign : A great introduction to the game
Multiplayer : Noscopes,grenades from across the map and grenade launchers. 10/10 would play again."
12744,Classic!
12745,Stand up. Dead. Sit down. Dead. Pass out. Dead.
12746,Great storyline.
12747, I still recall playing it on my father's desktop all night. HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE BEST TITLE OF COD FRANCHISE.
12748,Last good Call Of Duty [*] Still crying in the one of the cut scenes :'(
12749,"The last great Call Of Duty. Also the last great Infinity Ward game (if you forget that most of Infinity Ward members moved to Respawn Entertainment where they made at least two really great games, as of 2016). Also the game so good people keep buying mods for it published by activision each year."
12750,GGWP
12751,to bad games after started going worse MW will always be one of the best franchises
12752,Best game ;~; 7
12753,"Best CoD game still... I just hope they remaster this one.

2 thumbs way up"
12754,Awesome game
12755,"Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 will guarantee you two things.  
Lots of action-packed levels and direct stab to the feels because the final level is going to make you grieve when you finish it and leave you WANTING to purchase COD:MW3 to finish the job."
12756,very nice shooter
12757,"Such a good game, really doesn't get old. The campaign is still a blast to play, and the multiplay still has a decent amount of players. The peak of the modern COD series."
12758,gucci
12759,"This game is definitely a classic in the Call of Duty franchise. Although there's not many people playing multiplayer, you can still find a game of team deathmatch within a few minutes. If multiplayer isn't your style, there's always the campaign as well as special operations missions. The campaign itself is good for a go around, and the special ops definitely tests out your patience as well as being fun as well. Although its an old game now, it's definitely worth it to play through it especially if it's on sale."
12760,CoD at it's finest
12761,"One of the best of the Call of Duty franchise.
No more words needed. :)"
12762,Please please please bring out the remastered version of this game... The absolute perfection of perfect
12763,my favorite call of duty. simple but fun. spec ops is awesome
12764,best COD ever
12765,"This game is, hands down, the best shooter game I have ever played. I constantly kick myself for not playing it more when it was as popular as it used to be. (I play multiplayer like everyone else)"
12766,"This game is so darn good, lots pf playability."
12767,"If you've ever wanted to play your first, first-person shooter game ever, this is the one, speaking from someone who started olaying on a bright Christmas morning in 2010"
12768,"One of the best games of all time. The story was solid. The multiplayer was good until they stopped caring about banning hackers. Special Ops was great for playing with buddies and challening too. This matched the standards of the original Call of Duty's. Activision need to make games like this again, not fancy space guns."
12769,"Best cod, just hoping for a remaster!"
12770,"Still a classic. Despite all its flaws, it's kept me entertained for a long time."
12771,"Amazing game, wish the campaign never ended."
12772,"Best Call of Duty ever made, the multiplayer was fun and the campaign is amazing!"

cs go is amazing and always will be"
12778,Verygood game tbh
12779,"Simple,chaotic fun and broken. 
Best game ever."
12780,"""Remember, no Russian.""

Played it in an airport.
 

11/10    Would do again."
12781,"Awesome game, the best CoD"
12782,10/10
12783,Mission Failed Lads...We'll Get Them Next Time!
12784,This is the best cod
12785,good game to shot heads on :)
12786,one of the best part of call of duty
12787,Great childhood game and my favorite CoD till this day!
12788,Just pure epic story
12789,Best game everrr but there are some hackers in it but still 10/10
12790,"This game is very good, I mean it's not the most beautiful game, but the gameplay is solid.  Also, it is very fun to play the spec ops with friends.  The multiplayer is kinda lacking, but only because most games are with cheaters at this point - not a problem with the game, just one with the community"
12791,Its a great game and yes get it the multiplayer is challenging at best but besides that i love it.
12792,Gotta love this game for a Call of Duty.
12793,Game of all time )))
12794,"good game


333/333"
12795,"just writting a review for the badge. decent game though, full of cheaters. buy bo2"
12796,"WOAH OLD SCHOOL IS STILL ""THE"" SHIT"
12797,Well probably the only game where i cried.Ghost death );
12798,Old but Gold :DDD
12799,beautiful story mode
12800,"I am playing Call of Duty, since I was 8 years old. I just want to say that this game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the best FPS with out Big Maps I ever played. This game is A legend, not a standart one! I was crying a lot on GHOST's death. 10/10"
12801,"Never tried the multiplayer aspect.
I think the campaign is good enough to buy it."
12802,Prob the best Call of Duty ever created!  A must have for FPS gamers!
12803,"Great game, main modes are still populated unlike some of the other games in the franchise. Solid single player, best in the franchise for me personally. Some hackers do exist online but none have negatively effected my gameplay experiences and usually just put you in lobbies with increased player counts which are incredibly fun. Overall it's the best game in the franchise in terms of both multiplayer and singleplayer.

Met less hackers than the amount I have been called a hacker for playing well, 10/10."
12804,"Best CoD game, ever!"
12805,Its pretty good
12806,"Just,Good
"
12807,"This in a clasic. even though it may have hackers running though it, it is still an amazing game. It diserves the TEST OF TIME award more than any other"
12808,"Yes! An overall fun game. This game still has ~500 active players online at any given moment, enough to get you into a lobby within 30 seconds. (Nov 2016)

A nice casual and nostalgic FPS game to play. Gameplay feels extremely smooth and responsive as long as your host is good. There are unfair parts about the game, but in my opinion: nothing gamebreakingly OP.

If you're willing to see past the hacker once in a few lobbies and would like some good ol' fun in a casual FPS: this is by far the best option."
12809,"Still a good shooter.
But the Matchmaking and host system is shit.
+to many russian hackes."
12810,good game well played
12811,i like this game too much/feat tobuscus
12812,AMAZING
12813,Legendary game 10/10 really fun to play !!!!!

12818,10/10
12819,The best chapter of Modern Warfare series. Must play!!
12820,it's cool sometimes
12821,Best game of 2007
12822,There are still a fair few people playing this and 90% of the hacks just put you in a lobby with more people.
12823,10/10
12824,Jarrad is bad at this game
12825,Best COD
12826,Best CoD ever!
12827,still enjoyable

12835,"Multiplayer is still a must have shooter!
I abrove this game 10/10"
12836,"

12841,"Only got this game for the co-op and surprisingly, the co-op alone is easily great enough to recommend the game. A nice variety of missions with a few twists and good difficulty curve where even the hardest missions are still doable. Creates alot of cool moments of triumph, tention, panic and relief. Plus we won one mission when the downed player successfully crawled to the exit."

12844,This game is amazing even in 2016 and i m sure it will ramain the same way!
12845,"Had the greatest time of my life playing this back years ago, for years. Much Love."
12846,The game that just keeps making me come back no matter how old it is. You don't need me to tell you how fucking good this is.
12847,This is the best cod game infinite warefare is terrible and hendricks is annyoing af
12848,7 years old still a better game than Infinite Warfare.
12849,"Best game, in all of call of duty series.
forever!!!"
12850,Best CoD game.
12851,"Wondering if it is still good?
There is no doubt that this is one one of the bed CODS ever made, and it still stands up to this day.
This game has its hackers, ofc, but it√∏s not as bad as you would think, since it almost only the good playerbase that hasn√∏t left for never versions of the series.

Should you buy?
If you like a good shooter, and aren't afraid to learn the maps to compete with this game long term fans, then yeah
This game alsp has the nuke killstreak...... that scould not need any arguments 

The only turnoffs would be that the game is not updated and has a som bugs that scould be patched but aren't

All in all the best that cod can offer you"
12852,bring back mw2
12853,"Best COD multiplayer game.  I've been playing this game for years, first on xbox and now on pc.  The graphics aren't bad for an old game, still has a small playerbase.  Best cod killstreaks of any cod, campaign is also amazing.  Overall a great game that just doesn't get old."
12854,Old but gold
12855,Classic high school days. Full of 12 year olds screaming about my mother and how everyone is homosexual.
12856,This game is very good everyone should buy it
12857,"Classic game that's withstood the test of time. Many, many days spent across multiple consoles on this game.

Full of hackers and whiny prepubescent little boys that claim that they've had sex with my mother, I never knew she got around that much. Thank you XxPussyDestroyer69xX for showing me my mother's true character. 10/10"
12858,"Not sure how to describe the game. The most fun Singleplayer trought any of the modern CoD series, had a multiplayer that could make you OP in any playstyle you wanted, at the hieght of youtube being born, the ""OG"" to commentary over gameplay, amazing and well designed co-op levels, dedicated severs and mod capabilties (Unofficialy).... Probably the most hyped game we might ever see.

I was never expecting to like or buy this game. I ended up paying full price 3 times. Love you MW2."
12859,"I love the campaign, it's pretty cool."
12860,"solid game, runsgreat on any PC nowadays. good graphics for an older game"
12861,i will always love you <3
12862,"i have over 1000 hrs on this game on xbox 360 and a couple days on Playstation and its still an amazing game to this day. I cant wait for this game to get a remaster. 
"
12863,Still a fantastic experience to come back to.  Always love playing through the campaign and doing a spec-ops run with a good friend.  A genre-defining experience.
12864,This Game holds up really well in 2016. Just watch out for hackers online.
12865,"I think I've played enough of this game to write a review for it. 

What I believe sets mw2 apart from the other cod games is how unbalanced it is. After mw2 especially. The noob tubing and chopper gunner killstreaks are just 2 examples of how easy it is to absolutely destroy your opponents. That's what I want in a game. None of this other bs where everything is fair and balanced. I like getting rewarded for my efforts.
I could say more about this game but my overall opinion is 11/10. 
"
12866,"I cannot conplain about this the game is ok but the graphics are amazing.

The sound effect is also fine
"
12867,Possibly the most fun coop experience within a game since Rainbow Six Vegas. All the aceivements are very challenging spent over 48hours playing this game in the first week of its release.
12868,"This is one of my favorite games in my steam library. I never get tired of playing it, no matter what games come out I always end up returning to this game and adding a couple of hours to my total game time. I would highly recommend this game.

note: I did not rack up all those hours you see near my gamertag. I just left the game running as I did not know that seam records the time you play the game back when I started playing on steam."
12869,Multiplayer is a classic. Still really fun to play after all these years!
12870,All Time Favorite!
12871,One of the best cod games ever made.
12872,"I freaking love the campaign of this game, the end almost made me cry :'("
12873,The best single player fps ever.
12874,Probably the best COD of all time. Even with the modders and script kiddies that think they are cool cause they can kick you from a lobby or shoot you acrossed the map first try I would still recommend this game. 10/10 make COD great again
12875,One of the best game of the Call Of Duty Franchise!!
12876,Best Call of Duty ever made! :D
12877,"This game is exhilarating. But not as exhilarating as my pizza. Better pizza, better ingredients. Papa John's."
12878,"I you are considering purchasing this game, I assure you it will not dissapoint."
12879,Remake. We need it NOW!
12880,This franchise shoud be call of Hacks!!
12881,"Ever since Steam began to record hours played, this game has remained my #1 most played. The campaign was fun, the co-op was immensely fun, and the multiplayer had tight mechanics that kept me coming back. I lost interest in later CoD games, but this will remain a positive experience in my memory."
12882,"Steam Awards has opened my eyes to write this review

Thought it has been 7 (just about 8 now)  years, this game's story in the singleplayer campaign offers so many characters to grow fond of. The story is intense and captures your attention, making you think ""Man, what happens next?!"" Though the graphics are to some, not that well, it still manages to appear as one of the best designed games of its time. This is a game that I will always come back to so that I may feel the good nostoligia once again

10\10, waiting for the remastered version"
12883,"The story is so good that the characters and interactions pulls you into the story. Shed tears over the tragic scenes, laugh, and learn with Soap. Thinking about it just makes you want to play it again."
12884,Goty 2009
12885,"A beautiful master peace. Given to us by gods that have fallen from greatness recently. The epic story continues in this game leaving you wanting more. Every mission perfectly crafted for both enjoyment and self improvement. with over 500 days played on console for this game, the PC version lacks local split screen multiplayer. 

Highly recommended, Just awesome."
12886,"Will always be a fun game, sadly mostly people play other call of duty's now."
12887,one of the last good CoDs in the franchise
12888,Rust. GG Kid.
12889,It's amazing...
12890,Still Best game ever.
12891,Best Call of Duty. That was great MP.
12892,Still dank
12893,rip ghost
12894,One of my favorite games EVER.
12895,One of the best cod campaigns by far.
12896,best game
12897,love this game
12898,bottom text blood type B emoji timbs
12899,One of the best Call of Dutys ever created!
12900,Best singplayer and multiplayer experience of COD
12901,"Old but gold, harrier -> chopper -> nuke"
12902,The last Call of Duty worth buying. RIP old Infinity Ward
12903,I got a badge for writing this :3
12904,best call of duty made!
12905,An FPS that has stood the test of time
12906,MOM GET THE CAMERA 360 NOCSUP
12907,Very cool game.
12908,good
12909,"Spoiler alert:








Ghost dies."
12910,One of the best CoD's we ever got.
12911,Best game on console and PC
12912,"This game is just awesome, I remember back in the day, when I first started playing this game. I thought I would get rid of it pretty quickly, but no! I was wrong. This game is the best in the serie so far. They never made a greatest one, if they make a remake of it, I would 100% buy it, eyes closed."
12913,this is game is just fun n stuff okie b0ss
12914,"Recommended
This game is awesome , but a little bit sad :'( is Roach's & Ghost's death"
12915,2016. This shit never gets old.
12916,Still my favorite game and campaign of all time! (Played way too many hours of it on Xbox haha)
12917,"By far the best Call of Duty game ever made.  The multi-player is spot on.  Weapon customization makes it worth the playtime alone.  Not a fan of twelve year olds trash talking you?  Try the story mode.  Very well written and incredible done, right down to the last plot twist.  Definitely do not forget the Special Ops co-operative mode.  Challenge yourself and a friend to finish some of the most grueling challenges on 3 different difficulties.  My pesonal favorites are the snowmobile races, second only to hard core sniping in ghillie suits.

Buy this game.  Play this game.  Love this game."
12918,Reminds me of the good old days :D
12919,Best Nostalgica Game ... Sadly Activision doesnt give a flyiing f**k anymore feelsbadman.
12920,the good ol' days...
12921,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 ist mein Liebling der CoD Reihe! Nur leider trifft man dort immer wieder auf Cheater die einen den ganzen Spa√ü verderben..
12922,Still my favorite COD of all time. No games since have come close. This was the peak of greatness for COD in my opinion. Can't really find matches anymore but still the best COD.
12923,Amazing game
12924,I miss you my good ol' friend. Maybe you'll get a remaster one day and our affair can continue in the future.
12925,yes
12926,Best Call of duty.
12927,fell in love with Ghost...
12928,Should win cus is very fun
12929,Best Call of Duty of all time
12930,Best call of duty of all time
12931,Classic!
12932,dank
12933,Been playing this since its release date back in 2009 and this game is still awesome. Wish Activision would released new games like this one.
12934,I get a little sad when I see this game because its just not as active as it used to be.
12935,"One of my favourite games of all time, Modern Warfare 2 houses one iconic action experience that became a cult in its own. Quickscoping, noobtubing, trickshotting... It's all here baby. Regarding the single player experience it has a campaign that I never get tired of, I discover something new in each new playthrough. Soap, Ghost and Captain Price... The wonderful trio that became front-figures for the franchise. You will feel for the characters, but still enjoy the hectic action adventure without it becoming too overly dramatic. Well, it's relative to what you consider dramatic. It's like a Michael Bay movie at times... Anyways... Moving on here.

Even though this game is about seven years old now, I enjoy it as much as I did when I got it the first time. It is addictive beyond anything else because of its hectic and action-packed nature. It's almost funny how several balance issues became a part of the multiplayer experience, like the noobtubing and G18 akimbo... I can play multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 for hours on end and later realize that time has just passed by in a whim. It is surprisingly stable considering its age, several game modes are dead since the player base isn't as large anymore. But the game modes that you can play, Domination, Team Deathmatch, search and destroy, free for all and hardcore, still hold your breath in a tight grip. 

Modern Warfare 2 deserves attention since this is the peak of the Call of Duty franchise. It's Call of Duty done right. When do we get a reboot of this timeless classic?"
12936,This was one of the best chapters i have ever played in the history of call of duty... Recommend buying it but start from MW1 First!
12937,dank.
12938,Never gets old... Best CoD game so far with its story and characters
12939,"Best graphics, fantastic story and mulitplayer that actually worked."

12941,"Wow...

Played through the campaign almost 3 times on Xbox 360 back in the days. Recently finished the campaign again.
It still amazes me how good a game like this can be! 
Perfect story that can have you attached emotionally to the characters and surroundings.
Mechanics, graphics etc. is awesome.

Multiplayer...
Saddens me how the population has decreased so much since launch. Hackers in almost every game I've joined.
Still brings back the nostalgic feeling!

So yeah, I strongly recommend this game!"
12942,i got a nuke bitch fuxk the hackers
12943,"mulitplayer guarantees a strict nat. prepare for lag fest. nothing you can do not even port forwarding
or dmz no support from IW either"
12944,the best game ever tbh i used to play this on console when i was younger now i got it on pc and i still enjoy this game exept all the noobtubers :) highly recommend
12945,One of the best Call of Duty games. I can play it many times even though it is an old game.
12946,This is a really fun game that i have enjoyed playing on PS3 and PC for over 5 years. I would really recomend this game.
12947,"Great game. Do recommend it, Especially  for the campaign if you played COD4. The multiplayer is also loads of fun.
Be carefully if you have it installed on a hard drive and then you back up the game and format the hard drive, it will delete
all your spec ops and campaign for no reason."
12948,"Enjoyed this game a lot, and still do. Its a nice casual shooter game. Campaign is well made, multiplayer is fun and the grafic is still appealing. However i u should have an open nat in order to be able to play some multipalyer minigames."
12949,Very classic call of duty and very fun.
12950,"Don't buy this game anymore, there are too many hackers on now. 

Honestly the multiplayer is so broken, it's not at all perfect, but because everything is broken you end up having fun."
12951,I NEED SOME FRIENDS ON COD MW2 CAN ANYBODY ASSIST PLEASE HELP
12952,Still one of my favorite games ever made.
12953,the best
12954,best cod there will and ever be.
12955,Its not infinite warefare
12956,"Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 is one of the best games I had played, of a shooter games. I had played this game from, Xbox 360, PS3, and now on PC. I had some memories with this game from the past, and wanted to experience it again.. I mean why not? Right? 
-Pros (what I can think top of my head)
*Multiplayer is still alive
*Special ops (I love playing this with friends, even thou I suck at it)
*Story mode
-Cons
*NAT type restriction, towards strict play from playing with people across other countires (But you can open up the NAT restriction, well if you aren't as dumb as I am)
*Small player base on multiplayer (well at least for me)
*That you're still reading this review. Not playing the best COD game on earth."
12957,"What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.

Now, you may be asking, ""Why is the multiplayer dead?"" The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hickers and children. Hickers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hicker, another five are going to take that persons place. 

The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warfare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and ""clean"" of hickers and cheaters.

Some examples of hickers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:

Wallhickers
Aimbots
Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks
Hud-Hicking (Yes, it does exist)
Instant VAC Ban

The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.

Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.

I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.

If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.

Overall, get it for the spec-ops, and the singleplayer.

Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hicked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.

Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hickers...

-Cheers

old cod better 

0/10 (can I get it any lower??)"
12958,"Nothing to say 
But its awesome game"
12959,cool game XD
12960,Excelent game
12961,this game is good
12962,"YES! YES I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS! THE CAMPAIGN IS ONE OF THE BEST CALL OF DUTY CAMPAIGNS EVER!

For people who like a classic war game this is for you. For multiplayer I have not ran into any hackers and the controls are super easy and simple. I think you should buy this game if you're looking for a good war game for a low price."
12963,Kozak multi szkoda ≈ºe przepe≈Çnione haxami...
12964,unbalanced multiplayer. refunded.
12965,It's one of many classics in the Call of Duty franchise.
12966,My ban is from Mw2
12967,"This games makes me think of old times when Mw2 was the best game out there ! I like how players are still active. The thing i like a lot on this game it's the campaign!! I still recommend this game, this game will never die"
12968,"Thought I would stop playing this but I liked it and I played it a lot
"
12969,Multiplayer Still alive after 9 years. and there still people playing it.
12970,Idk what to say this is the best game i have ever played :)
12971,Like it its fun
12972,2009-2013 Rip
12973,Great game as long as you are not in a hacked lobby
12974,One of the last good call of duty's.
12975,Its a good game but i whant new camos like gold
12976,I love the game and played endless hours on my XBOX 360 and then on PC... until I got VAC banned for a modder leveling everyone up without choice in a TDM lobby to get the banned. Otherwise i'd give it 10/10.
12977,"Modern Warfare 2 is a great game. The multiplayer is quite good and there are more players than I thought there was. You will probably run into the occasional hacker but I don't seem to run into any. The campaign is amazing. Probably one of the best. I would definitely suggest buying it.

The graphics are decent but don't expect much. The third game mode isn't very good but it's not terrible."
12978,Highly recommended!
12979,11/10 would get killed by hacker again.
12980,One of the best games in the series. JUST GET IT!
12981,One of the best CoDs. Could have smoother gameplay but overall good game.
12982,"This game still looks great in this day in age. No need for a remaster. Unless you want to milk the money cow.

Story: 9/10
Gameplay: 9/10

Community is still alive and decent these days."
12983,"I have 800+ hours on my steam and probably 300+ on my xbox. I have so many good memories of this game. Even after so many years, the servers are still up and people play. One of my favorite games of all time. Definitely recommend it."
12984,"COD MW2 is very good. FPV is gr8 and the graphics and animation is terrific. Crisp video, all is great for this lovely COD game"
12985,"Story is good. Multiplayer is fun too. 

If you have a slow internet connection and you end up being the host, everyone ends up lagging and starts raging at you. As I found out years ago."
12986,open nat-type :(
12987,"this game aint dead 
good thing about it 
there no more cheaters :D 
go buy it !"
12988,"One of the most recognisable and idolised games ever made by InfinityWard. Great campaign and an almost cult-like admired Multiplayer ( Which has sadly passed its golden age a while ago, most servers are empty and especially on gamemodes which are not team deathmatch) 

Get it at a discount or as a CD key , as great as this game is i do not believe it is worth its current price on Steam."
12989,i mean.. quake 3 is better
12990,Call of Duty has almost ruined a generation of shooter players !
12991,game is gud
12992,best cod ever its not dead still can play tdm snd dom ffa hardcore tdm!!!!!!

Cheers Valve."
12995,Still one of the most enjoyable shooters out
12996,"too many cheaters
and modders"
12997,"Great game! If you are looking for a game that is fun to play and its not hardware demanding, I think this game will satisfy your needs."
12998,"this game was the best game ever
"
12999,Not Bad :)
13000,Best game ever :D
13001,legends never die.
13002,awsome game. but the single player lags a bit. multiplayer runs smothe . there is very little lag on the multiplayer. 4.5 out of 5.
13003,PLESE DONT PLAY THIS GAME IT IS A TRIGGER
13004,when i was having this game it was cool it did have some problems but i got hacked and my cod game was deleted but i liked the game because it had good weapons and nice killing so thats why i liked the game
13005,"nice
"
13006,Remember no Russian
13007,"Great game, no players left in multiplayer though. If you get a friend and get the game under $5, play co op. So much fun. Cant wait for a remastered MW2."
13008,pretty awesome game cool story this game is amazing it has great graphics and pretty cool dlcs but ive seen better games than this but this is pretty cool and anyway it has very powerful guns and very good character to go with it this game is nice
13009,The last good CoD game :(
13010,"Awesome game, another classic."
13011,nao abre o multiplayer
13012,"I have to say of all the Call of Duty games (that I have played  I am Missing hrs on Advanced warfare and Infinite warfare so take that in to mind ) I have to say CoD MW2 is my favorite it is showing its age BUT the Mechanics of the game to me are great he sounds of the weapons sound great so are the maps  it has a loyal following it has developed some problems for some reason In Lobby chat is broken has been for some time and some times match making takes for ever. Another problem with the game is the occasional script kiddy that is hacking and well makes the game less enjoyable and does not have a voting system like Vintage CoD games U could vote some one out eg, Hacks.

Even with those negative points it's a good game to check out  
"
13013,the only thing thats gonna fucking happen is your gonna get noob tubed grenaded and broken fucking hitboxes this game should die off
13014,I enjoyed it a lot
13015,"Players still here, best $20 ive spent"
13016,recomended by PurpleTurtle
13017,"very good game i like activisioin and treyarch
"
13018,"Would be a good game IF is would work with Windows 10. Problems reported all over the places ,BUT no answers from STEAM....... Seams to be only a problem with loooooooong loading time ;-)"
13019,"[h1]This Game is Different[/h1]
You can't quite find the grenade spam, and much needed nerfs in this game anywhere else. It's unique community gives the game a salty twist, and the starting weapons don't give new players a chance on their first couple of multiplayer games.
The amount of sniper mains, aimbotters/cheaters, (tactical) grenade spam, and short life spans of soldiers make this game challenging to master, but easy to get used to. You will find a potential hacker in almost every game. Plus, the chances of you getting in a server with an [i]excessively harassingly players[/i] is about 9.5/10.
[h1]How to Enjoy the Game[/h1]
[u]Do Not[/u] talk to salty people. They are in every server, and they want to piss you off. Even if they don't bug you, talking to them fuels them, and they usually end up annoying someone.
[u]Avoid[/u] playing in servers with unbalanced teams. If you noice the server is unbalanced, finish the round (or leave mid-game, which I do not encourage) before you become frustraited.
[u]Avoid[/u] taunting other players, or discriminating others for personal enjoyment. This can, and usually will, end up poorly for both the suspect and the victim.
[b][u]Was this review helpful?![/u][/b] [u]Let me know.[/u]
I wrote this at 1:22 AM, so try not to judge. xD"
13020,"While I will still prefer Call of Duty Black Ops II(2), Modern Warfare 2 offers some longlasting fun and excitement. The singleplayer is well handled, multiplayer stays fun, and special ops keeps the formula fresh."
13021,Very short game for single player.  I am disappointed in the amount of playtime.
13022,"Still loves this game to bits and i don't know why people say this game has many hackers i havent even met one yet in my 111hours on this game. The misstakes this game did was bringing the Nuke and i know it's cool but you get so tierd if your match ends by some kid camping in a corner and don't even support his team. The second thing is the god dam One man army perk like come on why would you even let the enemies get no ending grenade luncher ammo all they want for the rest of the match it's just stupid. 

When it comes to singleplayer the campaign is just to short and yes it's a good campaign but it's just ambaresing short but you get the bonus map Museum witch is really fun to mess around with.

The spec ops missions it's just fun when you have a friend to play with.  

The game scores 8/10 for me ^w^"
13023,AY LMAO
13024,best cod multiplayer tied with advanced warfare
13025,Way better than Infinite Warfare just so you know
13026,"FUCKING GOAT GAME LAD

This was the shit back in the days .

13030,Amazing Game!
13031,"Multiplayer is basicly gone. Sorry to say but Call of Duty, you are dead to almost everyone now."
13032,"dis shit is the bomb. Honestly, this game is a little better than COD 4 tbh. Better graphics, better gameplay, and all the other good shit that makes a good fps. Why can't the new COD be more like this. smh Activision"
13033,"super good, but some hackers."
13034,10 out of 10
13035,MLG drop shots galore
13036,Its a great game
13037,"got vac banned and cant play online after i pay 20 bucks. fuk it they even didnt give me a warning after 1 time using a jumping cheat. ngga im broke now and gotta buy a second copy of this game, because its fukn dopeass!"
13038,"Whos up for talking about the campaign? NO ONE! There was a few nice mission but half way through it started to fell dull. The ending was super bad.  Mute everyone in the lobby and hide the chat and youre all good. Try not to play scrapyard, its filled with people who enjoys the tubes.  Its aged well."
13039,Very spicy gameplay
13040,One of the better call of duty games
13041,"I mean, it's call of duty, and one of the last good ones at that"
13042,cause u know..................... cod sucks!!!!!!!!!
13043,"You know, honestly speaking... I don't think MW2 needs a remastering like MW1 did, the game still looks fucking great by today's standards. Always a good game to play."
13044,BEST GAME EVER
13045,"dracula is king at mw2 xx
"
13046,"Do you like CoD back when it was good? Good! This is the game for you! Very Fun. Best CoD.

Not too many servers tho. :("
13047,This game is epic.
13048,"Good game, multiplayer is filled with noob tubers tho"
13049,it is freaking amazing
13050,Multiplayer was top
13051,"This Part of the Call of Duty Frabchise was pretty much fun back in the days of its release, nowdays you will most likely only find hacked lobbies & hackers playing online. Still it was much fun to play the first year after release.

Nowdays I would not recommend buying it, only for story mode."
13052,"I think the game has great gameplay and is very original and fun, but I hate it when the game sometimes quits automatically while your in a multiplayer match and it drives me insane."
13053,"7/10
This game was the model for cod when it came out and was very fun to play alone or with friends and the special ops were very fun. I had many replays going through the singleplayer and the special ops and you would probably as well. The multiplayer was very good and that's why it was so popular. Since they don't have dedicated servers I got vac banned from being in a hacked lobby where the host gave me cheats, and that was disappointing. So I had to buy the game again on a second account and I continued on having fun. Was a great game for its time, it's kind of risky to get this game now since a little of people play and the issues you may run into such as what I had."
13054,"The second best in the COD series IMO. This game was the main stepping stone into the modern COD. This game was and is great. Fun campaign, solid multiplayer... a well rounded game. Worth buying for sure!"
13055,"A simpler time. A better time.












Locked fps tho"
13056,Yes Serbian
13057,it r gud best game 10/10
13058,"hey guys its fred durst
this is the ONLY call of duty in any right minded persons opinion

$20 a little steep considering how old this game is but its a must buy when on sale

You will see what I mean,
Fred DUrst, over n out


Keep rollnnn"
13059,"This game gives me hope that Call Of Duty still has hope...



**EDIT** Nevermind"
13060,Its basically just fucking amazing
13061,"A very awesome game, very replayable and still a decent graphic after all these year. It's even better when you buy it on Steam Sale. Feels better when you play it in UHD, like I do."

13074,The last good Call of Duty
13075,"not gonna recommend this because, its a dead multiplayer game and the story now isnt worth the imaginary bullets you'd be shooting."
13076,Absolutely LOVE this game. Need to do something about the shitty little cheaters though. : /
13077,"best game ever made me walk again



EDIT 9/10 lobbies are hacked full of cunts using wh and aimbot
i will continue to be handicapped"
13078,I bought this game a few days ago on Mac and I love it!  Best COD game ever made.  Multiplayer is fantastic and the campaign has great missions and an engaging story.  Spec Ops is a blast too.  Highly Recommend!
13079,Better Than CSGO
13080,"*As of the posting of this review, I have played 101 hours of singleplayer and 235 hours of multiplayer which adds up to be 336 total hours that I have played this game*

-the campaign is great, gameplay and story is all good
-spec ops missions are fun and challenging and very numerous
- multiplayer is the greatest part of this game, almost every map can offer engaging gameplay, but some maps are masterfully designed and these will become very obvious as you play
- vast variety in weapons and perks, many unique classes to try out
-unfortunately, many multiplayer game modes do not have enough players in the lobbies, but you can always set up private matches

Verdict- falls in my top 3 games i've ever played, and I've played a lot of games..."
13081,"I bought two copies of the game (PC and MAC) to play together on lan. The problem is that coop doesnt work on combination PC - MAC and when I play campaign it stucks on Mission 8 (Mac) making it impossible to complete. Terrible MAC support, so I advise other people not to purchase the game."
13082,Get vac ban for nothing
13083,is gd
13084,"This game is the reflection of the human condition.
We all know hoe it is, and even though the are many things that could be easily improved for the benefit of the most, the few who can don't bother to do a single step. All they care is money. Exactly as mankind.

Would be difficult to change the teamcolors in order to help daltonics?
Would be difficult to fix the server instability?
Would be difficult to improve the chat menu?
Would be difficult to allow mods and add ons since most of kids cheat anyway?

The fact that this game still costs 20 buck is the proof that money is all what they seek. The only reason worth playing this game are the maps, which are quite good, and the men is simple, but there are far better and cheaper games out there."
13085,awesome
13086,"One of the best Call of duty's ever made,
single player campaign: 5/10 (It's The same in the entire campaign...)
Multiplayer: 8/10 (Too many noobtuber...)


"
13087,It took me an hour to get back to the fucking helicopter on loose ends when playing on veteran.
13088,"This game is still 1 of the best FPS games available the multiplayer is not what it once was .  I had forgotten how entertaining the campaign was it was a joy to play through again.  I played it first time round on the consoles as my friends were console players so didn‚Äôt try it on the pc  the graphics look like a modern reboot if you never seen it maxed on pc before.  Best ¬£6 I ever spent

 the multiplayer is ruined by hackers dont think i ever seen so many guys cheatin in the 1 game  half each server cheatin and they dont even try to hide it

Its still worth the buy for the single  player but only try online play if cheats dont stress you .  

So much for steam guard lol"
13089,best game 2k9
13090,This is the best game i have ever played since November 10th 2009 to now 2016 this was always my Favorite COD my #1

13092,"GG
After all this years i still regret the time when i used hacks for this game. For me multiplayer was quite an awesome experience. If you want to buy it today, Sure GO ahead. Enjoy the game and don't hack, You will really regret after seeing your profile reputation with a VAC ban on it. I was a cheater and paid the price for it. So enjoy this beautiful game. 

Overall Experience- Extremely satisfied

13093,Of The Best Call of Dutys  :)
13094,"The sequel to Modern Warfare, in my opinion this is one of the best first person shooters of all time. Classic Call of Duty."
13095,It's honestly depressing how many noob tubes and wall hackers are in this game.
13096,"Great game! comes with multiplayer and story mode! would recommend for first person shooting fans!
"
13097,"The Campaign is pretty decent, it holds up ok especially compared to a lot of the recent call of duty campaigns. It hasn‚Äôt aged well in a few areas, like the gunplay now feels pretty average and the enemy ai is awful. For me personally, this is where the franchise slowly started going downhill. The whole campaign is so over the top it is kind of jarring compared the first modern warfare where it felt pretty grounded in reality. The story in this game is so cheesy and ridiculous and very hard to take seriously. I never thought the campaign of this game was great like the previous games were, it was just decent. It was at this game where the gameplay started feeling very samy and the franchise needed to start evolving and it never really did. There are still people playing the multiplayer and it has not aged well. I found my return to the multiplayer pretty boring and it‚Äôs hard to say if it was because I already played the game until I got sick of it after the release of the game or if I have just played better online fps games after like battlefield 3 and 4, csgo and rainbow six siege. It was fun for a few hours until I got bored and decided to uninstall. I‚Äôm going to give the game the benefit of the doubt and say I didn‚Äôt like it that much this time because I already played it so much when it was released, it‚Äôs really hard to say. I still think this game is good but this was also the last cod I bought because I was already starting to get sick of the formula, especially because I didn‚Äôt find the game to be as good as cod 1, cod 2, cod 4 and cod wow. I did pirate all the games after this one just to play the campaign, at least the campaign of this game is better than pretty much every other one released after it. 
7/10 (Good)"

13133,"Campaign and Spec Ops is fun, but Veteran is annoyingly difficult and frustrating, and Hardened is too easy. There is no in between; it's ball bustingly hard or a walk in the park.

Multiplayer is the part most people come to in COD games, and for good reason. It's just as fun as I remember it to be back when I played it 7 years ago on consoles, but a few things bring down the experience. For one, there is no cheat detection program in the backround so hackers are free to use aimbot, wallhacks, and/or kick you. This goes hand in hand with the fact that there is a [url=http://steamcharts.com/app/10190]smaller playerbase*[/url] than other online games on steam, which is frankly mostly populated by multi-prestige veterans and the aforementioned hackers.

*As of now, steamcharts seems to be bugged and showing that there are currently 0 active players in multiplayer. This is false; the numbers are usually around 500 - 1000 at it's lowest point and 2500+ at it's highest.

Also, it's satisfying to level up and get new gear (as it is in other games that do it, like battlefield) but it just feels like you're getting destroyed early game just because the higher level guys have access to more powerful or borderline overpowered weapons, and levelled up perks. I feel the worst offender is the glock. Tons of fun to use yourself but damn it melts everyone FAST. I'd go as far as to say it's better than some assault rifles. And, of course, the ol' intervention. It's pretty much an awp with the stopping power perk, but at least you lose the ability to 1 hit kill when hitting the chest without it.

Speaking of multiplayer, here's a warning: [b][u]Do not purchase the multiplayer map packs.[/u][/b] After buying them, it restricts you to only being able to queue against players also with the map packs. This wouldn't be as big as a problem if it had a larger fanbase, but right now it practically makes you queue against only maybe 1/8 of the playerbase or less.

In conclusion, it's got some pretty big problems, but I still recommend getting it nonetheless. Get it on a 50% off sale here, or if you can't wait for a sale you can get it for $5+ cheaper on G  2  A."
13134,I was way into this game until black ops took away the player base. Csgo skills did not apply at the time. The storyline is very compelling to follow. Awe inspiring situations to carry out and see. I give this game one sniper scope out of one shot one kill.
13135,It's like Black ops 3 but good.
13136,good
13137,to much hackers

13148,"That moment when you get shot from afar with a grenade launcher and have no way of countering it.

That moment when the enemy has snipers in a map you can't counter snipers in.

That moment when submachine guns are more versatile and all-purpose than assault rifles.

That moment when you die thanks to a camper who then proceeds to steal your care package including an AC-130.

That moment when you're an Insurgency player but still get a mediocre K/D/A thanks to all the imbalances and cheaters.

13154,best game.i love it
13155,"Memories, these feelings.. This game will never die, will remain in our hearts for many years („Å£ÀòœâÀòœÇ )"
13156,"Things I liked about the game:
1: It was exceptionally easy to run. Even with my POS pc with terrible graphics cards, I could still run the game at its highest setting with almost 0 lag. Im serious. It was insane.
2: The missions were varied. Like the previous game, you have action levels, and stealth levels, sniper levels, run and gun levels, the whole deal. 
3: Captain price.
4: The weapons all felt very fluent and natural. Although technically the guns were all extremely similar, they all felt like they had different weight, and had different sounds and firing pattern.
5: Togglable controls. Probably not surprising for many, but if you have a half functional mouse like I do, being able to change the button locations is a goddamn lifesaver.
6: Smart AI. Im not going to sit here and pretent like it was totally flawless, but the AI in this game was definetly smarter and more natural than the last game.

Things I didnt like about the game:
1: The story was total ass. The entire game you are lead to believe that you are going to kill one big, bad guy, and at the last minute they change the antagonist and make you fight him instead. (the fighting was still cool though)
2: Some of the environments felt incredibly fake. In one part of the game, you fight in a suburban US neighborhood. It is so sunny, bright, flawless, and colorful that it doesnt even feel like it belongs in the game. it feels like a goddamn roblox map (Yes, I just said that)
3: The Mulitplayer is very fun, yet incredibly unfair. If you get a certain amount of kills, you can call in things like airstrikes, or fly helicopters or shoot off of jets. It sounds fun, until you realize that you have basically no defense from said attacks. If a few guys on the opposite team gets one of the air-attack rewards, i'd just leave the server. You wont get a chance to leave spawn. The game is over.
4: Some of the mechanics have changed. The biggest one for me is the bullet penetration. In COD 4, you could shoot through any wall like goddamn tissue paper, but in this game, you have no idea what you can shoot through, and what you cant! it is totally luck. Sometimes it shoots through, sometimes it doesnt. It works when it feels like it.

Little things i didnt like:
-------------------------------------
1: The knife no longer stabs, it just swipes. In COD 4, you got to see the knife get stuck right into your enemy, and it was satisfying as hell. Now, you just get to see the swipe, the little bit of blood, and that's it. Why they removed the animation, i dont know, but it was cool as hell

2: Some of the attachments dont make sense. Like why would a thermal scope make my gun have a goddamn heart attack? With sniper rifles in this game, you get HUGE amounts of sway. With acog scopes, you dont. Makes sense, right? So why would a thermal scope, which looks to be the same weight and size as an acog, bounce all over the goddamn place. I literally have no explaination for that.

Hours(Currently): 50
Rating: 6.5/10

My Thoughts:
Welcome to my Second Game Review this year thus far. First I'd like to say, I'm only going to be reviewing games that I have close too Fourty - Fifty Hours within the game. This will be my final review until I began pouring more hours into several games. Let us begin, So this game seems to get alot of hate on PC. While I wouldn't say this game is the perfect Image of a Call of Duty PC Game; It definitely isn't awful. There are alot more flaws with the Game then Pros in my opinion, but none of these are very common which is Why I still give it an above Half Rating. Lets begin with some Pros that the game offers. First, This is the most Popular Call of Duty I can think about, You Ask your friend what is there most played Call of Duty; Modern Warfare 2 is most likely in there top three. It Has a very good reputation on console. The Campaign is amazing if you've never played it, The Ending is considered by some the best FPS Ending ever created. Although I differ to agree, but for sure It has one of the biggest Plot twists I've ever experienced. Just playing that and Completing the mission, Then seeing this Plot Twist through me for a spin. I Was in Awe! The Bonus mission at the end of the Campaign isn't the greatest in my opinion, Compared to Modern Warfare the Original; Though it is only a Bonus mission. The Spec Ops are 10/10 in My Opinion, it isn't Zombies from the Treyarch Series with Detailed Story and Developing Characters but it's very Action Packed. Imagine playing Multiple Missions from a 007 Game. That's how it feels everytime you load up with your friends. The Multiplayer is the best I've ever seen in a Call of Duty game. There is a very great balance in maps, Meaning there isn't more awful maps then Amazing remakable quality maps. The Guns aren't the best when coming to balanced but better then *Cough* AW *Cough* The Camos are the best in my opinion, and the Kill Streaks(NUKE NUKE NUKE) Is such a huge gamechanger. When they talk about adding to the newer games they should look at what Modern Warfare 2 accomplished. Something so simple like a Killstreak ending the game, Yet So Powerful and Effective. There are Flaws to the game though, Campaign: The Campaign has some visual glitches at time but are expected for the time period, and the Bonus mission glitches alot while loading and sometimes crashes the game for me which never happened on the console version. Spec Ops: While I still think Spec-Ops is so fantastic, The only real major flaw I can see that happens very often and is game breaking(Which they should fix) is that The FPS Drops frequently, I mean F R E Q U E N T L Y. Finally Multiplayer: While the Gameplay itself isn't that bad and has aged very well, There is one problem that really has ruined the experience, The hackers... While it's expected in every single game, It isn't too frequent as in Aimboting and GodMode in a older game like this, What is more present is Level Hacking. Now I know, ""It's just a level"" But when your grinding and you enter a Boost lobby it's awful. You can't reset without going through alot of trouble to delete files, And you take the risk of being Vac-Banned(Yes you can still get Vacced, Happens Often) Which really can ruin the experience, I mean without the grind there isn't much to do within in the game besides grind for a nuke or two. What else is there after you unlocked everything? In Conclusion I very deeply love Modern Warfare 2 But because of the Frequent FPS Spikes, and Boosting Lobbies scattered all over the Multiplayer, I'm giving it a Rating of 6.5/10. Although I do recommend Purchasing if your a True fan of the Call of Duty Series.

13182,"I'm playing this many years after it first came out and all the ruckus has died, plus I only cared about the SP experience. Thus in that sense, it was a pretty good game, I wouldn't say great, but quite fun and I can see how it would have developed a following. I foolishly wanted to run the campaign at Veteran difficulty at first... and then had a much more enjoyable time at a lower difficulty as it's a real pain to keep on reloading after dying. Rather just be Rambo. The campaign is not... deep per se, but still plenty of fun, mostly it reminded me of what if World in Conflict had an FPS version (another Russia invades the USA thing). I'd say, if you can get this for $10 it's worth it (about 8 hours of gameplay on single player) but much more and there's better games out there.

13185,"The Call of Duty Series had a fantastic start with its first game back in 2003.

It did something that no other really game had before, and the experience was intense and really fun. Many think it is the better game in the series, but that could be due to the fact it was the first game/experience of this kind. It was a huge success and the following games also sold really well.

A little later comes modern warfare, which pretty much had the same impact as the first call of duty game, riding on being new and a little different, and also having a good multiplayer.

But was the gameplay that different really, despite the graphical upgrade? I don't really think so. In fact, I think most Call of Duty games are pretty much exactly the same, with just graphical upgrades, plus minor new superficial game mechanics that in the end doesn't change the game that much.

If you consider that most of these games are pretty much the same you have to look at what makes a particular title more interesting than another. 
That is, the campaign and the multiplayer. 
Firstly, I don't play the multiplayer because it is not my thing. BUT, it could be worth it to mention that the multiplayer is still alive for this game, and thas has to count for something. Back in the day when it was new, it was hailed as the greatest online shooter there was. 

For me, the call of Duty games are a ""casual"" experience that gives you quite a ride. It is an experience that is truly great the first time that is. It is like a movie that you participate in (slightly). Each scene oozes of high production value and clever direction, great music, great action, and great voice acting. The graphics are not the highest but it is utilized so well that it still looks and feels great, and runs quite well on even older machines.

Modern warefare 2 has probably one of the better campaigns, and it probably will affect you even more if you are an American (I'm not). Later titles all have their cool stuff, but since the series doesn't really invent many new ideas there is only so much you can do before the games become quite repetitive and predictable. 

Problems:
I mean, these games have never been a challenge. They have never been hard to complete, and there is reason for that. 
The problem is that these games are cinematic experiences that really want you to walk down a certain path and do exactly as the devs thought you should do, or the games quickly loses it charms. The first time you do a certain quick time event and/or chase it might be really cool. But if you make a ""mistake"" and have to do it a few times, it truly sucks. Imagine watching every action scene in a movie 3-5 times in a row. You would hate it. And so the game can never be truly a challenge or it would just be truly frustrating. There are only so many times you are ok with insta-death because you went in the wrong direction.

See, If you want a good, complex shooter with lots of freedom you will not like any of the modern warfare games. Multiplayer might be your thing, but then you have to deal with hacking, stiff competition, and angry 12 years-olds. It is a great experience if you don't have to repeat anything.
I also think these game are way too overpriced, especially the older titles, considering what you get from it. The campaigns are not exactly long in most games either.

But I do think that this is so far the best campaign, and even if other titles have had interesting ideas, they never really managed to nail it like this one. Get this game for a ride, (that might even disturb you a bit) for a heavily scripted roller coaster which will make your blood pump the first time. It is really good at that. But get it on a sale  or you might feel cheated.

Cheers!"

13187,This game is absolute awsome. It gives the player the cod feeling i want from the game.
13188,"This version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 holds high hopes for those who want the nostalgia. With extra graphics, the game looks more vibrant and beautiful than ever before and with PunkBuster, say goodbye to those terrible mod lobbies with aimbotting snipers on PSN and XBLive. Still the game retains those issues of improper weapon balance, which still warrants some critism and it does tend to be hard to find matches sometimes. Overall, still not my favorite CoD entry, but the PC port has given me a new appreciation. Although Controller support for those who want it would have been appreciated and there is no official mod support which takes a small ammount away from purchasing such a game on PC.

Call of Duty | Modern Warfare 2: 7.5/10"
13189,"Pros
-Action packed
-Great Campaign
-Excellent Multiplayer
Cons
-Sometimes can have technical issues but there are fixes everywhere

Overall 9/10"
13190,"Best Call Of Duty ever made. amazing story and gameplay.
Just 10\10."
13191,110% Most fun I've ever had in any video game.
13192,Greatest CoD ever made ‚ô•
13193,"this is one of those games i love






but hate the community"
13194,"The classic (and problematic) mechanics of Call of Duty of ""spawn an infinite number of enemies until you go to this waypoint"" are in full effect here. In a game that gives you limited health, limited ammo, and unlimited enemies, it very much forces you into a style of gameplay that may not be one that you actually enjoy."
13195,"""Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart. Whoever wants it back has no brain.""

13196,"Burger Town wasn't fully destroyed.

10/10"
13197,too much hacker but the game is cool
13198,6.5/10
13199,"How to play MW2:
1. Download
2. Play 1st part of campaign
3. Fuck the campaign and go to multiplayer
4. Get quickscoped
5. Rage
6. Git good with a training montage
7. Get the game winning kill
8. Feel the victory
9. Realise your KDR is shit
10. Flip your shits"
13200,One hell of a ride.  Had I the choice; I'd buy it all over again.  One hell of a story.
13201,yes
13202,i love this game but i really wanna get modern warefare 3
13203,Very cool first person shooter game. Have very interesting Campaign and nice Special Ops. The Multiplayer is a bit harder but it is funny to play with friends.
13204,"I love this game, it was a 100% worth the buy and I have had lots of fun playing this with my friends. The campaign was absolutely phenomenal with a great story line and fun missions including a snowmobile race! Spec ops was another aspect of this great game that helped it become perfect. Spec ops gives the player a challenging objective in which they can complete with a friend such as silently taking out enemies to get to the objective without being seen. Modern Warfare 2 was topped off with the well loved online competitive multiplayer which has many awesome and fun maps where the player can show of their skill to the world."
13205,h
13206,"A great Call of Duty game!
I've played CoD on my PS4, this was the first CoD I played, and first I've played on the PC, and this has made me decide to get CoD on PC more often. The graphics are always at the top as expected of the PC. But overall this game has a great story and I think the Modern Warfare games has one of the best storylines of all Call of Duty games!"
13207,"I played for nearly 2 days
i encountered my first hacker
He gave everyone fly hacks
He continued to report everyone but himself for hacking
Valve vac banned everyone on there but the hacker
Hacker screwed us over
I get vacced
10/10 would get vac banned again"
13208,"The game was released in 2009 and even now 7 years later I still absolutely love it. 
This comes from a guy who plays BF4, CS:GO and Halo almost exclusively.

You should definitely buy it, because it's still one of the best games you'll ever play."
13209,"Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best CoD games ever, atleast in my opinion. I'm not much of a PC player, but getting this game on the PC has motivated me to try and get better. In the past few days I can see myself improving. So weather your a hardcore PC player, or a casual one, this game will make you play, over and over again. Truley one of my best purchases, I greatly recommend you get this game."
13210,good
13211,"Game was good in 2010, trash now. This game is so flooded with cheaters you'd be surprised to see a game w/out them, also, there's virtually no punishment for it, only a few get VAC'd, and reporting them does nothing. Not to mention the fact that there are certain guns that destroy everything else (Scar, ACR, Ak, Raffica, etc). There are certain killstreaks that are cleary better than other when it comes to effectiveness (Predator, Harrier, Pave Low, Chopper Gunner/AC-130). The tick rate + netcode are awful (you'll get killed around corners more often than not, when you see someone all you have to do is just shoot because if they try and hide you'll still kill them).

Stay away, game is good (kind of), community is more toxic than Chernobyl (Old COD fans would understand)."
13212,Definitely the best cod :D
13213,One of the best Call of Duty ever with lobby ! but I prefer servers but anyway I recommended this game to FPS players. In the game is Single player/coop/multiplayer so it's worth to buy it maybe it's old but now is cheap ! I am also Battlefield player and to let you know if you are really fan of example cod and bf games it's perfect to buy all of them and finish missions to the end and play multiplayer. For me the best is multiplayer but it's good to know the story as well.
13214,you cant find a game for ground war- community is full of modders and hackers.
13215,"Good game way less hakers than PS3 or XBOX, it is worth the price even for natalgic reasons

Campaign 10/10 Multiplayer 7/10

Multiplayer is 7/10 because there are still hacker, but chances running into one is slim to none."
13216,Best Call of Duty
13217,I would of recommended this game if it weren't for the fact that almost 99% of players cheat and I decided to jump on the large bandwagon and do the same thing! NOW LOOK WHERE IT ENDED ME UP IN! I'M IN A PERMANENT VACATION AND CAN'T DEPART! Anyways... if your going to buy this game I stongly suggest to play singleplayer and avoid multiplayer at all costs (unless your playing with a friend) so you won't rage quit every match you join and keep getting headshotted by the same player 50+ and smash your keyboard.
13218,it was better then the rest of the call of duty games
13219,Amazing story and multiplayer. Recommended if you liked the first Modern Warfare game.
13220,Best COD
13221,ok
13222,"Great Classic, owned this game for years.
Custom Servers are garbage.

Whoever owns a kick tool are considered a person whose claiming to be owners of a server.
Nobody likes custom servers on Call of Duty.

Secondly, Official Servers are so much more better, less hackers than most custom servers owned by owners of abuse.
Most of the time when i play on official servers, the second a killcam goes onto a hacker, he's instantly VAC-Banned.

When i play custom servers, sometimes owners actually abuse their kicking tools because of the amount of jealousy.
Of being better than the owners, its ridiculous how many owners lies about their abuse on kick-tools.

Bringing up some garbage about someone doing or saying some offensive stuff, in-game,
As if nobody has done that in almost every game in existance lol, trash server owners.

Get gud."
13223,"If this game was a potato, It would be a good potato."
13224,Great game if you love camping. 10/10 reccomend
13225,"Awesome, originally got it for the mp and I just couldn't enjoy it. Downloaded RocketV2 and it is 10x better."
13226,"Good campaign; hacked multiplayer. Still worth it, though."
13227,Let's you kill unarmed civilians.
13228,BEST MODERN WARFARE EVER!!!! Aside from Those Annoying Noobs'Tubing Everywhere.. Its Still Awesome!!
13229,This is my Jam..back in 2010
13230,"jeg ikke like
"
13231,Got VAC banned for random connect to hacked server GG
13232,its a funny game and is good more then other call of duty
13233,The most amazing cod ever created! Won't stop playing even if it gets 20 years old.
13234,"Why are you still looking through the reviews!!!
JUST GET THE GAME!!!!"
13235,"Bought it, started the Client, keeps crashing, no fix helps.

BIG FAT BUMMER!!!

Cannot recommend!"
13236,"This is one of my favorite Multiplayer Call of Duty games! This was also the first CoD game I ever bought, so nostalgic! (70h+ atm)
Great maps, weapons and killstreaks to kill your enemies with, especially the nuke if you get it ;).
This game is awsome!

8.5/10"
13237,This game is ohh uhhh aaaaaaa fuk the best ! Old School legend !
13238,"Still playing in 2017.
Great game."
13239,"Mental breakdown inducer 2019 
10/10 Would pop a blood vessel again."
13240,Great single player ! Very interesting multiplayer!
13241,"very good, in my opinion, i recommending it"
13242,game would be better if it supported controllers. im terrible with mouse and keyboard
13243,One of the best cods to date. Story is amazing
13244,"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop.

13245,There is a glitch on the campaign mission where you start out in a helicopter and you are attacking an old castle with an m14 ebr. once it makes you exit the helicopter you get stuck in the ground. you cannot move anywhere. Please fix. otherwise great game
13246,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best COD gamesi ever played. I usaly play COD games on consoles but since i got gifted this game i had to try it. I would recomend this game to other people, new or old COD players. There are still thousands of people still playing every day as well."
13247,its fun
13248,I love this game but no1 plays it so yeah
13249,This is my childrenhood game and i like it very much !

13251,Good game
13252,"Simply BEST GAME EVER !  Buy one ticket for nostalgia trip, you won't regret it."
13253,This is a really good game c: but quite laggy for my computer bc i have a old computer :/
13254,oh my GOD. that guy TOTALLY just KILLED ME in a COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE and REASONABLE way. hes OBVIOUSLY HACKING. REPORTED.
13255,"Campaign is gripping.
Multiplayer is how it should be.
My ChildHood game
One of my favourite games, good content and open maps unlike how they are after MW3
Less hackers here than MW3

Buy this in a sale or on a third party website. Not worth ¬£20. The games 7 years old :)"
13256,COD? The conclusion of steam. Call of DLC
13257,YES GOOD!
13258,made it to 10th prestige in 4 days i feel good about my life now
13259,"Depending on your charitability, the point where the franchise (should have) died.

In itself a healthy game and remarkably still enough people on the multiplayer to enjoy that.

But it was evidently NEVER patched of any of the rather glaring balance problems, even those that where outright bugs. One, quickscoping, was enshrined as an indespensible part of the game herafter for the twats that make up the remaining dedicated fanbase.

Still, the series hasn't exactly improved in any measurable way since. I might say your money is better spent on Black Ops. Under no circumstances should you spend money on any CoD title later than that. MW1 is still the peak of the series."
13260,"This game is so good, wtf ever happened to Call Of Duty."
13261,Good game.

13263,Flashback to the best CoD there ever was... #RIPCod2016
13264,still a better cod than world at war
13265,"after all these years still the best cod
10/10"
13266,Return to a simpler time
13267,"I put a lot of hours into this game during its prime in my 360 days. Back then I thought it was the best COD to be released. It had a good campaign and the multiplayer was fucking amazing.

6 years later, I get it for the PC and its even better. Cant beat playing with a mouse and keyboard. The game to me, is still the best in the series. Im still playing through the campaign and started playing multiplayer, but ill still keep putting in the hours.

It doesnt matter how old the game is, its still the shit. 10/10"
13268,"when cod was good...
"
13269,"Up front: 9/10
High production values stand up pretty well even by today's standards.  Controls are tight and the campaign is varied and interesting, as are the weapons.  There are times when there seem to just be an obscene number of bad guys throwing themselves at you, but that is forgivable given that the gunplay stays fast and interesting.  This is not an Arma sim, this is a well-polished arcade-paced gunslinger experience and it is just plain fun.  Beat the campaign on hardened (3rd of 4 possible difficulty levels) in 7.5hrs which was a bit shorter than expected.  The campaign itself has moderate replay value at best.  The special ops missions (roughly 3 dozen) give you the opportunity to challenge your skills in a wide variety of ways so there is some replay value there, especially given that they can be played co-op.  All in all, still worth 10 bucks on sale in the year 2016."
13270,Well i know that i havent played it that much only 6 hours the mutli player and 2 the camping but i havent seen a hacker or hacked lobbies the game is great and clear from hacker n such but u defently shall buy it
13271,"So new, its good to see something freash on the market!"
13272,"The campaign is good,but the multiplayer part is pretty much dead"
13273,"Cod 2 and mw2 are the best CoDs ever.It is sad that there are a lot of hackers but still,the coop is pretty good and the single player is just amazing,fine story and a very emotional end.This game should be in every shooter-lover library.10/10"
13274,"[h1]""Stay clear of open areas""[/h1]
Boat mission on veteran is complete bs.
This is one of the last golden cod games, multiplayer is dead for most areas of the world, depending where you live you may still find some TDM's or FFA :)"
13275,"Fun game, Had fun!"
13276,Its a nice game really would recommend it especially for its price which alot of the time they put it for half price I remember I got it for half price (:
13277,Nice Game Must Have
13278,This is the love of my life. It is bliss. wooouooouooouooouhhh!!!!!
13279,how do i quickscope
13280,"map tuirns to rust... ITS GONNNA BE A BGOOD SGAKME .. . . . .. . COULD NOT MIGRATE HOST GG AFK 
"
13281,This was the second game i played campaign on... First one was the best one: World at War... I love world war games.. but this game mode here is just fun to play Co-Op with friends or the sniper mission on normal Campaign!
13282,Fun game graphics are awesome
13283,"Multiplayer is great, lot of aim bots running around but other than that its fun. Still pretty lively, but only in TDM and FFA. No one playes Search anymore."
13284,"this has always been the best COD. If they had just supported this game rather than make more of them, they would have probably gotten all my money."
13285,One Of The Best Series The Call of duty franchise Ever released
13286,xxxPu$$yDe$tr0y3rxxx joined the game
13287,"The high point of the Call of Duty series. Thrilling, Jack Reacher-meets-James Bond action that plays beautifully and pulls you into an impossibly absurd story that in any other game would be background noise. The multiplayer is the most fair and balanced as it ever was, before hackers took root and drove that into the dirt."
13288,BEST GAME EVER NOT BUT STILL AMAZING
13289,"From some wiki:
""The year is 2016, and despite the efforts of the United States Marine Corps and the British Special Air Service, the Ultranationalists seize control of Russia and declare Imran Zakhaev a hero and martyr, erecting a statue of him in the heart of the Red Square. Meanwhile, Vladimir Makarov, one of Zakhaev's former lieutenants, begins a campaign against Europe by committing brutal acts of terrorism over the course of five years.""

Some of the best missions you could hope for in single player FPS. Having not played it for 5 or so years, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it still looks with maxed out graphics.  Its 2016. Its still brutal on the harder levels and pretty forgiving at the Normal.  Your team mates still can't shoot straight.  You will be doing the majority of killing, which means hundreds if not thousands of dead terrorists, Russians, oh yeah, and lets not forget the civilians and the responding police force.  Excellent game for $20 I paid."
13290,it is s**t it multiplayer dosent work the only thing that works is campain but i wanted it for multiplayer
13291,"The greatest of all time. Case closed.
"
13292,Awesome game spec ops is amazing and multiplayer is just so fun!!!!!
13293,Great port and a great game overall.
13294,good times
13295,"""Love The Old Call Of Dutys."""
13296,"Not noob friendly but still a really great game, everyone is level 70 rip ;-;"
13297,"Best CoD I've ever played. I started playing it on the PS3 as it came out and I still play the game today (but on steam). Love the campaign. It's exciting, has a nice story and awesome gameplay. The multiplayer is also very good. It has it flaws but it doesn't destroy the game. The recoil isn't too low on smg's, the quickscoping with sniper rifles is satisfying and is supported by the sleight of hand perk. I just think this game is worth the money, even if it isn't in any sale."
13298,"lucky
"
13299,"Played first time in 2016, amazing
"
13300,"Really sick game I hit like 7000000 shots in this, nice job."
13301,If you want to play the multiplayer without your level being boosted do to some guy with mods good luck because I got to level 5 then got skipped to 20 then to 35 and then I returned the game.
13302,got banned like 5 years ago... still good game
13303,"The worst bug i've ever encountered!
Exodus: the laser sensor locks out after you die once making the game impossible to complete as you need that same key to finish the level (changing controls doesn't help either).
It is a great game and I have played it on consoles for years, just disappointed about this glitch that wont likely be fixed since it is such an old game now."
13304,The game is very indepth ad good. I mainly just want to 1v1 people on rust.
13305,Remember when Call of Duty was actually fun? Pepperidge Farm remembers!
13306,"The best CoD so far, still enjoy it years later!"
13307,"What an exhilarating, exciting and unpredictable 1p campaign. Still great, seven years later."
13308,"It's a good time sinker. Nothing else.
The single player campaign it's very flawed, a sequel that no one wanted. It doesn't adds nothing new and feels cringy most of the time."
13309,damn
13310,The last good CoD
13311,Great game. 4/5
13312,Still one of the best games ever!
13313,"This game predicted Brussels

11/10"
13314,lololololol sheperd ftw
13315,This is the best cod game ever 10/10
13316,i was stunned when my eyes laid eyes on this beautiful game that is mw2. im looking forward to getting modern warfare 3 and continuing the series. there needs to be more games like this not the futuristic stuff they are making now.i would love to see another modern warfare but its not gonna happen. im looking forward to the new games like this that call of duty will make in the future. if not there is always battlefield. i highly recomend this game to anyone who has played modern warfare or have not played this series yet. also you dont need a beefy computer to run on all high i run it on high 30 to 40 frames.
13317,Pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
13318,"[b]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2[/b]

Little needs to be said for the video game that defined a generation; still just as badass.

13319,Can't believe the community on this game still in 2016. I got this game as shit and gigs then to realise the community is still very strong with servers filtering out the hackers and improving the game still. 10/10
13320,10/10 great game but everyone thinks im hacking LOL
13321,"Great game, worth every penny. Great if you're looking for nostalgia (only if you have played this in the past) and overall a great game. Highly recommended, great campaign too."
13322,great gameee
13323,"Call of Duty peaked with MW2 and died after Black Ops

Honestly the best CoD out of all of them"
13324,"This game is a great over all but is kinda unbalanced. I only recommend you buy this game if you have experience in fps games or you're f*cked. BTW THERE IS THIS ANNOYING-ASS THING CALLED NOOB TUBING BEWARE but like I said, this game is fun as hell. (try quickscoping)"
13325,"walking around for 1 minutes on multiplayer, got killed by ninja in the corner
best game"
13326,"Great game.
Played online with my friend.
We had a blast playing it."
13327,Best multiplayer and singleplayer!
13328,"Decent multiplayer, may be poor for people in the US/CA, since most of the players are in Europe.

The singleplayer is incredibly short, only ~4 hours, your mileage may vary.  It also ends on a cliffhanger, so there's that.

i'd give it 7 dead Hitlers out of 10"
13329,Awesome game. Multiplayer is STILL alive and well. Go check it out!!
13330,The nostalgia is real! Loving those who're keeping these servers up and (virtually) hacker free <3
13331,"In many years time, I will be in a moonlit wooden hut on a mountainside. The warm crackling fire, sitting at the end of a king-sized bed, illuminates the warm rug. The mattress is plump, raised to the right level. The sheets are thick, filled with soft feathers. A window gives a view of the idyllic scenery. A blanket of snow to match the blanket of feathers. A gazelle prances in the distance. My wife, my gorgeous redheaded wife, perfect figure, hair as red as wine and a gaze as intoxicating. She is as nude as the day she is born and just as messy. I have her across the bed, legs splayed out. Her womanhood bared to take my might trunk. For many hours we entwine, always rough, always sweaty. Finally with a quiver of the leg, my Aphrodite falls back, too exhausted to carry on despite her peak physical condition. I myself, of course, am still fully erect, but give her the moment to catch her breath. I hand her a diamond bottle of pure river water and she gratefully takes a sip to hydrate. Between breaths, she leans in and whispers to me, ""Darling, I don't think I've ever seen your dick harder than it is right now."" I turn to her, look deep into her eyes, and respond. ""It's still not as hard as it was the first time I played Modern Warfare 1 Remastered""

[spoiler] Modern warfare 2 is pretty decent too tbch [/spoiler]"
13332,"Seems fun, need to put in a few more hours though"
13333,Most efficient
13334,very nice
13335,"a very great game, just an oldschool CoD. to be honest i play it more often as Bo3"
13336,"Its a legend.
Man this game is still good."
13337,dis is da best game in da wurld
13338,id smash
13339,"well it is ""playable"" but I wouldn't recommend this actually. 
Just played mw2. Here's what happened.

I invited my friend to play Team Deathmatch together.
out of nowhere we're playing Domination.
First we said, dafuq?!
after that, 2/3 times ""Host ended game""
In our team everyone was under level 20 and in enemy team everyone was almost max prestige.
Sooooooooooo there's sum ting wong atm.

If you want to play this game, play it on console.
Because this game is just a bad port.
"
13340,I Love this Game
13341,"This is a great experince of Call of Duty series. Single player great, multiplayer great. I recommend it ;)"
13342,Peak of CoD. This and CoD4.
13343,"When i first got this game for xbox 360 in 7th grade, i had no idea id be playing it in 2016. everything in this game is OP, it came out in a time before ""balance"" was a thing. It is not balanced well, it might not be balanced at all actually, yet it'd addicting and I will always love this game no matter how old it gets. Also this game on pc is ez mode. LUL"
13344,Best Cod in my opinion Dont Get Bo3 or anything after Bo2
13345,The way cod should be..<3
13346,‚ô•
13347,THIS IS THE WORST PC PORT I HAVE EVER SEEN IT IS UNPLAYEBLE
13348,"This game is a sequel to one of the most and if not the most known and the best games ever: Call of Duty Modern Warfare. Overall it's a solid game. The single player is immersive and interesting. Do not expect the best graphics though. In single player there's a lot of different guns, the story is not the best but it is fluent, the voice acting isn't phenomenal. This game, however, will always hold a place in my heart, like all of the previous Call of Duties: Cod 1 and 2, Cod 5 (unbelievably good), and the Modern Warfare series.
It's a good game, you should buy it, but on a sale; it's too pricey.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+Good story
+Memorable characters
+Relatively long campaign
+Nice missions

[b]Cons:[/b]
-With the consideration of the age of the game, it's pricey

[b]Verdict:[/b]
1	Burn it
2	Atrocious
3	Awful
4	Bad

6	Meh
7	Good
8	Incredible   [spoiler]<--- 8.5[/spoiler]

13349,"Hello there, you just want a game to have fun in?
1. Learn to ""Drop Shot""
2. Get the UMP with Silencer, Marathon Pro, Stopping Power and Steady Aim.
3. And have so much fun!

also Aus servers yay!"

13354,"Return to a simpler time.
Before jetpacks.
Before exo suits.
Before supply drops."
13355,"Easily one of the best Cod games, the gameplay is pretty funny and fast."
13356,"This was one of the best COD games. And it still is if you can get a decent lobby that all still enjoy playing fairly. Almost every lobby now has 2-4 people hacking.

If you can deal with that then play on my friend."
13357,"In my opinion, this is the last good CoD game (playing since the first one).
"
13358,"For nostalgia's sake. If you ever played this on the prev-gen consoles, hit the buy button and replay it to your own accord, MW2 was a great game in the COD series, if not the best (it definitely is for me).
90fps limit (or something like that), but you can play around that np.

9/10"
13359,This is the best game i ever played in my life.
13360,TRICKSHOT MLG 9/11 420
13361,Hands down the best CoD game ive ever played.  CoD4 is comparable but this one will always have my heart.  Its a shame that Activision went full j3w on us.  No longer a CoD player.
13362,"I loved this game back when it came out in 2009 and continue to love it now in 2016. I've seen many people complaining about Hackers in multiplayer, although there is an unhealthy amount of hackers in game, I never let that ruin my experince. If you notice that you've joined a lobby that doesn't seem ""vanilla"", simpley quit the lobby and find yourself a new one. 
If you're willing to purchase this game, be willing to give it some time, if you enjoyed playing it back when it came out, you would enjoy playing it now. Although there arn't as many people playing the game, it's still enough to fill the lobbies."
13363,:/
13364,cool
13365,"No Russian...

If you have no idea what that is about, buy the game. Enjoy one of the most powerful/talked about single player missions ever. Other shooters have tried, (including this studio) but none have quite done it like this."
13366,Pretty good got all the achievements because it was very fun
13367,"Servers are still fairly active, graphics are still good for today's standards, and personally it was what I grew up on."
13368,"This game is cancer, why vac ban still on this old ass game"
13369,"i got the game for 14.00$ next 12h its 7.00$

FUCK"
13370,Game is beautifully put together. Storyline is amazing. Campaign and Multiplayer is mind-blowing and ridiculously fun! I highly recommend for those wanting a nice and smooth FPS game.
13371,By far one of the best COD multiplayer games!
13372,"played the campaigns as a little kid and played through the spec ops with my older brother on his Xbox 360. loved this game and years later after finely tuning my multiplayer skills playing other cod games, i came to get this on sale and made a High Level Prestiged player rage quit. only have 30 minutes of multiplayer but coming back to this amaing game is just fantastic. thank you to the community for keeping this game alive."
13373,"how become my screen is black every time when i enter a game
"
13374,this game is so fun you should get it and plus its not that expesive
13375,"Great 8/10. First of all I know Im Gonna Bunch of hate for saying that. but . its my favorite cod. Sure on ps3/xb360
the multiplayer is amazing and all that. besides the minimal frame rate drops every now and then. Its good
"
13376,love.
13377,"This game is fun and there are still people playing but for the most part its hackers.also comes with isis simulator remeber ""no russian'"
13378,"Excellent game. Like many others, I believe that this is the best Call of Duty game. There are still about 500 people on multiplayer at this time if you are interested in that."
13379,"my first purchased multiplayer shooter, i played the hell out of this, and i have many good memories related to this game. CoD will never be like this again..."
13380,"Single Player:
Interesting story line, so deep, and so Awsum.

Multiplayer:
Very fun casual FPS multiplayer game, great time killer."
13381,"error 51
"
13382,Lots of fun and great to play with friends and there isn't as many hackers as you would think
13383," This Game Is Prtty Good At List The Campaign, The MultiPlayer Is Dead... But Still If You Want To Play A Good Single Player Game Check This Game Out. :D"
13384,best
13385,ROACH DIEING WAS SO SAD D:
13386,"multiplayer is so unbalanced, its choas. 10/10"
13387,its pretty good
13388,They don't make em like this anymore
13389,It gud
13390,"Best game ever. Because of the Noob Tubing and Sniping, its just great."
13391,"great game once played... But when i first launch it, it broke down.... it wont move... plz fix this"
13392,good game buy to gig bang!!!!!!!!
13393,GGWP.
13394,"it goo fam tot legit  fam top rate me cause im cool
"
13395,BEST GAME EVER
13396,Ive Bought it ages ago and i was struggling to find Australian Servers but the community have their ways. The game is a classic and the nostalgia kicks in. Queue the MLG montage
13397,A must have call of duty!
13398,The second best CoD game in my opinion. If there weren't so many hackers and hacked lobbies it would be even better!
13399,"Oh boy, the memories of the good old times. There isn't much to say about MW2 except that it is one of the best COD's there is. Would I recommend this even after all this years - yes. In a dicounted price, definitely."
13400,This is where the CoD franshise ends for me. I played the jesus out of this one. The ones that follow are garbage.
13401,"
love this shit, wish they still made cods like this one"
13402,my life between 09-12 summed up
13403,‚úî OK
13404,Classic twist for COD. Fun to play
13405,"I keep shooting and killing my teammates when they walk in front of me.
It's not my fault."
13406,not for pc its better on xbox
13407,ign 10/10
13408,"Perfect game... For me... First time i download illegal version, but my friend wanna play multiplayer then i bough it :D 9,9/10 for me :D"

13411,Addictive!
13412,Cinematic experience that leads you on an extremely linear path. Enjoyable on veteran difficulty for the challenge. Multiplayer was fantastic but is essentially dead.
13413,The good ol days back when CoD wasnt garbage.
13414,"This is one of the best COD games ever! It had a great single player, spec ops, and multiplayer. In multiplayer you will run into some cheaters though. Also the more people buy and play this game the less of an issue the cheaters will be. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves shooters."
13415,"Literally the best game to 1v1 rust some scrublords in, and practice your 360 noscope and quickscoping skills.

I've only played around 300 hours in multiplayer, but it seems okay.

I'd give it a solid 5/7."
13416,"DO NOT USE FOV CHANGER, OR VAC BAN."
13417,good
13418,One of my favourite Cod games ever. The campaign storyline is amazing and the characters just pull you in. I have compleated the campaign probably 20 times. Weapons are all pretty fun to use. Have hundreds of hours on this game on console. Must recomend.
13419,the best 10/10. Would mod again.
13420,k
13421,"Its always good to go back to an old CoD game and have fun

Multiplayer still very active"
13422,"Nice Game would definitely recommend to all, multiplayer is the best part."
13423,This game took place 7 years in the future when it was firsted released. No one seemed to complain.
13424,1v1 me on rust nerd
13425,I've been banned from this game.. I don't own it. :D

13436,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was one of the first games that got me into CoD and gaming in general and CoD MW2 is one of, if not THE VERY BEST CoD game. (IN MY OPINION) I remember me and a bunch of my mates finding out we all had gaming consoles like PS3 and XBox 360s. We added each other and saw this game at the store. There was like 8 of us in one party it was great fun. We all laughed and had a good time playing this game. I would DEFINITLEY recomend this game to ANYONE that is looking for a good, classic, fun FPS game for PC. Fantastic job on this. (Sorry for being such a long review. I just need to let people know to buy this game.)"

13442,"[h1]Quick and simple review of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2[/h1]


[i][b]Pros:[/b]

[i]-Good campaign, only really makes sense if you play MW1 first, though.
[i]-Lots of customizable weapons.
[i]-Ten Prestiges and over 700 levels to go through (including the prestiged ones)
[i]-Mostly decent community.

[i][b]Cons:[/b]

[i]-Hackers are kind of common to find.
[i]-Some people host XP lobbies and end the fun for people trying to level up.
[i]-Some people have aquired a ""kick tool"" that allows them to kick people at will. 




[h1]Overall Rating: 9.5/10.0[/h1]"
13443,Very fun game. Back when cod acually had a story line and a good online mode.
13444,Story mode is awesome! Also the best multiplayer!!!
13445,gg :D
13446,its honestly the best call of duty
13447,i just bought the game and it wont work someone help it keeps saying steam needs to be running but it is and wont work ive tried everything
13448,"You know, I actually WAS a fan of Call of Duty. However, the series rooted itself to death quite fast with this ‚ÄúA sequel every year‚Äù b#llshit, and specially since they‚Äôre so damn f#cking expensive. SERIOUSLY, MW2 AND 3 ARE QUITE OLD AND YET THEY‚ÄôRE STILL WORTH AROUND 20‚Ç¨ AND 40‚Ç¨ ON STEAM, WHAT THE SH#T. However, is MW2 worth it or not? As usual, I will start with the bad stuff of the game.

First and foremost, the first time I played this game after so many years, I got a bunch of problems and weird issues all in one go. To start with it, the game won‚Äôt let you change your preferences before putting a quite important video that explains quite a lot, so you have to either suffer through the video with the smallest and sh#ttiest resolution, or skip it, change the options and figure out how to see it again. That‚Äôs f#cking dumb, just let the player change them BEFORE SHOWING ANYTHING, DUDE! Not yet done with that, the first time the game loaded, still with the wrong options, it took quite an insane amount of time to load. I‚Äôm not sure AT ALL why that happened but it was weird, thankfully there where no other long loading screens after that. 

Another thing that I don‚Äôt quite like about the game has to be some gameplay things, specially when they conflict with the forced events. Why the hell are you allowed to carry OVER 1000 BULLETS FOR A RIFLE THAT ONLY HOLDS 30, AND YET YOUR CHARACTER SOMEHOW LOSES ALL AMMO ON A CUTSCENE!? There are also some stealth sections on the game, and at times I was detected in weird ways‚Ä¶ Although maybe playing on a high difficulty had something to do with that. The game also pushes multiplayer killstreak unlockables into the story mode and some of those are quite forced into your throat, like them or not. It's not done to death as it was on MW3, but it's still a but wrong.

Lastly, the way the story is handled in these games. Seriously. Just look at it, if you‚Äôre American, British, Irish or so you‚Äôre pretty much made of iron and you will only die in cutscenes. If you‚Äôre from ANYWHERE ELSE, you‚Äôll die by getting tapped with a butter knife on the foot. It would be okay if it wasn‚Äôt always Russian people getting butchered over and over, I end up feeling like Call of Duty is actually made by the government in an effort of making every country get extremely racist with them. I mean for f#ck sake, even if one of the villains ends up not being Russian, HIS ONLY OBJECTIVE SEEMS TO BE TO KEEP GETTING RUSSIANS KILLED HORRIBLY. I bet Activision got bribed by the 'Merrican military to make this games this cool to try and get poor idiots to join them. 

That crap aside though, what do we have left? A decent FPS with an actually quite exciting singleplayer story. 

Seriously, the story mode feels like the classic Hollywood movie, with Bruce Willis playing as the main character, getting shot from everywhere and yet not dying while killing half the planet‚Äôs population with grenades. There‚Äôs a great emphasis on bullshit that would be COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE in real life, but that makes the game quite interesting as you don‚Äôt know what will happen next. It's weird as the previous game was more focused on realistic military crap and in this one you go around with A THOUSAND F#CKING ASSAULT RIFLE BULLETS, but it's good enough.

Some of the tools you can end up using are actually quite fun to use. The sentry guns, the missiles, the drones, and even some of the weapons. However, a LOT of the weapons feel the exact same, especially since half of them are rifles quite similar to either the M4 or the AK47, which gets repetitive quite fast. The game also does shotguns no f#cking justice and that pains me as I LOVE SHOTGUNS. 

Another part worth mention has to be the music. In certain special parts of the game, such as the snow chase early on, it adds to the kickass factor of the game. Kinda sad though, that most reviews don‚Äôt even talk about good soundtracks.

Lastly, the game also adds two other modes, the classic ‚Äúspecial challenges‚Äù (it‚Äôs called special ops or something like that, don‚Äôt quite remember now) and the multiplayer. The challenges were fun, although I completely ignored the multiplayer, mainly because if you want a CoD for the multiplayer, you‚Äôll probably do better to buy the newest yearly CoD title, as they usually stay with the same price in Steam as they‚Äôre too lazy to change them. 

Is it worth purchasing? Yeah. However, the devs won‚Äôt change the prices for sh#t, which means you‚Äôll rarely find it at a low price, low enough to be worth purchasing. I recommend leaving it on your wish list if you‚Äôre interested on the game, and then checking on it during big sales. If it still doesn‚Äôt go too low, maybe look for a used copy for consoles instead, which would probably cost you near to nothing.

TL;DR Edition: Good game about shooting Russians in racist ways. Quite overpriced, wait for sales or buy it for consoles instead. Buy it for the single player, it‚Äôs good."

13460,Nice game but cant find a multi game under 200 ping
13461,"In my opinion this is the best Call of Duty title ever released. Call of Duty 4 was my favorite before this game. Modern Warfare 2 continued on a badass ending from Call of Duty 4. It gave us more character development with Soap and Price and shed more light of the origins of Zakhaev. It gave the story a plausible villain that made sense and actually made you want to take him out. The game ended on a pretty big cliffhanger and left fans on a 2 year wait for the next game.

The multiplayer is arguably even more enjoyable than the campaign. Modern Warfare 2 brought the beginning of the mass killstreaks. Though in comparison to present games Modern Warfare 2's killstreaks were actually balanced since they could all be taken out with various AA such as the stinger. The game is very well optimised and can even scale to resolutions upwards to 4k and beyond. This honestly was the peek of development for the Infinity Ward team."
13462,i love this game you should totally buy it :)
13463,"Hello Steam Support, Recently I've been playing Adventure Capatilist and I got bored really quickly and used Cheat Engine in the game to speed up the process. I have NOT used any kind of cheating infraction in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. I'm 100% sure. Yes I did have cheat engine opened and injected into Adventure Capatilist whilst playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 BUT I never injected any sort of hacking into my Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. So the only thing I want is steam to RE-check my VAC Ban and get up with a conclusion.

13501,"Beware that this is a singleplayer only review.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is an entertaining, but rather short campaign whose well done missions brings you to varied locations around the world. My biggest gripe I have with Modern Warfare 2 is that it feels more like a movie. It looks great in trailers, but isnt' as fun playing when you are controlling the protagonist yourself. Most of the time you have mates around you, often commanding you what to do at which time, taking away control from you each time. While it's still entertaining and worthwhile to play, I don't think that the direction of the recent COD titles is the way to go.

[b]pros[/b]
+ Great looking maps
+ It runs well on high settings. 
+ A lot of weapons to choose from
+ I recognized the shower scene from the movie the rock, the 006 scene from goldeneye and some more memorable scenes.
+ Good presentation

[b]cons[/b]
- It's basically a movie, which decreases the replay value a lot. I want much more freedom, not playing a role like an actor.
- Too scripted
- You know this clich√© where you get shot and your mates save you, making you a mere spectator during this scripted experience? Well, they have overused it a lot. I didn't count it, but it probably happens around 5 times during the campaign.
- Story is meh and the infamous airport mission doesn't add anything to the story or gameplay, making it senseless in the process. I openly admit that I hate this mission and can't see any reason why it should be even in the game.
- low replay value
- too linear

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
This game clearly fails as a good FPS since it lacks any freedom every FPS should have. I'd only recommend this game if you can shut down your brain for some hours and bare through an interactive movie. Don't pay more than 6-10 bucks though. If you want to play better COD campaigns, go play CoD 1, CoD 2 or Cod 5.

Replay value: very low
Rating: 6.5/10
Recommendation: it depends
Worth: about 6-10 bucks"
13502,"CoD MW2 was the first shootergame i ever played. Back in the days i used to play it on my xBox 360 but some time ago I bought it for steam too.

positive Aspects:
+ The Singleplayer is absolutely [b] [u] [h1] great [/h1] [/u] [/b]
+ a whole bunch of missions with, for the releasetime, very good script sequences
+ a lot of turns and surprises in the story
+ very fun multiplayer mode with motivation to get to lvl 70

negative Aspects:
- Story is partly fragmentary
- Nowadays you get kicked waay to much because every idiot is able to get a so called ""kicktool""
- Way to much cheaters on the servers in the last time

In the old days the game used to be great but nowadays i can only commend it for collectors, guys that are interrested in the singleplayer and if you want to play private matches with your friends.

Kind regards

13503,Best all around COD of them all. Story line and characters some of the most memorable. At the begining of MW2 it's current day and near the end of MW2 the story starts to becomce less believable. MW3 is where the franchise starts to becomemore of a fictional senerio. Still plenty of people plying it online. Will run on the average computer. Priced great and  if you could only have one COD game this might be the one you would want. Catch it on a special on steam and it cheaper than a big ass cheese burger. A real no-brainer. Very re-playable.
13504,"Its a great game, when its not glitching. My game was working really well and I was enjoying it until the mission Exodus. When you want to tell the honey badger to do something you're supposed to press the killstreak button and give it a target. What it does for me is that whenever i press the shoot button it acts like im giving the honey badger a target, so i can barely shoot my gun. I keep dying and cant pass the level."

Spent hours of online games, loved the singleplayer storyline and called in a lot of airstrikes while playing S&D and such until i got VAC banned because I joined a hacked server.

pros:
-nice graphics

13513,"I wish I could rate the online mode some where in the middle because I do have fun from time to time. Unfortunately, I can only recommend a Yes or No. While single player is pretty good, the online experience is extremely tainted with hackers and aimbotters. The worst part is that I do not believe anything is really being done about it. I will admit that I have had fun playing online. But this really only happens if I am able to get enough friends together to start a party. To sum it up, if you plan on playing online, expect this: You will continuously be shot through walls by aimbotters, ruthlessly tracked down by wallhackers, rude players, the occasional dDos from poor sports that can shut your net down for a bit, and you will quickly discover how sexually active your mother actually is (likely within the very first match)."

I dislike nothing about this game and have been playing it since midnight release back in 2009 on the Xbox 360. This game will be considered as a classic and will always have the replayability that is has now. I can see myself coming back to this game in ten years to experience the noob tubes and try hard quickscopers and relive my experience from when I was 9 years old. I may be young, but this game is the Mario and Pokemon of my childhood. I grew up on first person shooters like Halo and Call of Duty and this game was my number one played FPS. This game on the PC has barely any hackers at the moment, it did a few months back, but they're gone now. 

This game is in my top 5 favorite games of all time and will remain there for years."
13518,"Modern Warfare 2 is pretty fun for how old it is. The multiplayer is really fun and I really enjoyed the campaigns storyline. Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best Call of Duty games released. 

The game runs really well. You get a small amount of graphic controls but you should be able to play if your computer is not that old. The default control options are really bad; I recommend changing them.

The multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) is really solid. Even though its old I have no problems jumping into a full game of Team Death match. The game is still well and alive. There are some cheaters but I don‚Äôt see the that often anymore. 

Since this is an Activision game, MW2 is full of DLC. I would recommend not buying any of them. Activision is very greedy and charges full price for a game from 2009. I would strictly buy this game for the multiplayer or campaign then nothing else.
"
13519,"It¬¥s a great game, but way to many hackers. :("
13520,Probably to date the best storyline of any shooter game i've ever played. This game never turns stale. I still play it again and again to this day
13521,Ghost dies shepard betrays you and makarov gets away
13522,good game bra
13523,A Classic
13524,Wish their were higher settings for the video image so it would look better.
13525,"it is a great cod. Not just a great cod, THE BEST COD EVER MADE!! I absoloutley adored the campain and the multiplayer was just so good 100/10 BEST FPS EVER!!!"
13526,The mutiplayer for this game is awesome! Looking forward to finish the campaign too!
13527,Squad
13528,"Good game, but fuck Activision.

Also Troy Baker is in it. Fuck it some more."
13529,1v1 on rust right now
13530,Sadly this game has lost it¬¥s glorius fun days it¬¥s good to see people still play it but sadly the game is overuned by Russians who hack or only use rocket luncher or granade lunchers only. But co-op is still fun as hell worth getting to game just to play with friends. I have 577h put in to the game even if some what it does not say so on this review.
13531,This is the best CoD game ever. The campaign has an excellent storyline and the multiplayer is fun as hell.
13532,Basically one of the best call of dutys of all time
13533,"replayed this game on win10 for the first time since it came out 6 years ago and i have to say that this is one of the top 3 games i ever played. even the graphics looked amazing and  crisp with drs. the story line is suspense and exciting. i wish they would make more games like this, including all the little details. ai's could die a little bit easier and faster. of course i talk about the single player missions, as multiplayer is left for the brainless idiots in the gaming world to jump around and shoot each other."
13534,"Love This Game! It's Is Easily One Of My Favorite Call Of Duty Games!
And There's No Supply Drops! LOL!"
13535,A really fun game for people who like FPS's. You can play on a variety of maps on a great and competitive multiplayer with friends or play a really fun campaign. It has the classic COD feel and isn't hard to figure out. It doesn't have the best graphics because it is an older game but that doesn't take away from the game at all. Anyone who likes COD games and FPS's I would highly recommend this game to you or anyone who wants to try COD out.
13536,This game is one the best games out there  evn tho i didnt play alot i still enjoy it.  Definetly reccomend this game.
13537,nice game

13548,I don't hack on this game I swear.
13549,"I like it alot <3
"
13550,Best game ever made <3
13551,"One of the best COD games ever made, but multiplayer is kinda hard to get into since it's full with MW2 veterans, but besides that 10/10"
13552,Great Game!!
13553,"I loved this game, everything about it, the music, the levels, the betrayals. Had it since release way back in the day. 10/10 will undoubtedly play many times in the future.

The campaign carries on from the events from MW, The early and late battles in Afghanistan are fun and stimulating, the Russian invasion of continental US is theatrical and memorable. These sections being my personal favourites the music and atmosphere are incredible, ""Of Their Own Accord"" and ""Whiskey Hotel"" are phenominal from the moment you start in the trench bunker until you stand at top the ruins.

The Spec-Ops was a blast, both played alone, or co-op with a friend. A friend is optional but highly recommend specially if you're looking to play the 2 best levels, ""Overwatch"" and ""Big Brother""

the  Mulitplayer I never touched so I wont pass judgement."
13554,"11/10 Cheapest, easiest, and most fun way to get a VAC ban. Would buy again."
13555,"This review focuses on the campaign as the multiplayer is a mess of 9 year olds who had sex with my mom, and hackers

MW2 is a great follow up two the second game and is the best campaign i have ever played in a FPS game

After a attack at a Russian airport leads to conflict between the U.S. and Russia you must play as new people and fight agansit the person who arranged the whole thing Makarov

The game takes the whole kill someone you play as to a whole new level and thats all im saying about it.
You should stop reading reviews and buy the game."
13556,gud
13557,Best fps game ever?
13558,"Maybe the best CoD, and i rly loved it. 
BUT: Today i would not recommend to buy it, becouse of the hacker lobbys its nearly unplayable 50% of the time. You can leave these lobbys, but they will force you into them again if you search for a new one ... Maybe still the best CoD of them all if they could stop even VAC banned ppl to still hack and play this game..."
13559,LOVE IT
13560,"Best Call Of Duty of all time!!! Seriusly this is a great game, (my favourite i own this game on 3 different platforms thats how much i love it), and if your worried about online don't worry, as long as u play ffa or snd u will always have ppl to play and i must say at the time of this review i haven't played against a cheater, but if you're looking for a online experience with more players and more cheat security u can use a thing called ""IW4x"" that basically alows u to play on dedicated servers, and thats were most of the community is right now, btw if u want this game just to play online on dedicated servers, its totally free, just check this link for instructions: [url=https://iw4x.org/] https://iw4x.org/	[/url]

Hope I helped u, this is defenitely a great game :)"
13561,Gay
13562,can someone help me it wont let me go online it says steam connect failed
13563,Best COD ever to exist. Period.
13564,"Absolutely amazing game, blew me away. The campaigne could be made in to a genuinely amazing movie, and the multiplayer is endlessly fun

Despite how legendary this game is. After having completed the entire game and having 40 stars or so in spec ops, the game out of nowhere decided to delete all of my progress. All of my other steam games have no problems, but MW2 for some reason is now a completely fresh save with nothing on it, except for my multiplayer. Extremely disappointing, especially from such a legendary game, to out of nowhere delete all of my progress."
13565,good game! best series in all modern warfare franchise
13566,Definitely the best COD ever...
13567,When Call of Duty was still good..
13568,This game is now dead.... still fun though... sometimes.... h4ck3rz eveRywh3re

"
13572,needs controller
13573,Pretty nice game :d
13574,Blast to the past.
13575,"Its a pretty decent game but not better than battlefield 3 . I don't Know why ea pulled out their games from steam.
"
13576,Very nice game.
13577,Cel Mai smecher COD!
13578,Just as good as it used to be
13579,"the single player is short. like really short. its alright I supose but I wouldnt buy this game for single player. I'd save my money for something more expansive with a longer more satisfying ending and a better story that makes no real sense.

the multiplayer is shit. conecting takes way to damn long. and the game is just plauged by hackers.

inshort could be so much better go buy battle field 1 instead."
13580,"The singleplayer is great, but if you want to buy this for the multiplayer like I did, don't bother. It's filled with cheaters and last I heard a VAC won't stop the cheaters from continuing playing."
13581,Me and my dad play this a lot I just wish he would stop telling me he fucked my mom.
13582,This Game doesn't works the multiplayer is so lame. Every round laggs. 20‚Ç¨ too much for this shit!
13583,"very good game reasons
1.good graphics
2.smooth gameplay
3.playing with firends"
13584,What the hell kind of name is Soap?
13585,so much fun. it was a little lagy but i sorted that out its a mean game
13586,"Pretty good experience overall, Campaign holds up quite nicely, beats damn near everything that came after it, and most of what came before it. Special Ops is a great way to waste time and blow off some steam if you're pissed about getting tubed for the thirty bajillionth time. Multiplayer's legendary, is there really anything to say about it that hasn't been said before? Would definitely recommend."
13587,"decent fun, cod 4 is better tho"
13588,"If you hate niggers, you'll love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
13589,need help setting up my xbox one controller for MW2
13590,"[b]Please note: This review contains spoilers for the plot from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. If you have not finished that game in full, I do not recommend that you read this review until you have done so. That is, unless you do not mind spoilers. Consider this your fair warning.[/b]

The Call of Duty series has always been on an annual schedule, and since the second installment it has always traded off years between developers Infinity Ward and Treyarch; with the exception of Advanced Warfare, which was crafted by Sledgehammer Games... but that's an entirely different review. Fans of the franchise seem to love one developer and hate the other, depending on their taste. Modern Warfare 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Infinity Ward's original 2007 classic of the same name, coming in two years after its release.

At the end of the first Modern Warfare, Soap and Captain Price were left bloodied and lying on the battlefield after taking down Zakhaev. Their survival is left up in the air, and after the credits rolled the short epilogue mission Mile High Club becomes playable; the events that unfold during this outro lead into the cause of Modern Warfare 2. The game is set five years after the events of the first, the ultra-nationalists have taken control of the Russian Federation. Due to this, any diplomatic relationship with the United States has become strained. Zakhaev's right-hand man, Vladimir Makarov, has begun a campaign of revenge against the west by unleashing acts of terrorism on both European and International land.

Even though you control five different characters throughout the campaign of Modern Warfare 2, the plot is easier to follow than its predecessor. The two primary characters of focus are Sargent Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson and John ""Soap"" Mactavish, who is now a captain after surviving his earlier tour through hell. There are a good amount of plot twists that will keep players interested and on their toes as they progress through 18 levels in total, for a cumulative play time of roughly 5-6 hours. There are also a large amount of action sequences that help keep the shooting scenes fresh and alive; the game never becomes stale at all.

There are a great number of environments for both the exploring and destroying. From an underground submarine launch, to a brief stint in space, to snow filled landscapes, and war-torn urban streets. For a title that's nearly six years old, the graphics have held up surprisingly well; even better than in the first Modern Warfare. Everything is richly detailed, and there's more variety to the enemy models as well. I'm pleased to say that this game runs wonderfully on Windows 10, and I consistently maintained 60+ FPS at all times with no bugs, crashes, or glitches. However, there is a large amount of stuttering during exceptionally busy missions, as the framerate will jump up and down constantly.

The gameplay and controls are more of the same that you would expect from any release in the Call of Duty franchise, the specific controls are ones that have set standard for all first-person shooters that have been released after 2005. The kills still feel solid, connective, and satisfying; although in comparison to the first Modern Warfare, this release has a larger amount of areas where endless enemy spawns are present, a mechanic that forces you to move up or get overrun and waste your ammo. This is one feature that made the earlier games in the series so difficult, and it's both good and frustrating to see it back in full swing.

The only real down point to Modern Warfare 2 is that it isn't quite as memorable as the game that came before it. This may be largely based on the fact that the relationship between the soldiers isn't as solid as it was in the previous release, at least not until much later in the campaign. Some missions aren't easy to forget, mostly due to the difficulty associated with them, but very few stick out as what would be considered a ""classic"". Some noteworthy levels are ""No Russian"", ""The Gulag"", and ""Whiskey Hotel"". 

If you're here looking for multiplayer, this title retains the same mechanics as the original Modern Warfare in that it still has the leveling and prestige systems in place. There are a handful of new features, such as unlocking titles and emblems that can be displayed on your player card, and different rewards for maintaining a various amount of kill streaks. Quite a bit of time was pumped into multiplayer from me when this game first released, and it's a pretty addictive experience. This is the first game in the Call of Duty franchise to utilize the Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) system, so there are far less cheaters here than would be in any previous title. However, BEWARE, since players can host their own servers, some gamers have been VAC banned by simply joining a server that has modified files and cheat systems in place. Play online at your own discretion.

The final word is that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a decent follow-up to the first Modern Warfare title. The story is very captivating and interesting, and it really makes you want to keep playing to know what's going to happen. Some characters are introduced too late, making some of the relationship bonds feel a little weak, and while the missions are fun only a few of them will be remembered in years to come. Highly suggested to fans of the first release, and those that enjoy a good Call of Duty campaign. If you didn't enjoy the first Modern Warfare, you're not going to like this one any better, so move on.

Go buy it already."
13601,Like hacks have no life so yea cod mw2 need banned all hacks and clean it up this game
13602,"Well I only got this game because I thought it came in a bundle with another game. Don't think I'm stupid but when those COD fan boys said 1 v 1 me on rust, I thought they meant the game rust! No impressed! Where is my game rust? The map rust looks nothing like the game rust!!! Fuqu  you Ubisoft!"
13603,"Enabled VAC again, no players online. **** THIS SHIT! 



"
13604,"- Joins S&D Highrise
- Walked out of spawn and my whole team died in 5 seconds 
- Spectates the other team and 4 hackers

10/10 would get mega rekt by hackers again
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)"
13605,Recommended Game
13606,Classic Call of Duty. boots on the ground. Story has amazing characters and a gripping story that keeps you engaged. Multiplayer has hackers but spec-ops is fun.
13607,"One of the best CoD out there, before they started rushing them and adding all the DLC. I still like the graphics. The voice acting from the campaign and the music are very good, and so is the story: it has some nice, but perhaps predicable, twists.  You end up feeling sympathy for Price, Soap, Roach and others. I also like the variety of weapons in all of the ranges (short, medium and large range). The Special Ops missions are really good and have, I believe, a lot of replay value. Some of them are quite hard and require time and focus. I cannot speak of the multiplayer because I have not experienced it.
All in all, if you are looking for a solid, not-so-old FPS, you can try this game. If you are not sure, it price gets dropped around 50% every now and then."
13608,Good Game. but too many hackers
13609,"Hey, that's pretty good!"
13610,"This game is how I caught my VAC Ban for changing my FOV. Just get it through I.W.4.x (free) since there are still active servers, no cheaters, and way more optimization. Steam release is beyond terrible"
13611,best game!!!
13612,"This game ain't like it used to be. It's rare to find a decent lobby. Most of the lobbies are full of one-army tubers, cheaters, and hosts that will abuse kick-tools.

Activision don't give a damn about this game, we even had players with VAC bans playing online without a problem for about three months.

Favela still remains a long lost dream.

Still fun to play, just not that much anymore."
13613,"Probably the best CoD ever in history, but if you havent played before i suggest you buy a newer CoD with newer players. Because this game is much about skill! When you get used to the movement and that kind of stuff, this is the game for you!

I'm now waiting for the remastered edition, i hope :D"

13615,I have a special amount of hatred reserved for this specific game. Effectively killed Call of Duty on PC.
13616,"If you only want it for SP, go ahead its great. However if you want it for MP be prepared to deal with hackers, noobs, lag and the fact that the only lobby with many people is TDM."

13618,pretty good if you know how to install textures

13630,"(Spoiler Free Review)
The Iconic Modern Warfare trilogy is the best in the Call of Duty series,
Let's start with the campaign.

Story:
The story is well written it help engage players to 
know more and continue playing as play along.

Characters:
Memorable and well developed characters even with the
side characters are supportive towards the player. 

Gameplay:
Cinematic and action-packed, the Modern Warfare series has changed 
the face of FPS forever with different ways for players to engage the enemy

Music:
The best part of it is the music composed by the iconic Hans zimmer (The Dark Knight and Inception)
as he plays well fitting music from dramatic to intense missions

Graphics:
The graphics are well done especially during its time amazed players with amazing textures 
and models 

Now for the Multiplayer

Everything is plain and simple the limits still makes it fun from what is 
Call of Duty now with different perksand weapon attachments.
Modern Warfare Multiplayer is simple, the limitations makes the player think
on different strategies to overcome the changing play of the team and the 
opposing team.

Pros
+Amazing Campaign well worth the time
+Special Ops work alone or play with your friends
+Simple multiplayer
Cons
-There are times that you might play with hackers and
annoying kids (Multiplayer)

"
13631,"Probably the best COD game ever made, great engaging story continuing where MW1 left off. Multiplayer is still as good as i remember it and hasnt been this good in any other COD game to this day."
13632,"UMP45,Sniper,M203,G18 Akimbo
maybe Iw is no have brain"
13633,WAY TO MEANY TEXTURE GLITCHES IT IS NOT PLAYABLE DO NOT BUY
13634,Best cod ever
13635,"By this point in the seris the series still had some life in it.

 The single player is controvertial in its storyline and what it allows you to do but it's still player choice. I'm thinking of the no Russian mission. Its linear hand holding enemy respawning killboxing fare but It remains visceral and enjoyable throughout but theirs nothing that reaches the hights of the first games chernobyl mission which is one of the all time great fps missions in my humble opinion.  

The mp is obviously what people want to play and what still gives this game life for as long as it lasts. In its original foarm it is fast and fun and gives big and little guys chances to win big over interesting maps where practice realy does make perfect. 

An enjoyable entry whos sp remains worthy of some atention and where the meat and potatoes of mp will diminish over time as it inevitably must."
13636,"pros: highly anticipated game of the year, best selling first person action game of all time, gripping heart racing action

cons: found out a lot about my mothers sex life due to the in game voice chat, became slightly depressed due to banter and have had to begin taking zoloft"
13637,10/10 best game.  Also my fav.
13638,"As much as I enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it.

There is still no custom lobby support / dedicated server browsing.
There are cheaters in EVERY game and it seems that there is absolutely no anti-cheating mechanism in place, since they don't get VAC banned or even kicked.
And they removed the absolute best map of any first person shooters (my favorite): favela. 
I actually bought this on steam only to be able to play in that map in multiplayer again, and to my enormous disappointment found out they removed it YEARS ago because of some misplaced potentially religion-offending content and never patched it back.

Game has potential, still the most fun CoD, but the devs made very poor choices and basically showed the consumers their middle finger."
13639,this game beats all other cods screw black ops 3 youd be wasting 60 bucks buy this and save 40
13640,boring mw3 is better :((
13641,"Perfect game, its not infinite warfare. DONT pay $20 for this, get it on  https://adf .ly/1c2xT1"
13642,I forgot how much I love this game. This game was my childhood. Best CoD 10/10.
13643,Better than Infinite Warfare.
13644,"The last Call of Duty that has been okey.

But since last year there is alot of hackers and trollers thats why i say NO!"
13645,"Having completed all games in the Modern Warfare Trilogy, I can safely say that this is the best title of the lot.

The gameplay from the first Modern Warfare is polished and updated, the range of locations visited is more diverse and varied, and the story nicely continues that of the last game while adding in some twists and 'holy shit' moments of its own.
I especially loved the sniper-stealth levels (choreographed as they may be), and the famous *hem-hem* airport sequence lives up to its expected charms.
I also freaking love Taskforce 141 (seriously, Activision, just make another game about them and my money weill remain on the fucking table).

If you're a newcomer to the series who's not interested in the story and only wants some gameplay, I'd say this is the one to try out first. If you're more invested in the plot, go ahead and play Modern Warfare 1 (I highly encourage it- it's a really good game) and then play this one. You won't regret it."
13646,"Pros
-Good Story
-Good Graphics
-Multiplayer is ON

best fps game all the time, no jump for fly"
13647,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
Nighthawk's Score: 8.8/10

This was my first COD game. I don't know why but I always had a chip on my shoulder towards COD since it's beginning, I think because it seemed like a rip off of Medal of Honor with the first few versions. This game changed all that. This was a fast paced FPS with a polished feel and great unique content and game dynamics. The single player story was pretty good too. Too bad they couldn't keep up the pace with the following games in the series after MW3."
13648,This one is the best COD I've ever played.
13649,One of the best Call of Duty games in the series
13650,"The best CoD game there ever was. 
Honestly. Buy this. Save it somewhere dank. Grow some kids. Present it. Recieve best-dad-award."
13651,"I don't have this game but can somehow write a review, nice one steam devs!"
13652,"Many players have complained about hackers taking over this game but I've played for 5 hours and haven't noticed a single one. (Note: Multiplayer time is not saved on Steam). People said, ""Ah, 1 out of 10 matches have hackers or others said ah, about half of the matches have hackers."" Meanwhile here I am, I'm not even talking about matches, I'm saying FIVE HOURS of play time and NO hackers. It is possible that there could have been someone using an aimbot or something else that I did not realize but the difficulty has felt completely normal in every single match. I'm a low level due to just starting out and there are some other low levels scattered in the matches but mostly people lvl 70, yet nothing has stopped me from being in the top 3 many matches. I'm not saying this to boast, I'm saying this for the people who are skiddish about getting the game just like I used to be. I was scared of a bad experience due to hackers or tons of high level players. It's not the case here.

As far as servers go and playing with friends compared to Modern Warfare 1, it is the same as the console version of MW2. It auto selects your server based on ping and it has an ""Invite"" button for partying up with your friends. It worked just fine for me and my friend. You pick your desired game mode and then the game auto-selects the server and map but players can ""vote to skip"" the current map.

The graphics are slightly better than how I remember them on console. Menus, music, sound effects, hit boxes, your HUD, feels EXACTLY like it should. Player base has been anywhere from 400-1200 while I've been playing. I have not tried the single player campaign.

The only downside to this game is that it really could use more players. Team Deathmatch, Free-For-All, Domination, and some Hardcore modes are the most populated. Otherwise, in my opinion MW2 on PC is still just as great as I remember it being on console years ago. As of right now, ignore the negative reviews! As far as I've witnessed there have been 0 hackers!"
13653,Copied infinite Warfare. Also to Modern for me
13654,"Okay, I played it on a friend's xbox before owning it myself. Still excited to play the pc version. Got it gifted because my pc was a bit of an arsehole a few days ago. But still, I'm not that good with serious reviews so let's just make it quick.

Pros:
- Absolutely nice story
- Cool weapons
- Multiplayer is still pretty much active, no worries there
- CAPTAIN JOHN PRICE
- GHOST
- CAPTAIN JOHN ""SOAP"" MACTAVISH
- British accent (I'm not bothered with Brexit :v)

Cons:
- Stupid bots in some parts of the story
- Hackers and cheaters in multiplayer (aim bot and so on)
- Not cool enough bgm imo :v
- GENERAL EFFIN SHEPARD (Just, why?)
- Ghost's death (and Roach's as well)

Pretty much recommended for those who ain't really 'bout advanced technology and still love to fight the sh*t out of your life to defend it. :v b"

13660,its a fun game. it will defintely keep your attention for a long time.
13661,thanks obama
13662,Awesome game brings back so much memories but way to many hackers
13663,i would suggest not getting this game because sometimes when you open it the game freezes intantly and you have to restart you computer
13664,"What can I say about Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2. 

Whenever I think of MW2, I think of bliss, I think of flying through the clouds without a care in the world, talking to our lord and saviour jesus. This immense feeling of paradise can only be achieved after playing MW2. Soon afterwards, people will try and stop your progress to Utopia. This stage is called chemotherapy. Ignore them and continue on your fast track to heaven, because after playing this game you will immediatley begin to die of cancer. 

The amount of cheaters is absolutley ridiculous, it outnumbers the cheaters in CSGO by 300:1, and that is saying something. It would be okay if they at least tried to hide it because at least then I can try and believe that they are better than me. MW2, a game where its weird if you dont encounter mulitple hackers. 

More importantly than this, the amount of fucking faggots on this game is even more obscene. Who opens up a game and thinks 'How can I be a fucking rat today?'. If I had a pound for every time I have been noob tubed, I could stack them all up, climb up and be the first man to walk on Mars. The amount of tryhards overwhelm all my emotions. I normally miss the final kill cam of every game because im curled up on the floor, sucking my thumb and rocking myself to sleep. 

Finally, can we get chat disabled? Its either that or castrate every single person that says 'GG' after a TDM. Who the fuck do you think you are? Its a DM, not ESL One Cologne you braindead fuckhead. 

In conclusion, this game isnt the worst game ever, but there are some points (highlighted above) that could be improved."
13665,"One of the better COD. I think there is no person on steam who does not know COD, so I will not explain it. But, do not buy this game, if you want to play it online, you will find hackers/ultra pros. There is no fun at all. However you will have a lot of fun, if you play this with your friends in small sessions like 2v2 or 3v3."

13683,"Wish i could give two thumbs up, onee of the best fps games ever and love playing it. 

11/10 - Definetly suggested"
13684,"It was fun upon launch; but there was too many cheaters after a couple of months.
People liked the campaign, but the story is nothing compared to Black Ops and newer COD games."
13685,This game has the best multiplayer for a Call of Duty game.
13686,it's cool i guess.
13687,"Spec Ops is still excellent with a pal. Honestly, that's how they should have been making the campaign all this time; A series of co-op missions with different conditions instead of the on-rails monster closet stuff.

Worth the money if you get it on sale."
13688,"neger
"
13689,Good game but no player now...
13690,good
13691,Think this is the best COD of them all!
13692,I¬¥ts one of the best cod games i played and i recommend evryone that likes shooters to test this game out
13693,"Having NAT problems, end my life. Campaign is still one of the best lmao."
13694,soooooo many hackers its retarted but they still are bad XD you can see their aimbot on kill cam XD XD
13695,Its good
13696,"This is an epic sequel to the fantastic modern warfare.

I have 3 sentences to describe this game as great.
1)Epic chase scenes and all those predator drone Explosions.
2)The museum and all those other missions.
3) Pleanty of challenges for solo players.

It's an overall fun game and you should give it a shot."
13697,Very good game !
13698,Is a Game Legendary!
13699,LOVE IT!!
13700,Vey fun one of the classics the dlc is not that good but still one of my first an favorite cods the campaign and grapics are amazing and the multiplayer is very fun 9/10
13701,"someone booted me because i didnt quickscope them

10/10"
13702,its awesome my favorite game ever
13703,"The story line is amazing and ties in well with some of the other Call of Duty's. Guns are nice, and graphics are nice for it's age. Multiplayer is absoutely dead on PC, so that's definitely a no go. Very much enjoyed the story though, got me 15 or 20 hours taking my time."
13704,"Playing this game since it came out, never gets borring even when you play same maps over and over again. 

Played it a lot, and will continue, just it would be good that VAC/BAN functions better, and that we are notified if somebody is banned (and we reported it). DLC packages should be cheaper, since game is rather old."
13705,Kewl
13706,great game
13707,"Dude thought I was hacking because I noscoped him with an intervention with FMJ and steady aim. 
It was about 5 feet away and he apparently had it recorded.
10/10 community"
13708,"Good mindless fun still holds up and i still love to play it to this day
"
13709,First VAC ban
13710,"best cod game i have played, its deserve more players. the storemode its really good!"
13711,"I have this game on Xbox 360 and Steam now. So far the only thing good about this game is:

The campaign is probably the best COD campaign out there. If you want this game for the story GET THIS GAME.

But if you're going to buy it for the multiplayer, it is indeed fun to play but every now and then there WILL be a hacker who either changes the gamemode (ex. You search for a TDM game but you play S&D). The actual multiplayer without hackers is pretty fun.

So I would give the base game a 10/10

But my actual review would be a 7.5/10 becasue of the hackers on multiplayer ruinign it for everyone."
13712,"Very good story , one of the best series produced by IW ! 10/10 Vodka"
13713,I RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10
13714,"Played for a while, acquired hacked client, spawned fully automatic AC-130, got banned

10/10 would buy again! (Pls?)"
13715,Good game
13716,"Remember, No Russian"
13717,"Ramirez do everything! Also, why do the levels have to start in the middle of a battle. It's all peak and no trough."
13718,perfect game with no flying guys and perfect quickscopers
13719,awesome game
13720,"Some nice maps to play, I enjoy the visuals on MW2 more than any other COD title.

Game is quite old and this is PC we're talking about...not many left playing the game. Which makes the value and DLC worth less. 

Still can be worth picking up on steam sales if not already purchased"
13721,SO much gun action very amazed
13722,Back when Cod was good
13723,Really good graphics But no story Still really good!
13724,"The years I spent in middle school playing this game over and over and over till my fingers bled trully paid off.

Nothing can prepare you for the moment you learn that the idol you've looked up to for years has died. In Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, sometimes you play as that role model, and in the very end they die. We all die at some point. But that's the way of life.


Score: IGN 9/10 (It was okay)"
13725,This game is very much my favourite game of all time.
13726,Best COD in History period.
13727,"Awesome co-op missions.

But no steam cloud for them. I lose my progress everytime I uninstall/re-install.

False advertising."
13728,nice game i love the multiplayer

13732,the starting screen wont load so u basically spend 10 dollars to look at a black screen
13733,got Vac ban but good game!
13734,"Can't say this game is all that great anymore. The single campaign is just not gripping and lasts 5 or 6 hours at best. There are still some people playing multiplayer, but you're SOL if you want to play anything other than Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Search and Destroy. Really only pick this up if you have nostalgia from playing it on an old console."
13735,"How to Destroy in multiplayer:
1. Lightweight Pro
2. Commando Pro
3. Marathon Pro
4. Tactical Knife
5. Throwing Knife
6. Sometimes it's best to switch to your airdrop grenade it will let you run faster.

This is called Witching. Everyone will fear and curse you."

13742,"Awesome game, although I would highly recommend that anyone who wants to play on Steam via a laptop get a gaming mouse. It is difficult to shoot and switch weapons with a trackpad. I do quite enjoy the storyline and characters."
13743,This game is fucking awesome! Awesome campaign and multiplayer.

13747,"The game that killed the CoD franchise for a lot of PC gamers... Laggy, full of hackers, no servers (p2p). This is Cancer of Dullsville: Men Whining 2."
13748,:)
13749,Dead game.
13750,The best CoD game!
13751,"Classic game, best cod out there easily."
13752,"Great game, definetly lives up to its potential. The only downside to the game is the hacking community... This sadly puts the game down greatly, but even when hackers were in my game I still had fun. Overall great game still got a alright community. Definetly Get this game on g2a.com, so it is cheaper and is garenteed fun!"

13768,"Very old game but is very good. Takes place in 2016 (even though made in 2009) and about some war with the USA and Russia.

Mutiplayer, I can't say much. It's a bit dead now due to it being old."
13769,"I used to play this back in 2009-2011 on XBOX360, I will never forget those wonderfull times, especially when our friends came over and we would play in local.
Coming back to this game after years is amazing, I have played 4/5 matches, for now no hackers seen, but it'll come, thats the biggest part I am afraid of.
Anyway, the multiplayer is still being widely played and I'm loving it!

Oh yeah and the singleplayer? It's CoD Modern Warfare! 10/10!

"
13770,Would be nice if it actually launched consistently on Win 10
13771,"Good Story and good multiplayer gameplay.
-Leveling up
-Weapon Unlocks
-Weapon Attachments
-Scorestreaks
Quick tip:MeltenDew&Doritos seriosly helps you get beter."
13772,"Nice Quickscopes
Need more SkinZ and Knives"
13773,old but gold.
13774,best cod ever
13775,Probably my favorite COD game.
13776,Zajebista czƒô≈õƒá gry :)
13777,no
13778,I like it!
13779,ok
13780,Good COD Games...
13781,"The pinnacle of multiplayer for Call of Duty, in my opinion. This game striked the perfect balance between gunplay, map design, perks, unlocks and progression.

Whilst I think the most enjoyable Call of Duty single player campaign goes to CoD4, MW2 offers the most enjoyable multiplayer experience. Guns are reasonably balanced, the maps offer good variety and environments."
13782,"Probably the best cod ever!  I went back to mw2 after advanced warfare. The new cod titles have gone too far and lost what originally made cod.

However this title is amazing."
13783,"So Much Better When It Was Boots On The Ground , I Still Dream That They Will Remaster This After The Remaster Of COD 4 MW"
13784,this is the best game ever
13785,"this game is... was a legend but now you cant play because on every single server there are cheaters or fcking trickshotters lobbies and they kick you every time you are close to win.

13786,Best online multiplayer FPS I've ever played. Too bad I got VAC banned for hosting zombie survival lobbies using a little program called MW2 Liberation :-# Valve really should undo those bans... I never cheated in this game.
13787,"I absolutely love this game! I've played it on both PC and Xbox 360; I can say, without a doubt, probably thee best Modern Warfare out of the three in the series. Highly recommended for anyone on any system. Hell, someone's probably made it so you can play this on SNES, go for it!"
13788,freshest jawn i have ever popped - tyler/10
13789,"I LOVE THIS
GAME
"
13790,"Game is shit bcos no more servers
"
13791,Best CoD in my opinion. Might by worse in online multiplayer by now though. Still awesome for private games.
13792,"This game is really old and please don't buy it in 2016 it is a waste of money
"
13793,"PLEASE BUY THIS GAME!  This is definitely my favorite Call of Duty, but not enough people play it.  Recently I've seen 900 players online, but it deserves more.  Infinity Ward were at their best when they made this game:
>Crazy, yet skill based MP
>Memorable campaign characters and missions
>Diverse, fluid, well-designed MP maps
>450+ of my hours spent fighting other players
420/69--BEST CoD EVER"
13794,"I reccomend this game if you have played it before, as there are many hackers, and generally annoying people who play the game, and ruin the experience. If you haven't played before, I suggest you play a newer game, preferably Black Ops 2, due to a higher playerbase, lower likelyhood of annoying people, and no exo-suits, or supply drops. MW2 requires more skill than most of the Series just due to the physics. Once you get used to the physics, you will be fine. 

Hope this review was helpful :D


PS: If you get the game, please don't noob toob :P"
13795,"Ah the nostalgia! Great game. 

There are few hackers but not that many. Also its still really easy to get into a game which is awesome!"
13796,"School told me abstinence was the only way to avoid STDs, but none of that mattered because this game gave me AIDS anyway."
13797,Basically the best CoD made. its still pretty active and there's not that many hackers as people say there is.
13798,"I got the game yesturday for $19.99 its now $9.99
"
13799,"10/10 would get noob tubed again i never thought that i could puch through a wall but this game proved me wrong 
I would recommend this game for those with high blood pressure and get easily angry hehe xD"
13800,"- Nuke -
- Claymores -
- Noob Tube -
- UMP -
It's all part of the nostalgia that this game brings.




Best Call of Booty without a doubt

13801,COD..... do I really need to say someting else?
13802,"I love COD MW2, I played this game everyday on my 360, had tons of fun, I do recommend getting this game if you want/know how to deal with hacked lobbies/modders, Still a great game to play either way,






If only the CODs today were as good as this game, *hint* hint*, oh never mind devs don't like listening LOL"
13803,HELLO
13804,Hackers everywhere
13805,Just played the single player on Veteran to get some achievements. Played for the first time since a year after its release. The graphics still hold up. The story still holds up. The emotions are still there. Great game even if we did make fun of some of the choices the developers made.
13806,"This is a classic-hardcore first-person shooter that surprisingly still is good at this day and age... after being released this game was known to be the pain of first-person shooters for a while... Treyarch clearly showed there strengh in 2005-2013 with this game making it very note-able that they dont play around with there games and that this was one of the best first person shooters back then until black ops II came out (Modern Warfare 3 was not that well done) Treyarch nowadays have grown larger in showing there strength in making video-games such as Call of Duty, one of the best selling first-person shooter series, outta the top 3 Call of dutys, This call of duty would be in my top 3... such a classic game with much gameplay and action and this call of duty id say is better than modern warfare 3 just by how well its made and its mechanics, theres very few bugs (which i know of) and theres a lot of people still interacting with this game!
My Rating : 9/10"
13807,"This game brings back memories, you can still find a game in multiplayer even in 2016 and the campaign was so good"
13808,This game by far is one of the only games in multiplayer FPS that is worth my time and effort. I have played over 3400 hours and have loved it for the continuation that its just fun to play for all ages and skill levels.
13809,"not recommended 
prepare to spend a shitload of time modding ur router and never seeing that NAT  OPEN
i cant play with friends now 
GG"
13810,Good game
13811,Noob tuber rules the game because the multiplayer is incredibly balanced. GO F yourself iw
13812,"My favourite FPS game of all time, and hands down my favourite multipalyer COD game. MW2 was the game which kick started my journey into becoming a PC nerd; with it's once vibrant community and competitive clan wars. This game, although mostly played by console peasants, brought me into the world of PC gaming and it's culture. To this day I still can't believe how much of a quickscoper faggot I was but it was a heap of fun at the time. It is sad that even now I run across hackers when I'm on a COD nostalgie rush (not anymore) but it is good that they finally got dedicated servers. 

No denial MW2 was the game of my twelvie years."
13813,"This is back when COD was done right. No futuristic gimmicks just straight war. If you are thinking about buying it I recommend buying its vanilla version, just the base game during a sale as its pricetag is a bit much like all the other earlier Call of Duties. But know a few key things about the game. There is no controller support but if you play other FPS like CSGO then learning keyboard and mouse is a breeze but feel free to map out your bindings to make it easier as its crouch and prone keys are slightly off in my opinion. As far as multiplayer is concerned it is not completly dead. According to SteamDB its 24 hour peak will hit around 750-800 players online. But be warned there are a few hackers that cheat the game and glitch lobbies. With its relatively low player count you're also pretty much forced to play specific modes. Team Deathmatch and Free For All are accessible during most hours throughout the day and night. If you get on during its peak times though (check SteamDB.info for when this is and relate your timezone to Seattle's) you should be able to play others like Search and Destroy, Domination, ect. Also the reason why I only recommend the base version is because its DLC maps are pretty much dead."
13814,i havent really ran into anyone hacking in this game and it is better that cod advanced cancerware
13815,carl on duty: modern cellphones
13816,"Dont Buy this game, there are a ton of people that hack the shooting, whether by snap shooting or shooting thru terrain and map.  Sometimes both. It's just not fun gaming, unless you too are a child that likes being kicked in the face by a soccer pro.  Sad that this game is ruined so.  I did enjoy the few times where this was not happening, but its almost impossible to play without being shot thru a hill, behind a house in a trench, by a shot thru terrain.  :("
13817,was a descent game but now is a sack of shit that has a ton of hackers on like every server no fun sad face :(
13818,Can we get a update so we can use a controller?
13819,"The ambience and gameplay is all cool and epic, but the campaign levels are so long and boring.
But still, it's still a very playful game and there is a lot of selection of guns."
13820,"Live in India?
Don't bother getting this for multiplayer, you wont get good lobbies anymore.

Would still recommend getting it on sale for the singleplayer and special ops.

It was fun while it lasted."
13821,"only play the story, online is a joke"
13822,Still better than Infinity Warfare
13823,"Still the best COD so far and i haven't encountered any hackers yet, *hyped*."
13824,10/10

13829,"It's a Awesome Game I totaly reccomend it
"
13830,"7 years after release and still $20?? Really? Well back then it was worth the standard release price, but to this day they still rape you for as much money as possible. However, it is still a good game. I'm just a little pissed I had to pay $20 for it."
13831,"Amazing game,story.multiplayer,spec. ops and graphics :) - one of the best cods :))"
13832,Its very fun to play this game with friends and overall really good game
13833,"This game was amazing on the PS3 and it's just as awesome on PC.  I only have 2 issues with this game so far. Every so often, I'll try to start playing, hey to the menu, then it crashes. But that happens rarely. And, last but not least. NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT. Playing with a mouse and keyboard is fun. It brings a new aspect to the game. But I like to sit back and relax and play comfortably with my controller. Just because of that, I give it a 8/10. This game still kicks ass."
13834,Really fun game. i play it every day. its awesome. and i really recommend to buy this game. good work
13835,Best call of duty ever
13836,Life Ruiner
13837,"Great for a call of duty game, but compared to good games it's shit"
13838,"Game itself is great. Hackers have ruined multiplayer, though, and they just laugh and change their name and are back on. There's one in almost every match."

13853,"I first bought a PS3 for Cod4: MW and must have played that game for hundreds of hours, prestiging all the way to max, having so much fun with my friends.

So it was only fitting that the hype was huge around that time for MW2. And the game blew my mind, lived up to the hype plus some. It was the last COD I would play on my PS3, and all my friends now older, moved on. Thus, I bought it here on Steam to relive that magic again.

The first two Modern Warfare's are me favorite in terms of single and multiplayer. The campaign for these games are incredible and it's heart racing action that keeps the pace. Even MW3 had a great campaign, had to mention that.
But the multiplayer for MW2 is by far my favorite out of them all, IMO it struck the perfect balance of (Cod4 and World At War) in terms of stratigic play and all out barnburners (pun intened).

Battles online can feel tense, very quiet, and scary. Other times it's an all out war. This is IMO how COD should have always remained as the atmosphere takes the game to another level. This is helped also by the community as the playerbase is very active and not cutthroat about anything.

The campaign is worth a playthrough for any FPS fan, and the game has lots of achievements to unlock, which im a huge fan of.

The game took what MW brought to the table, and perfected it IMO. It was also better optimized, so for people with toasters, It even runs smoother than the first.

I can't recommend this game enough, it does everything right. Single/Multi/Coop.

9/10. Must play."
13854,It's not Infinite Warfare ;)
13855,"Truly fantastic game, and along with COD4, the game which really catapulted the Call of Duty franchise into the limelight.

Much like its successor Modern Warfare 3, this game has the below standout attributes:
[list]
 [*] Superb sound design: guns and explosions sound like the real deal.
 [*] Outstanding single player campaign: the pace is brilliantly varied and does not let you catch your breath.
 [*] Astonishing multiplayer: the beginning of the now universally-recognised Call of Duty formula, with prestige, class creation, perk selection, etc.
 [*] SPEC OPS - incredible set of missions best tackled with a friend. Starts off slow, but ramps up quickly.
[/list]
The multiplayer is still active for this title, but beware of the hackers out there.

Highly recommended, even just for single player and Spec Ops. Seven years after release, this game still stands the test of time."

13857,"Hello, my name is XxX_420$7uDMufF1N69_XxX and I would like to welcome you to a simpler time called 2009 when all you had to do to settle the score was load up Rust and 1 v 1. Good times. Dont forget that Stopping Power is the only perk you ever need."
13858,Amazing game play it all the time and still love it
13859,good game
13860,Nicht so lecker
13861,"After playing the game for 25h I'll try to sum it up
Pros:
-Great campaign and co-op
-Looks good for such an old game
-Amazing MP
-Likeable characters 
Cons:
-Almost none plays the MP anymore
I give this game 8.1/10"
13862,"Continuation of COD 4. It introduces new options to combat and multiplayer. Single player is too short, but it have good story and it's very intensive. Multiplayer have two cons. First HACKERS, second lack of dedicated servers. I recommend it :)"
13863,"This game is pretty good. I'm not going to talk about the campaign or Spec ops mode, because I haven't done those yet. But the multiplayer is increbly fun, even if it is a little unbalanced, such as the grenade launcher, quickscoping, and the killstreaks are very annoying. But this game is very fun still. The multiplayer has a ton of challenges and I am personaly currently... I think 69% (haha I know) of the way through all of the challenges. The challenges include headshots with weapons for camos and XP, or just using a gun or attatchment for an attatchment, or using perks for the pro-version. anyway, I give this game a 8.7/10 because it is crazy fun, it's a little unbalanced."
13864,Back from the time when CoD was still good. A classic.
13865,Still better than Infinite Warfare
13866,The paradise of Greeks based on my gameplay.
13867,"A good game,But many cheaters...."
13868,"10/10 would get modded by hackers and get 5 trojan viruses again


AVG detected 5 files within the Modern Warfare 2 files that were trojans.

will now uninstall this piece of shit.

To be honest, MW2 isn't a bad game but the VACT (get it? VACT instead of fact) that there is no more VAC makes the game unsafe for literally anyone. Hackers are abundant and virus transfers are too. Stay away until VAC comes back."

13889,"The story line is shorter than the original Modern Warfare. It was 'only' ten hours, but ten hours of non stop action. No easy missions, no time to catch your breath. Every mission is next to impossible, against overwhelming odds. I killed more bad guys, blew up more stuff and died more times than in any other game. Very intense!! 
Drawing on my vast medical expertise from two and a half semesters of pre-med, I advise, upon completion, 48 hours sleep and a bowl of Wheaties. 
10/10 
Highly Recommended!!!"
13890,THIS GAME IS #THEBOMB
13891,"naice game
"
13892,"Great game, gameplay is amazing, weapons are cool, barracks too. But I won't recommend it nowdays. First of all, hackers, second - small group of people play it but still u got full matches. All tho stupid noob-tubers are all around the map making u rage, cuz the only thing that they do (if u don't know) is throwing gernades at ya. It's not fun, ok, just stop, its not funny. That's why i won't reccomend it, however it's a great game :)"
13893,"This game is simply a masterpiece with big M. In my opinion, Call of Duty Modern Warfare  trilogy was the best that CoD could've bring us, because since CoD : Ghosts, it started to suck. Anyway, I can recommend not only this one, but whole MW trilogy to everybody.

Pros:
-amazing story
-nice graphics
-amazing missions
-lots of weapons
-Cpt. Price
-Soap on the rope

Cons:
-sometimes you can get very confused about who and where you are"
13894,"Simply out, the best part of an absolutely amazing series of FPS! Second to none!"
13895,"Wow Hacker Hosts And Now I Can't Even Find A Match In Mw2 GREAT JOB ACTIVISION!!
I got kicked for hacking some how some what and after I got kicked I couldent find a match AND I STILL FREAKIN CAN'T"
13896,90fps cap bads
13897,"I played this game with friends in school, got a great deal on the Steam download and it's everything I can remember and more.  Seamless integration with Steam.  I wish there were less cheaters, but for the most part, people are  honorable and gaming is a s fun as I remembered."
13898,"I just recently bought MW2 on Steam, and it definitely is fun to go back to the old days of Modern Warfare.
I beat the campaign (again) fairly quickly, and I did enjoy it. I also played Special Ops with a buddy, and I found that very fun as well.
The only thing I didn't like was some aspects of the multiplayer. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not going to rant about the multiplayer being full of hackers. Sometimes it is, but that is the hacker's fault, not the game's. Althought it does affect the game's multiplayer, it is still quite fun to play it (not every game you join is full of hackers). The Special Ops is probably my favourite part of the game, and I still recommend it for any CoD fan, despite the issue of multiplayer."
13899,"A great game overall.
Easy to install and run.
Good fun both singleplayer and multiplayer.
Competitive and challenging.
very satisfied i can find no fault with this game.
"
13900,This is a good game but it does have glitches. i have a vey bad glitch where everything does blue if anyone else has this problem please tell me how to fix it.
13901,I am sure that a lot of people bought this game for the multiplayer and that is OK.Buuuuuuuuuuut you have to know that there can and will be hackers.Somethimes not that anoying but somethimes they will make your blood boil.I have seen a few noclip or maybe only one .Thare are a few aim and wall but it is not that bad as people say .I will recomend this game but know that you will meet some hackers here and there but wont ruin your exerience.THIS IS IN CAPS BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORTH BUYING THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE AT LEAST ON 50% SALE .
13902,Campaign is awesome buy it for the campaign and spec ops. The multiplayer though is full of hackers every server you connect to has a hacker in it. Im not joking around. Do not buy for the multiplayer you will regret it immediately. Also dont buy the DLC its way over priced for a 6 year old game.
13903,nice game i like it
13904,mantab

13912,"this game is very fun
"
13913,One of the first Call of Duty\'s I played and still love it. Just wish they\'re anti-cheat servers didn\'t work in private matches.
13914,Omg where do I begin with this one. My steam has 3 fucking vac bans from modded lobby\'s. Never buying a cod on steam again now my profile makes me look like I hack.
13915,"Got reported a long time ago for sniping someone across the map. They called me a cheater. I said, \""if using a 60 inch 4k monitor is cheating, report me\""... they did... VAC ban... DAMNIT!!!

Still a great game. Highly recommended, except the part where nobody plays anymore."
13916,beat game ever
13917,"To everyone hating on this game right now lemme just tell you why you\'re wrong.
So far I\'ve spent 3 hours on multiplayer and I\'ve not encountered 1 hacker.
I always find a game of atleast TDM or Domination, although over game modes are quite dead.
Also why would you not get this game or get it and hate on it, the nostolgia is enough to make you enjoy it."
13918,THIS GAME IS THE CLASSIC CALL OF DUTY WE LOVE  AND THERE IS NOT MUCH HACKERS AND IT IS EASY TO PLAY WITH A MOUSE
13919,"Tons of fun playing this game, wish the Modern Warfare series still made game like this or CoD 4.

Last CoD game before the money grabbing was totally obvious."
13920,The community i just full of people who are old to this game so i reccomend that you dont buy this game after 2013 because youll just keep getting deathstreaks
13921,1v1 me rust intervention only fag no painkiller
13922,a perfect sequel
13923,"Best call of duty ever for the quickscoping community, even beats mw3 but it's rly close!"

13938,"I've always enjoyed the single player aspect of these games. This one continues where the first Call of Duty left off. The graphics still are decent to this day (2016) and the music can get you in the mood as your shooting down soldiers. The only bad thing is this series rarely, if ever ges  on sale. The price for what you get isn't worth it for single player coming in at little then five (5) hours. It's all preference. The mutlplayer component is there but filled with hackers. If you can get it on sale for 14.99 or less I say grab it. Otherwise, your not missing out on anything that has not been done in previous FPS."

RPD has unlimited ammo, RPD has a thousand-round clip, RPD shoots an' kills in one hit.

The RPD's made outta the same aluminum alloy off the NASA Spaceship, RPD's the Gold standard of modern warfare, (quotes from guns and ammo magazine August 2007)
See right here? I got a 5 Killstreak aim usin' that $hit I got an RPD right here and....goddammit. That wasn't the RPD's fault, that was my fault, I was just being a bad player right 'dere, the RPD's immaculate, the RPD's the pursuit of perfection is what it is.
You don't even gotta aim the RPD it's so good it's got heat-seeking bullets just headshot 'im. You could give a monkey this gun and he'd go around and kill everybody it's the greatest thing ever built!
I am...attracted to the RPD. The...the structure of the foregrip is...
Even those stupid motherf**kers on XBOX knows the RPD is the best thing ever made in the goddamn game!

13946,"I have loved playing this game since I had it on the Xbox 360. However, this version is plagued with hackers, with no real method of action for taking them out (besides a long and laborious external reporting process). 

I have never NOT recommended a game across any of my reviews, so this says a lot. Either Activision or Valve need to make this game's online actually accessible. Games without hackers are an extreme rarity, maybe around 5% of actual lobbies. Until then, this game gets a NO RECOMMENDO from me."
13947,"Call of Duty: MW2 - A 10 year retrospective on PC

A whole decade later, Modern Warfare 2, as a game, has stood the test of time. The campaign mode is as fun as ever, and spec ops missions are great alone or with a friend.

Unfortunately, the multiplayer experience has not. Whilst the gameplay is still top notch, the online experience has been fully destroyed by the work of a certain few, talented individuals, like Scoudem

The rise of lobby tools has resulted in the multiplayer experience being destroyed, and turned into a game of who has the better tools. You may get a nice host, running a clean game. Or, you might get a bad host abusing their tools. It's a mixed bag

Would I recommend you buy this today? Probably not... But if you're willing to host and moderate your own games, it might just be for you."

13955,"     This is going to be my first not recommended, but not because of the game because it's a great game.  I had so many good memories of playing this game on Xbox 360 a couple years back, but that was not the experience I came back to.  The servers are now all full of hackers and aimbotters and players that are invincible.  I was so hoping to jump back in when a friend bought it and play a couple games with them and really show them how much fun a Call of Duty can be before all the added stuff from Black Ops onwards.  Please do not purchase this game unless you do not plan to play multiplayer (which that is the only reason I purchased it).  Fair warning to all."

13964,"[h1]The Golden Call of Duty[/h1]

[b]One of the best Call of Duty, I fell in love with the series with this game, since it was my first Call of Duty. Single player has a really awesome story and a cooperative Special Ops mod where you have to complete really difficult objectives with your partner. Multiplayer is golden, no other words for it.[/b]"
13965,Still a funny game after more than two years.
13966,It's my favorite CoD of them all.
13967,Great game. No hackers
13968,"By far my favorite CoD game! The best and most memorable CoD campaign with an epic soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. The co-op mode, spec-ops, is a series of challenges set in places from the campaign but with a twist. You can also play spec-ops single player but it's far more fun with a friend. The multiplayer used to be amazing back in it's prime sadly now it's hard to find a full online game. Or for that sake an online game at all, and even then there's hackers everywhere! Overall this game holds up VERY well for being 7 years old, i just wish the multiplayer was as lively as it used to be. My final score for the game's current state would have to be 8.5/10."
13969,DAMN!!!!! i love this game so much!
13970,"This game is really bad, AI is either WAAAAY too easy or its got aimbot, multiplayer is filled with hackers or people who have over 1,000 hours on the game and noscope4lyfe.

Really I think call of duty is ruined, and this was the first ruined one."
13971,Very Good Game but i ran in with some hacked servers which made me instant lvl 70
13972,"The games great and I love it because it reminds me of the long nights, staying up with my friends, playing S&D, quickscoping on Rust and just being a stupidly fun game even without friends. Optimization isn't that great, it's running 480p on my laptop which is a 2015 Macbook Pro to put it into perspective. More than worth the money if you can run it 720p or better."

13974,Loved the story ‚ô•
13975,"For new and old generation of players...this game is one of the best series for ever !
Just test it out really.Im not lieing.Multi is awesome maked,no op guns and shit,maps are all great looking.
Kampagne has a very exciting story in my opinion.

But the best thing was the challenging mode where u play some maps solo or coop.
Making silent missions or missions full of action,coop kampagne is the best thing that i have saw in cod.

Juggernog missions on the ship on veteran HOLY! Nearly impossible without making plans.
This game is a real shooter that everyone should know."

13983,"fun, balanced and good graphics"
13984,"why doesnt it support controllers?? :(

13987,Usually I don't like COD game. I found them borring and i don't like the community at all. But there is one exception ... mw2. I have great memory with this game it's actually the first cod I ever saw (I was looking my friend playing). Modern Warfare 2 as a great community (Still active in 2016) and I didn't find a lots of hackers.The people in this game (on PC ) are super fun and really cool. Since im a new player in the COD franchise they gave me a lot of tips. There is a something great about mw2 ... i can't describe the feeling but it's the only COD which give me this awsome feeling. The campaign is also great and the co-op mission are simply awsome !!!! One last thing if your a new player like me be carefull the people on the online are real MLG xD Worth every penny !!!!!

14011,Campaign 10/10
14012,"boring, scripted, bad hit reg"
14013,"don't play it!
terrible community"
14014,"By the time this review is written this game is dead. What is left is an infected carcass full of wallhackers and aimbots. Don't buy this rotting peice of crap. Don't buy any more of the CoD series, its the same bullshit every time."
14015,"Best game of the Modern Warfare/Call Of Duty series imo,fun sp,co-op and mp."
14016,"See i always played Xbox 360 and Stuff like that.

But when I got this game for PC.. oh just oh.

Its honestly the best Version of it and heres why.

You get to Put custom Camos on your guns.
Private Match Mods.
Better Graphics & Its Pc so :o"
14017,"-Great game
-Long but great missions
-Replayable Campaign
-Spec Ops and Multiplayer

It's a total win!"
14018,Great game for the true veterans of the Call Of Duty Series
14019,"The Campaign is great! Good story and great characters that you will remember. Now, the multiplayer is what this game is most famous for. The multiplayer used to be great, but sadly there are very few active players nowadays, and a lot of those who are active, are eighter hackers or unfair players (campers, noobtubers etc.). The only playable gamemodes these days are team deathmatch and free for all, as far as I know. With all that being said, It's a GREAT game, but it's not what It used to be :/"
14020,gg
14021,Classic. Even the Multiplayer is still populated.
14022,"Single Player rocks. The soundtrack great. One mission even managed to make me cry on my first play. Then the game has very beautifully-designed modern levels that I would love to walk around and just glare at. (Kill enemies first, of course)

Special Ops mode adds replay value to the game if you wanna challenge yourself.

Don't play online with other players since vanilla Multiplayer is broken and unsupported. If I crave playing a FPS, I'll mod the game to have offline bots where I'd never experience lag, complaints, or waiting. This is how I'll tend to my FPS addiction."
14023,Liked the first Modern Warfare. Bought this. Got into game. Was reminded how many 12 year olds have fucked my mom. Proceeded to 360 noscope each of those bitches. Sat there eating Doritos and chugging Mountain Dew as I shittalked back to the kids. Never felt more mlg in my life. Never got a triple :c 420/69 dankest game I know ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
14024,"The same great game you played back in 2009, but now with less than a thousandth of the userbase and no dedicated servers! Have fun finding lobbies! Also, why to heck do they not have dlc multiplayer maps for free already, do they really expect anyone to spend 15 bucks on that. Recommended because the game itself still holds really well, iv'e got over 40 hours in multiplayer and its just as fun as when i first played it years ago. i just wish there were more people on it"
14025,"good story line, hard as hell on normal. thinking about similar games."
14026,cool game
14027,Best CoD multiplayer EVER
14028,.
14029,swag
14030,If you want to meet nice people from other countries (=Russia) and are curious how long it might take to develop a stage 3 brain cancer - this is the game for you!
14031,A Good Game.
14032,I love this game I have no problems running it at high settings camapign is just perfect. Online can be annoying sometimes but otherwise this is a perfect game.
14033,"This game has a very big problem: to many cheater in the Multiplayer, like in MW3. I dont want to explain the game more because everybody know everything about this game: good story, good spec ops etc. I still recommend this game, but not for original price."
14034,"A true Masterpiece! even in 2018 this game still rocks! I wish COD series make a comeback and make another superb title like MW and MW 2 ! but i guess we won't see that day again :) and maybe we do! who knows! anyway the visuals are still amazing, the gameplay is fast and top notch, the musics are astonishing and the story is awesome! aboslutely the best stroy in the whole COD series IMO :) the spec ops part in Vet deifficulty can be very challenging and is definitely much more harder than the MW3 missions! the multiplayer is still one of a kind and ofcourse it's a COD game, so if you can get along with hackers and cheater in MP , you are for a fun ride!"
14035,"Best CoD to ever release.
Waiting on MW4....."
14036,Stay Frosty...
14037,"Great fun with a decent community still. If you play Tdm you will still find games. This is the point where CoD multiplayer was at its best in my opinion. I understand that people really enjoy CoD4, but this game is easily just CoD4+More - more attachments, more weapons, more killstreaks, deathstreaks, more reasons to prestige, titles and emblems, more ways to play and be unique in your play. Campaign is one of the best in the series, but much better if you play the Modern Warfare series in order because they all connect and have the same characters. SpecOps missions are fun side things to do co-op with and have decent replayability with the varying difficulty and needing to do better at them to unlock more missions. 

Overall, great game with a great campaign and the point in the series where multiplayer was at its best. I have yet to run into any hackers in my first ten online games.

Part Two:
Right after writing the review I had a run of like, five games with hackers in them. So, there are a lot of hackers in the game, but if you just avoid where they are looking or are playing on a big map there's nothing to really worry about. Remember, true skill always is better than manufactured skill. You can still destroy them even if they see you through the corner."
14038,Awesome
14039,how can i get server list?
14040,INCOMING NUKE!
14041,"a very good campaign, and a even better multiplayer system. really good game overall, for its age and date."
14042,"Perhaps one of the best CODs.If you still haven't played it then you should try it.
however it's not as fun as it used to be,and you can start seeing the age of this game"
14043,It's pretty fun.
14044,"The storyline in singleplayer is great. Ofcourse it all begins in Moder warfare 1. But I cannot review that game here. 
Great game!"
14045,"i love this game 
there are hackers but there is a nice community"

10/10: MUST GET, even if you're not a fan of Cod this game may possibly change your mind."
14048,"It was a good game for casual play when it came out, now its broken since there is no VAC active for it. No competative multiplayer, people say that if you buy the DLCs you get locked to play with other people who have bougth them."
14049,pls help my mouse dosent move when im in call of  duty modern warfare 2 multiplayer main menu it dosent move HELP
14050,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best IF not the best call of duty game.
14051,Game is cool to play to be stoned or on crack or the smth like that. In other way its pretty boring
14052,"One of the best call of duty""s"
14053,"[ In short fun game but don't expect to not run into hackers ] May,11,16

the shooter that defined modern shooters came back with a big punch in the sequel more guns maps and better graphics.

Graphics - there okay by today's standards are really low can be run off a intel 4600 gpu on low 720p easily 6ofps but a step up from the first modern warfares clearly outdated graphics.

Gameplay - very enjoyable probably one of the most fun to play games ever made i have thousands of hours with pc and xbox 360 put together. There are lot's of guns to choose from most feel somewhat different, maps are mostly good with a few exceptions (afgan,wasteland and estate are the ones i can't stand your opinion may vary).

Hackers - well there are still a problem with the dickheads the community is as expected with a call of duty game you will run into a decent amount of modded lobbies as of the date of review, it will vary from day to day as some days i can not get one others i run into them so much i just exit the game and do something else.

Summary - great game fun graphics are alright can be played off almost any PC nowadays gameplay is great of course it's MW2, hackers can be a big annoyance to everyone so be warned. quick addition - the community is still alive and breathing there are enough players to find games in TDM, S&D, Domination and Free For All"
14054,"The campaign is fun, and is actually bearable for me, unlike the campaigns in the recent Call of Dutys.
It's cool to use some strategy to beat some co-op with a friend.
The multiplayer is what most people probably play for, and is also excellent.

This is all coming from somebody who cannot stand the new Call of Duty titles."
14055,very good awesome game
14056,Call that duty man this is warfare modern 2
14057,better than call of duty modern ward :)
14058,"Very good game, no lag, and very good uptime servers"
14059,Its okay.
14060,fun game
14061,I find this game to be really fun to play in the campaign or even the special ops! Wish you can search for a special ops partner without having a friend. But over all. The game was well put together and well done.
14062,It's ok
14063,"Used to be a pretty nice game, but not worth buying now as it does not work properly with Windows 7 or newer. Even in compatibility mode it freezes and crashes consistently in single player, so unless you enjoy playing the first few missions of the campaign until it freezes, crashes, and looses all your data and makes you start over, it's a pretty worthless game at this point."
14064,It doesn't even fucking work....
14065,"8/10 campaign spec ops is good, the S.A.S mission are fantastic, but the ones that you are playing as marines all of the missions feel the same, ""Ramirez finish this review"" my point exactly"

14071,Guys say that COD4 was the OG game but this is what brought me to multiplayer
14072,ITS PRETTY GOOD
14073,Very fun CoD for many people including myself this was the game that made people love CoD it started off the amazing franchise which Call of Duty is today
14074,A true classic
14075,This game is the best cod out there with the best multiplayer ( in my opinion ).if you like good fps games i recommend this to you (best buy it at sales)
14076,"This game may be old, but it is still very fun. The multiplayer action is classic and never boring, and the campaign has an excellent storyline that goes with all the other Modern Warfare games."
14077,"infinite warfare? no, thank you!"
14078,This game and mw1&mw3 is better than the new Call of Duty Infinite Warfare
14079,The cod with the greatest multiplayer

14085,"So I played this from 2009 to 2014 for most of the time on my Xbox 360, can confirm it's good."
14086,i recomend getting this game its op wen u play multiplayer
14087,"A disappointing sequel to one of the most solid FPS games of the late 2000s.

Released with no mod tools, dedicated servers or custom maps. To many, the hallmark event that turned the once-great PC FPS gaming into a consolized mess, something from which it has never recovered."
14088,Well worth the money! Fantastic game!!
14089,Nice
14090,"Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is an amazing game, it was only my third Call Of Duty but it remains to be my favourite to this day. It has incredible graphics, a great and in-depth story and is just oozing with heaps of content such as Spec-Ops which I had a blast playing with my Brother when I was younger. Multiplayer unfortunately does not have as large a community as it used to and you will come across quite a few hacked lobbies but multiplayer is still very fun. MW2 is near and dear to my gaming heart and I extremely recommend this game to anyone who can get their hands on it."
14091,Better than other CoD games
14092,Fuck The Noobtubers
14093,"A W E S O M E !
(Have only played singleplayer!)"
14094,One of the best Call of Duty games in the series. Very easy to pick up and play though it does take practice. I would recomend this game to anyone who wants to buy a really good game.
14095,Outstanding. Only problem is that Mac Edition crashes on startup about 95% of the time :(
14096,old but still gold!
14097,"Ok ok, I'll say it. This game still rocks even on the XBOX-360. Best Call of Duty Modern Warfare 10/10.

-Good facts:
 -Interesting story. (Play CoD4 then play this)
 -Very good graphics.
 -Nice weapon costumization.
 -Very nice multiplayer modes. (I recommand Domination)
 -Good title/emblem system. (First CoD game with this kind of system)

-Bad facts:
 -Some of the maps are just... sh*t.
 -No team balance.
 
Note: A lot of you are saying there are too many hackers. Nope. I saw just 1 hacker and he got VAC banned.
          Worth it!"
14098,multiplayer = Noob tubed.
14099,"Love this game, it's so unbalanced, that it's not boring. Gr8 game 8/8"
14100,No More Question. Its Perfect for FPS fans
14101,"I like this game but I can't recommand it on PC.
This is the first ever COD console port. it took away leaning and mods. But no controller support and local splitscreen.


If you just want to play mp, go for it. Servers browser is still there."
14102,"spoiler] After This We Are Going To COD MW 3	[/spoiler] :D
Best Story Game In My Life Just Like COD MW :D

14114,"Spent countless hours on this game back when it first came out (on the 360), had many great memories on this game with friends and my brothers. Miss the good old cod days."
14115,"[h1]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2[/h1]

[b]COD:MW2[/b]
Let me first start off by saying that i was once a massive COD fanboy, i played for a team and played non stop everynight. That all stopped when i started playing CS:GO as it does i played alot of CS:GO (Check my hours) i played it so much that i started to get bored of it again. So a few long storys short i took some time off (Playing in a team ETC) its comming up to a month and i have played so many other games that i have had on my Steam Account from back when i first created it, i now own MW2,MW3 and ghosts on pc and everycod that has ever been made on PS3/4 but none of them games add up to this one.

In COD:MW2 There is a bit of everything for everyone what i mean by this is that there is a single player (Highly Recomend), Online and SPEC OPS, all of these combine make a amazing game, Three features i would like to point out about this game are listed bellow aswell as what i think can be improved on (This is covering all three options in game)

[list]
[*]The Story (One to beat)
[*]The Flow (Smooth no stuttering)
[*]The Characters (You become attached)
[/list]

But with advantages come disadvantages
[list]
[*]Graphics (When it was released the graphics were great but its out of date now)
[*]Online (Online needs alot of work and has done for a while e.g Hackers)

So to summerise otherwise i would be here for days writing every bit i loved about this game, i would highly recomend this game to anyone who likes FPS Shooters and/or has played call of duty before, as the story is really touching if you listen and take in everything they say aswell as it covers everything from Running and gunning to stealth and sniping, somthing that other games lack.

Man i want to be here talking about this game for ages, buy this game and you will understand why i love it so much thanks for reading and thanks for making such a great game!

(-I WILL PROBALLY UPDATE THIS REVIEW TO ADD MORE EACH DAY SO CHECK BACK!-)"
14116,:)
14117,"Replaying the the Modern Warfare franchise and bracing myself for the COD 4 remake. Really hope this eventually gets a remake, but its still a classic. Hoping they have a sale soon so I can pickup MW3."
14118,Best Call Of Duty Game ever.
14119,"One of the best Call of Duty ever produced!
Intense and awesome campaign, with a nice coop to play with friends and finally, a spetacular multiplayer, you cant get boring like the newer CODs out there, you just keep playing and playing!
The price is a little high for a game from 2009, but still worth getting it on a sale!"
14120,gaming
14121,I was always a big call of duty fan when they first came out... MW2 was a great game. Believe it or not... since i downloaded this game i thought their would be alot of hackers and this game was ruined but i only ran into a hacker once. this game is still clean and great to enjoy. I would tell everyone to play it.
14122,hej barn
14123,"I love the Call of Duty franchise ever since the first one came out when i was a little kid the MW seires is one of the best i've seen, I hope to see your next game of COD that is coming out this year will be good, GREAT GAME i rate this game 100%."
14124,"Ah, a classic FPS. Love it or hate it, you woln't get anywhere with a gaming discussion without bringing this game up.

Most of you kiddies under the age of 12 might not have got this game because of mere lack of intrest or your parents are liberal. If the answer is liberal and you want the game, you are probably adopted, kill it before it lays eggs. If you just dont like it, What is wrong with your taste of video games? If its both...well shit.

For the singleplayer portion, you mostly play as Srg. Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson. He does have a fiery death on the mission ""Loose ends"" where you are tracking down Makarov.

For the multiplayer portion, its darn fun. I mostly use a LMG and a launcher with lock-on for those planes. But I recommend an LMG for the UAVs, though. UAVs are weaker and can be destroyed with one shot with a rocket, but, save the rockets for the ass-hat copper/plane.

Overall, I would rate this installment 8.5 UAVs out of 10, putting this game on my recommended list."
14125,Old games are the best
14126,This is my first Call of duty game on PC. I was very suprised at the intence and interesting story with great graphics and gameplay. Multiplayer is about hacker free and there are still active players.    10/10
14127,"es ist wohl das beste cod das es bisher gibt
ich m√∂chte zuerst auf die story eingehen sie tiefsinnig mit viel action und einigen emotionalen momenten die musik ist grandios und gibt einem in jeder sequenz den drang und die lust dazu weiterzuspielen es gibt unz√§hlige missionen in denen man in klassischer cod manier seite an seite mit seinen mitstreitern k√§mpft 
man versetzt sich in die geschichte und f√ºhlt sich wie mittendrin 
story muss man spielen!

jetzt online man hat eine relativ gro√üe bandbreite von verschiedenen waffen(acr for the win)
ein kleines minus ist,dass man auf eine waffe h√∂chstens 2 aufs√§tze packen kann,doch das wird mit coolen und wundersch√∂nen maps.einer gelungenen balance und vielen heraudforderungen wettgemacht

14129,Does not have conroller compatibilty
14130,"I do recommend this game, MW2 is my favourite cod. I have played Campaign multiple times, and i have to say it has a great story, probably the best out of every cod series. Coop is great for playing with your friend, same with multiplayer, lots of players running around with tubes tho.  The only problem is lack of players, i remember the good old times, when everyone were playing this game... I'll say it again, i highly recommend this game, it's only 20 euros, i'll call it worth. Thanks for reading."
14131,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

14143,"This game is a good game to play for a story board, multiplayer, solo game (no partners).  The story board is not too complex.  When you work on the story board there are levels that can not be completed or that are difficult to complete-nothing is wrong with a little resilience.  The multiplayer does match making with friends and different people.   I do not know about one man against an entire army when you play solo games.  There should be AI soldiers that assist in solo mode."
14144,"Though theres not a lot of people still playing, its still an incredible game that I know is amazing and that it'll have that spot in my heart for all the fun times I had with it. I hope Activision or whoever publishes the COD franchise will remarket this game and keep it going till the end of times. Until then GAME FOREVVERERR. Sup is OUT!!"
14145,Nice Game <3
14146,Fuck yeah!
14147,ITS SHIT
14148,Only Team-Deathmatch mode works... !! Why other are not working? The game tries to connect but doesn't join any game!
14149,"love it! great story, great multiplayer, but may need a to fix up the anti-cheat a bit.."
14150,"awesome COD story
11/10"
14151,"A Hacker called in 3 airstrikes at once, used rapid fire rocket launcher and nuked everyone.
Typed ""gg"" at the end of match.

10/10 best community"
14152,"Very nice game, no crashes or lag (unless the host has bad internet), however it is hard for new players to level-up because most players in the game are VERY high level. I advise you play the story first before you dive into the multiplayer."
14153,"READ:I Played This Game For a PRETTY long Time and i have to say its a great game i do recommend you buy it  but before you  shit on this comment sayng:OMG  BO3 IS THE BEST,OMG WTF  THIS GAME IS SO OLD
i am just giving my personal opinion this is a great game and   this is one of the best cod games out there persoanly i think the list goes like this:1.cod waw 2.cod mw2 3.cod bo2:  JUST because a game is new that doesent mean its awesome  these old game are SO FUN AND SO GOOD but again not much people play them because they are  to busy playng fucking Dog SIMULATOR 2015 (cod ghosts)    lets take cod aw it is a good game HAHA JUST JOKING it couldeven bin a good game but they fucked up when they added  SUPPLY DROPS and EXO JUMPS and all that bullshit  cod bo3 umm... they  also fucked up only at the supply drops   and ghosts 2 dont even have to mention so i like the old games just because its old doesent mean its bad 
10/10
I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS GAME
I AM SORRY IF MY ENGLISH IS NOT THAT GREAT  :D"
14154,"Weri nice, veri swag i leik it!"
14155,Really fun game!
14156,"MW2 has a great campaign and a dying but still great multiplayer. The special ops mode I think is what has saved this game for me. There are rarely any hackers in MW2 like there are in the older cod games. I have seen more hackers in Ghosts than MW2. When I describe this game to people I tell them: ""The unbalanced parts of this game make the game more balanced than some of the newer COD games."""
14157,lol
14158,Its a good game tbh many people say ''MW2 is a bad game because ump and nuke 'n stuff its too crazy'' but i think its the best cod game of all the cod games. and the singleplayer is awesome.
14159,"For a 7 year old game it really holds up. I played it on console when it first came out and its pretty much as I remember it. Personally one of my favorite storylines in the COD franchise. Multiplayer is how you would expect for a 7 yo game. If you want to get into it your going to be raped....and raped....and raped. But grinding is possible. at 5 to 6 kills per game I got to level 21 within a few hours (spread out over a week due to work) 
TL:DR fun story for CoD, multi is grind heavy"
14160,"best cod ever
"
14161,i rate the intervention
14162,Friendly word of advice play full trilogy to fully enjoy it.
14163,"Can be fun at sometimes. It would be better if it wasnt full of hackers. Game is wicked dead, only a few game types to play on. TDM is mostly hackers, Free4All is okay, but there isnt alot of players, Search and Destroy is a bunch of little kids quickscoping (who cry if you just shoot all of them) This game is not even close to $20 worthy. This game is years old. CoD4: MW is still at $20 along side this game same with CoD: WaW, CoD: MW3 sits at $40 still, CoD: BO is at $40, CoD: BO2 is at $60 still, alongside that is CoD: BO3 and CoD: Ghosts at $60, Why is Black Ops 2 still so high when the franchise made 3 more games. Advance Warfare is also $60. Steam doesn't know when to lower prices. 
Call of Duty 1 - 2003 = $20 <----- 13 Years Ago
Call of Duty: Finest Hour - 2004 (Ad on) = $20 <---- 12 Years ago

14164,"Memories from 2009 :')

[h1]Game on my friends![/h1]"
14165,"Amazing game, probably the best Call of Duty."
14166,"I got aids and Smoked 3 meths after dis juan, made me turn lesbian 10/10"
14167,"Just finished it on Veteran difficulty...Ive got to replace my mouse :))
Still best COD"
14168,It's fun to come on with some cheats and do some modded lobby shannanigans :D
14169,Hacker Warfare 2
14170,"the coop mode is really decent
the story mode isnt as good as the first part but still ok,
but online, oh boy...
i saw plenty of s*** back then in my ps3 times, but this..
camper, uav hacker, camper, camper and f****ing camper everywhere.
i used to be a legit 10th prestige player with a kd ratio of 2.5, but here im struggling to keep 1"
14171,"Really good game but some of the multiplayer is hacked
8/10"
14172,gooooooood gammmmmmme
14173,I CANT PLAY ONLINE i have windows 10 and a beast pc yet still just says not responding and black screen what the hell is going on
14174,vhy german langue pls english language :(
14175,that game is very fun :)
14176,I CANT PLAY ONLINE!
14177,"Ok this was a good game until it got hacked.I played 1 match and already recieved prestiege this is not cool fix this or else not funn
"
14178,Good
14179,"ya know i dont see anything wrong w/ mw2 peopl eare saying its a FUCKOING HOURIBLE GAME its great the only thing bad is if u want to lvl up like normal u have to leave a lobby that has a prestige system. ALSO hackers arnt like mw1 or cod waw hackers(f****** godmode f****) these guys either prestige u or make you join fun lobbies that wont give u viruses and the lobbies are like zombies, quik scoopes and rtd fun stuff!"
14180,"Remember, no Russian."
14181,Campain was good everything else is trash.
14182,"This game is easily one of the best (if not the best) COD games imo.
The only con in MW2 is the people that keep spamming noobtubes with one man army but this game is definetly recommendable to anyone who loves first person shooters."
14183,gotem
14184,"Favorite CoD ever!
Even Better On PC!
10/10 IGN"
14185,this is a really good game i would recommend getting this game it is fun with friends
14186,Morro!!
14187,"Destroyed my academic records and social life since 2009
11/10 never ever tried this game"
14188,"Old but very fun to play when bored
"
14189,"This is the best call of duty, I really love this game :)"
14190,"Great game and an awesome story. Graphics are still good even in 2016. BUT DONT BUY FULL PRICE WAIT FOR A SALE! This is a review for the campaign only and if your looking to 100% everything with all the intel items, finshing the game on veteran difficulty, and getting all 69 stars in Spec Ops took me about 45 hours. (some of that is replaying missions for fun)




Edit: I have about 180+ in multiplayer and it is fun. Not a dead game but not a very big population. Often there is a hacker or 2 but i feel it does not ruin it since most of the hacked lobbies are 18 man lobbies."
14191,"R.I.P this truly was the greatest call of duty game. Before it all went to shit, before people were flying around the map with exo suits.
this was one of the last GOOD call of duty games
I highly recomend this game if it is on sale!
10/10"
14192,Like it
14193,This is an epic game even though i dont have it yet on pc i have it on PS3 its so goooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14194,Best Mountain Dew and doritos simulator 9/11 IGN
14195,too many hackers and noob tubes in this game and all the legit players can do nothing about it because valve is too fucking stupid to fix the game to ban hackers
14196,Hello darkness my old friend
14197,Yeah its pretty good i guess. Explosive spam though...
14198,"This has got to be one of the best CoD game out there. All of the new CoD games are in the future and has all that technology. Those game just doesnt feel like war, it feels like people with deadly nerf guns and jetpacks. This game takes place in the present and no stupid sliding rockets and floating cars. There is a HUGE bonus in the campaign. Not to spoil anything but you can drive snowmobiles, use ice-picks, use a turret on a car, and much more I didnt even reach yet in the campaign. The multiplayer is awesome but there isnt anybody search and destroy and other gamemodes but there is still alot of people on this game. If you reading this review before you buy the game and you are thinking about it, buy this game. Rating, 420/10 Turtles."
14199,"awsome game totally recomand
"
14200,"I meet nice  people, join Expiire clan and learn how to noscope and quickscope... Major problem are noobtubes, but game is still fun

14203,"During ""No Russian,"" I played Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" in the backround, while murdering innocent civilians and laughing my ass off. Something is 120% wrong with me.

10/10, would be a confirmed psychopath again."
14204,i cant play it because of direct X pls help me out so i can play some MW2.
14205,Released in 2009 and still a GREAT game with a lot of players!
14206,gg
14207,Best cod ever multiplayer is the best good graphics this game used to keep me up till 4 in the morning xD
14208,awsome game
14209,Great game!
14210,This game is good but the only problem is that is has a lot of bugs. One is that your mouse will just stop and won't move even if you quit and relog.
14211,Classic Call of Duty Fun! Shoot some shit and unlock fun new guns. Much better than the newer CODs IMO.
14212,Best game ever! I got VAC Banned and can still play online. 10/10 would cheat again.
14213,"I remember getting this game in 2010 on the xbox 360.
I remember all the fun I had, so I had to buy it on here. 

Love the campaign, best campaign I've played in a longtime"
14214,hey who is up to be friend on steam and do the private match glitch (easy level 70)
14215,gg izi nubs simulator
14216,wow  the mp  in this cod is  awsome not just runing around and kill like a newb
14217,Still better than CS:GO and I say this after that I have 800+ hours in CS:GO ;)
14218,"Best COD ever, multiplayer is not dead :D!"
14219,ACR/10
14220,"not the worst game ever. however


pros:
-alot of guns
-incredible campagn
-cool perks and streaks
-best campagn story in all of call of duty

cons:
-alot of hackers on multiplayer
-game is easy to hack (i did it in under an hour then removed them to prove my point)
-maps for this game are stupid. with a many feeling clunky and terribly layed out.
-wierd frame fluctiations 
-everyone has bad mic quality even if they have a good mic
-cant talk in lobby
-no vote kick
-no map voting"
14221,"SPOILERS!!!!!!!






















All i have to say is.........Rest in Piece Roach and Ghost you were good men."
14222,best call of duty made and no FUTURE BULLSHIT!
14223,Last best call of duty game out there... R.I.P
14224,One of the most revolutionary FPS' of all time and they decided not to have dedicated servers. Aside from that the campaign is fun and full of great moments.
14225,i like it super mutch realy fun
14226,"MW2 is still fun, but I really, really, really miss lean.

Dedicated servers? Don't worry about that if you know where to look. The vanilla product will NOT have it though."
14227,The only COD that didnt bore me instantly. Enjoyed COOP mode a lot.
14228,"I absolutely love this game, yes, it's mindless, requires no skill and is totally unrealistic. 
but I don't care cause I can jump on, bash a game out in 10 minutes and feel like MLG.


it's a shame the game is getting filled with more and more hackers and the game types are dying because of the host2host system it uses. it's going to completely die one day."
14229,It's really nice and you won't get borred easily by it!
14230,Love this game I've been playing COD for a while now and I LOVE this game! <3
14231,i dont even own it and i got VAC banned lol gg 10/10
14232,ONE OF THE BEST AND AMAZING GAME TO PLAY..... THE MULTIPLAYER IS DAMN FUN I RECOMMEND THIS GAME VERRRRRRRRY MUCH.....
14233,One of the greatest Call of Duty of all time.
14234,It's so fucking deep
14235,Its 2016 and I am playing this on a macbook pro with an integrated gpu. There are still plenty of TDM Games. It is so much fun and is a challenge
14236,tr√®s bon fps !
14237,"if you like the old good cods then this is for you
"
14238,this is a good game but leave cod to the consoles
14239,Its ok I guess
14240,The game is very fun the titles and emblems in multiplayer are hilarious and spec ops and campain is fun too
14241,Literal best cod game ever
14242,Yes.
14243,"Best CoD I' ve ever played so far. Honestly the game is amazing but sometimes the kicking trickshotters and the hackers are just to annoying. And if your really interested in the game I hope you have loads of patience because there are lots of tubing fucktards with one man army and shotguns, g18's, painkillers and much more. Overall ill give the game a 9/10."
14244,Must have
14245,50/10 one of my favorite and one of the best Call of Dutys in the series
14246,"cool game, but too many hackers and only very little people play this now :("
14247,"One of the best Call Of Duties to date... MW2 is one of the most hyped and played Call Of Duty games to date for its great campaign and amazing multiplayer with an addition of its CO-OP mode called Special Ops

Pros:
+Amazing campaign with unpredicted turn of events
+Multiplayer always keep you in the action
+Good variety of weapons with barely any underpowered weapons
+Special Ops is fun with your buddies
+Killstreaks always make the multiplayer interesting
+Great multiplayer maps
+Great voice acting
+Burger Town ;)

Cons:
-The campaign is very short which is like 5-6 hours on normal. Veteran takea about at most 9 hours

My final verdict for MW2 is a 9.5/10

Thanks for reading this review!

WARNING: For windows 10 users the game will not startup after the first startup when you first play. The second startup and beyond will screw you over with a black screen and fixing it is a pain in the neck since the most common fix doesn't work, I experienced this problem but I know all of this info on the game from playing it back in the day on 360."
14248,iz gud.
14249,this gam is 2 dope..
14250,"Wow....Just wow. Where do I even begin? Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 is one of those special games for me. The first time I played it I was 10, that was 7 years ago. I played the hell outta this game back on my dad's 360, but over the years as I evolved into a PC gamer it fell by the wayside. I saw it on sale recently and thought I should get the game that gave me so much joy all those years ago.....And let me tell you, it's just gotten better with age. The way this game has gracefully aged suprised and thrilled me. And the plot and mechanics still hold up to this day. In my opinion, MW,MW2 and MW3, when played as a proper trilogy, have one of the absolute BEST stories in gaming. This is a golden example of what a good FPS is. BEFORE everyone went all jetpacks and wallrunning. Don't get me wrong, those games have there place, but this one is special. If you want to play a great story rich FPS, look no further.If you want to play an addictive multiplayer shooter, look no further. If you want to go back and relive the golden days of COD, look no further. This game stands as a shining exable of classic game design, and is simply a must play, regardless of what you think about the Call of Duty series.

PROS:  Great Campaign                                    CONS:    A Short Campaign.... Maybe?......I can't really think of many :p
             
            Fun Multiplayer

            Runs well on PC

            Spec Ops

            Fast Paced

            Decent Graphics for a 2009 game





             So in short, GET THIS GAME. 
              ~Quinley"
14251,This is The Real CoD :D

For me, BY FAR, it's the best CoD EVER!"
14260,A great game that while not as good as its predissor is still amazing. A must have and a worthy successor. Plus its better then the new call of duty games.
14261,the longest call of duty story ever in the history of call of duty's
14262,"bringning back some old memories, this game is still amazing, ive been playing multi and i can say it really isnt that hard to find a match. i also havent ran into any hackers {yet}. totally worth my 10. also come check out SMPL GameGuys on youtube please if you would like to see some great content."

14269,Fantastic game !!! Legendary !! The ‚ÄúEven Better Than I Expected‚Äù Award !!
14270,.
14271,Still the best there is after all these years with its only rival being its sequel.
14272,Best game ever

14279,Amazing!
14280,Thid game is fucking awesome!!! Singleplayer and Multiplayer nothing miss!!!
14281,"REMEMBER NO RUSSIAN 

The best game scene of all time"
14282,"Absolute classic, timeless and will always play."
14283,TANGO SUCKA!
14284,"COD MW2:
I cant give an opinion on spec ops because i have not yet played it.

PROS:
- The story is very easy to undertsand (unlike bo3).
- The graphics are really good considering the time it came out on.
- This game can run on a hamster wheel.
- Its boots on the ground so multiplayer is not full of un-skillful little kids.
- No Micro Transactions
- Some gamemodes on multiplayer still have active players.

CONS:
- Multiplayer is a literal ghost town.. which is sad.

CONCLUSION:
If you have joined COD since COD:GHOSTS I really really recommend this to you.
If you have gotten sick of the new games and you've missed this game. get it."
14285,Still playable
14286,"I was sniped by a guy named fucksnipers. I asked him to explain this hypocrisy. So he said ''He who snipes snipers, runs the risk of becoming a sniper himself. If you gaze into the scope, the scope gazes back''

Did not expect this level of philosophy in a video game."
14287,"This one is probably better than MW2R at least for lighting, plus remastered's AIs are incredibly stupider than the original LOL."
14288,yes
14289,Awesome game good work
14290,"The best Call of Duty multiplayer experience out there. This was when the franchise was in its prime. CoD 4, WaW, MW2 and BO1 are the best Call of Duty games out there."

14293,Game plays very well on Windows 10 with all settings set to max.
14294,"Just played MW2 on 360 again, I hate this now, versus the consoles it's laggy, vacant and has shitty controls and the graphics look like clay."
14295,Best COD game EVER. Like EVEEEEER.
14296,Best FPS ever
14297,This is the reason why i got steam...
14298,best game ever
14299,"Wow, it's tough to believe it has been nearly seven years since this game came out. It marks a really cool time in my life, when I had finally moved on to go to university after community college and I was meeting all sorts of new people. A few people I had recently met were picking it up, so I figured, why not?

I know the CoD series gets a lot of flak for being casual, having an over-the-top campaign, and being a rehash every year, but I think of it as a series that pumps out constant quality on a yearly basis for people who want this kind of thing. CoD is a great time, because the multiplayer has a high skill ceiling while managing to be addicting in the right ways. The campaign is stupid, but it keeps you going and it is just pure action porn in a good way. The Special Operation side missions are frustrating but keep you coming back.

I think this was a pretty fun game, and I can't believe it was seven years ago that I picked this up for full price from some record store in Santa Cruz."
14300,"I still remember playing with my friends on Highrise and trying to do trickshots. hahaha, good times! It's a must-have for a Call of Duty fan."
14301,good gameeeee
14302,"Worth every cent, buy this and not your Ghosts, AW or BO3 bullshit.

THIS is the real deal, not that crap.

but watch out, this game sucked me in for 764 hours in Multiplayer."

Corrected his speling of my name
Laughed together

14304,"For years I have seen this as the game that set call of duty on a bad path, turning it on a mindless shooter, disrespecting history and war.
But now I have grew up, and I see what this game really is:
Pure, Unfiltered, American Propaganda"
14305,GOOD GAME
14306,"The very last great Call of Duty game. 

Hello, I originally began playing the original WW-2 set CoD on PC back when I was a boy on my Uncle's computer. I was fascinated with how fun and ""realistic"" it was. I was immediately hooked on the games. I played Cod 2 and 3 religiously, and I will never ever forget the day I heard about Modern Warfare. Finally. FINALLY a game of 21st century setting. I was ecstatic. I played through the campaign and had endless hours of multiplayer logged on my Xbox 360. After doing everything I thought possible in that game, my dream came true, and another was released. To some, there's almost no difference between CoD4MW, and MW2. To others, like myself, there's an indescribable gap between the two games, where MW2 is on a whole new and higher level. To me, no other shooter game has had the balance MW2 had. It has set a standard for me that I look to in other FPS games, often times I find no equal, save the original Black Ops game. This balance is what made the game for me. I've never been a person to be ""naturally"" good at video games. MW2 was one where I excelled. Because I had a fighting chance. I found my niche and I stuck with it. I maxed the game on my Xbox 360, and eventually grew into PC gaming, leaving consoles behind. I only have a few minutes played on this game so far, but I had to actually back out and type this up even after the first few matches. It has been such a trip for me going through the menus and the lobby system. If you're considering buying this game for nostalgia, do it. Do it and don't take any flak that comes to you. Do it, and relive your early teens of shitty girlfriends, mountain dew, and yelling at your parents. If you've never played MW2 and are looking to see the hype, I'm afraid it's gone forever. There's a few people around on the servers, but the HYPE, the actual maxed pace heartbeat of a game that took the world by storm is gone forever and ever. Then again, maybe that's the beautiful thing. Maybe that's what has this game frozen in time as one of the all time greatest. 

Forever and ever, Modern Warfare 2. 

NuovaVita"
14307,This game is so good and still has a whole bunch of players and now hackers def get this gives me good ptsd
14308,Probably the cleanest and most enjoyable COD to date.
14309,It's a good game. Playing the game you are immediately immersed in the atmosphere of war. Once the game has a good story line. The game is worth its price. I recommend
14310,It's okay.
14311,"Story mode. Coop. Special Ops. All pretty fun.

MW2 Multiplayer is my favorite FPS multiplayer of all time. So many hours. So much death. So much fun. Nothing was too OP. Search and Destroy. Hardcore. So many amazing memories."
14312,"1st mission: Shoot and kill everyone and chase down a evil guy
2nd mission: Be hitman and shoot and kill everyone
3rd mission: Shoot and kill everyone 
4th mission: Shoot and run but kill everyone
5th mission: Shoot and kill Russians
6th mission: Shoot and kill everyone den launch a nuke
Last mission: Shoot and kill everyone who is your friend and kill the villian that appears like the villian from 007 from Skyfall
Where's the evil guy from the first mission?
10/10 would shoot and kill everybody again"
14313,This game dosn't get old for its age. It plays like a modern FPS and is really fun. I would recommend this to anyone who loves shooters.
14314,i love it other than the fact that i get vac banned for doing nothing wrong... but whatever
14315,"Are u considering buying this game ?
Are u wondering if its worth the money ?

I've played Multiplayer for 2764 hours as of now, and i consider it one of the best Call of Duty games out there even if its from 2009, is it worth buying it ? Yes, if you can stand the low ammount of Modders & people using Kick tools in Search and Destroy and Free For all, its not a big ammount of them, but they do exist.

Havent played story mode that much, i have completed it 2 or 3 times and i did enjoy it, but the big thing about this game is the multiplayer. you wont get bored of the multiplayer , ever. :)

if you're wondering if its enough players to find games? oh yes there is a lot of people still playing this game, but some gamemodes is not played as much as others. Most active game modes is probably Team Deathmatch, Free For All, Domination, Demolition & Search And Destory.

+16 Maps with Good Variation. (not alot of people playing the DLC maps)
+Well Balanced Perks.
+Decently Balanced Weapons.
+Community is decent. it was better when the game just released

A 6-7 year old game still doing good.

im raiting this game 10/10 clearly i have enjoyed all my 2764 hours i've played! :)

Is MW2 the best CoD game so far ? Yes by far. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the best. Is it worth buying ? Hell yes! No question about it! Buy Buy Buy Buy now ! :)"
14316,"I don't know what to say just
I LOVE IT
the game isn't perfect but still it hasa very good multiplayer very good campaign and spec ops (I hope infinity ward bring it back in cod 2016) it is still played in 2016 I don't know why people say hat the multiplayer is ""crazy"" or ""unbalanced"" and some douchebags discovered hat I am playing they said that I made the wrong choice cause it's old and black ops 3 is the best cod or some shit but I judged the game by playing it(and in was $9 when I bought it so....) anyway it's a very good game"

14330,"very very goood campaign but over priced here.

90 percent times multiplayer has hacker.yup not the good kind.
they just give u lvl 70 prestige and laugh it up

at max now u get 700 ppl on multiplayer so finding times are bad and only team deathmatch works.but still game has aged well
"
14331,CHRIST SHALL RI
14332,"Definitely one of the best cod's out there if you don't mind the occasional noobtuber and wallhacker.

My rating for this game is a solid 9/10. Go out and buy it, you won't regret it!

ps. If you have a monitor above 90hz you won't be able to experience the glorious smooth gameplay because the multiplayer is locked to 91hz, unless you mess around with the console (wouldn't recommend it due to the chance of receiving a nasty vac ban!) This is my only negative thing about this game, which isn't a great deal..

14335,"This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing."

I think this is the best  of CALL OF DUTY that was ever made ... for me BIG LIKE ..."
14338,Nice game and hard multiplayer
14339,This game has one of the best Call of Duty stories I've ever played ;D
14340,"I bought this game because years ago I loved it. It's a great shooter, a real classic of the genre. But, there is a really big problem. The PC version has very few people online and the system for joining games is a joke. Joining my second lobby, the game refused to load the game and it contiuned to do this. As a result I am refunding it.

WARNING TO DLC BUYERS: There are very few games with DLC online and it's a waste having it."
14341,PLS Fix ONLINE i cant play online?
14342,This is the best call of duty that has ever been made i don't undertsand why call of duty had to become futuristic its bullshit
14343,"still my fav COD game, on the Xbox-360 i played easily 600+ hours on this game... OLD IS BETTER!"
14344,"This is by far the best Call of Duty Game i have ever played.

The story mixed with the guns and shooting and 
everything else makes a very good shooting game. This is 
it.
The graphics are clean and smooth for the year 2009, The story
is just the most amazing story ive seen. The Modern Warfare
franchise is the best.

I Highly recommend this game, its worth it, every penny.
(9 years later... still awesome.)"
14345,"I really enjoyed this game so far! Great missions
Defenitely worth the 6$ I paid for it :D"
14346,"If you ever wanted to shoot up an airport, this is the game for you!"
14347,More innovative than the new Call of Duty¬Æ
14348,"Multiplayer is very entertaining. Story mode is one of my favorites, and Spec Ops is decent. Provides a very nostalgic feeling if you had this game back in the day."
14349,"Remember, no Multiplayer in the remaster"
14350,B E S T C O D E V E R M A D E !
14351,What the fuck. Got banned for just using wallhack. Big let down Valve. I dont appreciate you releasing unfinished games with these fucking bugs. Fix your fucking game god damn. -1 rep went first with money and never got a finished game. Goddamn Valve fix your shit!
14352,This game is the best first person shooter i know i absoulutly love it this should be the first cod you buy
14353,Is good stuff!
14354,thnx for the vac
14355,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CALL OF DUTY'S THERE ARE

14362,"Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 is probably the greatest CoD I've played, and one of the best games I play. I am still a noob, always will be, but there is little more satisfying then blasting away with an AK-47 after a long day. Great price, too."
14363,FUCKING AMAZINGGGGG
14364,k
14365,Great game. Would totally recommend this even as a 2016 game. It just has the quality of a 2016 game. Yeah the graphics and textures are iffy in some places but it had to be legendary back in its time.
14366,fun game when you can match with people other than that it's a dead game online. I bought it for the campaign but if you want it for the online .... good luck cause you will find 20 people max online and thats on a good day.
14367,Should i get the DLC for this? i have the  game but idk if i should get the DLC or not.
14368,"mediocre game, I would only spend the money if it was on sale."
14369,"Still playing this game in 2016, One of the best Call of Dutys out. If you're a begginner to RPG Games, I highly reccomend buying this game and playing it."
14370,"Only cod that actually has no russians and is fun to play!




EDIT : Russians has invaded call of duty modern warfare 2"

10/10 ‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏´‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö mw2"
14374,Really loved this game when i played it for the first time back in 2010. and i'm so excited for MW2 Remastered this coming 30th April. funny they decided to release it now when they alr finished with the remasterd of this game 2 years back.
14375,It's a very good game! I relly recommend this game!
14376,"Its my only game on Steam so far, I LOVE IT"
14377,"Best multiplayer game, I love it"
14378,"Cod mw2-i play that
cod 4-i love that
cod ghosts-i hate that"
14379,I know i dont have a lot of played hours but i played campaign 2 times and i can say that this game has best story what i ever seen... :)
14380,"Very fun, the best in the series to date as it isn't as fast paced due mainly to the fact it doesn't have any of the advenced movement systems that are seen in the newer COD'S, such as thruster packs.

Don't worry about people not playing online anymore as you will find a server on most modes almost instantly"
14381,"Taught me how to throw a knife and quickscope. And ruined my life. 
-10/10

(P.S. the sound of hitmarker in this game is nice too)"
14382,still the best Call of Duty
14383,This game is still as good back when it first came out. There is a good amount of people who still play the game and I have only encountered a hacker once out of the 3 years i've played.
14384,"Great nostalgia trip. As an older, more experienced gamer, I can better appreciate the smaller things they added to multiplayer. The maps are well designed, the guns have sense to their balance, and the tactical fedelity of the gameplay is mindblowing. Barring the Danger Close perk, which makes me question the sanity of the game developers at points, Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer is a fun, fast, and explosive experience."
14385,"Whats to fucking hate?

Great classic old game better then these ""futuristic MLG BUUST JEMP 360 EXO SUIT FUCK YOUR MUM"" Pieces of shit"
14386,if you like memes thats ok man
14387,mad game
14388,"I can't believe I have not written a review for this game. It's a little late but here it goes. Easily the best Call of Duty game by far. The story is amazingly well written and brought to action in a fun and exciting way. The music, let me just say Hans Zimmer is the fricken man, blows me away. Anyone able to write music that makes my heart pound and fill me with a sense of power is a god in my book. The characters are also amazing, giving you a sense of comradery as the story line develops. And the plot twists, did not see that coming! This game has it all, so if you want to get your monies worth and love first person shooters this is the game to play.

Sadly MW3 was a bit of a let down, but that shouldn't stop you from experiencing this epic tale. Rangers lead the way!"
14389,"HACKERS!!!!!

but, its still the best COD ever"
14390,its bad on pc get a console to play it
14391,Best COD In the series. 10/10
14392,"FUCKING AWESOME GAME !! guns were balanced, maps were pretty good, kill streak rewards were simple yet exciting/rewarding. missing the days of MW...."
14393,"it is a really fun game personally it is my favorite call of duty, but the one thing is not alot of peploe play it. So u are limited to playing certin gamemodes but i deffenillty recommed this game."
14394,"10/10, best Cod
"
14395,"so unbalaced and so much fun
"
14396,"amazing game good job
"
14397,made me love the COD serioes!
14398,"Very good game , when flash bang explosives back to you you get blinded and slowed
wtf is this"
14399,i like it very much if you could add controller ussage it would be great thank you!!!!!
14400,Trashboat.  But everyone already knows that.
14401,"Ah. The last good Call of Duty I really enjoyed. Almost brings a tear to my eye... Going as far to say that Modern Warfare 2 is my favorite shooter from 2009. The multiplayer is good (in the exception of hackers), but the one thing about this game that interests me the most is it's story, resuming after the first Modern Warfare with a satisfying ending, which many games today struggle to achieve. A new innovative mode: Spec Ops. Spec Ops pits you with the option of a friend against AI foes in missions specially designed for this mode. From objective base to elimination and even stealth missions, that's right, stealth missions. The famous Veteran difficulty returns and veteran is perfect in Modern Warfare 2; its not too easy, not too hard. 

I guess $20 is an acceptable price for Modern Warfare 2, but I would wait until the game goes on sale. Until then, I will see you guys on the next review!     Let's form up!     ~Strealth 1548"
14402,"Run and Gun,whats not to like."
14403,"This game would easily fall into my top ten of all time. I think this is THE BEST COD ever made, and probably will be made. single player is so damn good. But unfortuantly,the multiplayer is ruined with hackers. The fact that steam claims this game is Valve Anti-Cheat enabled makes me sad, there is no enforcement of this wahtsoever. Its really too bad becuase this was one of the best games to play with friends, but until the multiplayer is cleaned up i would not say its worth $21.99"
14404,"Still as good as I remember it, if not better 420/69"
14405,AMAZING game. Especially on pc. Better graphics on pc also.
14406,"Best game ever, got vac ban and i can still paly"
14407,"One of my favourite games , too bad its full of cheaters"
14408,"Really good game, recommend it! :D"
14409,"Is very GG, love it and brings back memories of enjoyment."
14410,AKA- Camping Simulator
14411,best cod game.
14412,its...
14413,It's so boring
14414,Fun stuff.
14415,love seeing people name faze
14416,"Mountain Climbing sim 2069

best game 10/10 Would post on Dailymotion again"
14417,"P.S: Review is only for the campaign, didn't try the multiplayer

It's ok, mixes enough elements on the levels without boring me, game wasn't able to keep me from playing it in one seating or at least more than 2 hours at a time. Average story, at least somewhat memorable characters. It's still a very linear shooter which is not bad since there's going to be rarely any bugs pr complications compared to open world. 

Definitely cool graphics for 2009. but the story length is only 5 hours (played at hardened difficulty, veteran is just BS, you need to know where the enemy pops out to be able to shoot them first)"
14418,I was modded and I need to know how to reset my stats I hate this...
14419,not so real game :3
14420,"A lot of hackers now, but it was good back in the day. One of the better CoDs imo"
14421,"I believe there is only one thing to be said about this game:
Great.
There, I've said it.
Sure, it has a few flaws, but it's still the very best shooter I've ever tried. 
I have more hours in this game than any other game, and I still play it today.
Take the time to play this game, and find yourself entertained.

Also, a reboot of this game would have been great, so please, if you're reading this, sign the online petition to make that happen.

Best regards

Even."
14422,Just renamed with '2009'   :'(

14425,"[h1][i]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2[/i][/h1]

This game has a good storyline, good gameplay, it was the first Call of Duty game to introduce Co-operative mode.
It's very fun to play it with friends. AI are well organized, stealth system is working well in the missions, but in rest it has a big hole into the multiplayer, less people are playing it. Give it a try, it's a good game with a good reputation."

Back in the day I left the MP because of cheaters, but as of now it's still active and cheaters have moved on to other games so is fun to play it again. There are always between 1000 and 3000 players online so you will definitely find somebody to play with."

14440,"I remember playing this game a long time ago when it was the best COD you could play. Everything was just amazing. There were no noobtubers, hackers, little kids and more. I used to play an old alternate online version called AlterIwnet and i remeber i it was the best thing i ever played. Nostalgia got me and I decided to buy a Steam version and I can tell you that I'm really dissapointed. AlterIwnet players were very fair and honest and there were no hackers and noobtubers. So i remember joining a server and got noobtubed in the first 5 seconds and I thought it was a joke but later on I realised i was wrong. Maybe 40% of poeple who play this game are fair and normal. Before you start shitting on me and saying this is an old game I get that but I can tell you that this game is ruined. Long story short this is a game whose community has gone to shit."

14460,"This is hands down the best Call of Duty I've ever played. I have played pretty much every Call of Duty that's ever existed, from the first one to Black Ops 3, and none of them have ever even come near the enjoyment I've had with this game. My dad was actually the one who got this game in the first place. He played it for the campaign (which was short but very epic and fun), but never really ever touched multiplayer as he knew he wouldn't be very good at it (he also didn't like tubers, campers, and knifers). I played the campaign and multiplayer a lot after he got mostly done with it until our family computer crashed and broke down while I was playing it. I didn't touch the game for a few years until about a month ago; and holy shit did I reveal a holy grail. I'm now completely addicted to this game. I don't know what it is that makes this game so damn fun, but whatever it is, the developers sure did it right. This game exceeds above and beyond what other shooters can't do, and I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone who wants a old game that's still insanely fun. 

Also, since this game is relatively old, there has been trouble finding games. As far as I've seen, people either play TDM, FFA, or Domination."
14461,i only play muiltiplayer and i have a great time with it and its a great community
14462,Best game ever
14463,"Get it, but only for I W 4 x. Vanilla MW2 is uber garbo. Don't @ me."
14464,2 MLG 4 U
14465,Not as on the PS3 end XBOX 360 but still great!
14466,"Well let me think of something....oh yeah
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best CoD Games ever made! (better than Infinite Warfare)
Oh and my top 5 CoD games:
1.CoD MW3
2.CoD MW2
3.CoD 2
4.CoD Ghosts
5.CoD 4 MW

Ok,let's start teh review:
First and foremost is the single-player experience. As the anchor of the Call of Duty world, campaign mode is back, and it's intense. You'll instantly get a sense of just how far the improved engine has come when you're thrown into the bustling streets of Rio de Janeiro's favela, the ice-capped mountains of Kazakhstan, the dusty roads of Afghanistan, and other unexpected locales. On the visual side of things, Modern Warfare 2 is an obvious step up over Call of Duty 4 and World at War, with a stronger emphasis on complex terrain in the environments, weather effects, destructible objects, and the overall sense of action and chaos that comes with so many visual improvements. This is only complemented further by the increased attention to sound design, with the effects of many returning weapons being re-recorded,even more in-level chatter amongst your allies, and a truly captivating score by Hans Zimmer which builds based on specific in-game moments. Modern Warfare 2 feels like an action movie through and through, with the production values alone dating Infinity Ward's last game, Call of Duty 4, quite a bit. 

FUCKING INTEL BLYAT CLIFFHANGER LAST INTEL BLYAT VERY HARD BLYAT

14469,best call of duty game ever!!
14470,MW2 is a game with like 7 hours of content. Singleplayer is okay I guess
14471,Kill Shepard.
14472,"[b] The recent disabling of VAC actually broke a lot of hacks for MW2, gg now cheaters arn't as rampent! [/b] 

[b] The Campaign [/b]

By far MW2 has one of the best campaigns of any Call of Duty. Despite this marking the transition from CoD being a series of war games, to a bat-shit Michael Bay style game series, the campaign still manages to be enjoyable (if you can ignore that it's supposed to be a sequel to CoD 4).

Presentation wise the game has solid voice acting, graphics that have aged very well (lots of details in the enviornment, smooth animations, solid character models, etc.), and a superb soundtrack from Han Zimmer.

The story has many twists and turns, along with lots of characters that are well remembered by most CoD players.

Each level in the campaign is diffrent and there is never a dull moment, whether it's sneaking into an enemy base during a blizzard storm or escaping a favela, the campaign will leave you hooked for it's 5 - 8 hours (depending on what difficulty you play it on).

[b] Spec Ops [/b]

This is a good mode to test your skills alone or with a friend, it has nice challenges that use campaign levels along with some unique maps just for this mode.

[b] Multiplayer [/b]

It's very addictive, fast paced, and has lots of nice weapons, loadouts, and killstreaks to toy around with. It's maps are very good and most are classics. Hackers may show up once every 1 /50th of the time, but overall it doesn't ruin the game (at least for me). I'd also recommend looking at this guide for information on how to change your FOV to a reasonable level for PC (don't worry, you won't get banned as Infinity Ward has gone on record for saying it's ok to use an FOV changer https://community.callofduty.com/message/205674719 ): https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=154105687 because it's a straight console port, with some resolution, video, and control options, they never added a way to people to change their FOV (using console) to levels seen in past CoD titles.

I'd recommend this on a sale, all 3 parts of the game are worth experiencing."

To all you CoD haters, this is not the exo-nonsense, but actualy some boots-on-the-ground gameplay!

14492,I love MW2 its a classic but my only problem is my laptop runs at a woping 1.40 GHZ so I got aroung 5 or 10 fps total when playing
14493,By far the most well thought out and most compelling Call Of Duty game ever made. I have been playing this game sense the realase date way back when first on Xbox360 the on my Mac and still cant ever forget how great this game is.

14496,"I think this game has a great story, but in multiplayer the mini map sucks, that is my only complant"
14497,"Even though my computer exceeds the minimum requirements to run this game, multiplayer still doesnt seem to start up as quick as the campaign or special ops."
14498,"Well it's a classic..Just get it and spend some time, ofc get it at a major discount :)

[UPDATE] NO TDM since 13th Februari and no intended fix from both IW and Activision makes this recommendation null and void."
14499,"Price / hour: 0,11‚Ç¨

It was alright, since I played it before MW3 came out. I recommend MW3 more for multiplayer

But for today, I recommend it in this way:

Singleplayer price / hour: 0,30‚Ç¨

The singleplayer and coop were awesome. If you have a friend, that price / hour thing is pretty neat.

Conclusion: Multiplayer people; don't buy it.
Singleplayer lovers: Yup, buy it."
14500,"Although frustrating at times like all FPS games, MW2 is actually a pretty decent game. The campaign is pretty good and the co-op missions with friends are a ton of fun. The gameplay is good and the maps are a lot better than those of new CoD games. Unfortunately there aren't many players left online."

14506,"[b]Rank:[/b] 6.5/10
[b]Recommendation(s):[/b] Play Call of Duty 4. Be able to deal with very high game pace.
[b]Major Theme:[/b] High game pace, high action title.
[b]Bought at Price:[/b] $0.00 (Gift at full price of $60.99)

Yes, even a long time ago, I used to play Call of Duty. Say What!?! Yes, even as a strong advocate of the PC Gaming ecosystem, I too enjoyed a Call of Duty title. It probably wasn‚Äôt the best title to get, but at the time it was reasonable. At least on the PC, this was the last average title to be cranked out.

Obviously Call of Duty isn‚Äôt realistic (I certainly hope you understand that), nor was it really intended to be (I hope not). The appeal too many is the quick, non-stop action and the ability to use Kill Streaks along with perks to change up gameplay. ‚ÄúFair‚Äù isn‚Äôt a term I would use, as each Call of Duty title has its own overpowered or unbalanced class and weapon setup. If you are looking for actual competitive play, Counter Strike is where you should go.

The graphics are ok, the FOV is like taping your face to the screen, and the singleplayer plot is kind of dry and confusing. For sure however, this title stands on its own ‚Äì just like Call of Duty 4 on PC.

I might go back and play this game again, but I don‚Äôt think it would be for a long period of time. If you are into the Call of Duty series, Black Ops 2/3 will have a much upgraded experience for PC players. For ‚ÄúCOD purists‚Äù, this title will be the one."
14507,good game
14508,good game but does anybody know how to use  a controller on this game ?
14509,I love this game 10/10
14510,Played this game for 300 hours or so ok well it turns out to be the best multiplayer out there im just astonished on how great this game is i love the ffa. this must be the best call of duty ever even better then bo3 and yes i just said that and i give this game a 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10

14520,Good game!
14521,"i will recommmend this game because of how fun this is, i know their bo3 and bo2 and others, but this is the best of the old cod's...so get this and you'll see what i mean... like the graphics are beast...(if your computer is beast ;) ) but other then that you will like this game, so buy it!!!!!!!!"
14522,10/10 would get hacked again
14523,"This was my first Call of Duty game ever. Sadly I don't play this game as much anymore but I will tell you this game is still worth buying, especially if it's on a sale. May not be a lot compared to the old days, but this game still has a lot of players. 

There are unfortunetely hackers in this game, and I'm not so sure if VAC works on this game now, but there aren't a lot. 

Aside from hackers, everything in this game is perfect. The campaign, spec ops, and definetely multiplayer is awesome. 

If your looking for a fun Call of Duty game to play, this would be great. The price of this game isn't bad, but I suggest getting the game on sale or through a site that sells a key for cheaper than the steam price. 
10/10 long live MW2."
14524,call of duty dies after this game
14525,"Oh, good old MW2. Nothing really changed in a long time (even campers and tubers are still here). Would give it 11/10 for sure."

14530,"This has been my favorite CoD for a very long time and i am always happy about the memories it brings back when i get on the game from time to time, though i do not get in it often, it is a much appriciated game."
14531,Great campaign beyond solid multiplayer best of all cods if you ask me.
14532,"It's okay. The first will always be the best.  Sorry, Dave."
14533,"Overall, one of the best games i have ever played. When i played back in 2010-2011 on my PS3, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer.Now, 2016, i re-bough this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.
About the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server. 
There is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.
And theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.
Is MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.
But wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. ""Yes"" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but ""no"" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay."
14534,"Great story, great multiplayer guns but hacked lobbies are a problem"
14535,Best CoD ever. This game got so much details and is still one ov the best online games out there! Should work on every PC!
14536,"Single Player - Short, but good.

Multiplayer - Best multiplayer on a Call of Duty game, destroyed by noob tubes and campers. Awesome maps though!

Spec Ops Mode (Coop) - It's not a zombie mode (obviously), but there's great fun to be had in this small missions.

Best Call of Duty to date, in my opinion.

(played on console, to be replayed on PC :) )"
14537,multiplayer dosnt work
14538,One of the best games i ever played
14539,"R.I.P Ghost, Allen and Roach, True heroes"

Multiplayer? Eh."
14547,"Game vac banned me after I hacked to max level. 

thumbs down from me."
14548,goood
14549,This game was really good I LOOOOOOOVED IT!!!! xD :D
14550,"Campaign and Special Ops are good. One of the best singleplayer aspects that could have been created.

Ever since IW patched this game (like 6 years after release...) and removed Liberation, the Multiplayer has become an absolute sh*tfest filled with nothing but 12 year olds running around with Grenade Launcher classes and One Man Army.

And you still get the irrelevant random who thinks he's the best ""OpTic Slayer reg. gunning God"" in every game mode you search, tryharding using whatever class and brain cells he has left to get a tactical nuke. Disgusting...
People online produce more salt when you kill them off a nuke than all the salt packets from every fast food chain in the world put together.

Overall, if you enjoy the campaign and challenging yourself in Spec. Ops to beat your score, this game is for you. Without Liberation, enjoy nothing but grenade launcher One Man Army spawn traps in Multiplayer."
14551,Game was released in 2009 but even in 2016 is still worth buying. I totally recommend it.
14552,Cool
14553,"good game BUT the minus are unbearable to ignore

-no vote system (kick,change map,ect)
-full of hackers,noob tubers,kids with mental problems
-no dedicated servers
-no bots
-expensive dlc's

ther are ""mods"" out ther in the net that allows you to use vote system,dedicated servers,bots to play agenst
BUT the developers are like ""dont give a f""
they hunt down every modder that tryis to fix the damn game and make it better.
ok i understand you dont like pirate version of the game,but this is the only way to fix this mesh,and is the only way becose you the develpers just dont give a f about the game!

how dificult it would be to just add this option to the game? if simple modders can do it,you can do it.
BUT NOOO you just dont care about your game..full with hackers! you got your money so you dont care about us.

yea let them buy our new cod's, forget about mw2.NO NO NO!!! i wont buy nothing until you fix this mesh.

i mean EA Games its hated for many things we all know that.but its seams that they are not the only ones that need to be hated.for me you are just the same,you dont give a f for the players that suported you when you needed the money.

and i will say it again,HOW HARD IS TO IMPLEMENT THIS OPTIONS IN YOUR DAMN GAME?????


(sorry for my english)"
14554,"Good game, brings back Nostalgia of playing the campaign and muiltiplayer."
14555,"good game but lot of hackers.
"
14556,Best COD so far!
14557,"The game itself is great.  However, they should warn people about the Steam interference.  Their mandatory intrusion into your game really puts a damper on it.  I loaded the game, and as of now, I have to wait four (4) hours while Steam downloads their unnecessary items on my computer.  
Steam really ruins the game by not allowing you to play the game that you bought.  
Steam is the only reason I don't buy more games from Activision."
14558,Call of duty: Hacker warfare XDDDD
14559,this game might be old but holy shit is it fun. When was the last time you had fun playing a COD campaign?? THIS CAMPAIGN IS FUCKING AWESOME 9.99/10
14560,"One of the greatest multiplayer experiences I've had the pleasure of being witness to. Hands down the greatest game of the series. Still played, still current. Joined a deathmatch game, got two AC130s from 2 consecutive care packages. Won the game. The fact that people are still hooked is more than enough evidence that this thing is a masterpiece of its own.

14582,"Strap on, its Call of Duty Roller Coaster!"
14583,"This is a very
 good game

14584,"The first Call of Duty I played, I still, today, remember the first time I laid my eyes on this. Went to my friends house, saw him playing and there was choppers, harriers, crazy weapons and everything. Bought this on PC ASAP, and later on xbox 360, then PS3, then Xbox again. 


One of the best Call of Duty trough out time. I recommend all Call of Duty from Call of Duty 4 to Black Ops 2 (Yes Black Ops 2 was fun, when you grabbed alot of friends and played it, and since I'm a CoD entusiast I liked it.) 

On the other hand, Advanced Warfare and Black Ops 3 is a real dissapointment, if you've played Call of Duty since 2009. 

Call of Duty Ghosts was fun for a while, but the campaign is glorious, love it!

Bad part about playing on PC are the cheaters.

"
14585,"Great addition to the CoD series, storyline waaay too short though."
14586,"With all the games I have ever played (and I played alot...) Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has got to be THE best multiplayer FPS experience I have ever played. This game literally is why I failed half my subjects in years 11-12. With all the game modes, customizable classes, perks, kill streaks, maps and Co-op, this game had made a huge impact on what FPS multiplayer standards should be like in 2009. This game was 10/10 but don't bother buying it now since its like 7 years old, just wanted to give my 2 cents on what this game was."
14587,Nice game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
14588,One of the best online shooters to date which is sadly filled with hackers nowadays.
14589,great. best game cod has ever made

14595,"Call me biased, this is my favorite CoD ever. Aside from the ousted controller support this game still kicks ass when people are actually on... make sure you port forward!"
14596,91 FPS cap and no ability to unlock via console like Black Ops.  This game should be running at 200 FPS no problem.  Why bother putting a 120hz graphics setting if you're going to cap at 91?
14597,"Great game dispite hackers, Easy to run on low end pc's running intel graphics ^^"
14598,10/10 - They don't make Call Of Dutys like this anymore...

14603,this is best game :D
14604,My favorite game <3
14605,Game is good  like rockets lauchers & strikes...
14606,"Well, I think most people should know this game by now since its not the ""newest one"" lol. But if you are reading through all reviews to see if this game is still enjoyable in 2016 all I can say is YES. The Story mode is intense and plays much like a movie with some cool cinematics and fun gameplay.  If you decide to jump into multiplayer warning from my side, there might be alot of servers with hackers, but I also had playsessions over 9hours without a single hacker met, soo yeah it kinda depends :P 

Overall i recommend mw2, the graphics still hold up pretty well (same old engine ofc) and the multiplayer is also fun , especially if you play with some friends (5 at best)."
14607,I bought the game because Repz is down
14608,"[h1]Disclaimer: the review is mostly for historical reasons. Multiplayer is essentially dead.[/h1]

I feel that Modern Warfare 2 as one of the best multiplayer experiences. Despite being peer to peer, removing modding, restricting the player count to 12-18 players, the game had what competition didn't, and that's insane amount of content.

I would go as far as to say that the game had 4 times as much content than any game of that time: Medal of Honor 2010, Bad Company 2, and even the older CODs like COD4 and World at War.

This game an insane amount of replayability to the game. The are 70 levels in the game, and there is a certain unlock at pretty much every level. At the same time it's well placed. It takes 2,500,000 XP to reach the max level. In terms of kills, it would require to do 25,000 kills before reaching it. That takes a while, believe me. It's actually the biggest XP ceiling in the whole franchise.

Back in 2009, it was the bomb. It was the first call of duty to require steam, and everyone on steam was playing this game.

It had its problems - mostly overpowered weapons, generally grenade launchers. That said, unlike COD games of today, it did have great maps and proper spawns. The spawns were basically static predefined areas. Spawn kills were a possibility, but were no happening very often. The maps were generally pretty big in size too, especially for a COD game.

Map design, spawns, weapon balance, content - all that makes up a good multiplayer game. The game wasn't perfect, but it was close. These days, a lot of multiplayer games followed the same suite, but let's not take it for granted. Some respect is ought to be given.

As for the campaign, i never understood the hate it sometimes received. I felt that it was very intriguing. Hans Zimmer soundtrack also adds to the plot. I have replayed it countless amount of times as part of my modern warfare marathon. Honesty, it's the third game, where the story got stale. 

There is also special ops, a coop mode that allows a max of 2 players. Honesty, it was amongst my first coop experiences, along with left 4 dead, so i have a lot of fond memories with it, so i might be a bit biased. But, in all honesty, it's hard to mess up coop in a shooter i think. I think it is just generally more fun to shoot things together.

[h1]Finally, lets pay some tribute to the developers of this game.[/h1]

If you still don't know, the team that was working on this game, Infinity Ward, had a big argument with the publisher and about 46 IW employees left the company. That was shortly like 6 months after MW2's release. All those people formed a new company named Respawn Entertainment, which is responsible for Titanfall.

The writer for the game - Jesse Stern, was also replaced with somebody else. So honestly, MW3 isn't even a real COD game anymore."
14609,It is a good game with a good story and good multiplayer ;)
14610,"Listen, let me tell you this straight. I love this game, I love it. It's a classic call of duty, and if you like 4 you really should try it out. Most negative reviewers of this game are only being harsh on this product because of hackers, but read this. Their are not a large amount of hackers, most of the time it's balanced. In fact out of the 20+ games I've played only 2 have had hackers or a hacker in them. I would give this game a chance. Oh, and another thing I like about it. It still let's you play it at your native resolution.10/10"
14611,"***NOTE*** THIS REVIEW IS A REVIEW OF MW2 MULTIPLAYER AND NOT SINGLEPLAYER

One of the Best FPS ever made, in my opinion this game is better then BO3 even though some people might disagree with me, this game had what other CoD games didin't have wich was a Game Ending NUKE ( 25 kills without dying ) , althought many people complained of this killstreak because it ended the game I actually liked it.This game has many many more pros but it alsow has its cons :

Pros:

1-Graphics are pretty good for an old game like this ( wil mostly run on all computers, even the shittier ones, like mine )
2-Alot of fun multiplayer mods even thought now mostly people play TDM , Domination, S&D and Free-For-All
3-The killstreaks ( my personnal favorites where the Harrier Strike and the AC130 )
4-The weapons ( my favorite primary weapons where the SCAR-H and the ACR and scondary where the SPAS-12m althought i hated the F2000, it was horrible in my opinion
5-The amazing maps ( it was full of awsome maps like Terminal, Highrise and Afghan the only ones I didin't like where Rundown, Karachi and Wasteland

Cons:

1-Hackers ( you will obviously find some but not often)
2-Campers and Noobtubers 
3-Aimbotters ( I guess we can put them in hackers )
4-The fact that FAVELA got removed (this was one of my top 5 maps of all CoD games )
5-One Man Arm perk ( its an awsome perk but noobtubers ruin it.... )
6-the time it takes to start a match ( it always take about 5-10 minutes for me to start up a match and get everyone ready)

In Conclusion, Mw2 Multiplayer is an awsome game and you should definativly give it a try ( it is worth for like 22 $ so its not tha much and if you don't like you can get refunded ), even though their are hackers they dont really ruin the game and they mostly get VAC-banned, the multiplayer is still full of players playing it even after 7 years."
14612,As my first COD game on a computer I disliked it.  For fans of the series I guess it's pretty good though.
14613,Best game ever made.
14614,"There are a few games in the Modern Warfare branch of the COD game series that I have not played but at this point MW2 remains my absolute favorite COD game.

I am not generally a COD kinda gamer. I fell in love with COD2 back in the day and I struggled to find anything close. MW2 did it for me. I recommend this game!"

The spawns are kinda unbalanced but can be good for you if your the one that spawns behind the enemy. I really wish they continued the MW series and hopefully they continue on with it this year. There is still a surprisingly large population and it takes only 2-5 seconds to find a lobby (Ive only tried TDM). Anyone looking for a fun shooter and/or is looking for a game that can run on your pc, this game's for you. Please be aware that the game has hacked lobbies, but luckily not as bad as WAW or COD 4."

14634,"Game has been left to rot by IW, other than the known RCE exploits (look it up, multiplayer is not safe.) VAC never worked for years so many people had to take matters into their own hands to get any legit lobbies until 4X came around, then they randomly decided to make VAC work again and fuck over half their playerbase with bullshit bans. Thanks for the permanent red mark on my profile because you couldn't fix your game."

14640,"Some nights I still dream about the M93 Raffica burst pistol but then I wake up just to realize COD series has changed to the worse and it breaks my heart. This game had it all. It still probably do (well except players).

I even kinda miss all the time we spent in lobbies trying to get into a game, but I mean that was only for about a year or so maybe."
14641,"Awesome, awesome to the max"
14642,"People still play 4 Game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Hardcore Team Deathmatch and Domination (sometimes you can find Search & Destroy but not usually). Most of the time you won't have a problem with TDM but any other game mode you will be waiting several minutes for Steam to setup a lobby and when you get one it will likely be laggy. I got this game on sale for 10 bucks a couple weeks ago and it was worth it... But I would definitely not recommend paying 20 bucks for this game unless you only like Team Deathmatch. 

Oh, and it is full of hackers. If you can deal with people shooting you through walls when they shouldn't even know you're there then this one's for you! I would actually guess that AT LEAST 7/10 people are actually cheating in this game. Since the anti-cheat engine is disabled they don't even try to hide it anymore. Never seen such blatantly obvious hacks in a game before. I rate this game ***Fart noise*** out of 10.

UPDATE!
Reverted to Windows 7, had to reinstall the game. Won't even run in Windows 7. I am not converting back to Windows 10 just to play MW2. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY and don't buy this junk."
14643,I like it.
14644,BEST call OF DUTY ever!
14645,"This game had every chance to become the best Modern Warfare of all three, but it failed and that‚Äôs because of the multiplayer part.

While the single player is probably the most touching part of the whole storyline and the additional missions are really enjoyable, it‚Äôs the online play that people look up to the most when it comes to Call of Duty series.

And, unfortunately, it looks like Infinity Ward, after the big success of MW1, wanted so hard for this game to be even better, that they overdid it. This resulted in the multiplayer to be completely unbalanced, with every possible type of explosive / deadly weaponry right in your face.

Grenade launchers, chopper gunners, RPGs, 'long-distance' knife? You name it. These are all available at your disposal in the amounts which will bring you a headache after thirty minutes of gameplay. By that time you‚Äôll be already seven or eight matches in, because the deadly inventory often means a match can last only five minutes or so. Add no dedicated servers and you may also suddenly end up waiting for actual game longer than playing it.

I will always have a weak spot for all three Modern Warfare titles, not just the first one. Many years after its release MW2 is still playable and has about 1800 players every night. However, it requires a huge amount of patience and devotion for it to be truly enjoyable. 6/10"
14646,HANDS DOWN BEST COD EVER!!!!!!
14647,People still playing?!! Should i download the game again?
14648,"This is one of the best CoDs EVER :D

10/10."
14649,America.
14650,"I would high recommend this game.....If it weren't a ghost town.

I'll get this out of the way quick: If you wish to buy this game for the online play, I would strongly recommend you reconsider.

This was not my first call of duty game, however this one is by far my favorite.
The story was amazing in my opinion, however it was short which is a draw back, despite how short it was every second of it was amazing.

The game play worked really well and all of the kill streak rewards are very good, from the simple U.A.V to getting a nuke off if you can.

All the weapons are unique and feel different in some way each having some what balanced pros and cons.
The game was also more forgiving to new players with the death streaks leading to making an un-enjoyable part of the game less un-enjoyable.

All the maps I found very good, each one allowed different play styles to excel if done correctly from running and knifing to camping, my personal favorite is High rise.

All and all this game was by far my best Call of Duty experience before it started going down hill. I will always look back to this C.O.D game being the best in the series. 

As a side note, the graphics are really good for the time, the weapon arsenal is also exceptionally good. The Story was short but amazing. Online maps were all very good, never dreaded a map or game. Lastly the music or BGM was astonishing good, composed by legendary Hans Zimmer it blew me away and added to the theme of the game/war and enhanced the experience greatly.

I would give this game an 8/10."
14651,This game
14652,"Classics always amuse me, I like this game a lot"
14653,"the multiplayer is awsome , still alot of people playing online and i havent run into any hackers yet so thats awsome , im running on windows 10 and everything is up and running no problems"
14654,"Note: I have played over 400 hours of multiplayer and 100 hours of campaign/spec ops by the time I write this review. So don't say I didn't play it wise guy, here we go. 

MW2 is my second favorite COD after Black Ops 1. It is, as you can tell by the title, set in the modern era and thus appeals to a larger audience than Black Ops (set in the cold war era). This games campaign is the second installment of the modern warfare series and it is amazing. Awesome story, great voice acting and characters, fun missions, and a simple plot that makes sense (*cough, Black Ops, *cough). As a bonus you have Spec Ops, which is like Campaign without a story, only missions. They are really fun and it's a good challenge to complete them on Veteran difficulty, play it with your friend and you will have a good time. 

The multiplayer is where you will be spending most of your time, you can play with friends or online against real players (mostly experienced ones). You will at first be overwhelmed by a bunch of BS that gets annoying the more you play (Noob Tube, Commando, Quickscoping, etc...). This is the only downside I see in this game, the nonsense Perks and Weapons. This game can be described as a huge mess with irritating things as such as the grenade launcher (in combination with certain perks), powerful killstreaks, some overpowered weapons and other BS such as being able to replenish claymores and noob tube ammo with scavenger (another perk that you can choose). You know a game is real good when you still have fun playing even after all those inconveniences. Maybe that's what makes it fun? You decide.I also need to mention that there are many hackers and you will run into one at least every second game, shame.

Without these things, MW2 would have the best multiplayer out of all COD's. If you have never played a Call of Duty game before or even a shooter then I would not recommend this game. Maybe for the singleplayer, but not for the multiplayer, it's broken and hacked to pieces. If you want a good started COD for both aspects, go for Black Ops (check my review). Overall 8.5/10, better than the last 3 recent CODs. Have a good one, peace."

14656,I have had this game for a while and only played just over 2 hours on it. After an upgrade to Windows 10 the game no longer functions; immmediately ceasing response upon launching. It is now unplayable and due to the time I've had it and the play time it will not be refunded. THANKS GABEN

Tired of the crap games put out by Treyarch, Sledgehammer? Want to go back to the good old ""flesh and bullet"" days? Modern Warfare 2 is your game. For an 8 year old game, the graphics are beautiful, weapons, for the most part, are well balanced (but if you wanna be good, use an ACR)

The only bad thing about this game is all the hackers in it, and removed VAC feature. But, more than not, hackers suck and are no big deal. Buy it!"

14693,"This review is mostly based on the single player mode only.

PROS
- Awesome graphics for the year of 2009 (They still look impressive compared to some triple A games released in 2015.)
- Fluid and easy to learn keyboard controls.
- The gunplay in this game is one of the best and refreshing in the Call of Duty Franchise.
- The story is one of the best in recent years (There are actually great surprises and plot twists in this game.)
- Most of the characters are pretty memorable and unforgettable. (Especially Soap, General Shepherd, and Captain Price)
- There are multiple characters that you play as. (Each one shows the different perspectives on the war between the U.S and Russia)
- The story actually continues on well from its previous game (Modern Warfare, COD 4).
- Every mission/level in this game seemed very creative with its gameplay other than standard COD shooting for the entire campaign. (Ex: You get to escape from a collapsing prison in one section, you drive and shoot in a  motor raft in another section, and you actually play alongside the main villain in an entire mission.
- YOU GET TO DRIVE SNOWMOBILES 
- The Spec Ops are pretty fun and can be addictive for people who like time trials and challenges.

CONS
- There is no controller support to this game
-The online multiplayer is completely broken with cheaters so DON'T buy the game if you expect decent online PVP.
- This game is a little too expensive just so you can just play single player. ($20 for a COD game in 2009, but surprisingly its one of the cheapest ones on steam right now.)
- There are some characters that are really disinteresting and boring (Your squad while defending the U.S from Russians is forgettable. I can't remember a single name from the Rangers missions except General Shepherd.).
- The campaign is kind of short (But it's a great story and campaign so it has lots of replay value.).

Final Thoughts- This is one of the best COD games to date with its continued on amazing story from COD 4 that leaves you actually remembering characters and plot elements that you don't see often in recent COD games. If you are dying to also play normal online multiplayer without tons of cheaters, buy a pre-owned Xbox 360 or PS3 copy of this game. Otherwise, this is a fantastic game that every COD fan should own.

14694,4/10 dead lobbies. mainly 6v6 tdm is about it
14695,Great game even though its old
14696,"This is by far one of my most favorite CoD games!

- The multiplayer is actually quite amazing ""Ofc"" With enough players to get you into que's for all the good gamemodes.

- The single players story is actually amazing ""Completed it on Xbox i have yet to do it on PC.""

- The same standard ranking system but it wont be CoD without it! :3

Note: The mutiplayer client is seperated from the Single player client. ""So if you review the game little side note it wont show your multiplayer hours.

Overral pretty damn Good shooter with an active multiplayer to get you playing for days."
14697,"This game, well how can I put it?

Story - Suprising, it all gets you when you least expect it. Epic story line, perfect mechanics, all out amazing experience.

Multiplayer - Wow. Just wow. Words can't explain the epicness of this!

Special Ops - Challenging, fun and great to play with friends

Overall a definite 10/10"
14698,"Good: enjoyable, great and tactical maps, various weapons and perks
Bad: too much time to find games, laggy hosts, hackers"

14702,"Why would you make a multi player game online with no match making ? What a waste. You can only play the spec ops missions with other people by inviting them, you can't just create a random match like EVERY OTHER GAME OUT THERE!"
14703,"I used to play this back on Xbox 360 and i kicked ass then tried it on computer and still kicked ass..since i use Hard wired connection for PC on this game it is great and just the same. This old school game is my love for a long time. 2 years straight playing this game. The maps and guns and perks that this game has. NEVER gets old. The players that still play today have gotten a lot better since there is not many just casual players that are on here any more. But if you come across this game. PLAY IT.

Off the record. on campaign you can still get out side of the map. watch youtube for how. 
On multiplayer. The developers do not watch over this game any more. Download you an aim bot or hack and if you wish. Go to fucking town on some people. A lot of people will call out hack or what ever. ...what ever.. BUT word of cation.
IF YOU HACK AND FUCK WITH THE WRONG PERSON....they could come back and DDOS your ass and shut your computer down or burn it the fuck up...dont know what DDOS is?...you better look that shit up lol."

14725,"This game is cancer

10/10"
14726,"Note: the following is about the single-player version. I don't play multiplayer so cannot comment on it. If you're buying it for the multiplayer, look at other reviews. If you're considering buying it for the single player, this review is meant for you.  FYI.

It's so scripted that there is little to no replayability unless you enjoy doing exactly the same thing over and over and are enamoured with learning what is effectively an elaborate dance routine (shoot there, spin around, shoot there, move 2 meters, shoot there, etc.). So $/hr of enjoyment is limited. Lucky I only buy these things at massive discount Steam sales.

Overall storyline is strained. On the plus side, many of the missions are somewhat entertaining the first time around. Some are annoying as hell, apparently made to simply annoy the player, or perhaps showcase a particular element that the developers were particular proud of.  None made me think ""wow, that was great"".  The ending was, as with CoD4:MW, an annoying as hell tightly scripted cutscene.

Will I get the CoD:MW3? Probably, but only at a massive discount (ie: under CDN$10). Because so far the series isn't worth more than that. But for $10, it's an OK buy.

PS: You can't even turn off the repetive music. Instead, you'll have it blaring your ears while you TRY to listen for the killer dogs approaching, or footsteps behind you. There are ways to turn it off by hacking the system (well, renaming a file) but that compromises the local file integrity. Go figure.

PPS: Having now tried the multiplayer, my opinion doesn't change. The main issue is their idea of ""server selection"". As in: you don't get a choice.  You are connected to the first server it finds, and servers are user-operated so anything can happen. The system does not offer a list of available servers. So if you're in a group you don't want to play with (ie: they've hacked the server so much it's useless), you're stuck, because that's the first one the game will find. Alternative services have been aggressively shut down by the distributor for some reason. As for gameplay, it's the usual mix of perfectly reasonable people with an unfortunate leavening of cheaters. 

PPPS: Oh, and if you want to play around in single player, expect a LOT of issues trying to get the console working, and keeping it working. It was working, I ""resumed"" a game, and now it's not working any more. Yes, I've made all the necessary changes to config.cfg, yes I've made config.cfg read-only so the damn game doesn't overwrite it with a stored copy (why in HELL have a config.cfg if there's a stored copy, I'll never understand), but it still won't bloody work. ANNOYED! Doesn't change my recommendation though, my opinion of the game was already low.

Definitely not at all recommended unless you get this game at a steep, steep discount."
14727,"its ok I guess, I need more time with it"
14728,my game keeps crashing
14729,"So many years later and there still are matches going on in this game.

I originally started playing this game on the Playstation 3, but while that community died out and almost being unable to find a game to join, I decided to get this game dirt cheap on sale.

You might not find a lot of games in the rather obscure gamemodes, but if that's what you are looking for I wouldnt reccommend this game anyway. The fast phase of the game, the mechanics and basically maps do not give you the right feel when playing for example CTF or Demolition. There are other games out there that excel at this type of gameplay.
But back to why i originally started playing it. Team-Deathmatch still is very playable, even to this date there arent many cheaters if at all in the lobbies I join. The fast phase of this game just makes me come back every time, Its that shooting someone feels so rewarding, even if you die 20 times after that, It doesnt matter, you'll respawn anyway.

While i dislike certain changes that there are, for example no (voice-)chat in lobbies, it doesn't influence gameplay.

This game is old and still there are people playing this, this and all of the above is the reason that I do recommend getting it if you do not have it already. Dont have the 20 euro for it? Wait for it to go on sale, I promise you its not a waste of money. You'll enjoy hopping on, playing a match or 2 and quitting again, But that like every 2 week for the rest of the time that this game is in your library.

Don't like multiplayer? Thats cool too! this game offers a great singleplayer gameplay with a continuation of the Call of Duty 4 storyline which also goes on till Call of Duty Modernwarfare 3. While the game doesnt offer much free exploration and such, I do like them because they give me the ""you are the star of the movie"" kind of feel. That might not float your boat, but hey, I am reviewing this from my point of view.

The special ops is also a great addition to the game, while you can try to complete them by yourself, It makes it a lot easier when you try it together with someone else. There are a few acchievements to get here too, so when or if you have the time I'd highly suggest doing these too.

Overall is this game great, Especially now that it has aged so much, still playable in pretty much all aspects."

14754,"In all the COD games I've played I think I can see that in terms of story, spec ops, and multiplayer that this one is probably one of my favorites. With a kickass story that picks up after the first along with notable characters, new weapons, and amazing levels, this game in terms of campain lives up if not succeeds its predecessor. Spec Ops is an amazing solo or coop experience (I would recommend two player for extra fun) that brings you back to the campain levels completing different objectives. Lastly the multiplayer is so much fun with plenty of different game modes, maps, weapons, and more that in combination with the limited hacking that seems to have taken over the previous COD multiplayer gives this game a 10/10 would buy again. There is a reason that this game is still $20 after all the years it's been out."
14755,"Probably one of the best, if not the best game i have ever played in the Call of Duty franchise. I would recommend this game to any hardened and or novice Call of Duty fanatic, or just someone looking for a competitive and fun FPS game."
14756,It's like you're 12 again!
14757,too many hackers

German's getting angry caused by politicans.
German's getting german in the fact of being a german while rageing like a german caused by german censorship.

Ah and, hackers hackers hackers :)"
14760,"The multiplayer in this game is great fun! I keep coming back to it.

Positives:
+ Breakneck pace
+ Tasteful weapon balance
+ All-or-nothing class perks, multi-leveled.
+ Stages are well structured and rather large
+ Killstreak rewards are absolutely satisfying in this game
+ Game/round-winning killcams are a joy
+ HOST F*CKING SUBSTITUTION, meaning the game isn't over when the host player leaves.
+ Challenges breathe life and replayability into the game. Not just progress-based challenges but also situational.
+ Buttery-smooth and responsive gameplay and networking when pinging low. Friendly to snappy reactions.
+ Zero split-screening
+ Fun with friends
+ Arguably still the best multiplayer in the series
+ Not dead at all

Potential negatives:
- Odd respawing. The game tends to place you near the person who last killed you and vice-versa.
- All-or-nothing class perks. They can get annoying when everyone decides to be the Mad Bomber or power-buff an already high-powered weapon.
- The Vector SMG is the only weapon with stable ACOG sights. Use the attachment with caution on other weapons
- Extended Mags ""attachment"" can be VERY tough to unlock
- P2P-host/client multiplayer. A game can fall apart due to host's terrible connection. Host migration DOES kick in during these situations though.
- Not without its hackers. But I've actually run into some fun hacks.
- Not open to mods. Bummer... The game's flexibility encouraged me to make some Perfect Dark mods."

14791,"Overall, one of the best games i have ever played. When i played back in 2010-2011 on my PS3, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer.Now, 2016, i re-bough this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.
About the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server. 
There is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.
And theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.
Is MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.
But wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. ""Yes"" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but ""no"" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay..."
14792,"this game is the best game!
10/10"
14793,"Was quite the masterpiece back in It's day. Once was in It's prime, now it is not. As age has shown and newer tittles have been released, this community is quite lacking, expecially for us folks in Australia. Not to mention one of the funnest arcade like sniping systems around still, such a silly and out of place game with many over powered things such as the ""commando perk"" being able to lounge many metres for a knife kill or even the ""noob tube"". Just a great funny game, in which many hours can be lost. :)

Never the less, a great game and always has BEEN! a great pickup for most gamers out there and not many pounts I can jump on that haven't already been sprouted too!

Final verdict - 10/10 Paano's Stamp of Approval"
14794,Gg
14795,great game for wasting time.
14796,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! The only issue im having is that hackers are once again returning with force lobby mods and aimbots and stupid crap and i want them BANNED!!!!!! i cant even hit a clip without being called a hacker (i quickscope) and apparently i have so called hacks i have a VAC for this game because i went into a modded lobby with modded files and now its on my record its so stupid.

14808,"Personally, I love the campaign story. Would recommend you get it only if it's 50% off or more."
14809,"Singleplayer: Short as f*ck but not that bad.


Co-op: Yeah that was really fun to play with friends when game was released (2009).


Multiplayer: Hmm.....How to start....Awesome and Legendary FPS with many modes (you can max 4 or 5 of them beacause other nobody plays) full of 5k no brainers, Russians who tubing you all the time, spamming claymore, using RPG or shield. Host should be guy with potentional best connection for the game, unfortunately many times you feel like he's from Transylvania. Very common is also modded lobbies (may happen that modder will take your levels, attachments and weapons you already got before), texture hackers (undetectable), aimboters, wallhackers, norecoil hackers, rapid fire scripts or god mod. I personally prefer very popular mod Search and Destroy, where you average find around 6 games (5 of them are ususally trickshot virgin kids which literally dont let you play because of constant stunning, tubing or instant kick and let alive only the biggest idiot of your team as victim to do trickshot on him). Useful thing is tool called MW2sa by dint of you can kick hackers or tubers. The author of this tool asks in readme to try behave like adults and warning other people before kick them for some reason, unfortunately, his wish is not always heard, so often happens that 12yo kid kick you because you just winning with him or he maybe dont like something you said before. Some months ago Steam decided enable players which got VAC ban in this game (everyone should get a second chance or not ?) continue to play so many people can play again. So what are you still waiting for ?! Just pay 20 EURO and buy this 7 years old game !!! 11/10

MW2 is in my opinion the best call of duty there is ,i would have said total war but its unplayable because of the hackers.I hve it on console and on pc and i would have bought even for 360 if i was 10 year old all the time .Its the game that a navy seal sniper with 20 years of training goes to a ladder doing a ladder stall 720 no scope jump shot and that 5year olds with rpgs and noob tubes rule the the game!Its really annoying but the game i thinks shows its potential on the hardcore gamemode ,the bad news is nobody almost plays hardcore in mw2 they all go deathmatch(literaly there 1000 players and all play deathmatch.Long story short its a childhood memory that deserves to be in an fps gamers library.

If u look for something serius without kids ,gyus dont bother (it is a one way trip )if u know what i mean :)!!"

word."
14832,"This game used to be a lot of fun!

TL:DR; If you play online, you will play against hackers, and not have fun.

Unless you play in a private lobby with friends, (which you can't level up and get new or fun gear in private lobbies) all of the online servers are filled with hackers. And even if those hackers get VAC banned, they can still play and cheat like they were never banned."

I never had a decent computer to run this game and once i finally did this was a must have for my collection of games on pc. i prefer playing fps on pc then console as i grew up playing half-life, counter strike, and day of defeat on pc with my brothers lan. then later on the internet when we got better internet. I still prefer this mod2 to any of the newer cod games they have come out with as im sure alot of you feel the same. however this game is no longer playable as its filled with hackers, say one thing about them hacking and they will fuck your game, and stats up. im so very disappointed."

14852,"STILL my favorite game of the COD series. This game started off for me on an Xbox 360. I put many hours in. After finally ascending to the PCMR, I bought it again on here. I wish they would exactly remake this game instead of BS Black Ops. The only bad thing about this version on Steam is there are no community driven servers. Its just like on 360, you jump into a queve and get placed into a server. This is crap, since there is indeed plenty of hacking. There used to be a server system for this game, that was community driven and had modertors on every server. After they shut down the servers, all I have is this version left. I still play it plenty. Just wish there was more of a way to ban hackers."

14855,overall probably close to my favorite call of duty. theres hackers here and there but just report them. the multiplayer is fantastic.  definetly worth the 20$
14856,"hackers everywhere, but its still fun and the best COD imo"
14857,"Fantastic game, but all but died off because of the poor support by activision's VAC program that is woefully inadiquate at monitoring cheat hacking. Cheat hacking iswhat ruins the game forregular players looking to gain skills."
14858, najlepszy cod :D
14859,"Probably one of the best Call of Duty's in the franchise.

Bought it for nostalgia and alot of people still play alot, i've only ran into about 2 or 3 in multiplayer and still just as ""friendly"" as ever in multiplayer.

definitely worth buying."
14860,"I was VAC banned from MW2 over 6 years ago because I tried to create my own modded zombie server to have some fun (after I accidentally joined one). So I downloaded some software to host it and I was banned instantly...

Now I everytime I try and search for games it simply says ""Steam Connect Failed"", I believe this is because of the VAC ban. They have become much more strict on allowing accounts to play with a VAC ban. Disappointing because I really loved this game and I got my VAC ban many years ago...

I was also able to play merely 6 months ago even though I had the VAC ban but now all of a sudden I am not?"
14861,fun
14862,still after several years this game plays itself like it came out yesterday
14863,luve it
14864,This game is still beast af 10/10
14865,Still one of the best Call of Duty games in the franchise. Plays like a dream and I can always come back to play time and time again.
14866,2 best call of duty of all time...but i suck at this game and i dont see hackers in this game cause i am the hacker in the game
14867,"Great multiplayer experience, one of the best in CoD.
Match-making is fair, gameplay is great."
14868,"If this game has the same price as black ops 3, I'd buy it."
14869,Good Game
14870,is fun
14871,good  stuff 10/10
14872,"One of the best call of duty games I have played
Very fun :) Great gameplay but quite a lot of nooby stuff that ruins it a little but overall a great game.
8 out of 10"
14873,Nice game
14874,"OLdish Call of Duty but I love it. Fun to play, interesting storyline. Worth the buy if your into shooters."
14875,10/10 would get nube tubed again
14876,Too many cheaters.... not enough means to stop it and I think the developers care little about it.
14877,"Good Game. Online is alive and all is good. great campaign. 
But please Valve. Enable the VAC again in this game D: hackers is turning back to this great game."

14879,I feel like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was the top of the Call of Duty series. It was everything it needed to be after CoD4
14880,"Call of Duty is an enchanting game in which the main poser is to liquidate ""Makarov"" - new russian villain who wants to bring his plans in action and to extend Zakhaev's works about taking over the world. To be honest, I think that compared to the prevoius Modern Warfare in this game the plot is lame, I mean there are 4 out of ""16"" missions in the game, I shurly qualify them as imposing missions, it's a pity. Moreover I think that almost in all the tasks must be a time limitation, I think that this is drearily to liesurly do the tasks. But, I think in general the multiplayer, the grafity in the game, the new things that ""Infinity Ward"" wanted to do better in the game, they did, so, I just think it worth your money."
14881,Best fucking game ever
14882,Best COD ever. Enough said.
14883,Good
14884,Good game with an even better community.
14885,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway"
14886,"MW2 maybe the best generation in MW series. 

It does not include too much story-telling but every battle is exciting enough."
14887,"Can use a controller on this game, a newby when it comes to steam and this is my first first person shooter on pc."
14888,Hackers hackers hack Also I was ranked 70 now I'm ranked 2 what the hell
14889,"Game is great on PC, highley recommend to any FPS fan!!!"
14890,Good Game!I like the multiplayer mode!One of the best shooter games!
14891,top 1 quickscoper
14892,"No offline LAN, no mods, no command console, the campaign is decent but the muliplayer is a copy paste clone of call of duty 4: modern warfare with fewer players allowed per server, no server browser, just terrible matchmaking that doesn't even work correctly anymore. It's basically a console port. Buy Call of duty 4 Modern Warfare instead as it is actually future proof..."
14893,"Multiplayer Review:

Before I bought Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 on Steam I wasn't sure if it's worth it since I already played it a lot on console years ago and I read that there are a lot of hackers in multiplayer.

I can now say it's worth it since it's still a lot of fun and it never gets boring.

About the hackers I can't agree with all the posts about it since I only saw about 10  hackers or so in  about 40 hours playtime.

Yeah there are a lot of players who use tube and sniper but for me it's not a bad thing since I don't really care about what weapon everyone is using ^^

The connection is normally good but sometimes I can't even move because of lagg and I normally loose the connection after about a minute...
Fortunetly it doesn't happen too often but it's still annoying.

The only downside I saw is that they community is pretty much unfriendly most of the time.
Half of the lobby doesn't write anything and the other half is insulting everyone or they want to report players just because they got killed by them or because they use a weapon they don't like.

But other then that everything seems to be fine and I would recomment everyone to buy the game if the unfriendly community doesn't bother you ^^"

REVIEW :
Typical action shooter. Good for casual gaming.

CONCLUSION :
Recommended on sale price."
14895,Great game for all ages.
14896,THE BEST GAME EVER I MIGHT RECORD PLAYING (And those nasty hackers)
14897,"Really nice epic classic Call Of Duty game. If you are looking for a good FPS game, that still has players in multiplayer, can be run in most of computers, and which has all kind of action, you neeed to buy this game. Also if you aren't but this game anyway,,"
14898,"Call of duty modern warfare 2 is probably the most call of duty game  call of duty made. 

Its so Call of duty that you can almost taste the 8 year olds banging your mother.


This is like the quintessential Call of duty 
Save all your money and just buy this game instead of the other seven hundred thousand entries because this is as good as it gets."
14899,"My game time shown is probably for the single player (20 minutes). But it doesn't show my 23 hours invested in the multiplayer, and that's just here on Steam. I have about 1 month and a week of total play time on this game on PSN. This game is how I made a few of the friends I'm still playing with today, the reason I like search and destroy so much, and in my humble opinion, probably the most worthy successor to Call of Duty 4, surpassing every other iteration of Call of Duty since. 

This game is everything to me."
14900,TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING!!!! 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 BBBBBOOOOOOOOOMMMMM!!!! Win Confirmed
14901,Îã§Ï¢ãÏùÄÎç∞..............Î©ÄÌã∞Ïóê ÏÇ¨ÎûåÏù¥ ÏóÜÏñ¥
14902,"barely any hackers, the multiplayer still holds up today. i bought it 1/17/16 and I still love it."
14903,"Probably one of my most favorite games of all time. So many overpowered guns, pissed off 12 year olds and running with a sniper rifle, and also hackers lots and lots of hackers. But what fun would it be without hackers every call of duty has them, might as well just beat them and let them know they are inferior, or maybe their hacks just are... sorry i am rambling this was an amazing game until they released a new call of duty a couple of years ago... now it seems to just be the die hard fans that love it as much as I do. Play it/ Don't play it, I still love it!"
14904,i love this game
14905,0/10 Can't be 50 Cent
14906,"This is old but realy good story
"
14907,"The best game ever made ever MW2 is a must buy, buy it or you shall be possesed by david vonderharr"
14908,its super awsome. has great graphics and is a very awsome multyplayer game. best game out of the series 10 out of 10
14909,"Campaign - amazing.

Multiplayers - 40% players are tubers, 10% cheaters, but its still amazing. Complexed perks, many different guns, interesting kill streaks and nice maps. 

Worth buying - best CoD ever."
14910,"For me this is the last of the great Call Of Duty Games.
A hell of a beatifull single player campaign, still active multiplayer community.
Would buy it again if didn't have it by now.
I Love it as you may understand from my comment."
14911,When I was 9 years old i bought this on release day for the 360 and I enjoyed every minuite of it! 1000/10
14912,best cod so far
14913,"Its real good.

Sounds pretty stupid, but its true. Despite all the other games in the franchise, I still fell that MW2 was the last GREAT cod. Even though mw3 was stupidly fun, and bo2 was very enjoyable, I still feel that Modern Warfare 2, even with all of its flaws(Looking at you noobtubers), is still the superior COD. And even though it was made in 2009, it still gives me a awesome experience.
Would very much recommend."
14914,"Shit game, uttrer bollocks, full of hackers. Don't waste your money. Please fix"
14915,"Love Mw2 So yea get it best classic
"
14916,I cant help that I love these types of games. Mindless violence is needed on the worst of days!
14917,"(mulitplayer) Either you join a lobby full of hackers who lower your scores, and reset everything you've done, call in a nuke with 2 kills ect. Or you join a lobby full of campers, I'm talking hardcore sitting in the corner with an rpd silenced.... I even caught 2 people boosting once !!! and there's very few lobbies to join as nobody plays it anymore, you'll leave to find a new one, straight back in, I do not recommend you buy this if you're looking for some nostalgia, buy an xb360 and get it on there if you must, but not pc."
14918,"it fun
"
14919,My Best CoD!
14920,this is the best shotter game i Ever played
14921,One of the best Call of duty games ever made! In my oppinion is the best!
14922,"Even considering the multiplayer's numerous issues and poorly balanced items and perks, this is still a far more entertaining experience than any COD multiplayer that came after it."
14923,Great game :D
14924,Lov this game. Fast FPS game and still allows for some teamwork.
14925,Bought this game in December 2015 and I have not met a single hacker or hacked lobby and I find matches very easy even with the DLC enabled. I'd reccomend buying the game on sale if you have some buddies that want to get back into some of the old Cod games.
14926,"This is a very good game. Better graphics than the first CODMW1 however the sound is unacceptable. In the first there was very real and clear sounds and additionally they allowed you to select your sound frequency. In this game there is no such extra setting. It seems they have stripped that out for other reasons and this is sad. I have a great sound card and speakers and other games are great with the sound. I was very impressed with the first game and especially the sound but not this one. They must have gone cheap, but still the story is so good!"
14927,"You would think that at least one person would have asked a real soldier just how effective a 7.62mm round is against a soldier. This game is stupid. It takes four or five shots to eliminate a target. Can one of these programmers please demonstrate their bullet-proof cotton by standing in front of firing range and taking 5 rounds from a 5.56mm weapon. This is not a game; it'a a movie. It's scripted, it pre-destined, there is nothing the player can do to change the result. Just shoot stuff and wait for the cut-scenes. 
By the way, real soldiers never say the word 'repeat' on the radio - the word repeat in an artillery fire order. 
The game takes away your choice to move, to see, and to decide. 
The game looks good, but it uses the amazing graphics to draw dirt, snow, and blood on your face.
A wasted opportunity. It's a movie. The player has no control over the results. The end scene is excrutatingly frustrating as a boring end-of-game movie. Get the cheat codes and play the one-player levels. Disapointing."
14928,Really fun to play with friends :D -Said in 016 not 1900!

14932,"I think Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 made a great sequel to it's predecessor, CoD4. Great graphics, great game, and great multplayer maps/weapons and awesome singleplayer campaign also."
14933,"Likes: Graphics are incredible compared to console version, no high latency like on console version, and players are easier to get along with!
Dislikes: Some days, my PTSD from being in Iraq causes my left hand to shake a bit, so controller support would be nice!"
14934,Its ok but many Hackers!
14935,"Very fun game, but would not recommend buying it unless you want to mod, becuase everyone hacks nowadays on here.

(212+ hours back in like what?..... 2010?)"
14936,Very MLG
14937,Terrible Game
14938,"This game is still good except for 2 reasons

#1 Awful Lag

#2 Terrible Spawns

Besides that this game still played aswell as it did on the good old console days, but i'd say its a 7/10 because of those two reasons, but it brings me back to the days of 1v1ing on rust to see who was the best with the intervention"
14939,The best and by far the most fun Call of Duty game i have ever played. I have over 1600 hours of pure fun put into this game. It's well worth the money and the game keeps living up to its potential!
14940,"The sequel gives you all the thrills and chills of single player campaing that Modern Warfare 1 provided.

However the second instalment of MW series gives you a great Special Ops missions, which can be played with your buddy and it will give you twice as many hours of fun that the single player campaing, cause it is a killer coop experience. 

Wish the campaing was coop also :P

14975,I do like this game. It was the first Call of Duty I ever played. The campaign is great and alot of the missions make me want to play them again after beating them. The multiplayer is exactly like the console version; no server browser. You won't be finding any modded servers here. It's just regular old servers. The spec ops is also fun but is better enjoyed with 2.

14982,Very good
14983,Solid game!
14984,After 6 years and counting you wonder how and why are people still playing this game? I've been a big fan of FPS all my life and by far this one in my opinion is still the best. Over the Call of Duty series that have been released people still play good ol' Modern Warfare 2! Why? Some people say it's more natuaral looking and feel! I agree! So what are you waiting for? Let's Do This!
14985,"329.8 hours playing CoD MW2,  ya think I like it?   

I didn't know how they could POSSIBLY improve on the first Modern Warfare (Call of Duty 4), but they sure as heck did it!  I love this series (only played up to Black Ops 1, so far) as much as I like the Half Life series.  I HIGHLY recommend BOTH series!"

The final nail in the coffin was its successor, the game-turned-actionmovie MW3."
14990,"I'm on edge about giving Modern Warfare 2 a negative review but due to the fact that;
A. The campaign is pretty short,
B. There are only roughly 500 people playing multiplayer,
I feel it has to be given a negative review.

I've heard that this is one of the best Call of Duty games from many people, and I would agree with them up to some extent with the online play, Special Ops missions and the campaign. However with a dying online community, the few remaining people are religious Modern Warfare 2 players who have reached max prestige and are back up to level 70 and have been playing it since it was released. With few players online you're odds of entering a game that doesn't have one person who is ridiculously better (26:2 KD) is very very slim. Instead of feeling like you're competing online, you're having a miserable time while the #1 player is calling in his 1,000th nuke and doing a celebration dance. I wouldn't recommend the online to anyone who has little to no experience playing the COD games.

The campaign has a great story is you follow along with it but it's just very short and can be beat in under 6 hours. Esspecially if you play on an easier difficulty. Overall it's a good story but it doesn't make up for the length of the campaign.

The Special Ops are the best part of this game, esspecially if you have a friend whom to do it with. There are 23 missions that get increasingly difficult the further down the line you get and will have you sitting there for over an hour trying to beat a single mission on veteran. Fun and diverese missions make Special Ops truly stand out in Modern Warfare 2.

The conclusion however is that after you beat the short campaign and destroy the Special Ops missions, you will only have online multiplayer left which is where the replayability comes in. With dwindiling numbers online, when you buy Modern Warfare 2 you better really REALLY love the campaign and Special Ops because the online multiplayer is in its final days which will leave no replayability to the game at all. Due to this fact, I cannot recommend this game."
14991,"Got banned, not cool"
14992,"This is when IW went backwards in time to matchmaking, before quake came out and introduced server hosting files for dedicated servers.   Most FPS's suck these days.   Nobody wants to let communities mod and grow."
14993,"Short version:
Ok singleplayer for $10.  Not recommending cos the normal tag is (at least in AUS) $40 USD.
Play time 8hrs 40min on Veteran (frist run)

Long version:
Standard shooter.  Still not as good as original COD.  Stole a lot of it's missions from the original 
(e.g. Reichstadt, Stalingrad).  Gunning down civilians was a plus.

The difficulty of enemies is lame, brought on by implementing a simple AI that  autoaims/wallhacks, funneled scripted moments, and overwhelming number of enemies. Nothing tactical or strategic required.

Weird autosave spots, like right in the middle of a firefight.  Then not one for 5 minutes.
Visual cues when and where you are getting hit from are poor. Screen shakes a lot for no reason (getting hit, heavy vehicle)
Garbage stealth level where you kill one guy silently and suddenyl everyone knows.  Unless if your sniper buddy kills him, then that's ok. Spawns enemies right on top of you, in corners where you know there were no enemies.

Can't tell who are the enemy, yet get a game over screen for shooting your buddies
No continuity between one level  and the next.

Some nice level design - felt that although scenarios were repeated ad infinitum - some of those levels lacked character, while others were detailed.
Only allowed to complete everything one way (with a handful out of thousands of potential choices, with zero consequence).  
Hold button until it dies works in 95% of cases
Your allies do next to nothing unless explicitly scrtiped to do so... might as well be Star Wars Stormtroopers.

I feel there was a much better story here that someone sold out just to get it published.  There were heaps of tiny details that were present just not utilised.  Pity."

6/10

[h1]Intro[/h1]
Although Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was a relatively average modern military shooter, this is a decent improvement. Sure, this is still a generic modern military shooter, but short of making the gameplay more interesting, there are things like a great soundtrack and explosive cinematic sequences to keep the brain from being bored of said gameplay.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
+ Great soundtrack.
+ Decent replay value.
+ Good weapon variety.
+ Good aesthetics and graphics. There are also some explosive cinematic sequences.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- Intels no longer give you cheats.
- Heavy flinch when getting shot at.
- Generic modern military shooter gameplay.
- Little enemy variety. Yeah sure, you fight Militias, Russians and Shadow Company, but they all are still humans with hit-scan guns.

14996,"Best CoD game by far, best campaign ever. Its rather old already, but still playable. It doesn't require a high end PC to play. I solidly Recommend it."
14997,Very Fun
14998,Overall an awsome game the multiplayer can be hard but after a whille u get better much better than aw and ghosts combined I would buy this game again.  If u don't own this game buy it now
14999,"Even in 2016 its fucking amazing. No hackers so far, fun to play, amazing campaign. Totally worth it.

VAC banned tho."
15000,"The best and only CoD game which has a good story. Still worth buying.

Edit: Also, better multiplayer option with no hackers."
15001,Excellent
15002,"This is a fairly good CoD. Solo is really enjoyable. Don't waste too many times online though, you'll get to hate humankind. And for a good reason."
15003,9.5/10
15004,Epic game
15005,:)
15006,"I remember going to a midnight release for this game with one of my best friends, and it was worth it because this was a pretty awesome follow up to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The singleplayer campaign is pretty fun, but it felt short and some parts were kinda repetitive. The gameplay is still great and the graphics are still pretty decent for a Call of Duty game. 

Didn't run into any crashes or glitches, which is a plus. Multiplayer is still fun after all these years, but I did occasionally run into hackers and hacked lobbies. Overall, its a solid entry in the Modern Warfare series, and I had a blast playing through it again after all these years. 

I highly recommend Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2."
15007,Makes me feel like an eighth grader again. In a good way. Sort of.
15008,"the only reason why Call of Duty made money and fame.

If you haven't played modern warfare, you haven't lived.

But the series is the only part of CoD that I recommend for newcomers- even though you cant play mp nowadays.
the storyline is well worth some torrenting/downloading"
15009,"I love the multiplayer in this game, and the campaign has some parts that I remember from this first time I played this game years ago. Coming back to it now brings back some nostalgia, I love this game"
15010,frank what is this
15011,
15012,"COD MW 2... now this is when COD used to be fun! Even the MP seems more fun, no more 360 in-the-blind-no-scoping-with-knives from the other side of the map. This is when COD was good, this was when COD was king of online MP. Not to mention the story isn't bullshit."
15013,"waiting for english version

10/10"
15014,best cod ever
15015,"Probably the best call of duty ever made. I had played it on 360 for such a long time and had to buy it on PC. I was kind of diasspointed that you couldn't use a controller to play it, but after a bit I got use to keyboard and mouse and its so much better. The campaign is still great, probably my favorite in the series before it went to shit. The graphics still hold up and the game looks relatively good. Multiplayer is still pretty nice, not too many hackers from what i'v experienced so far. All in all my favorite call of duty to date and in my opinion it should be remade.

9/10"
15016,"Call of Duty, after WW2 but before the doritos and the mountain dew.

In other words, a good CoD game."
15017,"O Jogo Achei Incrivel , Recomendo Muito Foda , Os Graficos N S√£o muito exigentes para um computador foda entao vc precisa apenas ter um razoavel ! 

9,5"
15018,YES!!!
15019,10/10 would make the emblem/title challange again
15020,Still the best CoD for multiplayer.
15021,"Again, another shooty shooty bang bang, but in a new colour scheme"
15022,"Just bought the game for the third time, still love it!
One of the best COD games out there. Haven't come across any hackers or cheaters yet.
20/10"
15023,There are still buttplugs flying across the map 'till this day
15024,I Love This Game.
15025,DO YOU LIKE SHOOTING DIGITAL PEOPLE? YES? WELL I HAVE THE GAME FOR YOU!
15026,Recommend this game for the pure fact that the co-op campagn is absolutely fantastic.
15027,One of the greatest Call of Dutys
15028,"Great game, excellent multiplayer, i recommend it."
15029,"Dont take my lack of hours as me not having knowledge towards this game, this is by far the best call of duty to date. No bias towards other cods, ive played them all and without a doubt was this the most fun CoD made, it was made in 2009 for christ sake and its graphics and gameplay still blow me away with how much of a good job infinty ward has done creating this game, they need to stop making call of dutys like AW and ghosts and take from this game way more because Bo3 has taken me by storm and have stepped up with their game, infinty ward need to make more games like this and even the grounds between treyarch and infinity ward. Not a helpful review but a little statement on what really needs to happen in the years to come for call of duty. 10/10"
15030,i cant play multilayer
15031,I guess my mom has seen quite a few 12 year olds...
15032,this game is game who whant a fun game that can help peaple learn old trick and new ones along th way in this game
15033,Fill your mtn dew bottle and find a bag of doritos cause we 1v1'ing on rust m8
15034,Still my favorite out of the COD series and Black ops series.  Graphics still kick butt!
15035,"Best COD game by far
"
15036,"Just another mindless FPS.  Very addicting, lots of action.  Not your old fashion Call of Duty, but well worth the money if you're into multiplayer more than single player.  Just don't expect any major ""wows"" from the single player.  Its predictable and linear, and the few times it isn't, the surprises are yawn worthy.

Basically, this is where Call of Duty left the realm of interesting campaigns but picked up the endless multiplayer."
15037,"ŸÖÿ±ÿ© ÿ≠ŸÑŸàÿ© 
"
15038,"By far my favorite call of duty's ever made I just play quite often, single and multiplayer are very emersive."
15039,i stopped playing csgo cos of this game :)
15040,yes boi

15042,still fun to this day!

15044,"FAQ:

Do people still play it?

(for North America at least) yes, many people still play, easy to find matches but its mostly team deathmatch. Not many people play Search and Destroy or anything else from what i can tell.

Is it filled with hackers?

Heard there is some but 6 hours in and i havent found any.

Is it worth it?

This game is hella old and you probably shouldnt still be paying 20 dollars for it. Wait for a sale or buy it from Goodwill or Gamestop for your old Xbox 360 or Ps3 for cheaper."
15045,Ohhhhh ya Dawg!
15046,The best Call of Duty
15047,always have and always will love the modern warfare games
15048,"dude... i just walked a mile through the cold fucking snow to get a steam card for this game and the shit wont even move past a black screen nor be closed without forcing it. son of a bitch its a waste of time, fix your shit."
15049,"I would recommend this game if you enjoy the campaign modes of FPS's, but if you are planning on buying it just for the multiplayer I would not recommend it  (read 3rd paragraph) and would instead recommend Black Ops 3.

Single Player: The campaign of this game is amazing, I have 100% 'ed it and have logged over 80 hours in it just because it is a great game to go back and play every now and then.

Multiplayer: Nowadays you will not find many online games without hackers/modders as this game is very old in the series, but I still play this game a lot because I love to 1v1 n0obz with my intervention."
15050,good  game
15051,pew pew
15052,What was I thinking?!
15053,"This is an amazing game and it always will be.*

Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Pros:

+Lots of weapons, weapon attachments, etc.
+Totally customizable tags with all kinds of emblems and titles
+You can make your name colorful and chat with colored letters
+Its easy to level up anymore
+All kinds of challenges
+Amazing singleplayer
+Amazing spec-ops/co-op

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Cons:

-Lots of hackers and cheaters
-Many games with ""snipers only"" and ""Trickshotters"" and not doing so resulting in getting kicked with the error message: ""Server file mismatch. Please validate your game files.""
-Cancerous community
-Microphone Spam online



Other than the cons in this game it is an amazing game and totally worth the money. The singleplayer can be played on Recruit, Regular, Veteran, or Hardened Veteran (I may be wrong on the names but its basically Very Easy, Easy, Normal, and Hard.)



*The hours listed show my singleplayer hours played, I've played over 250 hours on the multiplayer :)"
15054,"There was an era when people gathered and lan partied. Then the time came, when you Owed to have Internet connection and services such as those steam provides, in order to play multi. Then dedicated servers seized to exist and games such as this, ruined the fun, especially when match making doesn't find any players.
If you like fps and especially COD , play everything until MW(2). Your location might depend on whether you will be able to find other players and from MW2 and on, the game is more esport friendly, meaning for ex. Totally random spawns etc..."
15055,"rubbish steam effort with no controller support as per usual , and they don't make it clear before purchase !!!!!"
15056,A 2009 game that doesn't look like 2009. More fit to 2013's game.

15062,best cod game ever ... <3
15063,"I'm not a big CoD fan, but I can tell you that this is one of the better Call of Duty games.

I've only played throught the story and that was the main reason why I bought it. The story wans't bad 
but took me about 5 or 6 hours t finish it. Haven'y played the multiplayer yet, but the game is just a big meh.

I'll only recommend this game if it's on sale.

"
15064,"CoD: MW2

Simply the best campaign for any CoD game....EVER!
Multiplayer? - Amazing, except for the hackers since it's old......
Zombies? - Oh right there's no zombies unfortunately, but still fun! :D"
15065,i love this game
15066,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. you will spend 5 minutes looking for a match only to join a server with 200+ ping... this game is dead... i was hoping for some entertaining nostalgia, but i guess that's asking for too much from CoD..."
15067,"Well I do not know even where to begin why Call Of Duty Modern Warfare game.First good time when I played multyplayer Four Delta One ( 4D1 ) .Extra graphics continued the story gives a good dynamic with extra good music.Maybe to these new creators of Call Of Duty series took this into consideration and started making a game where the player race and not jump like a kangaroo . Graphics on a very good level, details are very good and sharp what we liked me as a player .

Wondering whether the recommend

YES

Buying DLC map

NO

10/10"
15068,"Action, FPS, Solo or Multiplayer.  Yes, I recommend it to others!"
15069,AWESOME GAME! it might be old but i like it bc its my fav call of duty games of all time so thank you tryarc
15070,I like this game... just a bit.
15071,Best Call of Duty¬Æ game ever.

Play Multiplayer on iw4repz with dedicated servers"
15073,ganska bra
15074,"Such a brilliant game. Love it - by far the best Call of Duty, closely followed by Black Ops 2. I decided to revisit it because recent Call of Duty games have been awful and I am not dissapointed."
15075,"Classic, that everyone should master before buying newer titles."
15076,"It may be Michael Bays call of duty..... 
But ya gotta admit even he's good when he's on the ball.
Great campaign, as for multiplayer, stick with black ops, less hacked servers lol"
15077,"Great 
So hard for me to start up idk why 
doesnt respond when start
great graphics"
15078,"**Edited Review from Years Ago**

ONE OF THE BEST CALL OF DUTY EVER..

I Keep it as Short as I Can..

Comparing this to the Remastered Version on BattleNet..
If You Looking for the Best Graphics, Go buy The Remastered Version

BUT, if you just want to Having a Nostalgia, then GET THIS ONE!!!

I Played Both This one and The Remastered, and I Gotta be Honest.. This one Brings back the memory of a GOOD FCKIN CALL OF DUTY game!!"
15079,"An awsome game,even after all these years. This is how the Call Of Duty games were and still should be. The story is awsome. Lots of awsome action and enthralling gameplay. The multiplayer is sweet (No squeakers found here so far). If you like a good FPS try this one first. :)"

about every 10 games or so you will find about 1-2 hackers and it kinda ruins that game

overall worth the 10"

15086,good old day's!
15087,it graet game i love it!
15088,"This is probably the best FPS ever made and I prefer it to all the sequels, but it is ruined by the constant presence of hackers who kill the joy of the game. If everyone had to play straight, it would be the best game of all time. I report hackers constantly, but I am told that Steam no longer VAC bans people in MW2. Sad."
15089,"With no more solid multiplayer its not fun to play anymore online - Too many cheaters.

 Campaign is fun. Good interactive story. Replay Value is high."
15090,Classic
15091,"Use to be pro untill cunts deranked me and i modded to get my rank up, then got VAC banned"

15093,Awesome
15094,"this game is awesome!

15095,Good game
15096,this game gud
15097,Multiplayer is still fun if you can look past everyone calling you a hacker everytime you get a kill.
15098,"Tryhards, Trickshoters, Quickscopers, Noob Tubers, Ragers, Ninja's, Hackers, Fat Kids, Casual Gamers, and so many more wonderful people come together and make the community. About the game tho. Well play and FIND OUT FOR URSELF U LAZY BUMS!!!"
15099,best game ever :D
15100,"Modern Warfare Series is the best series of COD in my opinion and MW2 is the best, amazing graphics, great game setting, and just great overall. Story is still great and Special Ops mode is a great SP addon. Dem god deam nuclear Bombs :v . Rekt by hardscopers simulator 2009."
15101,One of the best Call of Duties out there. I used to play this on the PS3 and when I bought it on steam this year nostalgia hit me hard... The story is perfect and the Multiplayer is no less. Newer CODs are shit compared to this master piece.
15102,still fun after years
15103,"amazing game, most  people think its full of hackers but its not. 

campain mode meh, i find the airport mission offensive.

the reason you should get this game is. the multiplayer

Going through a security check,a guard asks me something in Russian,sounds a bit like ""Cyka Blyat""

I answer politely ""No Russian""

I only realise my mistake the moment i was knocked down,guns drawn to my face,and my hands were in handcuffs.

This is how MW:2 got me arrested"
15108,"Bought this on steam while stationed overseas in Germany.  Ended up with the stupid German copy with the edited levels.  Great game, horrible purchase :/

If in the military and buying on Steam, verify location modified games or use a vpn."
15109,cool i guess
15110,Better than CS:GO by a mile.
15111,"This is slightly bogus, i got this game mainly because i thought i was going to be able to controlably fight against robots in my own pick and choose scenerios. but the laptop version completly lacks the ability to do that when i did the exact thing on my friends xbox. i am very upset and dissapointed that the whole reason i got the game is pointless"
15112,"Still the best Call of Duty out there, some would argue that cod 4 is, they're equally good, this one imo is a bit better. Cones down to me playing it a lot and the fact that I played this first, before cod 4"
15113,i love this game it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN!!!!!
15114,"I'm so glad to see one of my favorite Xbox Games available on a computer, but can you guys please make a patch enabling it to be played with a controller like half the other games on steam? It'd be so much better that way especially sonce that's how most of us got used to playing this game originally.Thank You"
15115,I suck worse than a ten dollar hooker and I'm still a hacker.
15116,NICE GAME
15117,Awesome multiplayer game! enjoyed a lot!
15118,I LOVE IT. Its a nice game. Not the biggest fan of campanign but i love multiplayer. Multiplayer is awesome it has lots of hours of fun.

15157,"Best call of duty game in my opinion
"
15158,"The Steam version is bad, especially after they removed VAC authentication. (See my VAC ban) If you want a good client, go to https://auracore.net/ AuraCore is essentially based off of old alterIWnet/FourDeltaOne code, so it's good to go.  If you don't have the DLC, you should be able to find it by searching for ""alterIWnet DLC Repository.""  As it is still in its early life, we need people to host US servers to play on.  Anyways, RepZ is garbage, so don't bother with it."
15159,"Back when this 1st came out i bought it day one for the xbox 360, it was fantastic. Sure there were issues with kniving, bullet sponging, and balance but they never spoiled the fun for me. However when the next cod came out i left MW2 in the dark, but i always regarded it as one of my favourites. 

I have contemplated buying this game for the PC and so when i saw it on sale i decided to buy it, it was a good choice. 

The singleplayer mode is still great fun as are the spec ops missions. The only let down is the multiplayer but that only down to the lack of players. 8/10 times i can get in a full game but its usually TDM and nothing else which is a shame but not the end of the road. Its still great fun but now we get to the crux of the issue; do i recommend it? For a sale price, definitely. For full price, nope. Its a shame that Activision refuse to change the pricing with the times, heck COD4 still goes for ¬£20 when not on sale which is ludicrous when you consider its age and lack of active community. 

TL;DR On sale? Buy buy buy! Not on sale? Dont bother."
15160,Best campain Ive ever played!
15161,"Still active, yeah ya run into a hacker or no lifer with 10k hours in MP, but just gotta leave match and join another one."
15162,Maybe the best cod i ever played and ever well be
15163,good
15164,"Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare was good! But i mean really good a master piece. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is by far one of the best call of duty games and also other master piece, i think was the last hight from the franchise. In my opinion i think call of duty 4 still better but i cant deny this game is near to perfect. This game is super addicted, really good graphics, the gameplay is improve from morden warfare 1 mainly in multiplayer, the single is kinda short but is so epic, co op is amazing to play with friends! I even played more co op then multiplayer it selft! this game have a pick longivity because of the multiplayer. One of the most nice things about this game is the fact this game age really well, even today looks amazing. 

Review: 9.5/10"
15165,8/10 would get ears blasted by low bitrate in-game chat again.
15166,ITS STILL FUN
15167,classic
15168,"Amazing game for ret. ards! If you are a ret. ard, this game is just for you and doesn't require any skills to be a hero! Get yourself an unlimited sprint perk with a commando perk, which allows you to stab your enemies with your pocket knife for 5 meters distance! Spend your time on the run and stab mission! Not interested? No problem, you can just equip yourself with a M203 nooblauncher to get an easy and guaranteed kills every time you respawn! If this still isn't your style, we got another  option: The dualwield autopistols! Take the Glock 18 to each hand and just run and spray it all over the map, you will get your free kills! Still not interested? Than you are most probably not a re. tard and the game isn't made for players like you."
15169,its better than call of duty waw 9/11
15170,The noob-tubers made me realize I've been to funerals funnier than this game.
15171,good

There are [u]no hackers[/u] .. well maybe 1 or 2 but modded lobbies where you'd get everything unlocked are non-existent although many seems to think this game is filled by them.

+Gameplay
+Unlocking system
+Custom classes
+Maps
++The campaign is simply fucking amazing.
+Nostalgia

Conclusion; Yes you should buy this game. The 20‚Ç¨ will be worth it. If it's on sale 50% off, buy it."
15177,no
15178,Better than Call Of Duty.
15179,it is very fun

[i] how 2 get bots?	[/i]"
15193,Got into a lobby after 10 minutes of searching and instantly the highest level with all unlocks. 1/10 easiest game ever.
15194,Beating this game on Veteran difficulty would be substantially more impressive if people actually respected or acknowledged the Call of Duty franchise. I feel like my time was wasted.
15195,One of the best Call of Duty's out there! I love the Modern Warfare series and i hope that there will ever be an Modern Warfare 4 without all those jetpacks of the past 2 years!
15196,Amazing. Love it. it's going to be HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE
15197,"A classic Call of Duty game, great fun for the single-player -- the multiplayer has a smaller playerbase now, of course, but you can still find some games."
15198,the best call of duty title for pc if you are looking for multiplayer.
15199,"At the beginning it was good but now it's a fucking noob game. There are only guys with noobtubes, autoshotguns and other stupid weapons."
15200,"This is Call of Duty as it should be. Not any of that money-grabbing unfinished poorly designed waste of time junk that we know call of duty as now. Please make CoD great again
"
15201,"Man this game brings memories.Well....it all started 6 years ago.I bought the game with the help of my parents of course, i was a kid back then, i know i was that kind of annoying ass kid with a high pitched voice but...man the memories.I made so many clans and fond memories with so many people, we had a sniper clan and shit...it was truly amazing, i started my own clan and we fought a few times, but lost...of course, i was just a kid with no fucking idea what i was doing,but hey...they might be one of the best momeries i had.I had a few friends which got to my heart, its hard to forget them, you know who you are, and if you come by to read this, YOU ROCK! :D.Well, let me get to the point, this game was the pinnacle of gaming, nice graphics, for that time of course, good story..at least in my opinion, and one of the most addictive shooters out there,and god i loved the multiplayer, with all the quick scopes and shit .Anyway, long story short,one of the best games i have EVER played, no doubt, thanks tho whoever read this, even now !"
15202,game wont start.. help
15203,My favorite MP FPS in terms of maps and gameplay
15204,Bring this game back!  Best Game of the Decade!
15205,there are hackers everywhere . People ues cheats like aimbot and all that badd hacks dont buy using your own money its not worth it.
15206,cock
15207,Multiplayer is 12-year-olds and hackers that think it's fun to mod in low gravity and infinite ammo.
15208,wow this has good storie but when you play multiplayer its too many hacker but one of the best game i ever played so fast buy it
15209,shit sux
15210,The campaign and special ops are good but the multiplayer is not working as it will not load I don't know if it's my computer or the game over all it's a good game
15211,"Great game!!
"
15212,"Old school COD,(Like every COD should be).
Love this game. Love the MW series, W@W and BO 1 & 2.
Ghosts was mehhhhh and from there on, COD took a downfall due to boost jumping and wall running.
To bad the publishers/devs didnt listen to the community. 
Every respected COD player is in favor of: BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
Cheers."
15213,"Good game, but make sure to get it on sale. It's not as good as MW1, which is probably news to nobody. Not reviewing multiplayer, the single player campaign is about 6 hours long. The set pieces are great, some of the levels are very entertaining, and this game is visually fantastic. But, unlike MW1, the story is very stupid and, at times, feels very cheap and contrived. 

As in, this game taught me that Russians are magical wizards and have the ability to transport entire armies across the world overnight, undetected by anybody. Or that security cameras only work when the bad guys face isn't directly in frame. Or that all terrorism in the world is caused by a single person, rather than complex economic, social, and political issues. Or that nuking your own country is the best way to stop a foreign invasion. 

So, yeah. Enjoy the game for the levels and visuals and pretend the story doesn't exist. Because, that's apparently the same mindset the developers had when making this game."
15214,"Modern warfare is in my opinion one of the best series of the game call of duty, this game will completely engross you in the plot... the Plot is the same this game is very unpredictable and intense if nicotine in the essence of this great shooter, you will want to play it again and again, but multiplayer in this game is gorgeous, in it you will be able to natrinirovali your reflexes and aiming at players, and have a good game , gamers)))"
15215,LOVE this game.. lots of fun...
15216,Great.
15217,"Possibly one of the best cods ever.  The campaign is great, despite it's short length, I've had no issues with the multiplayer but be weary of hackers because they are almost everywhere.  But I had so much fun playing this game, and consider it to be a classic.  TBH get all the MW games because they are all great."
15218,I really love the slow motion kill cam at the end and the kill replay! This is an awesome game!
15219,My best game ever $$
15220,Still better than CS:GO and TF2

15240,"If you think you should buy the new cod so because it is new, don't do it!!! 
This still remains the best cod ever made. 
Lately call of duty is a brand that wants to sell by name and not by quality. 
If you like a good old-fashioned cod with good graphics this is what you have to buy!"
15241,"great game and recomend it to all :) 

watch out for hackers tho coz there is a few"
15242,Total Call Of Duty : MW series Best Story.
15243,Best game ever!!
15244,"One of my favorite FPS games of all times, need more games made like this."
15245,"Campaing is interesting and not that short but short enough to keep you interested.

Multiplayer is kinda dead nowadays if you have both dlc purchased (if you don't you will get hacker lobbys) so best way to prevent that is to buy all dlc
IF YOU BUY ONLY ONE DLC YOU CAN ONLY PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO TOO HAVE ONLY THAT DLC=NO ONE (that was useful back in the day so you wouldn't get kicked from lobbies for not having a dlc, if you happen to own only one you can always disable the dlc on steam)
Multiplayer is almost legendarily fun. Yes it's unfair and noobtubes with scavenger are best but that's how it goes. with right amount of skill you can outplay noobtubers.

But the special ops is where this game shines. there is suprisingly many of them IF you play with the hardest difficulty. because that makes them almost nintendo like hard where you have to play them all over again dozens of times to complete them. (hardest are the breach mission and the explosive only juggernaut mission and THAT ESTATE MISSION WITH JUGGERNAUTS EVERYWHERE)
I suggest only play with veteran difficulty. everything else is too easy

And the best you can get out from this game is play with your friend the special ops next to each other (modern laptops can run this game easily) with the hardest setting especially the two stages with the other controlling the helicopter/ac-130.
coop makes them a lot of easier though because you can revive each other.

15246,"The BEST Call of Duty to date. Amazing high paced, crisp and smooth multiplayer with the best campaign of the series that leaves you wishing MW3 did a little differently. Multiplayer is pretty much dead now sadly. Everyone has bailed on it because of the talk of hackers. From my experience hackers are few and far between. Get yourself mw2, get on multiplayer and hop in TDM. BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO IT."
15247,"Few years late but this game is awesome
Only a few huge annoying things.
90 fps cap
no fov slider
peer to peer 
no proper settings system
dlc
"
15248,i just want you to do that you must better protect the game from heckers some guys wallhecking and staff like that
15249,"-Join a multiplayer match-

Ran at an enemy with my shield

Enemy quits game.

10/10 would intimidate again"
15250,still wondering why some people hate Call of Duty
15251,11/10 Best story of all CoD's
15252,nice
15253,Best Cod
15254,"Help , I cannot start my Multiplayer
For some reason when i press Play it takes like ages to start up , 3 ages later... it is not started up yet....
If some one who is reading this comment and knows how to fix it, Plz tell me ... because i really enjoy playing this game on multiplayer.

Your probaly gonna comment : Did U Hack? my answer: no i didn't"
15255,"this is definety one of my most favrouit games ever
i have played most Call of Dutys and this has some of the best multiplayer maps and has an awsome rankig and levelling system
i definetly recomend COD MW2 to all who love first person shooters"
15256,hey why is my cod mw2 multiplayer not working.its broken or something?is the server down?
15257,I bought this for the single player and both steam and activision will not find or help as to why it won't play in single version so if that is your idea DON'T get it .
15258,Probably the most balanced and fun multiplayer experience of the last decade of FPS games.
15259,"-Plays first game.
-Hacker gives you max level and all acheivements.
-You shit talk a noob tuber.
-He ddos's you and resets your stats.

*repeat*"
15260,"BEST COD STORYLINE EVER!!
10/10 FOR THE EPICNESS!!!"
15261,8/10 little lag spikes but its a awesome game
15262,"POKOKE OKAY

walaupun sudah termakan usia tapi tetap okay

eventhough its not to old game, but its very GOOD game...."
15263,"Hard to believe that a COD game could provide such a fun and time consuming experience online when compared to the money driven horseshit that the franchise has become today, but Modern Warfare 2 in it's prime was one of the most entertaining and enjoyable online experiences I have ever had in the FPS genre.

I weep for the future and of what Call of Duty has now become, and can only hope that one day a company can learn from exactly what made this game good and recreate it again."
15264,a relic of the glorious age of good mw shooters.
15265,"[i]Its old, but really cool."
15266,"Very good game, with a very good multiplayer.
"
15267,"if your looking for an perfect fps campain look no further this game hase the best fps campain I know and I have playd the whole cod series up to ghosts and I have playd all the battlefields exept 42 and 2142 and so on.

on console there are just hackers in the multiplayer so I have not tryed it out on the pc."
15268,i love this game so much not many hackers.
15269,"Recommend it for the campaign, but not for the multiplayer. The MP is literally trash. After the VAC bans were removed the game has been filled with cheaters and hacked lobbies. But yeah, if you like something like medal of honor but with a modern touch to it, then you will like the campaign."
15270,"player data bases is that much bad so once you unistall the game and re-install it again you lose all weapons,skins and everything that comes with your levels and all you ever achieved playing this will be lost so it become like you never played before this and you need to start from zero no matter if you was 10 prestige level before,you will just lost all stuff you ever had...and thats where my VAC ban comes from,THANKS for keeping my account well and thanks for destroying  my profile...be sure to take care of the player‚Äôs belongings...gameplay of the game is so much good,nicest of all modern warfares ever,but company  is piece of ____ and no one gives a ____ about data bases...."
15271,"Rly nice game in all
Best out of the Call of Duty Series"
15272,"Nice game , but community sucks :("
15273,This game is good since 2009. :) 10/10 rated
15274,Good game love it
15275,Best Game that started it all for me highly recommend new COD players to check this game out
15276,GREAT GAME
15277,"This game is my childhood. Honestly, I've never felt an experience in any other Call of Duty that was able to match this, save Call of Duty 4. A genre-defining blockbuster first-person shooter, you will be enticed and drawn back to MW2 for years. Modern Warfare 2 is the last GOOD Call of Duty..."
15278,The best game ever purchased. Highly recommended! Just wonder when it's going to be remade.
15279,"This Game Is Perfect, Has Set The Standard For Most Call Of Duty Games. Campain Is Nice, Multiplayer Is Fun, And Co-op Is Pretty Good! But Do Keep In Mind, Multiplayer Is Almost Completely Dead. At Most Maybe Two Lobbies Are Up, And Both Of Them May Be Hacked. You Can't Truely Experience This Game Like It Used To Be. Not To Mention The Hackers Promote You To Max Level In One Lobby, And It Sucks For Me When I Try To Play The Game The Way It's Sappozssed To Be. Nevertheless, It's Still Fun And Looks Great."
15280,Great game
15281,"Worst ¬£20 I ever payed. The singleplayer I do recommend. As for the Special Ops.
The Multiplayer is so broken on this. Just... BROKEN.
You Can't change the Resolution or the game goes crash. If you join a match, the intermission screen gives you lag, If you manage to get out of the Intermission screen without lag or game crash, YOU GET A COMPLETELY BLACK SCREEN. NOTHING BUT PITCH BLACK VOID. FIX THIS."
15282,good game
15283,Best multiplayer for me in my pov and i want to get mw3 so i can play mulitplayer on it :D
15284,"probably one of the better educational games i've seen, really helped my kids with basic algebra. would reccomend to all parents."
15285,"YOU run
YOU get a kill
YOU die"
15286,Top of the Top multigame of all time.... instead with big shit failure of black ops III....
15287,its a fast past shoter game like all the other cods
15288,I've played every call of duty there is and this one rules them all. Everything about the game is fantastic it's got a great story with memorable characters and missions as well as a Hollywood soundtrack.
15289,"was fun playing this game some years ago...
now it's dead

TDM is kinda fun if you like playing it and if you find a game that isn't hacked and/or Domination

Search and Destroy is totally dead. You almost only find games with quickscope douchebags kicking you if you play normal -.-

that one DLC I got has 2 maps I actually like but when activating the DLC you find less games (sometimes not even a single one)

do I recommend this game? nope
will you buy it anyway because it's CoD? of course

the quickscoping kiddies got butthurt and disliked the review xD


the spec ops missions are kinda cool"
15290,DECENT!!!!! as bubbles would say
15291,Mw2 had not play with any hacker so it good it low ram it a good shooter game
15292,You must buy this game before you buy MW3
15293,"It's a really fun game, but there's a lot of noob tubers."
15294,Probably my Favorite COD in the francise.
15295,best mmo fps game on mac
15296,It's aight
15297,FRICKIN AWESOME THERE IS THE OCCOSAIONAL HACKER BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IT IS PRESUMED TO BE!!!! GREAT FLIPP'IN GAME
15298,do not buy this game after you play for a while the game will not run and i will not get of you desc top dont wast your money
15299,Noice
15300,cod ist ein hurensohn 10/10
15301,gud shet niega
15302,so far everyone has said there are a bunch of hackers. ill be saying how thats bs. i havent gotten into a single lobby with a hacker only problem with this game is not many people play it so most gamemodes are useless and other downside is youll meet atleast someone in each game that uses a noobtube and it can get out of hand usually. but im glad i bought this game.
15303,"Livestreamed this game and really had a lot of fun playing it. Getting kills with the guns is fairly easy, but trying to get some headshots require some skill and skins being locked behind reaching a certain headshot threshold makes getting skins pretty hard. I would like to see that these skins be accessed by reaching a certain kill threshold instead of getting a certain amount of headshots, but the devs kind of stopped developing this game a looooooooooooooooooooooooooong time ago. But, if you're into old games like me, this game is something you should buy. Hopefully, some of the people working on MW2R will revisit the Steam reviews to see what could be added or changed in this game. But, all-in-all get this game.

I used to stream this game, but I think I still have the VODs and couple of videos uploaded on my channel. Feel free to stop on by and take a look. I ain't gonna force you to subscribe, but if you like what you see, go on ahead.

15304,best cod
15305,"For me this part of Call of Duty is the best, i love this game its a classic from COD series! Also the multiplayer is still awesome and many players are still playing, bad thing is hackers like in every god damn game."
15306,yaaaa
15307,GG
15308,"Admit it.
You jizzed yourself when you found out you go to shoot up an airport."
15309,I remember playing this game when i was younger... and its stel fucccking funny! :D <3
15310,"11/10 for Captain Price who is in every single Call of duty , but still charming :)"
15311,2nd Best FPS Multiplayer I Have Ever Played
15312,Love the game. Not as many 420xXxBlazexXxItxXxH4ck3rZsxXx
15313,"Sequel to one o my favorite games, and this as falls into my faves, the storyline s awesome, DLC's look awesome an are awesome. Well, this is my personal opinion. But ask me if would recommend it?... sheeeeeeiiiiiit.... Hell yes!!!
"
15314,Not a bad game ;)
15315,"Was such a fun game, both in singleplayer and multiplayer, despite it's port shortcomings. 

With every failed instalment of Call of Duty, you reminisce back to this game, or it's prequel, wishing or hoping that they'd get it right again some day."
15316,epic ONE
15317,Best Call of Duty
15318,For Zakhaev
15319,Easily the best CoD
15320,Literally the best COD ever made. Dont @ me
15321,Yes Yes Very Good Very Good!
15322,"Replayable. Repeat, replayable! The first CoD I've ever played and since then it has worked like drugs."
15323,"The best
"
15324,A very fun game. You don't really lag in this game!
15325,"Although it isn't as good as the stellar CoD4, I still enjoyed MW2 immensely. And, in my opinion, it is the last good entry in the series."
15326,"The best COD amongst all in my opinion but the PC version lacks many features in comparison to PS3/360 versions:

- Full controller support.
- 2 local player Special Ops using split screen.
- 4 local Multiplayer using split screen.

Call of Duty is, problably, the most expensive franchise ever. Many companies updated their games to the new demand and Activision didn't. Activision say that these updates in PC have many technical difficulties, come on...

I'm hopeless about a major update in COD:MW2, so I don't recommend this game because the high prize of this game (even on sale!) doesn't represent the real quality of the game (with respect to PS3/360)."
15327,Excellent game :D !
15328,Good game .Well played
15329,Too Many Modders! :( BUT FUN!
15330,Not bad.
15331,Very good started playing and instantly was put into a match with a bunch of FaZe members who taught me how to setup trickshot I'm now the co leader of OpTic  Rain good game overall
15332,‚ô• Captain Price & Soap
15333,Can't play with my friends online because of a bug. (which will never be fixed)
15334,Every online match I played ended with a little kid jumping from an inaccessable (almost) area and 360 no-scoping someones ass. 10/10 would play with this child again.

15338,"It's a good follow up to the first Modern Warfare (speaking strictly of the single player campaign), however it is definitely way more hell bent on shoving little toys in your face than the former. Still, the gunplay is smooth and the story is fun, there however isn't quite as much shock and awe at the first one.

A good buy on sale."
15339,Yes
15340,"Good game, nothing more and nothing less for a cash-cow franchise."
15341,This game is worth in my opinion the multiplayer is great no hackers that will fuck your experience

15349,"Still a populated community so don't worry about not finding a game because you will.

15354,"All of these are rated on a scale of 1-10, 10 being best and 1 being worst.
Game play: 9/10 The gunplay is great and smooth as usual. 
Graphics: 7/10 Decent for now, good for it's time.
Story: 8/10 You're back as Soap with the old team, as you find yourself in different combat areas and a huge variety of fun.
Multiplayer Experience: 3/10 Hackers, hackers everywhere. Steer clear unless you find a dedicated server with good admins.
Single player Experience: 9/10 Fun as I've said before. Big scripted set pieces as usual in the COD games. Good fun. You can get a bots mod and it really enhances the experience since all multiplayer rooms and servers pretty much suck.
Overall (Average): 7.3/10 It was a good game but time hasn't been well to the multiplayer experience to this game. If you have friends in a big lan party  then give it a shot. 
"
15355,"The best Call of Duty out there. As of 2015 there's still 300+ people playing the multiplayer, which should say something about its quality."
15356,"Multiplayer is completely unaviable due to lack of players.
This is caused by publishers or developers bad decisions regarding game servers.
"
15357,Nice game
15358,"Very good,i love this game"
15359,"Played around 90 hours on multiplayer, and haven't come across a single hacker, hacked lobby, or aimbot yet"
15360,"Great Campaign story. Multiplayer is decent. But the community is insanely toxic. You get attacked for doing basically anything. I got hit offline for using a certain attachment, and I get told to get cancer for using a certain gun. It can be hard to find a match depending on the game mode you're searching for. Occasionally there are hackers. Overall I'd give the game an 8.5/10 if it weren't for the toxic community."
15361,So nostalgic </3
15362,"Don't buy this game, it is filled with hackers and is just not fun to play anymore. Get it on Xbox360 or PS3 to have a hacker free experience."
15363,"Got to agree, this is the best 2nd best call of duty game. It's really well done

PROS:

Story mode. The sequel really takes the cake realy great job Infinity Ward. 10/10

Memorable missions

Multiplayer Was A Blast. God. Damn. I had so much fun in this game in multiplayer and was GREAT. 

Memorable characters

Best weapons out of all Call of Duty games, even the future games. You have ak47, famas, scar-h, UMP, MP, glock, deagle and pretty much every famous modern weapons. I wish new CoD had weapons like this. And then Modern Warfare 2019 finally have most of these weapons. But most importantly the BEST rifle in all of video games and iconic ACR. No other COD games have it.

The ""No Russian"" Controversy. I don't know why pus sies are insulted because of some one mission in a fictional VIDEO GAME. You have GTA and Hatred and other games where you optionally or have to kill civilians. It's a shame that the triple A developers nowadays have to tone it down.

Soundtracks


CONS:

No updates


9/10

I recommend for singleplayer. If for multiplayer, most lobbies are hacked so gl."
15364,CoD is great CoD is nice!
15365,"Great game back in the day(Review doesnt show it but I have approx. 600 hours on multiplayer), is now a ghost town and run by hackers. Get it on console, you can get a pre-owned copy for less than 3 pounds, has *way* more players on it and less hacker while this still costs 20 pounds.

On a side note, the single player visuals hold up extremely well."
15366,"It's a really good game, plently of action. Funny enough 'Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 - Multiplayer' is even better. I'll give this an 8/10."
15367,"It's a really good game, plently of action. Funny enough 'Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 - Multiplayer' is even better. I'll give this an 8/10."
15368,yews my favorit game :))
15369,it's good
15370,i wish the servers were not made of used nails
15371,"I really like the campain series of Call Of Duty (Haven't tried all yet..) But the multiplayer is also quite fun. Only downside is that it is an older game, and that it is quite common to find hackers or exploiters. Fun overall."
15372,"Storyline- good
multiplayer-..... HACKS!? na I will not play multiplayer
though mw2 was good :)"
15373,"good game
"
15374,"best single player in call of duty, pulling a knife out of your chest most realistic shit ive ever seen +210
multiplayer- got shot with a guy using duel wield shotguns using final stand and a riot shield +210
420/420 would rage again"
15375,Still the best cod
15376,I downloded the game 4 times and restarted it 7 and I still cant play the damn game I expected more from Call of duty I will not recommend this game to anyone.
15377,"My favorite Call of Duty game in the franchise. Love everything about it, just wish the multiplayer was more active, with less hackers."
15378,"Awesome game, I really love it. Everything about it  i honestly like it. Music, Story Characters, Etc..


Not even bother thinking it's on my top 10 favorite games."
15379,Why Cant you use a contoller they need to make it where you can like MW
15380,great
15381,GAME OF THE YEAR 2667

15383,"Very fun game to play. Even though it is from 2013, a lot of people still play multiplayer. This was overall a good buy, I recommend this to everyone."
15384,"epic
"
15385,"The best one of COD series. The story is wonderful and multiplayer is full of energy, adrenaline and more!"
15386,"R.I.P. MW2. Great while it lasted.

Singleplayer 5/10
Multiplayer 10/10"
15387,Nice
15388,Worse in every way compared to its predecessor.
15389,"It was a great game in its time, but it has been ruined over the years by the rise of hackers appearing everywhere. I had the game for not even an hour, and I was hacked to level 70. I didnt want that at all, it takes the fun of the multiplayer away from me. Hacked lobbies are too common, and hackers will be found with access to all care packages(unlimited amounts of them), god mode, and unlimited ammo. Now, the story is still great dont get me wrong. But if you came here for the multiplayer I must warn you its not what it used to be. Buy only if you want the story."
15390,"Still has a big community after 6 Years 
Multiplayer is gud
thats all i gotta say 
i r8 8/8"
15391,"why the fuck cant i run multiplayer?
"
15392,"Still no favela retured for the PC players and VAC was removed because so few players playing the game. In reality everyone is at liberation mods which allow custom servers (including favela) 

I would love to rate up this piece of legend but it's not worth it anymore."
15393,dated but still fun
15394,Perfect!

Can't really play any other game mode then team death match and FFA do to lack of people. But hey at least I don't have to watch me hit marker a guy with half a clip before killing them. 
(CoD BO3) And or not halo jumping around or have to unlock stuff even after leveling up."

15410,"At this point in MW2's lifespan I would advise you not to buy this game, due to its extriemly small player base. The only way I could recomend this to someone is if they're a die hard fan of this game. P.S. there are only 300-400 people in the game at a time from what I've seen."
15411,best game of all time

15417,Great game!
15418,"IMO - Other than CoD: 4 Modern Warfare, this is the best Call of duty game.  I really loved the multiplayer, the single player was also very good.  All around a pretty good game.  

Pros:
- Guns are awesome, customization is also great. 
- Balanced game, all the guns, maps are very well balanced out.
-  Multiple game modes keep it intresting, between hardcore and regular modes with search and destroy, etc.  
- Singleplayer is good but not over the top as future releases are.
- Graphics and sound are brilliant.

Cons:
- Became saturated with hacks after awhile and multiplayer is non existant  now.
- Some guns and perks are too overpowered."

15499,"With nearly a thousand hours played in Singleplayer and Multiplayer it makes me sad to give this a negative review now. I loved this game. I used to play this all f****n day long after school with my friends and even made new friends. 

It used to be the best game I ever played but now it's literally dead except for hackers, campers and ofcourse trolls.
To bad that the newer games don't give the same feeling like this one did. I guess it's time to say goodbye and finally uninstall it.

May my memory of this game stay always in my mind and the pure joy that I felt, shall stay in my heart.
RIP </3"
15500,"Hackers, hacked lobbies, max level hackers and lobbies, hacks hacks hacks VAC ban bypass,"
15501,"Hans Zimmer's music makes this game feel more like an overly epic movie with a storyline you must not miss !!
The game's story, the plot twist, the music that gives you goosebumps make it one of the Call of Duty's you don't need to feel bad about purchasing it =)
The only a bit maybe more negative thing about this game is the multiplayer full of underaged racists that will drag you into an argument mostly relating to your mom or your penis size whether you're a guy or not. I myself got VAC banned (Thank god I can still play COOP) for playing this game with bots that the multiplayer doesn't have to offer but whatever..
Overall, I recommend this game, and say it is fun to play ! =)"
15502,nice game only a few bugs and bad physics that make this game unfair some times but its good over all

Fast flowing, classic CoD with a fantastic campain. Recommened it to anyone if you are a CoD fan or if you want a brilliant FPS game to start playing."

15513,Sadly the few people who still play this game spam noobtubes with one man army. Its litterally unplayable at the moment. I reccomend getting RepZ or IW4Play if you want to play miltiplayer and not rip your hair out after 5 minutes.
15514,Verry good fun entertaining game.

15519,The Best Call Of Duty :D
15520,"Yes I had this game on 0-day this game is very good

it's good for slow PCs

Try it out and play Search and Destroy."
15521,Best call of duty ever IMO
15522,This game has some lag and limited players left but i absolutly love MW2 ive had it for 2 days but i love it 10/10
15523,Brings back memories for sure. Haven't hit modded lobbies yet surprisingly and the campaign is great and worth the money by itself :)
15524,AWSOME GAME
15525,Good but old....
15526,"No dedicated server support in multiplayer.  Not only does this mean there is virtually no ability to play on custom user created maps (unless you play locally) but it means you get put in games with no attention to connection issues, skill level or map choice.  This one thing alone ruined it for me.  If this doesn't bother you I'd say it's a great game, all of what you'd expect from the COD series.  Haven't gotten much into the single player campaign yet but what I've played has been pretty decent."
15527,"I've played this game through twice. First veteran difficulty on Xbox 360. Then a few years later on PC, normal difficulty this time. That doesn't mean the game is so good that playing through twice was justified but I've enjoyed it both times. Especially the last 1-2 hours in the game. And the ending which is pretty good (including the credits). 

Multiplayer is still active so there is a decent chance you can have a quick match but maybe not in every mode."
15528,"Great game and brings back memories.
Woud rec buying this."
15529,crashing on multiplayer :(
15530,Funner than watching porno's with Ariana Grande.

15545,ok
15546,"This was the COD that blew the franchise up, let it set records and become the most revered franchise in the FPS market. This isnt becasue the game was ""good"" but instead becasue it was addictive. So really this isnt the ""best shooter ever"". Its more like the most addictive shooter ever.

Crack Cocaine out of 10, would snort this again."
15547,Very nostagic! Brilliant game play! Definitely worth a play!
15548,"I like the storyline of the game, but on my pc the subtitles are blurred and the menus are illegible. But, its a great game. :)"
15549,Im proudly say that this is the Best CoD ever.
15550,this game with no offline split screen on pc is preety much useless. console version much better with it ...

15574,Good
15575,its great shit 10/10
15576,"This is one of my favorite games.  I poured so much of my time as a teen playing this game, and I'll always have fond memories of it.  Although, can I recommend it now?  I'm not sure.  The problems I have with this game could honestly keep some of you from wanting to purchase it, and it also doesn't help that Activision KNOWS this game is not worth $20 anymore, it's worth maybe 5 or less on a sale.  

PROS:
-Fun singleplayer (not the best, but fun)
-Spec Ops is great as well, super fun co-op missions with a lot of variety
-Multiplayer, at it's core, is fantastic.  

CONS: 
-Again, the cost of the game.  I've purchased this game twice in my life, and I'm not too sure why besides nostalgic reasons.
-Grenades.  This killed the game back then, and it mutilates it now.  I can't go into a lobby without multiple people abusing the ""One Man Army Danger Close"" class.  It's honestly one of the most broken aspects of a video game I've ever experienced, and this game is almost six years old, so no way is it going to get fixed.
-Toxic community.  Of course this is COD and there are a lot of young, immature people.  Back in the days of console, I'd just mute everyone.  Now, I can't get rid of the sidebar chat.  Sure, it's not nearly as bad as annoying voice chat, but it's pretty bad either way.
-Lack of players.  Few people play this game anymore, and as a result, most of the game modes besides TDM & Free For All are dead.  I'd love to play Hardcore SnD, but that's not possible anymore.

Honestly, the purchase is up to you.  Just know that this game will never get any better than where it is at now."
15577,"Good game one of the best Call od Dutys of all time.
If you don't but this game you WILL GO TO HELL."
15578,Good Game.. !
15579,The game is a fun experiance in my oppinion.
15580,"Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Stopping teenage pregnancies since 2009."
15581,"Bought the game, black and green letters and numbers start scrambling around. I'm very confused until an image of Captain Price is made. He grabbed me by the neck and told me ""Welcome back, it's time to relive your childhood Soap"". 

Very satisfied with my experience

10/10 Would hallucinate again"
15582,great game
15583,"I do not like games with such repetitive gameplay.
Here, the objective is ‚Äòrun, shoot, reload‚Äô, nothing left to strategy, imagination. Stealth missions are nearly non-existent.
If you are the fan of the franchise, you defintely should buy it, but other people would do better without playing this game."

Multiplayer: YES / Included

15590,"Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 is a famous FPS game (obviously), as many players said, it has an explosive story, probably the best story among the whole COD series. Starting from Ellen who was trying to stop Makarov secretly, after several events, to Soap and Price who were trying to kill General Shepherd to stop him from realizing his plan of defeating the Russian Army in order to make U.S.A regain its violent 'reputation'.

The game did give us a brand new experience on its graphics and new equipment in multiplayer mode, as well as the new cooperative mode ‚Äì Special Ops in which you can play against several waves of bots either alone or with other players, this is quite challenging when you arrive at a high number of waves.

I found this game's story really moving. It is one of the highlights of the COD series, this one was surely the game of the year and I definitely recommend this game to all the COD fans.

Positive remarks 
+EXPLOSIVE storyline
+new equipment 
+brand new graphics (at that time)
+new cooperative mode Special Ops

Negative remarks 
-Not many players are playing this anymore."

15600,"[10/10] Had 2000+ hours, wanted to relevel prestige for fun, lost the hours. Am at 1400+ again.

There is hardly any swearing. There are hardly any hacks. If you show respect, you will get it back. There is a strong yet small remaining community in MW2. Many good players get called hacker too often, but it does not matter to us. It's a compliment that maybe you'll eventually even work for."
15601,"Best CoD campaign of all time, however I do not recommend playing on veteran, not to anyone."
15602,ÿ£ÿπÿ∏ŸÖ ŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ© ÿ≠ÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©
15603,"‚ÄãI recently picked up this and Black Ops II on deep discount because I used to love the old WWII Call of Duty single-player campaigns and was in the mood for something linear and bombastic. Needless to say, it gave me both. The last CoD campaign I played was Ghosts, and that was terrible. But this one wasn't bad. It has some good set pieces, especially getting to fight on American soil as the underdog. I didn't even bother with multiplayer. If there's anyone still playing it six years later, they're likely much too good for me anyway. I won't be your lamb to the slaughter! It's short (barely 6 hours), linear as hell, but with a decent enough story and some decent actors (who doesn't love Lance Henriksen?). It satisfied the itch. Now on to better things."
15604,GOOD GAME
15605,"The only good thing in this game is the campaign and spacial ops but the multiplayer is infested with hackers and angry hosts that  kick you from the lobby whenever you're getting high killstreaks.

Such a shame since this game is so nostalgic and fun (yet unbalanced) multiplayer game."
15606,"Still a pretty good game, worth playing, quickscope is still the best"

15609,Server browser is needed.
15610,"if aids could be contracted via video games, this game would be the main host for the disease. If youre thinking about playing this game in this day and age, save yourself from losing a few years of your life due to stress from noobtubers, knifers,, painkiller, and just plain douchebag players. Pretty much anyone left playing this game is a huge asshole who's main objective is to ruin other people's experiences of what could have been a great game. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something that causes enjoyment more than frustration."
15611,"A game where you go around and knife people, while they attempt to shoot you. You laugh, as their bullets miss, and when they do hit, they feel like jello against your mutant skin, and you quickly regenerate any damage that you may have received. People get angry, they call you a hacker, but you tell them that your hacks are just too good. 10/10 would be called a hacker/camper for knifing again."
15612,"Undoubtedly exciting, lightning-paced and highly skill-testing shooter with fabulous, atmospheric maps. yet certainly lacks the depth and satisfying realism of the truly great military multiplayer shooters such as Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm. Other criticisms would include it's adverse discrimination against newer players by making things harder for them than veterans. Notwithstanding, Modern Warfare 2 is adrenaline-filled without a doubt."

15620,"Single Player:  

Pros:

Simple. Clean. Fun.
Fun missions that are well designed and complex.
Game mechanics are an improvement compared to COD 4.

Cons:

Terrible Storyline.
Get's boring. I can only play it for like 45 minutes in one sitting until I get bored out of my mind.


Multiplayer: Just terrible frankly, almost no one plays it anymore and the ones that do are all hackers. No point in playing it.

Conclusion: Decent game, but you're probably better off playing a different COD, such as Black Ops or any of the more recent ones (Ghosts, Advanced Warfare), or waiting for BO3 which looks pretty damn good.

Overall - 6.5/10"

15624,Regret simulator.
15625,Best cod ever
15626,"Great Game
"
15627,"Ahhh MW2. The memories. This is great if you just want to shoot people. The problem is, the other people. There are hundreds of hackers in this game, and they are quite easy to come across. There are fixes, but if you are willing to take the risk of just going straight to rank 70, go for it."
15628,"It's a decent game with a fair number of players, the game really shines in playing 1v1 with a friend and in playing online with strangers. The story missions are crap, and dont really provide training for the multiplayer very well but at the very least it lets you get a basic feel for the game. All in all, not a bad game for the price, but dont bother getting the extra content, you can just mod it in."
15629,the game is k
15630,"Makarov thought he saw a Ghost.

He got spooked and dropped the Soap.

He soon paid the Price..."
15631,Great game. Quickscope for days.
15632,"took me 100h and 5000kills to get to level 70, was definitely worth the time"
15633,"really good game , just not many people playing it on PC :/"
15634,"More campers than Ghosts. 
Ghosts is still considered to be the most camper friendly title."
15635,10/10 would have no russian again.

15640,"Not just one of the best FPS games to come out, but one of the best videogames to come into existance! Activision started to loose their way after this game..it's pretty sad, knowing that this aging game is still on par with games even today. 11/10"

15649,MW2 is the all time best CoD!
15650,Very good!
15651,"WARNING!!! If you join a XP Lobby, you will be VAC banned according to many people. The game is pretty good though."
15652,"This was the last good Call of Duty in my opinion! The main game is a kinda dead sadly... but if you install RepZ, which is a custom client that adds Theater Mode/Ingame Class Editing and added weapons ranging from most Call of Duty's. They even added Nuketown.

I'd say get this!"
15653,"Stressful and far too difficult. This game is for 'game jocks' on every level other than recruit.
Unending waves of bad guys in the favelas is unrealistic. Mandatory killing of innocents in the airport is grotesque.
I have to wonder about the humanity of the game developers."
15654,"how boring can this game be? no one moves around, everyones sits in a corner waiting what a waste of time"

15660,"This is one of the last good call of duty games, and its pretty fun still"
15661,Not bad
15662,"At first I was resistant to the switch from dedicated servers to peer hosting (don't get me wrong, the latency advantage is a real thing, and sucks if you are not hosting), but the lobby system grew on me and I came to love the rolling sessions and opportunity to make friends with a small group of people instead of being a nameless avatar lost in a 40 person MW server. Overall my favorite call of duty game. It's fast, clean, and runs well on most hardware."

15678,Good game and fun to mod on.
15679,i LOVE ths Game and so Cool
15680,i rate it good because the hackers have seemed to cool down so there are aculty normal games without hacking
15681,Best Game ever played!
15682,"My Fav CoD game next to CoD 4 and WaW, it has a nice multiplayer, a predictable singleplayer however. (mediocre imo)
The MP Beats any of the new ones which are shitty, and advanced warfare doesn't keep it classic at all. I Played this game in 2009 when it first came out, and i still continue to play it some times it's a great game minus the noob toobers and campers lol"
15683,"A step up in CoD games. Quick and exciting online gamelpay. 
Probably, in context, the best CoD release."
15684,I love this game who doesnt classic 420 Scoping and kids saying i fucked yo moma
15685,"I still get called a hacker in 2018. Amazing game, this is the only good Call of Duty multiplayer

Also this is anecdotal but I personally haven't seen any hackers in ~40 hours of playtime so the problem isn't as pervasive as people make it seem"
15686,its not working
15687,"If you're buying this for the campaign i would recommend it. If you're buying this for the multiplayer on the other hand... i don't recommend it. I've played the multiplayer for around an hour, but from what i could tell... It was completely dead. It doesn't have any hackers that i can see of. The campaign on the other hand is very dynamic and short. MW3 has a much longer campaign than this one. 8/10."
15688,"Love this game, great SP and MP, where I spent a lot of time, trickshoting, killin some retards. If there's a promo or you already finished the COD4: MW- go buy it."
15689,"doesnt work on windows 10 ! , used to love playing this on win 7 .
now that i upgraded my OS ot doesnt work anymore , the game doesnt even start , just opens up a blank screen .
word of warning before you buy."
15690,best multipayer i ever played in my life
15691,"Re-writing my review. As the COD series is on sale right now hopefully some of you will read this before buying MW2. Back when it first came out I gave it a positive review. Unfortuantely, over the years this game has become not only less and less fun, but now, hackerfield. Hackers everywhere. I recently re-installed this game about two months ago to play with some buddies of mine because they were playing. I literally played less than 3 mintues and then uninstalled. Simply because, #1. It was boring. and #2. HACKERS. Oh my gosh. Modded/hacked lobbies and tons of players with hacks, i.e. aimbots, etc. Please, please, please do not buy this game. Save your hard earned money."
15692,It gave me an endless blow job. It was not fun. It had braces.
15693,bang ok
15694,best cod of all time
15695,not laggy on a shitty computer 10/10 ign

15709,"Best Call of Duty, after black ops 1 it got worse."
15710,"Singleplayer: It's really rare nowadays to find a modern shooter campaign that isn't just ""shoot and spit on anyone who's not white.""  Sure this one takes a sharp turn onto Hollywood Effects Lane and Incoherent Storytelling Street, but it's definitely not bad, and at least it actually tries not to be racist.

Multiplayer: I ended a round with a 360 dropshot noscope and everyone yelling at the killcam.  Then I returned to the lobby to find that I had been hacked up to Lv70.  10/10."
15711,Best Call Of Duty game ever!
15712,Heard they remove Favela Maps because theres racist againt Moslem there ? Goodbye MW 3 wont buy it

15723,"It's an okay game? The singleplayer is pretty good, and the multiplayer is solid.

Yeah, I'd just go hit up Modern Warfare 3 or whatever instead.

15728,"It's a really good Call of Duty game ! Some hard missions but after all pretty amusing,had fun , multiplayer is even better (yes it's still alive) even tho it's filled with hackers...would reccomend it 9/10"

15752,"Fuck this.
Fuck you Fatal Error."
15753,awesome game!
15754,"As Call of Duty games get worse this one continues to get better due to comparison. Maybe when it first came out you passed over it because its CoD and nothing special but now that every game after it is shit download this http://rsebots.blogspot.ca/ and prepare to burn countless hours. 9/10 personally favorite FPS to play when im on brain shutdown mode

Edit: i think i made this review when i was 14 or 15, 22 now all those points still stand and i just finished playing the remastered edition again with the green beret intel cheat. this game really just keeps giving, now if only they remastered the spec ops...
also fuck it big 9.7/10 for the remastered guy. maybe a ten when they remaster spec ops come on guys LFG"

15762,"Too many Hacks. Probably the best Call of Duty even though old. Once in awhile you can get good games. Half of the time you get no hackers and you are able to play a good match. I still wouldn't recommend unless you know a group of individuals that love this as well you can play with. I love the matchmaking system of this, but it is also flawed. With individuals running their own custom servers they spend too much time on keeping it cheat free xD."
15763,The Goldeneye of it's generation.  It's wonderful.
15764,I love this game.
15765,"TOOOOO DAMN MANY HACKERS ( not showing off but i reached to a point that i played with no map just because i was getting my map hacked like 4 times a day and its realy frustrating repairing all the time your files and i was able to nuke many times ) but after a year the hackers just went off the charts totaly insane hacking on every game you could possiby search and as you entered theyr loby your prestiges reset to 1 and maany other frustrating tricks they got :)
Plus totaly Removing Favela without fixing its issues with the whole insulting matter that went on with the toilet and the arab scribings on the portraits i personaly payed for this game and i would like the whole package that i payed of if you get my point cus Favela is still out of the search lists....u just got to set up your own game there and lets face it this game is to enter it and kill some people ( see the perks like comando = fast and slash not w8 for every1 to log on make the party and all that u just want to go online join search find game and PLAY the game not setting up the whole grid for a decent favela...."
15766,like
15767,that is a good game
15768,"As of now (I'm sure it's not as of now, now) the game is pretty much worthless to play.
Hackers everywhere and it's just simply not worth the hassle to find a server without hackers.
It was a great game back in the day but if you want a CoD either buy BOII or any of the more recent CoDs, whichever you prefer."
15769,Nice game but too many hackers

15782,"I am okay with cheaters in my game, but if they are a horrible host there is something wrong with their ethics. I was in a game with one of those cheaters, decided to make everything fast without my consent. I asked him ""I want to play in a vanilla standing"" and he listened to me. Made everything normal. He was the best host I encountered too. The cheater chose only fun maps and didn't mess with our games after I requested him not to. The fact that cheaters can easily exploit due to the fact they practicly own the server when hosting makes it very vulnerable for cheaters, not to mention bad connection. I mention good cheaters that do not impact your experience negativly but those cheaters whom beat the game with their cheats is annoying, sometimes their cheats are shown in the killcam which is funny yet rediculous. I don't really like this game, p[layed it to remember the thrills of my 5th grade life. I remember having a friend over and we would be on split-screen Rust just quick-scoping for like 2hrs. I recommend it because it is slightly playable, like it was 6 years ago."

15807,"[h1] Modern warfare to the next level [/h1] 


As the sequel of one of the best shooters of 2006/2007 (COD Modern Warfare), Modern Warfare 2 takes on the challenge to continue the story where it left off, while improving on the fundamentals of a decade long franchise.

[b] The world is on the brink of war [/b]

While in the first MW, the team led by the emblematic captain Price managed to take down Zakhaiev and his plot to overtake Russia and start a new world war, it didn't help to make the world a safer place.

When ultranationalists in Russia uses the fallen terrorist as a nation emblem, it is again up to a handful of Tier one soldiers to stop a new threat that could lead to another world war.

[b] Same thing but better [/b]

MW2 is not a revolution for the franchise but what it does, it does it well. The story plot is easy to follow, and let's be honest here, very much in line with what you would expect from a blockbuster action movie, with a few plot twists here and there that makes the campaign quite fun to complete.

The gameplay remains simplistic, with no bullet drop or the like, but rather focuses on bringing a lot of action in a relatively fun way for the player.
A nice improvement compared to the first opus is the removal of the inifnite spawn for the ennemies, which allows you to progress carefully if you choose to do so.

The type of missions are somewhat a bit less diversified than in the first game, and I felt that most of them were lacking a bit of personality. There are of course some nice moments, and the game takes you to quite different landscapes, from Afghanistan to Brazil or Kazakhstan, and even to the US.

[b] Guns, a lot of guns [/b]

The game being a FPS, the gun selection is critical to keep it entertaining for all. And here, you will be pleased to know that you will find most of the modern arsenal available to a Tier-one warfighter, from pistols to launchers.

The games doesn't allow you to choose your load-out but you can pick freely any weapon from a fallen ennemy.

[b] The world is a bit nicer [/b]

Graphically speaking, the game runs on the same engine than the first MW, with some minor additions here and there, meaning that in 2020, it starts to feel quite outdated of cours,e but still remains nice for the eyes. Obviously, don't expect something close to the remaster.

[b] Spec ops [/b]

The big novelty of MW2 is the introduction of the Spec Ops mod, which is basically a collection of several missions in which different goals are set. Some are fun while some at the later levels can be very hard and frustrating. The good news being that you can play in co-op, which makes them way more doable than solo (some of them require you to have another player). This extends the fun of the game for another 5-10 hours before completion.

[b] Multi [/b]

I dind't play the multi part of the game, and by now, I guess it's pretty much dead. Better try your luck with the multi of MW 2019.

[b] Pull the trigger! [/b]

I would definetely recommend this game to any FPS fan looking for a nice shooter in the modern days. I mean, at this point, this game is a classic.

There is obviously the decision of buying the original or the remaster, and here, in my opinion, it is a question of platform. If you are a Steam fan, and doesn't want to bother with Battlenet, then buy the original version. You can get it for a good price on sale, but of course, it won't sport the goodies of the remaster version.

Otherwise, the remaster version would be a nice choice for anyone looking to discover this cult game."
15808,"Why this is one of the only CoD games that truly deserve your time and money: For the first time in the Call of Duty series, the infamous veteran mode is actually a fair challenge. Enemy placement is rational, said enemies are no longer just aimbots with brain damage, and they no longer endlessly respawn. The visuals (at least for the time) are impressive. Especially the character models. 
There are some great over the top moments to experience during the campaign. You'll fly over a mountain on a snow mobile, chase the enemy down the rapids in a speedboat, and of course; listen to Prisoner 627's suicide run speech towards the end of the game. An awesome bit of sillyness.

Whilst not dragging the game down too much, the multi-player side is, unfortunately, a different story. Unlike CoD4, there are no dedicated servers, so matches suffer from bad lag spikes, and good luck finding anyone playing outside of team deathmatch and free for all. Spec Ops is the better option. This mode allows you to play an alternative version of select single player missions from both Modern Warfare, and Modern Warfare 2. Either solo or with a friend. My personal favourite is Hidden. A co-op version of the Chernobyl mission from CoD4.

This is the last Call of Duty title (with the exception of maybe Black Ops 2) that actually tried to evolve the franchise above the level of an interactive movie. Definitely gets my recommendation."

15812,"Sweet game. This and Call of Duty 4 are probably my favorite Call of Duty games. The story is really cool and the graphics are not to bad for its time, and it brings some cool features into the game which I really like :) This is a ""Must have"" game.

Even in 2018, I can still find matches quicker than in any other Call of Duty. It has modders but doesn't ruin the gameplay too much. Co-Op is great with friends too."
15813,"Don't buy this game. It's full of hackers (that won't ever get banned). You'll be extremely lucky if you play a normal match. The nostalgia is good and all, but definitely not worth to spend that much money on it right now."

15815,"This was A GOOD!!!!!! game only CON

HACKERS ON MULTIPLAYER"
15816,"DO NOT BUY FOR THE MULTIPLAYER! Because it's full with hackers!

Story is good, acceptable graphics. Fun COOP"

15821,"[h1]FALLENV3GAS Reviews Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 | ""Remember, no controversy.""[/h1]
[b]7.1[/b] Hours to Complete

‚ñ∫ [b]/TL;DR/[/b] 
(The first game I played on my Xbox 360 so slightly biased). The best singleplayer and coop in a cod game to date. When the game did have innovation and not trying to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• your wallets.

[b]In depth...[/b]

‚ñ∫ [b]/PERFORMANCE/[/b] 
As you could expect good. Solid 60 fps and looks great. Nothing more to say it will run on a lot different setups.

‚ñ∫ [b]/GRAPHICS/[/b] 
Good even now. Textures in places are weak which considering its linear they could do a better job of hiding.... It‚Äôs got a more of a realistic look with a whole colour palette to choose from than what other games in the franchise use; MW3 grey colour palette and Black Op 2 orange colour palette). Why they don‚Äôt vary colours is beyond me but at least this game does not. 

‚ñ∫ [b]/GAMEPLAY/[/b] 
Good. Guns actually have recoil, good punch through and feel military grade. Movement is also quite slick. Equipment as well as a selection of combat scenarios that vary up. Stealth sections are instant fail sections (for the most part) and if you‚Äôre good enough you can get through them loud. Less hand holding in this game. Feels more open and free though the odd corridor does loom over you from time to time but that‚Äôs expected. 

‚ñ∫ [b]/REPLAYABILITY/[/b] 
From the campaign there are some missions that you will want to play again as they were unique (Enemy Of My Enemy), just plain awesome (Cliff hanger) or just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up (No Russian). Spec Ops also has a range of mission modes to cater to different playstyles and different challenges. Get to Echo set of missions to know what I mean. And best of all try to collect 69 stars.

‚ñ∫ [b]/CONCLUSION/[/b]
If you can‚Äôt tell this game is great for a reason. Cod at its peak when it was not rushed, lacked innovation and climbing over each other to take more money from you. Multiplayer is filled with hackers which is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but singleplayer and spec ops make up for this and are worth for a great purchase.

15822,Shit game
15823,"I really like this game but the hackers are frequently prejudicing this game. I think this game should have a better security and a better connection to the servers. Like every FPS has the campers and the guys using grenade launcher,it really let me angry. Sometimes the players let the game worse.

8/10"
15824,Welcome to Call Of Duty: Hacker Warefare 2
15825,lol wat.
15826,"Singleplayer 4/10
Multiplayer   9/10 

Singleplayer is too short and not interesting like in all CoD-games.

One of best multiplayers in Cod NEW-history(since Cod4).
Tubers Ump and hakcers suck but lets consider u got a game wihtout these you have an awesome game"
15827,"This is the best game that i have ever played.  If you haven't gotten it yet, it is worth the buy."
15828,"It's call of duty....
11/10 would get fucked by nukes again."
15829,it is so cool
15830,best game
15831,meehhh
15832,this game is great
15833,it was okay
15834,"I'll be the first to admit that this is hands down my favorite game of all time. Not only because I get enjoyment out of it now, but from all the memories I have of it from Xbox 360 back in 2010. With over 1k+ hours on Xbox and another 292+ hours on my other Steam account this game is timeless to me. Although there are some cheaters who take advantage of the game from time to time, I manage to find a good, clean lobby very often. 

Along with awesome Multiplayer this game has a spectacular Campaign and very fun Spec-Ops missions to play with friends.

Call of Duty in general holds a soft spot in my heart. But this game, as I said before, is timeless. 10/10."
15835,"Love The Series of COD :D

11/10"
15836,i loved the game. just wish i could get my vacban lifted :/ 300+hours is alot to lose for maybe 2 games of aimbots
15837,"Nice game,but a lot off hackers"
15838,"Probably the last good CoD. Great MP. Great maps. Great single player.  But this game has no more support so it has a lot of hacked lobbies etc. This game has very good graphic even it was made in 2009. Great optimalization so you can run it on older PC like me. Yeah buy it, it worth it =)"
15839,"very good
"
15840,its too good
15841,One of the best games I ever played
15842,"One of my favourite games of all time, brilliant and fun memories.
I will definitely never forget my time on this game :]

10/10"
15843,i like this game and have playd if sinse it came out
15844,"First of all, this first person shotter gamer has everything you need .
Want a good gameplay of campaing? Get MW2!
Want an awesome multiplayer gameplay with lots of gamemodes, maps, guns to get and customize your class with the best atachments out there? Get MW2!
Wana have fun with friends? Get MW2!
Want awesome first person shooter games? Get MW2!

I can answer your MW2 questions if you are planning buying it just add me on Steam, ill accept it right away.
Enjoy.
"
15845,"This is brilliant! The story is amazing, the gameplay is awesome and the music fits perfectly. Will definitely play again."
15846,What a classic... The only bad side is no controller support.
15847,This is last Call of Duty game that was made in the time period of when the franchise was actualy respected.
15848,One of the most classic games of all time!
15849,what are you doing BUY THE GAME
15850,no t√§√§ on t√§mm√∂nen 5/10 r√§iskint√§paska ja autismitehas
15851,"Hackers Galore it is not a Shitty Call of duty pc port without A hacker in your lobby this game is full of them also what is call of duty game without the campers,the hardscopers, And my Fav The person that calls you a noob for using a good weapon on him or using a flashbang or some shit like that you know what? Fuck this video game I got to level 17 in under an hour because people are so bad I ranked up so many kills if you want a challange go play bo2 it is alot better"
15852,Good game.  Met a lot of great friends from this game.  I love this game but it needed some changes.  Wish things were like they use to be.
15853,"It worked fine for a long time, I upgraded to windows 10 and did not like it. I reverted to 8.1 Now it won't play. I deleted it and re installed it. Still won't work. I am sorry to see this game go, it is one of my favorites.."
15854,gave me hax
15855,its ok...barely played it
15856,"The lack of dedicated servers really hurts the game, if you get into a hacked lobby you'll get VAC banned, plus nobody plays it, if you plan to buy this, please don't; if you are doing it for ""da ztory"", just get another shooty game with a good story (may I recommend Bioshock Infinite?).

tl;dr fon't buy this, ever."
15857,"It's 'OK'. But honestly, no self respecting person should really be purchasing any of this franchise anymore. They reached their climax some years ago with their original COD games. Now they're all just rehashes of the formula. Nothing new or interesting anymore."
15858,"If you grew up with 80's and 90's Action movies
You'll love this game"
15859,Has been Banned 10/10  would Hack again :D
15860,10/10 would get banned again.
15861,"Dont buy to play with  friends , doesnt work"
15862,"Honestly, the best cod. People say theres too many hacks but i find tons more modders on ps3 than pc. so this game is just pure fun. awesome campaign, hour-wasting multiplayer. buy it."
15863,"Best COD available, even now - particularly the campaign, though has my favourite MP."
15864,"This is where Call of Duty began its long decline.
Single player (as most of the game in this series) is good and fascinating and multiplayer HAD its good moments (TDM and S&D) but the matchmaking system is really bad.
As soon as Black Ops got released this game pretty much died and survives only with hackers dominating servers.
I would buy this game now only for <10‚Ç¨ for its single player part (if you liked Call of Duty 4, which is still largely played and the best Call of Duty ever in my opinion)"
15865,GG
15866,An awesome game!
15867,"The 3rd game i joined had a hacker that got my rank to 70 and 10th prestige, but since then. No hackers, rage awaits you in this game, so you must get good

PROS
-----------
- Very fucking fun
- The best call of duty (exepct call of duty 4 and 2)
- Just fun

CONS
----------
- Noob tube
- Campers
- Trying to get nuke rage
- Many players having better weapons than you




Now that hacking is patched i think this game will be alot of better
9.8/10 too much noob tubers"
15868,Awsome to many hackers though
15869,SO MUCH HACKERS
15870,"Seriously... This game was amazing and everybody knows it. So many people say that the modern warfare series need to be rebooted, and why not? The modern warfare series was the best multiplayer fps experience. Infinity Ward, I implore you to reboot the franchise and bring back the Call of Duty we love."
15871,Great gamplay and also a very good story
15872,Back when Activision made good Call of Duty Games
15873,good game lot of hackers tho
15874,no russian
15875,Doritos simulator 2069
15876,Still better than Advanced Warfare...
15877,10/10 Goblin Legs
15878,terrible i beat the level and the game just goes frozen and beofre you say it's my computer i literally just built this thing to other steam users can confirm that i have the recipts as well less then a month old i want a new game steam this is bull shit
15879,So bad
15880,"The multiplayer mode is insane! I think this is really good game if you don't have a really good computer, and you like first person shooter games! It has a fun story and it has a really fun fast paced multiplayer mode. The game has kind of bad graphics but it does not matter. You can play the game on your grandmothers old laptop if you want. It's a lot of hacked lobbies, and the multiplayer killstreaks can be quiet annoying. But overall

9/10"
15881,"i like this game but the private matches needs fixed you lag all the time when you join and i have good internet
"
15882,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Eat."
15883,"It's good. It's probably up there as far as best multiplayer shooters.

10/10 Infinity Ward RIP"
15884,Hmhm.
15885,10/10 The Ultimate Call Of Duty Game :)
15886,Welcome to the game of hackers... Altough I have a VAC ban on this game for changing gamemodes...!
15887,"The Modern Warfare series was the last set of COD games to have fun multiplayer and campaign. The campaign is like reading a really good book or watching an exceptional movie. You truly get attached to the characters. This game will never get old on multiplayer. It's the best multiplayer hands down in my opinion. I have an embarassing time logged on my 360 playing this game. However for PC, I would suggest getting a controller. I usually don't mind mouse and keyboard, but COD games are exceptions. Hopefully with the Steam Link coming out in November, playing the game has the feel of playing on a console."
15888,Bestes cod!
15889,best gane ever
15890,"A great game but too bad becuse only 500 and something are just playing this. Best Game I've ever purchased
"
15891,"Want to get this game for the story/ Campaign or special ops?  Go ahead, it's a great stroy and spec ops is fun

want to get it for Online?  Noooooooooooooooooooo, stay away, do not buy if you only want online, you'll be lucky if you can make it into a game that's not hacked to oblivion, that's the 7 matches that go on, in the United States at least...

*DO NOT BUY FOR MULTIPLAYER!!!!!*

[u]Singleplayer- 9.3/10
Multiplayer-2/10"
15892,"If Call of Duty stuck with this direction of games, imagine the respect they would have commended for years! Unfortunately they made futuristic games no one wanted and were mostly averaging between 45% to 60% favorability."
15893,Very fun.
15894,"In my opinion the best CoD Singleplayer. The sidemissions are really funny and on the hardest part challanging, even though you spend the most part looking at the wall you are hiding behing.

Finished it with all stars left.

The singleplayer characters are all true badass and believable, it feels ""kinda"" realistic.

This multiplayer is the only CoD Multiplayer I could play for longer times. Real fun, if you are not bothered by the kinda outraged community."
15895,Damn dude !
15896,k
15897,Everything is OP=perfect balance. gj Infinity ward
15898,"This game is one of the worts multiplayer games ever. Lots of lag, hackers, pretige hacks, bad lobby system, disconnects, hosts rage quiting, etc..."
15899,"Might fine trash talkers that think they are good but they use noob tubes.

10/10

would get toobed again"
15900,"""Games are nothing more than mere products! You examine popular market trends, churn out nearly-identical titles, and then you rake in the dough!

15901,Chicken
15902,"Great Game! Works well on both mac and pc, It has great gameplay and a good story. There is also a great working mutiplayer system! I recomend this game. I highly recommend this game!"
15903,"i have played it until the end(4 hours gameplay) and still dont know about what happend,The story is just unineristing!Usualy i love the story of cod (playerd mw1,mw3,cod bo1/2,ghost) but in this story its hard to know why their doing it,I still dont know why markarov is a good character.then the final it was unlogical and unspectacular.Multiplayer:Only hackers more i dont need to say about it.Specialforces could be good but not with no players. Overall: I wont buy it again if I had a choice."
15904,"Loads of action,explosions, rage, and 20 feet knife lunges."
15905,The baby one.
15906,I played this game for its Singleplayer mostly but Multiplayer too. The singleplayer is decent and i found a bunch of hackers  from online. But becides those two this game is actually fun. Mostly like other Call of Duty Titles but diffrent in a good way!
15907,"This game is amazing. I dont care about modders, i can always avoid them. And kind of like them, because i had an xbox 360 version, and it took a while to get to prestege, now its like i never left the game at all, and also they add more gamemodes like, gun game, prop hunt, hide and seek, and so on!"
15908,Need radar on private matche's...
15909,fuck yeah
15910,oooooomg i love this gaameeeeeeeee

15920,"Back in the day I would have suggested this game. I spent crazy hours playing Multiplayer Online. It's such a shame that the PC version multiplayer is dead now. I hear that Xbox is still alive. The single player was fun but short. Bad Company 2 was my next FPS and I enjoyed the single player more.

15925,"Call of Booty : Modern Whorefare 2.
Great single player campaign with great story line,characters and awesome gameplay,but it's rather different story for the multiplayer version. No matter how loving and caring human being you are if you play multiplayer you would turn into a racist,daemonic t**t and won't stop bitching every time. The game that would eats you alive from inside and all out. The amount of hackers is even more than population of China. Overall this multiplayer has given me a broken monitor,mouse and hate towards my fellow teammates. F**k Y*u"
15926,Extreme FUN !!!
15927,it doesnt work for me
15928,Very good game. In depth campaign and excellent maps for multiplayer.
15929,"The only COD in history to have a great campaign and a great multiplayer, and no exo suts.... good old fashioned Modern Warfare."
15930,"The games is really good but the prices of the packages
"
15931,best cod ever!
15932,this game is a combination of fun and skill
15933,"no matter how many hackers there are this game is still fun, aswell as the campaign and spec ops mode"
15934,"Stopped working after a week.
Activision gave shit support.
I wish that I bought this game AFTER Steam refunds became a thing.

The game just stopped working on my R9 280x for no reason at all one day. I recently upgraded my card and the game works again. When I wrote this review, Activision had strung me along on their Twitter support page, telling me that they would fix my issue... They provided shit advice (ex. Have you tried re-installing the game) for half a year until I eventually gave up and told them that I'd had enough of their bullshit. They should have just told me that they would not provide support for the game anymore if they weren't ready to give customers decent help."
15935,"Worst game I¬¥ve ever palyed, RIP 25‚Ç¨"
15936,LOVE THIS GAME
15937,one of the best cod's ever made
15938,I need friend for spec ops now
15939,I recommend this game
15940,Great story
15941,this needs to be controller compatible -_-
15942,"I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.

Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:

It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience. 

While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public ¬£100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.

This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned."
15943,"Single player very good, Multiplayer HACK CITY. Is terrrible, steam does not care, publisher does not care, do not get it."
15944,very goood
15945,"lul got banned cuz hax , shit game i rate 10/10"
15946,much rust
15947,it is very good but my mutiplayer dosnt work :( and cant fix it
15948,"Never has a game met so much controversy and expectations, Call of Duty raised the bar for first person shooters at the time. The fact that only until recently are they getting heat for there work makes me realize just how much of an impact this game made on the community."
15949,"very good game, steam is good"
15950,"OMG! I BOUGHT MW2 IN 2015!
- SinglePlayer = 8/10 (too short)
- Special Ops = 9/10 (nice and hard challenges)
- MultiPlayer = 8/10 (its all good until you join a hacked lobby....i was in hacked lobby only once in 10 games, so not many hackers anymore :D)

Final = 8.5/10
Very Good!

Update: Its 2022 now, its still alive and playable on Steam(tho only TDM and FFA for now), 
SM2 is coming though. 
https://sm2.gg/"
15951,"COD is pandering to the multiplayer side of games too much. I understand that is a popular option for players, but think of the many who like playing SP missions. Someone from places where the network is not good enough for MP gameplay.

6 hours is too short a time for a game of this caliber and price. Stay away unless you are an MP enthusiast."
15952,Epic single player campaign with awesome sountrack. The gameplay action was also refined and gave many fun hours in multiplayer.
15953,was a legendary game until hacks ruined it
15954,"Play once. Enjoy. Play a little more, Love. Play 95 hours. Becomes addicted."
15955,
15956,"The singleplayer campaign is my favorite of all CoDs campaigns. It truly deserves the word ""epic"".
Spec ops are great fun when you have a coop friend.
Multiplayer WAS also amazing, again my favorite of all CoDs despite its many flaws, but it's a thing of the past. The community died, people moved to newer, worse releases. Shame. 

It should be worth it for the singleplayer/spec-ops alone though."
15957,Hate it because theres hackers and i got vac banned for no reason at all they have no proof if i hacked or not DONT GET IT wait for Black Ops III
15958,its still a great game but not that many people play multi anymore
15959,"**I HAVE MORE HOURS IN THE MULTIPLAYER EXECUTABLE SINCE THAT IS HOW CALL OF DUTY HANDLES MULTIPLAYER**

This game is fun. It is a little old, and some of the movement mechanics are a little weird, but It is one of my favorite Call of Duty games. I played this on XBOX for a long time, and I actually managed to get to 10th prestige I played that game so much.

If the game ever goes on sale, I recommend giving the multiplayer a try, althought you may find yourself playing with the same people all the time, since not many people play the game anymore.

15970,"Back to 2010...my first online game, i'll never forget it. I never felt so much emotions like here. First teammates, clan wars, tournaments...i still love this game."
15971,Single-player mode is really fun but i don't recemend it to people with a crappy windows computer.
15972,"Awsome game with a great story!!!
I recommend this game for everyone :D !!!!"
15973,"this game is amazing
"
15974,"One of the better Call Of Duty games in the series, to bad hackers overtook it on multiplayer."
15975,"A brief, but very dynamic and well recreated simulation of a real time war between Russia and the United States. The levels are completely believable, well patterned after exiting locales and the gunfighting physics are superb. The story flows very well with the first Modern Warfare and it evolves with the inevitable invasion of the US and the deeper penetration of the US Armed forces into the hearts of enemy territory. 

The experience of playing soldiers is now more vicarious than ever. Playing Modern Warfare 2 is one of the closest ways to know what it is like to pick up a weapon and kill in the name of your country and come to see the extremes all are willing to go in order to ensure their success. Immerse yourself in Warfare 2 and find out what life in an open armed conflict is all about."
15976,"10/10 for letting me throw a knife at a certain person
Kind of short, as expected, but very fast-paced and always exciting."

15979,love
15980,Noob Tube simulator.
15981,love the game but so many hackers
15982,dis game gud
15983,This game should have been called this: Call of Hackers Modern Cheatfare 2.
15984,"Before I begin, the multiplayer didnt work for me so, mac users, be warned that if you buy this for the mp and DLC it may not work as it has with me. I have played the multiplayer many times, console and PC so i should be able to give a very precise and solid conclusion to it. 
The multiplayer is good. However with issues like game ruining hackers and a small playerbase, i dont think that this games life will last very long any more. At the beggining the playerbase was huge but now it has plummeted. The guns and modes (snd and the acr) are the perfect combiniation for fun and competetiveness and truly remind us of real call of duty. The graphics are moderately good aswell as the framerate. As is the hit detection and so are the guns ripe camos and designs. Thankfully there is no pay to win but there are very op guns which you unlock at the end of your prestige. Not to mention the huge playerbase of hackers :(. But to a conclusion it is divine and shows how a brilliant call of duty should be. Unlike AW and Ghosts.

The campaign is probably one of the most notable in the history of CoD as it introduces a new antagonist, better than Rorke, Irons and the Arab bloke from MW1. It has an incredible end which im not gonna spoil however it will lead you with your mouth open. However another part of it made me inferior and literally crying cos it made me feel like i had to get mw3 which i already have on my 360. However makarovs breif introductions really shape the face of what a campaign should be like. If not for him and Shepherd mw2 would be broken and these 2 characters have amazing voices and you can really see how determined shepherd is but also how much of an anarchist is. There are some distressing scenes of the campaign such as mission 4, No Russian where you shoot civilians. Seriously Sledghammer! Now i can see whjy this game has been banned in several countries such as Russia!!! 

From the icy mountains to an abandoned Burger Town to the Favelas of Rio MW2 is a bold classic CoD with stunning graphics, brilliant textures and hours of jaw dropping scenes. even though the multiplayer is dying, it still presents challenges and fun hackers lobbies. So i give the MP a 7.5/10. The campaign felt like i had to buy MW3 (spoilersX). It still takes a good 6 hours, has lots of replayability and has beautiful character designs. I rate it 8.5/10. So overall its an 8/10. Well done Sledghammer! (not for advanced warfare though cos that was terrible and rubbish and it sucked deez nutzz ha geteh) GET IT!!"
15985,"This is a very fun game, But sometimes you get into hacked servers. Over all I think they need to watch the servers more."
15986,play with me
15987,It's definitely worth the money. Very nice campaigns. Very nice guns. Awesome 10/10 baby!
15988,Pls don't buy this game. I've played it 3 days and have to deal with nothing but scumbag kids with trainers. save your money for something better than this
15989,Worth to Play.
15990,This game is bad.
15991,"Not gonna lie, Singleplayer is much better than Multiplayer.
But overall, it's good."
15992,"the glory days of cod from cod4 when the games had success and now modern warfare 2, i would say that this is the best cod game with a great campaign but the multiplayer as of 2015 is full of hackers, but back then before the activison fiasco it was all good. At least this version of infinity ward knew how to make games."
15993,Great game. Great experience
15994,it's the best cod game
15995,best game ever. If you are reading this to decide on getting the game it isnt as good as i say. There are to many level 70's so its very hard to rank up and there are also many hackers
15996,"If I had a Billion, yes a billion dollars and paid a dollar everytime I got noobtubed in this game I would have no money, because I broke my PC so many times of raging and bought a new one"
15997,this game was so cool you wont even imagine since i was banned for playing too good i dont play 200-300 days ago i have 1.1 thousand hours
15998,"Two words, No Russian"
15999,I Love the game but modders and hackers keep leveling me up and i hate that! Im trying to get rid of all the emblems i got but i cant!
16000,"Spec Ops is great you can play it with your friends and have a lot of fun.
Story line is good too.

But Multiplayer is s**t as to this moment I've played it for 2 hours and I already played with 3+ cheaters, I mean I saw the Kill Cam I know that you have hacks, I'm not saying that I'm great at this game but I see that you are tracking me through the walls.

So you CAN live without this game but it is still good, if you don't play multiplayer.

And I'm sorry CoD but for that kind of money you can get a much better game."
16001,"Its not arma, its not battlefield, and it defenetly aint-no half-life 2, but its the best cod of all time (besides mabie black ops 1)"
16002,"best game but u can`t join in ur best map !! ""maps is random and that was shit !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
16003,yes it is a great game with a awesome campaign
16004,"By far my favorite Call of Duty experience, and matched with all the combinations on the PC I found this game extrordinarly fun even though the game is heading on to be 6 years old in November."
16005,"MY NAME IS NOT IMPORTANT, WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHAT IM GOING TO DO
I JUST FUCKING HATE AMERICA, AND THE AMERICAN WORMS FEASTING ON ITS CARCASS
MY WHOLE LIFE IS JUST COLD AND BITTER HATRED

AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO DIE VIOLENTLY
THIS IS A TIME FOR VENGEANCE 
AND NO RUSSIANS SHALL BE SAVED

AND I WILL KILL AS MANY AS I CAN

ITS TIME FOR ME TO KILL AND ITS TIME FOR ME TO DIE

Remember, No Russian."
16006,this game is great for those looking for a smooth paced First Person Shooter (FPS) and come with multiplayer!
16007,this game is so much fun i jsut love the noobtubers and all the rpg bullets blowing my face up when i am about to get a nuke
16008,"Get the game only if you want to play singleplayer and/or spec ops.
I DO NOT recommend playing multiplayer beacuse there are hackers who use improved cheats which can cause VAC bans to non-cheating players on the server."
16009,"The most aids game ever made, my dad fisted me.
it's the best cod"
16010,"Amazing Storyline, 10/10, enuff said

***EDIT***

CoD MW 2 Multiplayer: I didn't want to waste dozens/hundreds of hours to unlock all the stuff in CoD MW 2 (weps, emblems, scopes, prestige, all that stuff) ..... So i used a trainer, and, basicly, i got VAC Banned. But people with aimbot + wallhack is allowed to carry on playing.
CoD singleplayer = 10/10
CoD multiplayer = -3/10
P.S. THE VAC BAN LOOKS AWESOME ON MEH PROFILE ! :D"
16011,n1
16012,"A great game left to decompose. 

As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.

First, the good:

1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day. 
2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good.
3. Fastpaced multiplayer action. 
4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive.
5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible. 

Now the bad:

1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.

2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile. 

3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?

4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world. 

5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing. 

I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD."
16013,nahh seriously it sucks
16014,meh
16015,Ny ticket to FaZe Clan
16016,"I've heard people say they were dissapointed with the campaign in MW2 and that after the first MW the series declined, having just played through the campaign again I dont agree.
I can agree that the whole reason for both sides going to war has some huge plot holes, but I think the resulting story is pretty good that features a few twists and turns that you don't expect on your first playthrough.
The early missions do tend to be a little mediocre but all of the US missions are excellently done as well as the Task Force missions after the favella and the visuals have been given a boost since MW1 with some quite good character models and environment design, my stand out mission being the missions in the dark US streets in the monsoon. 
MW2 also has one of the longer campaigns in the series and combined with everything else makes it a worthy entry if you enjoyed the previous game.
"
16017,"Play the game for singleplayer experience. The Modern Warfare series has a very interesting story with excellent world execution, voiceacting, scenario and music. Also, the story has great plot twists. I'm no expert but I felt like I'm taking part in a realistic war in a realistic world. 

The spec ops cooperation mode provides loads of fun if you play with a friend and it's challenging too!

The multiplayer mode.... Well... I played only one match and leveled to maximum level of maximum prestige. Hackers. Hackers everywhere. Don't play multiplayer."
16018,"it doent even work wtf
"
16019,all things considered this game is still fun even a decade and some change later
16020,Good game if u rule out the cheaters!!
16021,TASTE MY [strike]SKILL[/strike] STEAL
16022,"Last good game in the CoD franchise, sad fact."
16023,"One of the better CoD games, but not on PC. The multiplayer is broken by many, many, many, many hackers. I suggest playing ONLY on ervers you KNOW are not acked and are safe. Try just doin private matches with friends. The single player is fun, but has a weak story. Over-all, the gameplay is where it matters, and when you find a good lobby online, it is great fun. Due to the immnse ammount of hackers, I would advise youto buy this game on Xbox instead. PC= 4/10. On The Xbox 360 or the PS3, I would give it an 8.5/10."
16024,Don't drop the soap.
16025,"A great game, that is completely unmonitored, with hackers in most lobbies with the ability to change your rank and remove all of the weapons you've unlocked. It's a broken game now, don't buy it if you want it for multiplayer."
16026,"One of the best shooters ever.
It would be better if there were less hacked lobbies but meh. Gun game is fun"
16027,"It's now full of hackers. I decided to rejoin my nostalgic game of MW2, but as soon as I joined a lobby, I was instantly hacked and prestiged. Good, yet bad at the same time :<."
16028,This game makes me cry
16029,Hackers are everywhere
16030,nice game
16031,THIS GAME IS AWESOME
16032,"You know, i used to hate Call of Duty with a burning passion...




Then i got this game...






Now i kinda tolerate it."
16033,"one time i choked in an Dorito while getting killed from an noobtuber who was flying in the sky with unlimited noobtubes to shoot at those mlg 360 snipars on the ground 


9/11-allahu akbar"
16034,This game is more modern then modern warfare 1 but less modern then modern warfare 3 but a good game though
16035,best call of duty MW ever
16036,best game i ever play
16037,"The Most Toxic Call of Duty Ever. Even Ghosts wasn't so toxic as was and is this game. Because of stupid game desing(a loot of bushes) and balance(half of guns is 20% awful, 20% is OP)."
16038,"hacked the game and gave myself ranks next day i get vac banned 

10/10 would get vac banned for ranks again"
16039,10/10 wouldn't recommend
16040,GAY.
16041,trickshooting simulator
16042,great game runs smooth love how i can only play TDM cuz thats all anyone has but runs smooth at 30FPS without graphic card
16043,Great Game
16044,Decent game.
16045,Great Game. Good Story.
16046,"Got banned because the host of a hacked lobby left the game

10/10 would ban again."
16047,"i bought the game not from steam but from walmart it said it cant run on my 64 bit but thats what i own its slow and lags
"
16048,"Love this games, LOT.
Too bad nowaday no more player.
"
16049,to many hacked lobbys i got in to alot of them and got fucking vac banned wtf steam wtf
16050,Truly one of the best CoD games. Old but gold.
16051,"The game is dead. It somehow could be qualified as ""good"" on launch, due to it being the somehow first iteration of the Cod Multiplayer with all the glorified perk/killstreak bullshit you might now be fed up to after a tons of watered-down sequels. Campaign is still interesting despite being a 6 hour run-through hollywood movie.

Nobody is playing now except rare deathmatch games. Regarding spec-ops in co-op, the idea was itself nice, but from my 15-20 experiences with different people, the connection was too unstable to actually get to the end of the level most of the time. So they are a no-go unless you are playing alone, and if you do you feel like stupid as its not plausible to take a whole army alone (despite being the only decent shooter aside with your teammates when you play the campaign instead).



Anyway, you could compare this game to an iPod. Revolutionary at first, good for the time being, but now completely useless, and more worth as a museum piece than anything."
16052,"No LAN?, cant join friend lobby? canr use controller? not happy.
the game is a 10 out of ten,"
16053,Got vac'd:(
16054,Love this game would recomend to anyone who likes 1st person shooters
16055,PLAY PRIVATE MATCH WITH MOD MENU GET VACED 10/10
16056,Joins a game and gets VAC banned for joing a hacked lobby. Steam ruined the game and wasted our money.
16057,Too many noobtubes
16058,"A game so cartoonishly over the top you will half expect an animated rabbit to be your squad leader, Modern Warfare 2 offers you all of the shooting you've come to love from your power fantasies, but none of the realism people tell you CoD has. 

But if CoD was realistic, half of the game would be waiting for your girlfriend back home to ship your spare underwear to base while you lazily play basketball in your off time because there's literally nothing to do, so I guess I'm fine with the wacky zany premise."
16059,great game
16060,"awesome!!!!!!!
"
16061,"A lot of blood, but fun..."
16062,most vacbanning game ever
16063,"Perfection! 

Thanks to all my team mates."
16064,fun
16065,"This game was very good back when it was popular(AlterIW)  The base game is amazing and the only real issue is multiplayer, which was fixed by a third party(AlterIW) then taken down by IW... Then fixed again by a third party(FourDeltaOne) then taken down by IW.  Even though the multiplayer is not playable now, I still find myself going back to the single player to play spec ops or to finish grabbing all the intel.  I have 3 stars on all the spec ops becides the 2 player ones and just recently got all the intel so I decided that I should finally write a review on this great game.
10/10 support for mp, ty IW
10/10 sp for real though"
16066,awesome game but lot's of hackers
16067,Good game ;)
16068,Fun 2 hack in dis gaem r8 8/8
16069,yaegh¬®'
16070,very good
16071,One of the best modern shooters of all time. Highly addictive multiplayer with a challenging singleplayer and co-op experience.
16072,"Vac banned For Chaning my FOV 


10/10 IG MOTHER FUCKING N"
16073,Amazing game stratigic multiplayer
16074,"Even if you just play it for the single player, that alone makes the game worth it tbh. Multiplayer is good too just hackers ruin the experience."
16075,"ah, just played this again after many years. epic soundtrack, legendary weapons/sounds/animations and IF you are lucky you can get some awesome matches.

but then the scrubs appeared again who have nothing else to do in their *!*¬ß""*¬ß lives but to use cancer abilities and weapons that were the god awful 12 years ago.. and they still do. must be fun ruining the match for others by just spamming rockets and grenade launchers! nothing but disappointing..

dont forget those cheating maggots aswell!"
16076,"loved it so muck loving it much not so meany modders for me
"
16077,it is one of the best game
16078,muhahaaaa
16079,Amazing. Great graphics and you don't need a super high end P.C to have fun.
16080,"I don't worry about hackers, I worry about snipers that one shot you."
16081,"I started playing COD since the COD4 released.Until then i hated every fps game.I hated moha,cs etc.Then a friend recommended COD4.IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER.And i still believe it.I thought that this world would never see a better   game than COD4.I was so wrong.After COD4,activision released COD5.A great game but not as everyone expected.And then in august if i remember correct activision released a trailer for this COD.I was watching all day and all night this trailer.When the game came out i was so fu cking happy.I think that COD6 is better than COD4.Dont be mad on this opinion guys.I had so fun trying to get 25 kills without dying,trying to keep my body still while i had 10 kill streak in a row and i wanted one more for chopper gunner or ac130 so i could hope i would get me my 1st nuke.After my 1st nuke i felt so great.It feels still great.I would totally recommend this game guys. 10 / 10.Also i dont have only 30 hours.I have over 700 hours in this game.Idk why it shows only them."
16082,"Just like the Playstation and Xbox versions bar graphics
"
16083,"Lotta hackers, but a classic. My profile got taken over twice, so im trying a reinstall, Otherwise this is now unplayable for me, which is disappointing. Only saying I'd recommend this because I got it cheap, and I still enjoy the career"
16084,"Played a couple of games, got called a hacker and got demoted to level 1 by a hacker 

10/10"
16085,Greatest game in history
16086,NO RUSSIAN
16087,My favorite call of duty game ever
16088,"Was fun game, until I got VAC banned..."
16089,There are not that many people playing it anymore and there are a bunch of modded lobbies and cheaters.
16090,Its is really fun but a lot of hacked lobbies.
16091,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
16092,"lobby was hacked and cant get rid of crap that has been down loaded. So beware..
the hacker has been around for a long time so i surprised nothing has been done the jokerRay.
has spoiled a good game .."
16093,THIS GAME IS AWSOME i personally think MW2 is the best call of duty Treyarch and Activision have made
16094,"Good singleplayer, bad multiplayer. a lot of cheats in free for all and so hard to lv up after lv 20. Still better than CS 1.6


P.S. so expensive on steam. i got it from a store at 30 Ron ( 6 euro/ 9$)"
16095,"i keep playing this game all the while, since the time of release, still the best game for me."
16096,Very realistic game
16097,This game is beast! If it is on sale BUY IT! I highly recommend this game to all FPS gamers  (except CS:GO players-they only play CS). I would give it 8/10 because it has it's cons too :)
16098,Best Game ever 10/10
16099,"This game is amazing. Buy it now. There are way less hackers than in mw3 (i dont know why, mw2 is older than mw3). The game is just great in genera;. Also there is no quickdraw which sucks"
16100,I know this game is old but a lot of people still play it so all I can say is that MW2 is and always will be awesome as long as people play it
16101,"Played it way back when.

It was alright."
16102,"I mean, it's a fun game, when you can get into a game that isn't hacked.  Nowadays, there are more hackers but because there are less people playing - there are less people hacking.  The only game mode you're going to actually find people in is TDM, any other game the people are nonexistant, but other than that it's a fun game, the campaign is fun and immersive - and extremely difficult at times (looking at you Favela mission).  The online MP can be pretty tough to pick up if you're new, and can get kind of frustrating, but other than that it can be very fun. Would recommend playing with friends - especially ones that are better than you if you are new.  If you get into a hacked lobby - you are not guaranteed a VAC ban. If you get into one you are likely to get what is called an ""infection"" which is just a hack that is temporarily added to your account, but you just need to restart the game to get rid of it.

Overall, I'd rate the game a 7.5/10 because of the hacking. Of course, if you are into the whole hacked lobbies and such - the hacking community is pretty great (just look up se7ensins on google).
"
16103,"The game itself is my favourite call of duty game ever! So good handling and feel on the guns, the movements just feel very smooth, the graphics are very good and yet it doesn't demand a crazy good computer to run smoothly! The single thing that keeps me from playing this game right now, is the hackers... There are so many fucking hacked servers, you are lucky to get a normal server... A real petty.... I wish tye producers could have some people jumping from server to server and ban all the people who host hacked servers, but thats never going to happen... But the game itself is a 150/10"
16104,Awesome Game! Great campaign (so far) and multiplayer is still pretty fun. Even though the game doesn't require much ram too run you should still turn down some of the settings if your on a small computer like me.
16105,"Alright Minus the multiplayer on PC, this is hands down the best Call of Duty in the franchise. You will not be dissapointed with this title (Albiet the Multiplayer is full of hackers) But looking back to originally playing this game in 2009 on the 360 it still stands out as the best in the franchise to me and I'm sure you'll agree!"
16106,It's a really good game I think.
16107,Terrible don't waste your money!
16108,-1
16109,the best game i ever played
16110,"Lobbies have nothing but hackers. If your looking for the game you played on your 360/ 
Ps3 then this is not it. It's just hackers, who can't be killed. Infinite health, 1 shot kill water guns. If you like hackers here's your game. If they annoy you then do not purchase this game."
16111,"""Bloody yanks, I thought they were the good guys""



This is easily the best COD out there."
16112,"ALL CALL OF DUTY SUCKS BEACAUSE YOU CANT KILL A ENEMY OR IM A NOOB OR EVERYONE IS HAVE HAXX!!!!!!










AND MY NAME IS   GABEN!
"
16113,"Get banned becuase i join a server and installs hacks from server. Wont lift the ban steam, hb i try a law suit because steam just made me lose 20$ for a game i cant play. bet youll lift the ban then."
16114,My favorite Call of Duty
16115,"Overall a very fun COD. A blast to play with friends! Unfortunately the problem with this game is the hackers. They are everywhere. That and the fact that it is basically a lazy PC port done very poorly. Very little options and they always seem to reset manually. Game runs pretty meh unless you download a third party program that lets you edit graphics settings. I will recommend this game, even with these flaws, because it is still a blast to play!

-COLTONR45"
16116,Call of Duty MW2 is a very good game there missions that might make you cry cause the russians  start to attack north america. like mw3 the second mission when to get out of the sub i almost cried cause it was intense to see the distruction. this is a good game buy it NOW
16117,Best Gme ever
16118,played 2 hours played on a server which then gave me every gun and skin 11/10 would play on that server again
16119,"Great game, exept when Makarov ejaculated lead into russians. Well maybe that was kinda fun actually"
16120,sweet nostalgia..
16121,Pretty good game. Has some things that need to be balanced or patched but still worth buying.
16122,nobody plays the multiplayer.
16123,meh...
16124,12/10 would get hacked again
16125,"they're Legend ,
But i Don't Know why I Bnned !
"
16126,"For achievments, this game is worthless..."
16127,"I shouldn't have bought this game because now I can't stop playing it!!!
This game is the reason I got a console when it first came out. Now that I play on PC I love it even more.
I finished the campaign all the way through for the first time and I was absolutely captivated by the story and how well it all tied in together. The ending left me in chills and I even enjoyed the credits and how they captured the entirety of the game in a unique and creative way.
When I left off playing the multiplayer on the console there was a shit ton of hackers that made me not even want to continue playing, but I have yet to run into any on the PC multiplayer (hopefully it stays that way). This game is WELL worth the money."
16128,Fuck yea !!!! it's awesome
16129,"[b]I am only recommending the single player, do NOT buy this game for the multiplayer. The multiplayer has too many hackers with a poor anti-cheat.[/b]

 Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 along with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was the shining light of activision's series of Call of Duty. These games were the last of its originality before Call of Duty began to release their repetitive titles on and on. I sadly forgot the single player, but it was very good and easy to run if you have a average computer. 

7.5/10"
16130,"its a great game i recomend it and yea buy this
"
16131,"only cheats
"
16132,"This game is amazing, campaign and multiplayer, but when you try to play multiplayer, its like super rare not to end up in a hacked or modded lobby, I would recommend this game... but too many hackers
"
16133,"HACKERS, HACKERS EVERYWHERE!!
Fuck this game. 
I recommend this game for history, not Multiplayer!"
16134,"Multiplayer used to be good. Used to. Until the hackers started flooding the servers. Also considering how old the game is, it's difficult to find a good server that doesn't lag like hell. 
On another note, the Single-player gameplay is still one of the best. Immersive storyline and atmosphere and really REALLY fucking amazing soundtracks"
16135,Call of Duty Classic
16136,Just as fun as day one. Buy this game
16137,clean quality uk #squad
16138,This game is the Best game of the Call of Duty World .
16139,Awesome game would recommend
16140,"The singleplayer isn't quite as good as the prior titles and is a lot shorter but if you thinking of buying MW2 it's for the MP. Yes is lacks dedicated server, yes modding isn't embraced unlike in say COD4 and yes the DLC is in the files yet you still have to buy it.

But this is a quilty pleasure. I even prestieged/maxed out ages ago. The FOV sucks by default though and will make you sicck unless you use an FOV changer. Optimization is great even though the game caps at 91 FPS and while it is a COD game the visuals arent half bad and it's actually got some color. The maps are great and it makes the console versions looks shit by comparison. Not too shabby. 

That said it's 2015 (Edit to 2017 now) and if you aren't already prestiged don't bother as this game as the odds will be stacked against you as every other player will have decent gear except for you. The DLC is still way to expensive in 2017 and few play it. It's a shame as I would love to play some COD4 maps in MW2."
16141,Guys i Download this game but how i change language from russia to english Pls need help

16149,"One of my all time favourite Call Of Duty games I never enjoyed any game's campaign as much as I enjoyed MW2's Campaign The campaign,the multiplayer I have so many memories with this game This is the only call of duty game IN MY OPINION whose DLCs are Worth every penny but anyway without wasting any time I'll just list the pros and cons

[b] Pros: [/b]
+Great Story
+The environment of the game absorbs you you feel like you're one with the character you're playing
+Great Graphics
+Great Multiplayer
+Variety of AWESOME weapons
+Challenging AI
+Awesome characters
+Awesome music [Composed by Hans Zimmer the guy who composed most of my favourite tracks]
+DLCs are worth buying
+No futuristic bullshit

[b] Cons: [/b]
-Multiplayer has very small community and filled with hackers
-You can't join the server of your choice in multiplayer
-While playing multiplayer you are sometimes forced to play in modded lobbies
-Abandoned by Developers
-Minor bug
-No mods

Overall Rating:- 7/10
I would have given it 9/10 but due to negligence of developers and some other negative aspects I had to give it 7/10 
Even after all this It's STILL WORTH BUYING and.. IN MY OPINION WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST CALL OF DUTY GAME
I recommend to buy this on Sale and yes it is worth it That's all I have to say,Cheers!"
16150,"worst game ever filled with noob tubers campers etc. the only people who play this game got it when it first came out and there all the max level which is level 70 if u wanted to buy this game and if you do you've made a BIG mistake
plus u need a SUPERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR fast pc for it to run or you gotta make our grahpics and your screen format crap just for it to run smooth. DONT BUY THE GAME"
16151,"All good things must come to an end. But not for COD MW2 any time soon. With the 347 Hours that I have played, I've found hope for the Call Of Duty Community. Back when it was the main COD that everyone used to play, people usually played 'normally'. By this I mean people didn't run around with tubes, Duel G18's and what not. Trickshotting also played a big part. IMO, MW2 has been one of the most successful Call of Duty's to this day. It is still a fantastic game both singleplayer and multiplayer wise. The multiplayer community is still alive. But you'll usually see the same people play with you when you enter every time. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself. 

I absolutely love this game and would play it again at anytime. 9.5/10 from me. I just love pwning the noobs, don't you? Have fun!!"
16152,"Best game
i think its better than MW3"
16153,"Best game ever!!!! But watch out for hackers, or modded games. Can and will get annoying.
Go Kill. :D"
16154,do not buy MW2 if you want to play multiplayer thar to tuns of hackers i onley played 5 hours and got my leveo hacked 2 time and was in mor than 10 hacked lobbys i wood not buy MW2 for multiplayer
16155,"Pretty fun, but mindless ""kill, advance, kill advance"" FPS."
16156,"Great game,great action,really good missions and multiplayer.This game is like playing battlefield with better story.
10/10 Would buy again :)"
16157,Its the best Call of duty ever
16158,"The second entry in the iconic Modern Warfare franchise, is a wonderful aracde type FPS."
16159,"i like this game, i use low graph but still good"
16160,"Last good game in the CoD series, RIP"
16161,"The Modern Warfare 2 community has increased since Xmas 2014. There are many new players and they, as well as regular players, seem to have ran away the hackers. When I say hackers, I mean aimbotters. They are the most deadly. I havent' run into one since last year. As always, campaign is great and spec ops is a nice distraction. Multiplayer is where this game shines.

Make sure you have a class dedicated to cold blooded and a stinger so that you can shoot down enemy air support. The key is knowing when to switch classes. Make sure you are prepared for every situation. Commando idiots, camping idiots, noob tube idiots, sniping idiots, shotgun idiots... 

I recommend watching gameplay on youtube if you are completely new to MW2."
16162,Ramirez! Do everything!
16163,"If you've played CoD4: Modern Warfare, then you've basically played Modern Warfare 2. Essentially the same storyline.
Don't get me wrong, it's an entirely enjoyable gaming experience, but it's far from essential to your library.
Multiplayer mode is new to MW2, and it can be fun, but my favorite part of MW2 is the array of solo missions.

16164,"single player thumbs up
co-op thumbs up
multi-player lan thumbs up

Multi-player with Valve's anti cheat two thumbs down.
The multitude of cheaters and hackers that run rampat on there servers leaves me with no faith in any of steams anti cheat systems.  If at very least you had the ability to ban a person to letting join a game your in, you could at least avoid some of them.

Can happen often you join a hacked server, leave it trying to find another game and you join right back into the same server.  Valves anti-cheat says it bans cheaters and catchest them however many times its very obvious the cheaters are there and wrecking any entertainment you would have.  Unfortunatly if you wish to play lan games and you would like to use more then the basic weapons attachments perks etc. you are forced to play with these poor servers and players with hacks and cheats running.  Some of these hacks are minor however most are disruptive (like people deciding to summon boxes and create walls or houses, others try to not be so obvious only using target assist creating multiple increadable kills only seen in movies, some of these are hard to determine because some good players abound with impressive kills and you have to experience multiple incredable deaths untill you can assume there is some hack running.  The worst is when someone hijacks a server creating bizzare events of people jumping increadable heights and weapon crates falling from the sky.

The old school way of allowing people to host and control there own network games was far superior there you would be able save servers that were running things fair or in settings you appreciate, and the server controllers could at will ban players they felt were not following there own rules and or seamed to be cheating.

Valves attempt at elliminating cheaters is iether forgotten about with this old game, which leaves me wondering if any of the newer games I may be on the fence of purchasing is worth the hassel of purchasing.

the VAC and forced playing multiple online games before it open weapon options during lan are the only negative to this game,"
16165,"To be totally honest, this game is not worth the money. Even on sale it's not worth it at all. The multiplayer is FULL of hackers. The only thing that's fun is the campain and the special ops but that can only last you so long. You join a game in multiplayer and you get all this op stuff... It takes away the fun and experience in leveling up. So you should hold on to your money and wait for another game you want to go on sale. Hope this helped '')"
16166,how do i sell this
16167,I love this game.
16168,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was the pinnacle of PC CoD Multiplayer. This game worked straight up. There were no major issues with connecting to a party or connecting to anyone online at all. If CoD was still made the way this game was made I would buy those games again.
16169,"i bought it and played it. only thing is saw in the multiplayer was explosions. i had no idea where people are, only thing is saw is explisons and death, it was like a movie from michael bay"
16170,"Last great game of its franchise. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a fantastic game to play, by yourself or with friends. I've played this game with friends on the console (curse my peasantry days, but hey, split screen) for a long time a while back. Oh the joys we had fucking up and blowing ourselves up during the stealth missions on spec-ops. The story is also absolutely fantastic, and not overdone with explosions and rediculous gadgets like its newer accounts. You'll love this game so much, that is, if you enjoy shooting people a lot. 

The multiplayer, i have played for not too long (like a few hours the day im writing this review) and it is pretty fun as well. Although, be ready for noobs with snipers still no-scoping you. Be ready for the drop shots. Be ready for the times you'll shout ""that's so fucking bullshit, how is that gun that fucking powerful!?"". Be ready for the mechanics abusers. I, on the other hand use the old fashioned run and gun, fare and square, and still manage to top leaderboards sometimes (seriously im not trying to brag, i seriously think im noobing it up a lot, but the enemy noobs it up too sometimes). 

Overall, i really think this game is something you and your kids should play, gather around the PC and scream every curse word you all can think of when you die. This is a game that everyone should have played at some point in their lives, because killing all the russians and still some how managing to lose is so much fun in this game. 

10/10 would- ""Ramirez, hurry up with that review!"" 


P.S. 

*(Spoiler Alert)* The ending is incredibly satisfying."

16180,"Lacks a server browser, the main reason to buy a CoD game is the multiplayer, and unless you can coarse a group of friends to buy it, you likely won't have a good time unless you have nostalgia goggles to help ypu out. MW2 lacks the simple things that most shooters on PC have, like FOV sliders and it has an FPS cap. 

The campaign is over the top crap, so it's actually quite fun, as you ride around the world, shooting people and getting caught up in drama you don't really care about. This was before the campaigns had turned into the dramatic bullshit that you'd find in Modern Warfare 3. It isn't as good as the games that came before it on the Infinity Ward side, but it's still fun and over the top

A terrible port, it runs well and looks better than the console versions but lacks so many features that any decent PC shooter released in 2009 should have. A terrible entry that started a general downward spiral for a great series. Buy Black Ops 1 or CoD: 4, or one of the original Infinity Ward games instead, those are much better."

16183,"The best in the series of Call of Duty, this game will never get old. A true classic!"
16184,"Amazing game, here's a brief rundown of my personal preferences of the 3 types of playstyle
Campaign - BEAUTIFUL! If you thought the WaW campaign was good, wait untill you see this one. Sniping into a russian base turns into close combat firefights. You need this game just to experience the campaign
Special Ops - Pretty decent. If you want maps that you can remember from CoD4 and MW2, play this mode. You can run the S.S.D.D couse untill you can nail it with a 30 second run.
Multiplayer - Decent but bad. Why is it bad? Hackers, hackers everywhere. I get lucky enough to not get hacked lobbies as much as i used to. Hitting level 70 legit is pretty difficult. But i managed it and it can be done
10/10. BUY THIS GAME"

best COD of all time!"

Pretty fair game.

16195,"Fulfills my fantasy of being enormous American Army males, saving the world from Mother Russia by killing thousands of enemies while absorbing their bullets."
16196,"Modern Warfare 2 and its MP is full of the craziest BS as opposed to any other CoD, and yet it's the one that stands out as the definition of CoD. CoD4 revolutionized first person shooters, but (at least, for many fans) MW2 was the cherry on the top. Super fast-paced multiplayer gameplay, a wild, absurd (not to mention controversial) campaign, and one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever orchestrated make this CoD different from the rest. Some say Black Ops 2 takes the cake, other say Call of Duty 2. But MW2 (in my humble opinion) is where CoD reached its peak of originality. Now as for recommending this game, I will say yes. Not because of the hacked multiplayer lobbies and people calling it the ""Ultimate Rage Simulator,"" but because of the nostalgia and good moments of the game. When the going gets good in MW2, nothing gets better than hearing Craig Fairbrass as Ghost saying ""Tactical Nuke ready. Turn the key."" As far as the price goes, it is worth half the price of 20$ on the market (excluding sales). Wait for a 50% sale and buy the game if you're a fan of CoD and will have nothing to do with the new, futuristic rip-offs of Titanfall and whatnot. Several hundred people play everyday, and chances are you'll run into a few nice people along the way (like I did). 1v1 with friends, go for nukes, and experience the sixth Call of Duty as it is - Absurd, unbalanced, yet downright incredible. And you don't like the BS of MW2, then play its predecessor, CoD4. But in the end, Modern Warfare 2 is the most memorable CoD to date. I can't very well describe the feeling of MW2. You just have to play it for yourself. And if you don't like CoD, go play Battlefield. Or Arma. Or Minecraft. Many dislike it, but for those who appreciate MW2, it's one of the greatest games in video game history."
16197,Would Like option for controller!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16198,"Singleplayer: Awesome, amazing story

Muletiplayer: take 10 minutes to find a server"
16199,"The highest bar Call of Duty has reached.  Sadly has not reached since, the original Infinity Ward folks knew how to improve a game and create a movie like experiance.  One of the best story modes for an FPS and great multiplayer."
16200,When COD still was good..
16201,"fun game in the singleplayer mode, some glitches but easily avoidable. multiplayer hacked life a motherf***er but mostly quickscope things and its pretty funny."
16202,Ok game but really for a Call of Duty game you should be able to use a controller.
16203,"In my opinion,, this call of duty is the best than others!!!!!! :P"
16204,"Firstly I like this game a lot but it stopped working 2 days after purchase.  I had shut everything down for the night.  Turned it back on the next day, gave Steam access to my computer for the Steam overlay and ever since it has not worked (freezing up either at or before the main menu comes up).  I am trying to get support or a refund, but Steam is refusing to refund me and they offer no real support.  I recommend this game as it is fun and intense but I do not recommend Steam based on my experience."
16205,KELVIN
16206,"Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2 is with out a doubt in my mind, one of the best call of duty games out there, I have played every call of duty game, pc and console wise from Call of Duty 3 up to Advanced Warfare, and this is still one of my all time favorites. The story line in this call of duty stood out to me, my friend told me to give some campaigns on call of duty a try since I had played mostly multiplayer and I didn't really get the hang of it, but this one completely blew me away, the gameplay in this game is phenominal and the graphics are still very decent to this date, I can't wait for another call of duty campaign such as this, and I definantly can't wait to finish this one 

9.5/10"
16207,"Yes, the multiplayer section of the game has hackers in it. Yes, the multiplayer portion is a broken in terms of the weapons, perks, and ""noobtubes"".

However, with all of this being said, Modern Warfare 2 will always hold a place in my heart for being one of the last ""good"" Call of Duties.

The game most certainly is not ""dead"", plenty of people still play this game, and I do not blame them. MW2 is perhaps (even with the hackers and broken multiplayer) one of the most fun CoDs out of all of them. While I do not have many hours here on the Steam version, I played this game the most on the Xbox 360, before I got the ""red ring of death"".

This game is perfect for casual gamers like me, who just like to relive the nostalgia of the Modern Warfare franchise, and not always aim for the highest score or the most kills.

One thing I [u]do not[/u] recommend about this game is the DLC. While you do get the classic CoD 4 maps and such, they will hinder your matchmaking, and you may or may not find any games at all with them equipped. The only positive benefit to having the DLC is that most hackers do not have it or use it, therefore allowing you to play ""legit"" matches."
16208,good times ~!!
16209,Was going to buy CoD:BO2 during the 2015 Summer Sale but decided to just reinstall this game.  Best $30 I didn't spend.
16210,Nice game
16211,"Best Battlefield 4 Multiplayer yet! Graphics looks really nice, so as the weapons and the vehicles. Only buy it if your pc can handle bf4, because the game is very heavy! The only thing that sucks about this game is the recoil and that you have to aim like 5 meters above someone's head with a sniper to hit that person. But it is more realistic that CoD. So +1 for me.

I rate this game 8/10 because the maps are shit."

16230,"There is something about this game that makes me wonder why everyone else holds it at such a legendary status. Sure, it is a good first person shooter, but it is not amazing. It does nothing to really seperate itself from the rest of the modern military shooters out there. The environments aren't great either, with a vast majority from the campaign feeling quite bland and brow-ish. It is, however, still a good first person shooter with fast paced action. Also, the multiplayer is great fun and I'm sure that is where you willl be spending most of your time.

The plot lost what coherency it had, gameplay began to show it's need for throwaway gimmicks, and things started to fall apart. But it's still a good game. Falling short of the majesty of earlier titles, but still good.

Damn it, Activision."
16246,Sad its fate is. It could be the best COD. Cheaters make it a living hell. The Singleplayer is great but spec ops could have a very somple thing. IN-GAME CHAT! Same on MW3 as well. MP had good new features but...Cheaters ruhined it.

16253,"Probably the best war game I ever played. After playing on PS3, I can say that trying this game again is something wonderfull :)
A delicious mixture of single and multiplayer game and between close combat and long-distance shots.
It promises real amazing battles between mates !
A fulfilling game !!"
16254,"Good game. 

Pros:

- Story
- Gameplay (it just works in every possible way)
- Performance and graphics. FPS did not drop, and did not crash or bug even once.

Cons:

- SpecOps should be able to play with random people."
16255,"A great game, nowadays full of cheaters but the maps , the guns and the gameplay compared to previous Call of Duty games are ground braking and the graphics required are quite low. It may be the best CoD ever made"
16256,This game still has a multiplayer crowd. Buy it it's the best one.
16257,one of the best call of dutys ever made other then cod4.
16258,doesnt work on my macbook
16259,Bad Taste after Modern Warfare ...
16260,I had a lot of fun playing this game and i recommend it to every FPS fan!
16261,if you get hacked it could lead up to cheat detected and i never cheated i have been hacked and i want it fixed.
16262,Worth It.
16263,"Campaing- 100 Great campaing very rich story
Multiplayer-75 okay but to many pricks
special ops- Loved it
overall grade A-"
16264,"I love this game

16265,great
16266,i want to refund this game please

16269,"Any Call of Duty in the series will tear you apart. How you may ask? Well, Let's just say ""vocab"", and rage. That is what I best describe this game. Also, this will tear your family apart as well."
16270,"enemy afk

i walk up to point blank and aim at his head

i fire

not a headshot


this game is fucking amazing"
16271,this game is very nice but to many hacker here
16272,"Hackers, hackers, hackers, and yeah more hackers."
16273,"The game is great as it is!
But....
As soon as you go to multiplayer it is a S**tshow. Almost every lobby you enter has some sort of modder in there that gives you all wepons, emblems, ranks, and all achevments. 
It results in a UNFAIR VAC ban that you could not help. 
Single player and spec ops are very very fun.

But overall i would say the game is awesome but the multiplayer is just a mod filled pile of crap."
16274,"Queued for a TDM lobby, got put in a SnD modded lobby.

11/10 Would be queued in an SnD lobby again."
16275,yes i like it but sometimes you run into hackers but good game.
16276,"So So, I'm not really into the Multiplayer kind, more onto the Singleplayer storyline. You need to play the first Call of Duty, (not the world war 2) the modern one, Call of Duty 4, In order to understand the beginning."
16277,It's fun and it is easy to learn. I live this game!
16278,"Good old could say classic cod, back in it's glory day. Good memories, Amen. 10/10"
16279,its shit
16280,i have had a couple of hours of gametime on this game then all of a sudden it sais i do not have it in my stema library?! steam hurry up and sort this out or i will deactivate my account!
16281,PLS MAKE A REMAKE PLSSSSS GabeN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16282,who wants to trade with mw2 to black ops or advanced warfare
16283,Because every Call of Duty after this one is just an expansion...
16284,It Keeps Saying Cheat Detected For No Reason... FIX IT!!!!
16285,"Events of the game make it feel like a goofy James Bond or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, which keeps the game from feeling boring. Gunplay is repetetive, and gets pretty tedious at sections of the game, but I would reccomend overall. 7.9/10"
16286,"this is one of the best games i have ever and if i like fps games you should get this
"
16287,"20 horas jugadas. De las cuales 17 fueron jugando lobbys con mods.

Esto puede ser algo que a muchos les interese, ya que es algo fuera de lo comun. Pero para mi, que soy un jugador que juega lo que se le ofrece es algo molesto.


7/10 despues de 6 a√±os, claro."
16288,"The last Call of Duty to not nerf weapons because of 10 year old kids whining about it, that feature has allowed me to run around with: scavanger, commando, danger close, C4 and the RPG at all times. I have laid on my back and jacked with this game in the background sooooo many times.  If there was ever a cross between Mr. Krabs and Mike Tyson, the result would be Modern Warefare 2. Also, I enjoy those burger town hamburgers hmmmmmm."
16289,"I joined a team deathmatch 6v6 game on literally the smallest map

16292,"i do not recommend this game, because in multiplayer there could be a hacked server resulting in unlocking EVERYTHING, for some people its AWESOME, but not to me because it just ruins the point in multiplayer with unlocking everything altogether, so i would like a refund because of that, thats the reason for MY refund"
16293,Best game ever made.
16294,"because i recommend the game, is why i recommend the game."
16295,Brutal online gaming. People love to hack into the game. Doesnt make the game fun at all. Please fix!!
16296,"Hai guys, i recommend this game if you love amazing explosions, fire fights, blowing people's heads off, and are a sniper and shotgun fan like me. I just love running around blowing people away with a nice blast from my M1014, or popping heads with my intervention. ^.^"

16303,Best release of COD ever made. To bad COD sucks now days
16304,"good game!
"
16305,"This is how i got a vac ban, would recommend. It is the only multiplayer game i would hack, becuase most of the hacks are basically just silly mods."
16306,The best from the series.
16307,fuck this to many moders
16308,"I like the campaign and, even more, the special operations very much: they are fun to play with a friend and, some of them, very challenging. I prefer those missions which don't have a timer and you don't have to hurry up to finish them. Chill out and play them your way.

About the player vs. player part of the game, which I'm not interested in, I've read in other player's opinions that it's also very well done.

What do I miss in this game? A cooperative campaign, like in CoD World at War, and a FOV slider."
16309,"[h1]Wouldn't get this game for multiplayer anymore.[/h1]

Took me a long time to get a computer that could finally play this game, once I did I had some fun with the story mode and some the features on the Single Player side of the game.  The multi-player was fun as long as you where not in a hacked lobby (which was 99% of all lobbies at one point) and now I have no idea if multi-player in this game works anymore.  Why I would get the mods that added a server list so that I could avoid the hacked lobbies in match-making, which Activision shut down sadly."
16310,Needs more achievements :D
16311,Best game ever!!!
16312,Gut
16313,call of brody is a game about befriending people online
16314,"Tons of hacking on the servers, not worth playing in single player, not worth spending $20 on. But you could go ahead and get it and have fun playing against predominately level 70 pricks that probably hacked to get there in the first place"
16315,this is a great game
16316,"Campaign and Special Ops work great.  Multi-player 75% of the time is hacked.  If you're buying for multi-player, I would not recommend.  Before Hackers 8/10 | After Hackers 5/10"
16317,This is a fun game!
16318,In my opinion the best CoD so far.
16319,This game is really fun :)
16320,"VAC is shit and bans people who are great at this game.....Your auto system has failed me on CS go.
"
16321,"one of the best games , in love with this game since 2010"
16322,"Awesome game,"
16323,"After the awesome first Modern Warfare the series just got fucked up. The beginning of that made MW2.

Story sucks compared to MW1. Where MW1 tried to create a ""authentic"" atmosphere, MW2 is just unrealistic and ridiculous. It had its moment though. The gameplay is mostly ok; there is not much evolution, but with some interesting, but infrequent, levels which give you the choice of how to act. The SP is worth a try, even though it isn't as good as MW1.

What totally fucks it up is the MP. MW1 was basically good, but had some issues. Instead of fixing those, Activision deceided to screw the game totally. Here are some reasons. If you are a fan of MW2, please do me a favour, and explain how you can enjoy the game with such problems.

-Way too small maps for the amount of players. Clusterfuck all day long.
-Complemented with a stupid spawnsystem. 
-Matchmaking, no dedicated servers.
-Killstreaks. Fuck sake, I don't get it. How can people enjoy it, getting instantly raped 6 or 7 times in a row by a guy in a OP Apache in a game which is all about CQB?
-Stupid perk system. Why the hell is there a perk which increases your bullet-damage?!
-Zero weapon balance. G18, enough said.
-Hitdetection and hitboxes. Watching killcames in this game makes me sick.

-And last but not least a totally immature community which is screaming ""ANAL"" in voicechat almost the whole time. 

I don't understand how this game can be so popular. I also don't understand why Activision decided to kill the franchise and create the CoD disease we have today. Get MW2 for the SP or the COOP. The only way you can have fun with the MP is in a private lobby with 3 of your friends, disabled killstreaks and some rules."
16324,gay af full of dropshottng ump45 sweaty nerd bogan inbreds
16325,old but still my favorite game but I never did have the dlc maps
16326,"would be fun, if it were not for all the cheating available."
16327,"No. The past is the past. Fuck this game. Fuck this franchise. And fuck you.
























And your mom.






























And your sister






























And whatever pet you currently own at the moment.






















And the government.





















Did i mention that this game sucks now?































"
16328,PAVLE CAR
16329,"Absolutely astounding game, whenever I play this game I get the feeling that there was passion put into this. Sure it's shooter game and shooters usually don't try to be much more than just a generic action game. And you wouldn't be wrong to call this game one. However this is one damn good shooter game with a terrific single player campaign, amazing and sort of memorable soundtrack, and great effects and gameplay. If you want a good call of duty game that isn't Black Ops 1 or 2 buy this game.

*this is my old review from a while back, like to keep it for old nostalgia sake*
‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

This game is great there is some random glitches but good this game can be sad in an emotional way and very messed up but it makes you think about the world today."
16330,Best COD's Multiplayer.
16331,yes im FaZe and banned in MW2
16332,"dont buy this, play on alternative ways ( u can find a lot on the net). matchmaking is horrible, hit detecion is not set properly. not to mention the number of cheaters. 

play repzmw2 instead, it's free, just google it. these servers don't have cheaters and lags"
16333,"Awesome first person shooter game out there brilliant campaign story online badass battles with friends and anyone! 

10/10 brilliant"
16334,How to get a vac ban on your profile that will last forever: play mw2.
16335,"(MULTIPLAYER) . First I played fine and have a lot of fun but now is impossible to join a normal game EVERY LOBBY IS HACKED ITS HARD TO GET A NORMAL LOBBY, they mess up with the rank and chalenges and make the game impossible to play fine, VAC ban doesnt work. I hope some day Steam fix this because is really impossible to play like this. 

(HISTORYMODE) Nothing to say just play COD4 and enjoy one of the best histories of false war (the real war on this world is a lot different)"
16336,"Good, but overrun with freakin hackers. The multiplayer is fun and engaging as long as its not hacked.
"
16337,"Greatest Call of Duty game, watch out for all the hackers in multiplayer. The game is better on consoles, but still great on PC. Recommend it!!"
16338,"Hate wars
Play Call of Duty

8/10"
16339,"Okay I'm not gonna lie i used to play this game in 2012 so fucking much on console it was a damn good game. But now its like Just Modders and shit, Look for a TDM game you get Domination somehow, i just miss the good old days with this game. Multiplayer is like meh play it sometimes. Campaign is still a classic its amazing you can play it like 50 times and still not get bored of it. Honestly its a  very very very good game, i would love to see a remaster of this. Mulitplayer is kinda  playable. I recommend it even though Multiplayer is kinda playable.


Edit: I have downloaded the IW4X basically like MW2 but with custom servers and other extra stuff. I would recommend getting IW4X which is free btw. People are still playing it which is good there are gamemodes that are not in MW2 but are  so much fun. This video should help :) [spoiler] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZYx0em5C_4 [/spoiler]"

16341,"Modern Warfare 2 was forged out of the popularity of the first Modern Warfare and shows the signs of standardization that would turn the series into an annual outing affair.

A solid sequel to its predecessor, it's more of a refining of the formula than a real expansion or improvement. Good, but not amazing."
16342,"This game was the best in the franchise, The multiplayer is amazing, the graphics are amazing and you just feel so small from the world. This game dose have hackers online yet not that many as for say World at war which also is an amazing game. It really feel's relistic in every way possible, and yes, regenorating health is possible in real life, Thank you game theroy for telling me that. The story for most games are to focused on one thing and really stick with it. This game's story is all mixed up and with giant plot twists no one would expect. The modern warfare franchise has always amazed me in every way possible, but this one was different, it was just... mind blowing. I recomend it to really any one."
16343,Nice hackers but always fun to play :D
16344,I need help. this game is great and fun but hackers..... i went into a modded lobby and they put a mini map over my entire screen so at this point it was un play able so i left and come to find out when i joined another lobby it was still there. PlEaSe Help

From 21/5/15 no hackers have been seen yet.

16360,"Dont buy it, get MW1 instead !!"
16361,Really nice game. It's much faster to aim and shoot and do other stuff than it is on the PS3. You can gain more skill on the PC then on console. But one thing that bothers me is switching from the original game to the multiplayer.
16362,"I like it, exept this is how it is:

me:Lets play some MW2!!!
person: lets play MW2 and make someone mad!
me:SOOO CLOOSE TO RANK UP!!!!!
person: lets make him max rank!
me:NOOOOO!!!!

so... in the end... i am like prestige 5 because of hackers."

Like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, in my opinion, those are the two best-selling games in history of Call of Duty with amazing fields, where either you are a cliffhanger, or you are the mafia... I highly recommend you to buy this game...

16382,Still a lot of fun to play. I used to play it on the Xbox 360 when it first came out. Great memories.... Hackers are a problem but I'd say 60%-70% of games are good. Pretty tight community too.

16397,"like every cod game the last years single player epic multiplayer sucks, only constant rape on tiny maps"
16398,Very nice game!
16399,"Another episode of Agrobal reviews an FPS xD

Oh, wow. This is the peak of mindless fun. I honestly liked the campaign. For the most part, it was boring but the plot built up with my monotonous expression on my face until I felt I was engaged enough to want to finish it. They managed to make a badass character and I dont think I need to mention that character. Infinity ward know how to do good storytelling but I'm just not that invested in the setting or gameplay. Why am I playing it? Because it was just there on my library and I wanted to give it a review. So I beat the campaign. For any CoD fan, I'm sure you will like this more than me. Grab it."
16400,Only good call of duty game that exists. That simple.
16401,very good game :)
16402,i woud if recommed but when i join a team death match its like a custom tdm were YOU cant see names or kILL ANY ONE PLZ FIX THE HACKER  I WANT A NORMAL TDM
16403,"I've bought this game 3 years ago. This game is really wonderful when I played on Single Player campaign and Speical Ops with co-op. But the problem is: when I played on Multiplayer, there are hackers around but there are few of them. I really hope that VAC is going to take care of them."
16404,"You start off by axcidently starting a war with Russia.
Countless soldiers die in an effort to keep you entertained. 
And few soldiers die who make you sad Ghost for example and Roach(yourself)

I wish they dove more into fighting the Russians. If cod brought more of an open world aspect I feel that would be cool. But probably wont be done.

I recommend this game if you like fast pass shooters and slightly unrealistic."
16405,"Broken piece of garbage. No dedicated servers, player counter is broken, the in-game invite function doesn't even work properly, hackers everywhere, the community for this is dying out. I played for one hour before someone randomly hacked me to lvl 70 and unlocked every gun and attachment upon joining a match. Get this if you want to see a great example of a publisher who doesn't give a flying fuck about PC."
16406,Best CoD multiplayer.
16407,"This is a good game. It has a good story, It has good graphics, Good wepaons, Characters etc. 
The only thing is, That to me, The story is kinda short compred to other COD and other game storylines.
Multiplayer iss good, But isnt when you get into the hacked lobbies, It may sound fun, But its actually just really annoying, Really anoying. overall though, Multiplayer works well, Nomreal connection problems. 
Overall, Real good game, Real good."

16437,Paid mods
16438,By far the best campaign out of all of the COD series but don't even bother to install multiplayer.
16439,I wish this version had bots like in the consoles.
16440,"Every lobby is hacked, basically unplayable."
16441,Best game ever made!
16442,"Don't buy this. Why? This is why: Hackers, modded lobbies, tryhards, need to go on? I gave this a positive rating because I remember the good old days back when this was newly released. If you don't have this game and want to buy it for nostalgia, don't, your memories will be ruined. That is all."
16443,pk je peux pas jouer avec une manette de xbox one !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   ! ! ! ! !
16444,The best Call Of Duty Modern Warfare Ever!!!
16445,"One of the best COD's ever been made, but the problem it the modded Lobbies - if you even find one tho.
The hacker fcked the game but it still nice."
16446,Bem loco
16447,Call of duty is in my oppinion the best shooting game throughout a variety of mods and stuff in multyplayer and also really good single player
16448,Great game and i love it!

16450,"vac banned for hacking, shared game and other guy got vac banned from it,  guy turned out to be a jerk

10/10 bought on ps3 instead"
16451,"Not bad game, you can do whatever you want in this Modern Warfare... like Trickshot's with your friends.
9/10"
16452,"Alltough it's a little old by now, it was one of the latest good call of duty games made.
Singleplayer is diverse and unique, and a good follow up for modern warfare 1 which in my opinion had one of the best single player campains ever. The game will drag you all over the world while plot twists and unexpected events turn the story line into one you'll definitely enjoy playing."
16453,"A fantastic follow up to the first Modern Warfare and a great addition to the Call of Duty Series.
Modern Warfare 2 follows the heart stopping story of the first MW and MW2 adds a lot of new gameplay mechanics like attachments on weapons, better graphics, etc. The idea of Russia attacking U.S. is just incredible, seeing that any country can be vulnerable to attacks of foreign soil. I truly recommend this game.

Pros:
-Better graphics
-New gameplay mechanics
-Story
-Multiplayer class and customization

Cons:
-Multiplayer sometimes filled with hacked lobbies
-Sound of guns are good but not perfect

Total Score: 9/10"
16454,"good love it

16455,"Good game but filled with hackers,campers and noob tubers 420/69 would be noob tubed agen."
16456,10/10 would vac ban again
16457,"MAC VERSION: A WONDERFUL GAME THAT HIT THE MARKET IN 2007. IN AROUND 2010 SOME CREATIVE SOULS DECIDED TO MAKE A PIRATE VERSION USING AN ENGINE CALLED WINE FOR MAC. THE GAME RAN SOOOOO SMOOTHLY ON A MACBOOK PRO BACK THEN (WITH HARDWARE DATING BACK TO AROUND 2010).
NOW SOMETHING WENT WRONG. TERRIBLY WRONG. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT THE SAME MAC FROM LATE 2010 CAN'T RUN THE GAME PROPPERLY DUE TO INCOMPETENT PEOPLE AT ASPYR WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE COMPETANCE TO TRANSGAME ANYTHING. TODAY - OF SOME BIZARE REASON - THE SPECS TO RUN AN OLD AND OUTDATED GAME HAS BEEN CHANGED TO NEW SPECS, AND THOSE WHO MADE THINGS POSSIBLE FOR AROUND 5 YEARS AGO, WEREN'T INCLUDED. PRETTY SAD."
16458,best cod after cod 4
16459,"Would I recommend this game back in 2009-10? Yes. 
Would I recommend this game now? No.

The game was amazing back in it's day, but now it's just filled with low-life hackers, who ruin the game. 
When you want to play some TDM, 25% of the time you will be placed in a hacked lobby and promoted to 10th prestige without your permission (Happened to me). Also because of all the hackers/ the game not being updated, the population of the game is about 500 people, resulting in you playing with the game people from day to day. Don't get it, the game is dead. Yet Activision still makes you pay ¬£20 for a out-dated game."
16460,"This game is great. USUALLY. The multiplayer is next to unplayable because of all the hackers. You are most likely going to join a lobby, (which some hacker will be in control off) and get boosted to Level 70. Then, Valve Anti-Cheat is going to VAC ban you because you were boosted. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a waste of money and a terrible experience. Everything else is great though."
16461,"I played this game for 32 days time on the Xbox 360. It was my first Call of Duty. Now I've played 3.2 hours of its PC brother.

Picking this game up today via the Activision sale was the best PC game purchase I've made on my ascendant rig. The euphoria that I once experienced when on a major killstreak or getting a string of quickscopes has been extraordinarily revitalized in 1440p, 90fps on the PC version today. Now, while TDM and FFA are the only modes with enough players to establish a great lobby, it's incredibly worth it to experience ""the most fun I've had on my Xbox"" all over again. I urge anyone who is undecided about this game in 2015 to go ahead and buy it, or you may miss out on the shrinking following entirely, and among the most fun that Activision has ever allowed it's customers to have.

Lastly, as far as hackers are concerned, I had one game where everyone was forced to use the Intervention on Rust (which was entirely enjoyable in my taste), and that was it."
16462,twat
16463,its awsome
16464,"This was the last game on the CoD franchise that was good. Story is really nice, multiplayer WAS good, but now its full of boosters and etc, but it's still ok. 9.25/10"
16465,probably one of the best CoDs of all time the campaign is insane after beating it on xbox still had to do it on pc ! 10/10 must buy you wont regret
16466,"Still one of the best Call of Duty games around! The multiplayer is still healthy with plenty of matches to get into. If you do play online though I reccomend the MW2 MP FOV Changer mod as there is no way to change it in game and the default was very low, giving me motion sickness."
16467,"Good game, I personally prefer the Moder Warfare series. Worth the money, good story and alright graphics, especially for when it was released. Some problems with multi-player such as running into modded games and things, a server browser would be ideal but IW won't update this game anymore."
16468,Nothing beats the old call of duty 2 & 4
16469,Had a lot of fun with this game on Xbox and PC Platforms. One of the best Multiplayer takes in a Call of Duty Game in my opinion. Would recommend to any shooter fans out there.
16470,Have had hours of fun playing this!
16471,"one for the best FPS game in my life, love COD forever:)"
16472,Great game from Infinity ward and Activision. One of my all time favourite Call of Duty games and great to play especially oin the computer.
16473,Still a good game. Not quite up there as COD 4.
16474,love it

16482,"Eh.

I enjoy the game, and I recomend it.

But not on PC.

I was trying to play it legitimately (Multiplayer)

I got to Prestige 2 in less than 10 hours because of hacked lobbies.

So the true problem is the amount of hackers.

Fun game, too many hackers."
16483,"I recommend it, only prob is tht multiplayer is filled with hackers >_>
I was private first class and when i joined a server my game froze then i got promoted to general of the army.... Whats the sense of me playing anymore if i reach the rank i wanted to play for... dumb hackers!"
16484,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo."
16485,i have loved this game from day one it is in my opinion the best call of duty game ever created matched only by its predecessor hell this game runs so well i can play it on my shit laptop max graphics with little to no lag
16486,Hacks. Hacks Everywhere.
16487,"I bought it to bring back some fun childhood memories from playing this game, and I think it's well worth it. I have found much less hackers than I anticipated and the game is just as fun as always. Even if you dont like the multiplayer, the campaign + spec ops sure is hella fun. Recommended. 8/10"
16488,"Don't let the age of this title fool you. I had it installed then they did a major steam update and required a full download again. Unfortunitely I pay per/GB. So years later finally decided to redownload it. LOVE IT! There are a lot of cutscenes, almost like a mini movie sort of game. the graphics are crazy good! I reeally don't remember it being this good back in the day. its every bit as good as BF3 except doesnt have to login to battlelog or whatever its called."
16489,"Great game, a must have!"
16490,love the story line. nice graphic awesome gameplay. :). oh and its fixed by VAC to newbie who was wanted by hackers :v 10/10
16491,"Everyone sucks so if you've tried CS and are trash at it (like me), and you like things like ADS then maybe this game is for you
Suprisingly it still has people playing, hacked lobbbies happen maybe 1/30 games
And of course it's still fun as hell, super fast arcadey gameplay, and it's pretty easy to carry; if you can move a mouse towards someone and click you're good to go"
16492,"Love this  game its my favorite cod i just bought it today and its worth the price, especially because its 50% off"
16493,"Gameplay: Good
Stability: Good
Controls: Acceptable
Difficulty: Acceptable
Sounds: Good
Graphics: Decent
Music: Acceptable
Story: Amazing

Other Notes: 
Kind of old but has an amazing story towards it. I strongly reccomend it if you love games with a good story, The online gameplay is alright, Alot of modders and hackers but is still very fun. 

Personal Grade: B-"
16494,"Wait...

16496,WWOOOOO HOOOOOO IM BACK
16497,"It's a good game but too short, i beat the game in 5 hours."
16498,For me this was and will probably be the best Call of Duty game.
16499,Terrific game! Best Call of Duty in my opinion. Great on console but incredible on PC.

16504,"Call of Duty... One of the best FPS series available since years ago. This particular game is old enough that it will run on pretty much any PC / console that's still around, but it offers all the action and quality you expect from a succesful franchise. I recommend this game to any serious gamer, who doesn't mind going a little retro. If you're not into older games, check out the newer releases! ;)"
16505,10/10 MLG gaben
16506,gg
16507,Probably the best COD to date. I wish Activision would go back to this play model.
16508,"Its simple, best CoD ever made! From story, through CO-OP missions to be played with friends, till multiplayer which is still awesome to be played!"
16509,Great shooter!
16510,cool cool
16511,"Ok so first i thought Mw2 ok ok old game good ratings Hmmmm maybe later .... A week after Hey Guys I got MW2 dont look at the time i have played but all can i say is that if you want a good olde game with good story (Better Than mw3 that what i think) this game is for you .
Pros:
-No exos
-No Futuristic stuff
-No Jetpacks
Cons:
-No Kevin Spacey
-Hackers
-Trolls
10/10 Would add Kevin Spacey"
16512,best
16513,My favourite game is Call of Duty and minecraft
16514,"Overall a good multiplayer expirience. Mulitiple problems do still exist, including poor servers, hacked users, and low usage for online gameplay. However, overall, the pros outweigh the cons."
16515,if i were you i would spend the 21.99 on the game i had lots of fun playing it and met new people joined new clans
16516,Developer: Infinity Ward - The best! New Black Ops developed by Treyarch - sucks!
16517,"MW2 has some features that no other game has:
-420 blaze it
-360 noscope off the top of rust
-quickscopes
-raging kids when they get_rekt

BEST MLG SIMULATOR 420/10"
16518,Brilliant Game!!! love it!
16519,Probably the best or 2nd best Cod I have ever tried.Campaign is fun and hard.
16520,"A very fun game when it was in its prime. The killstreak rewards are cool and challenging to get. Some of weapons are sort of overpowered and toxic for the game, but I would say that it is a great game overall. 9/10"
16521,"planning to buy this in 2020? do yourself a favour and don't!!! if you're into single player, i don't see why not ^^"
16522,"Shoot Shoot Bang Bang Gun Gun!

I seriously only got this for multiplayer. Can care less about the story. Last decent CoD in my opinion. If you've played any CoD then you've played them all."
16523,"Single player is awesome! but multiplayer is a downhill. i like the game! but i would just get waw. it has zombies and not as much hackers. i would love to play with people around the world, but thay can be dicks by hacking. im going to give the game a thums up, but i want people to get the game and NOT hack so i can enjoy multiplayer. i would give multiplayer thums down. i dont hate it, but for god sake STOP hacking!!"
16524,"[b]-----EDIT-------[/b]
A lot of people have been accusing me of cheating in MW2 Multiplayer lately.
This is entirely false, I did not cheat whatsoever. At the time I was playing there were (and probably still are) A LOT of hacked lobbies. What happened to me was I logged into a modded game. After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying ""[i]Bad host[/i]"". So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried. I looked up on some forum, found that people encountered the same problem and that you need to contact support as soon as possible otherwise it'll ban you. I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying ""[i]Cheat detected[/i]"". I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned. [b]ALSO NOTE:[/b] I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is ""solutioNNN"" and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.
[b]-------------------[/b]
Singleplayer: Wonderful!
Special Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great!
Multiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN.
I do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline.
Oh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before [b] getting a possible permanent ban[/b]."
16525,Best IW Game :D
16526,"So much history with this game, only wish i didnt quit back then...."
16527,"I am upset with this game because of the matchmaking system. It automatically searches for players in your area, and since there was not many i couldn't hardly get into a game, so me and my 2 other friends would just play private matches. However you cannot level up doing this and 1 of my friends was the highest level so he had all the guns me and my other friend didn't have. This felt unfair since we couldn't level up, therefore we decided to download some hacks just so we could actually level ourselves up quickly. We didn't hack agaist other players so we didn't ruin anyone else's experience, we just wanted to be able to enjoy the game that we payed for. However, we ended up getting VAC banned for this. I do not believe this was a fair ban but whatever. Now I can no longer even play the game. What garbage."
16528,Modern Mexican Knife fighting 2    Nuff Said!
16529,"Still a great game to play now. This was the last COD MP that I actually enjoyed. Newer CODs are just not good IMO. 

The Special Ops is great fun and quite challenging. Great to team up with a friend too. The campaign story is great one of the best in COD's history.

This COD however does have the problem that most COD MPs have. Bad Community, lots of aggro 13 year old kids shouting over voip. I hear its even worse on consoles. Silly weapons and attachment like akimbo and heartbeat sensors. I did 120 hours on MP and I wont return to be fair."
16530,Best part of mw!
16531,Love the co-op version of this game. Bring the real shit if you play multiplayer these guys are good
16532,NICE GAME BROOOOOO
16533,First match was paired with Shrek and Hitler and Shrek yelled Shrekt on the chatbox when he got the game winning kill. 10/10
16534,awesome campaign and multiplayer ! SPEC OPS ARE GREAT. but not that special so i'd rate it only 12/9 doritos :P
16535,it sucks.... mw1 is better cheat protected and the gameplay is aweful
16536,great game
16537,"crazy game, frustrating at times but amazing"
16538,"Best cod for multiplayer, 11/10"
16539,"Multiplayer is filled with Hackers and cheaters. I have 7 hours of game time and im already at Level 70, all weapons and attachements unlocked. All challenged are done. Theres no dedicated servers so you have no control over which servers you joined. So you always end up in hacked servers who hack your own game like changing all your classes names and leveling you up to the max.

Also, im always stuck to NAT Type: Strict (IW online crap) so its making it difficult to join good games. I can waste over 30 minutes of leaving/joining games before i can find a good one. I did try a lot of things to make my NAT Type: OPEN without success.

Overall, the game is awesone but hackers are everywhere and ruined the game. Dont waste your money on this one. Matchmaking is BS aswell as not having dedicated servers."
16540,it is fucking aweome
16541,"SO ein schlechtes Spiel habe ich noch nie gesehen...lags auf niedrigen einstellungen, slechte maps, schlechtes movement, kack hitboxen, schlechtes Waffen-balancing, tuber und hacker

16543,"This is the game for you if you like shooting things with guns. Cause there are guns in it. And shooting. After I beat the storymode of the game I was invited to shoot more things in multiplayer. I guess I'm good at shooting things, but I really felt like I could've shot more things. With guns."

I remember having the most fun with this game to the point where I beat it on every difficulty, twice, collected all the Intel and got 100% of the achievements, definitely worth the time spent. 

[h1]Storyline[/h1] 10/10 I've never played another campaign quite like it. Every level you played felt fresh didn't become a grind to go from A to B, there was always an objective that followed the storyline and helped push the character development was the story unfolded. 

[h1]Characters[/h1] Best Characters of any game I've played, Price well... everyone loves Price, Soap and Ghost (RIP)

[h1]Co-op[/h1] So many hours of fun and pain trying to beat all these and get 3 stars, Juggernaut Fevela lvl..... crazy. 

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1] Lots of great levels and not really any bad ones or unbalanced, Weapons were great fun, lots of them, attachments and perks to use, Akimbo G18 and Riot Shields were my favorite and killstreaks felt rewarding and carepackages were exciting to use and soul crushing if you got killed and it was an AC130 or Chopper Gunner D:

I can really say anything bad about this game except perhaps the multiplayer is kinda dead and only supports matchmaking so theres no server browser or active community servers to keep the game alive like COD4 has. 

[h1][i]9.5/10[/i][/h1] [i]- Best COD game, Multi is somewhat dead[/i]"
16565,I really liked this game but its multiplayer was ruined by cheaters and hackers >:-[
16566,Umm this game is shit the gameplay is amazing its just i got VAC banned for no fucking reason so im pissed
16567,best multiplayer of call of duty
16568,awful
16569,Good old classic but it is better if you play it with friends.
16570,"Originally I was VERY dissapointed to learn that there was no LOCAL multiplayer with this game, which is the reason I bought it. I could remember the fun we used to have on Rust and Airport and all those maps, but do not buy this game on steam for that, because it just ain't there. Why? I have no idea.

However, I have recently completed the campaign on veteran, and regardless of the omission of local multiplayer, this game is fun, there's no denying that. It's the only Call of Duty worth having on pc in my opinion; a testament to how good a franchise can get. You still have the campaign and all the Special Ops missions, some that require a friend to play with online, but most don't. And the same old CoD mechanics mean you can heal back up to full from almost dead, simply by sitting in a corner for a bit. BUT, I simply enjoyed this polished, smooth-running game! And I'm glad I bought it. Recommended for fans of FPS games and a bit of dumb fun. ;)"
16571,"This game was unfortunately the downfall of CoD. While it fixed many previous inbalances from the first modern warfare, it introduced many new overpowered abilities such as the commando perk and dual wielding shotguns. Not to mention how crazy devs went with killstreaks and even included the game ending tactical nuke. The game is still a bit of fun as it has very satisfying gunplay and can be very intense, but good luck playing some of the more tactical game modes that require teamwork over deathmatch. It also is very easy to get cheap kills that take no skill or for someone to cheaply kill you without really using any skill. The skill cap in general is very low as well seeing as it pretty much an arena shooter with slower and simpler movent, iron sights, and regenerating health. 

On top of all of this, this game is a very bad pc port. It lacks basic features that previous pc CoD titles had such as dedicated servers that support up to 64 players. You can also apparently get vac banned for adding a fov slider, a feature that should have already been in the game in the first place

16591,"Where do I begin? Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. It's been a long time since the glory days of CoD. 2009 seems like a lifetime ago, yet again like yesterday. A whole FPS generation has grown up since this game came out. Hard to believe it's been 8 years. I was 12 when it released and I remember begging my mom to let me buy it for my Xbox 360. One week after launch, I got it. Playing Call of Duty online seemed like the most amazing thing ever. I remember getting up at 6am one summer morning just to play because I was so excited. UMP Silenced ready to go on Skid-row. In 2012, I moved to PSN and played it there. In fact, I played this CoD for many years. When a new CoD came out, I always came back to this. The DLCs came out along with the new Stimulus playlists I remember. Then there was the care package glitch, where you could climb and double tap right on the d-pad to get double care packages. Remember 3rd person cage match? Remember boosting in FFA with a tactical insertion with a buddy? Remember trying to find your way into a 10th prestige lobby from TTG? Remember holding down X to lock the FFA lobby? Remember having buttons in your name? Remember FAL rapid fire mod? Remember the shotgun attachment on hardcore? Remember the Rust pipe glitch? Remember Michael Myers? Cops n' Robbers? Remember clan battles and 1v1 quickscopes? Remember trickshotting and trying to go big on YouTube? Remember calling that guy bad for hardscoping? Remember being amazed that someone had fall camo a week after launch? Remember getting online on a Friday night just to have fun? MW2 gave us that. Memories you can't replace. I made many friends on this game and I can tell you I have well over 1500 hours in game across my years of playing on the different platforms. I hope one day they remaster this gem of a shooter for the next generation of young FPS gamers to enjoy. Call of Duty may be a thing of the past for most of us and some may just say it's another video game, but Modern Warfare 2 holds a special place in my childhood and brings home the title of the greatest FPS of all time."
16592,If you like hackers you'll love this game.
16593,pizza
16594,"As you can see i played this game for 4.4 hrs, half the time i was eating a melon it was a good melon 7/4 would melon again"
16595,"""A classic, can't be missed! Still worth it!"" 

I wrote the above review in 2015, about 5 years after I had been playing this for hundreds of hours on both ps3 and computer (including multiplayer hours). It's half 2017 now and I have yet again rediscovered this game. A friend and I have picked up this game again in an attempt to complete the special ops co-op on veteran difficulty. It hasn't disappointed at all, it's has been one of the most enjoyable things I have played in the past few years.

I have now finally unlocked all possible achievements for the game and it was amazing. Coming back to this game and reliving the campaign but on highest difficulty this time has been one of the best decisions in my gaming carreer."
16596,"Singleplayer --> 8
Multyplayer --> 7-8 (now pretty dead tho)"
16597,"Great game, a COD classic. The memories come back when I enter a game of TDM on Terminal or Afghan (or Rust for that matter). But the game is only enjoyable when there are light to no mods present. I don't like it when all the lobbies I get into are modded. Yeah the mods are fun and all, but it just gets annoying after a while. Other than that, awesome game. Oh, and it would be great if this and the other CODs on Steam went on sale more often or went down in price. $21.99 for a game that came out around 6 years ago? That's a little ridiculous. Good thing I got the game for $5 when Staples closed down :)"
16598,most amazing fps shooter ever love this game perks are amazing fun 2 play :)
16599,shitty fucking game
16600,"It's  a great game
"
16601,shithead game
16602,"Quite possibly the best of the call of duties, everyone who enjoys FPS's should play this game."
16603,nice game
16604,"Damn, this game is still fun to play."
16605,Awesome game but there are some hackers
16606,the best cod ever!
16607,It's aiight
16608,"I got my stats hacked to prestige mode, I was only level 12 and now I'm at level 1 again ;-;
(SO MANY HACKED SERVERS)
Never play Free for all
Never play ground war
Never Play domination
Always Play TDM"
16609,"This is my favorite game. But I allowed my friend to control my computer over an application and he gave me hacks for the game. I did not want them he said it'll be a surprise. I was then VAC  Banned for somehthing I did not do. Fuck you steam.


Reading this 2 years later - 

Why are you lying"
16610,i cant find any server for multiplayer
16611,if the game didnt contain mods and it had dedicated servers it would be fine
16612,This Game is one of the best games in the history of fifa. Michael Jordan loves this game because you can golf in it.
16613,"its k 

now its just filled with hacked servers and idk if you can get banned for that?"
16614,"I will tell you all the pros and cons about this game, so sit back and read. I aslo will be going through each and every topic such as maps guns weapons and the profomence of the game it self so you looking to but the game, so read this and you will know

This game is very cheep to buy for such a popular game that is ranked 3 place out of the 13 call of duty games, but how do you know if it's a good game or not? Well I have been playing this game for about 2 weeks and this gives me a ok idea on where this game is heading.   


First before playing the game you have to download of corse. But is it easy? Yes very easy. You buy the game then it will automatically say download witch should take about 3 hours so I would do it over night. Then you play.

Guns and other
    Inside tThe game is ratted 7/10 mainly becuase of their only being like 15 assault guns and same with snipers, pistols and shot guns. Witch is not enogh, becuase for a fact advanced warfare has over 700 guns with all the advised supply drops added so modern ware get more guns and other equipment like scoops and grenades.


Maps 
Their aren't that maney maps. I am not sure how maney maps a call of duty game would have but I know for a fact that their is like 5 or 6 maps and only 2 of them in my opinion good. I would really like to see a nother reamke of nuke town in their to keep things modern.


Playing the game it self
This is a very easy thing to answer becuase IT is a 10/10 the game play is great you can easy know if you have killed a player or not and its not like all the master proses are the beast but me being a level 23, it is not that difficult to get about 7 kills each round.

Rattling the game would be a 8/10 mainly BECUASE of the choice of weapons and aslo not have gold camo to feel a little more advanced but for this price i defenilty recomaned and play it Becuase of the small price given.

"
16615,"Extremely addicting multiplayer FPS, would recommend 100% if you're into this style of game, one of my favourite all time multiplayer games."
16616,"I like this game.The graphics and weapons are my favorites.Enjoy this game!!
Bye"
16617,the game crashes like fuck any time you do milti-player and solo i would not buy the game
16618,"Glad I bought this game as I loved it back when I use to play on xbox, It was my first online game I ever played I still recommend it to anyone who loves first person shooters."
16619,Good game!!
16620,By far the best call of duty game. Still enjoy playing it to this day.
16621,"Awesome, adictive, but spoilt a bit by hackers...."
16622,banned for no reason DONT PLAY!!!
16623,Very Best Game Ever. I recommend this to Everyone.
16624,awesome mp game
16625,"Well, my feeling about this game is actually mixed, still it's more positive than negative, perhaps 55% vs 45%?
TL; DR:
[u] Pros[/u]
It's the last CoD made by Jason & Vince team, worth playing for this reason alone.
[u] Cons[/u]
[b]SP[/b]: too much Michael Bay and little (if any) Steven Spielberg;
[b]MP[/b]: No dedicated servers, tiny maps.
This game basically started the sh!tstorm against the franchise.
Howerver, I still suggest buying it, but only at 50% off or more discount.

Will update to a full review when I have the mood, mainly for comparison to CoD4, for which I've written a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/pheabus2005/recommended/7940/]longer review[/url]."
16626,"easwily the best call of duty game ever, graphics are amazing and pleasant, maps are varied and flawless, guns look and sound awesome, controls are easy to get used to, highly replayable, modern warfare has the best story of an fps ion my opinion.

only drawback is the annoying connecting to host during multiplayer games, other than that i highly recommend this legend"
16627,"nice
"
16628,Best CoD.
16629,This was an amazing game I thought i did not fnish the campaign but i finished it in 5 hours I was so happy. Spoiler Alert! : I killed Sheapard at the end. 100000000/10
16630,Great Game. The best one made out of their series.
16631,i love this game and  it 3 pirson mod  i give it a 10 out of 10
16632,"This game blows chunks, it used to be fun before every single game was modded and hacked. 1 out of 100."
16633,"Of all the Modern Warfare games, this one is the best. I don't think there has been a game better than this made in the Call of Duty franchise to this day."
16634,"I become genuinely sad thinking about all of the memories I made on this game, because of what it has become and because of the fact that those days are over and Modern Warfare 2 is dead. This game was literally my childhood to an extent and is also what I firmly believe to be one of the most beautiful games of all time. That is ofcourse coming from an original player, thinking on what it was then. Now adays it is nothing but hacked lobbies and emptiness. However, I think anyone that played the original can cosign on the fact that back when this game was new, it was nothing but beauty, 

Just look at my hours played. More than anyone else in this review thread. (Just noticed it only shows my hours played as 150 something. Which is WRONG. I have over 2,500 hours played on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2)"
16635,Still amazing like Call Of Duty 4
16636,Action Movie Simulator 2009
16637,The last good cod. RIP TT
16638,"For now lots of hackers, lag hosts, but that was the best CoD game."
16639,"great game you can run on ultra 60fps on a avarege gaming pc on my pc (office pc) it runs 50fps on med
full res"
16640,"Very addicting. Only downside, on almost every game, there are hackers/modders and it gets kinda dumb. But not In all lobbies."
16641,Modern Power
16642,"Got hacked by ""Sir Haxalot.""
Got quickscoped by ""Mr. Quikscopez.""
Got lectured by Barack Obama.
Got molested by Jerry Sandusky.

10/10 game
11/10 community"
16643,its okay
16644,"Solid gameplay.

If you can get an unmodded lobby.
And not have a hacker or aimbotter.

And there's really only team deathmatch to play any more."
16645,god game
16646,This was by far  the best cod ever made.
16647,epic online defenently a get
16648,"i bought this again after finishing up advanced warfare.
i wondered- had call of duty campaigns always been bad and i just had my teenager fanboy goggles on? 
or were they actually once good before mw3?

after replaying the campaign in mw2 i was pissed.they were so good.so so good. even now 6 years later, the mw2 campaign is ten times as intense as the last 3 call of duty titles. 

the multiplayer is beyond hacked, so don't plan on being able to play it outside of private games. i joined a match, it said ""hit space bar to unlock everything""  10 seconds later i was a level 55.so yeah. 

i found this for $8. and to replay the cutrain call of epic fps campagins one more time it was 110% a pleasure.
absolutely not worth paying $45 for the game and dlc as price on steam (that's insane activision. fix your pricing)
especially since the multiplayer is practically unplayable so that DLC will be useless.

(side note- my 270x was hitting like 300 fps on 1080p max. make sure you turn on the whatevertheycalleditbackthen-sync or your card will warm up pretty good)"
16649,this game is amazing with fantastic maps play and graphics
16650,"Nice gameplay, comparable to first Modern Warfare. Chapter ""No Russian"" does not add anything to the game's plot. Next time I will choose the option to skip that one."
16651,BEST GAME!10 out of 10!
16652,"Ramirez does everything
10/10"
16653,cul
16654,Best Call of Duty...No exo crap suits or crap ops will change that
16655,"Great Game.
"
16656,Very good game you should get it!
16657,Good game old but good :)
16658,not nice you kan kill my brothers in it.....
16659,"Don't buy if you wanna play fair online. I kept running into people with hacks. I got tired of it. Downloaded my own hacks to put them in their place and even it out for everyone else, BOOM! VAC ban. So enjoy some infinite grenade launchers"
16660,It use to be fun. Then Cheaters. Don't buy. Please. Save yourself.
16661,Very Nice Game But Alot of hackers ruin it
16662,.
16663,"CoD of Duty is pretty cool I guess except Ghosts is so much better then any of the other ones I highly reccomend ghosts because it takes all the worst parts of all the games and puts them together to create a really average game. This game is possibly gooder then ghosts but I think that ghosts is still good compared to black ops 2. FaZe hasn't yet accepted me into their sniping clan and this makes me sad.

yours sincerly

-a dedicated CoD of duty ghosts player"
16664,My best game
16665,this game is awesome had it to both xbox and pc. classic fps.
16666,Pretty good sequel to MW1
16667,yeah yeah love me some modern warfare
16668,"I was suppose to get this for my console but oh well.
 
Single Player story is great, I wasn't sure about the Multiplayer (never will I play Multiplayer).
Infinity Ward DLCs are not my thing to buy,
The weapons are nice.
 Down-side: Whatever you dislike.
 

Score: 80..../the many pristieges but really 100.00"
16669,"Love Call of duty, gotta play this classic."
16670,"Great singleplayer (last good CoD campaign), fun coop, fun multiplayer which got ruined by hackers and P2P servers."
16671,BEST GAME 2K15 BUT I GOT BANNED FOR USING FOV CHANGER SO YEAH SO MUCH FUN :/
16672,"CoD MW2 is a really fun FPS, but what I don't like about it is that it can be hacked very easily!"
16673,"It may not have the best graphics, and it may be already outdated by the new Call of Duty games, but its still a fun game to play, and online is fun for when you have free time, and its cheaper than the other new games, and you can easily run it in any pc or laptop, so its a why not option if you are looking for a shooter game with a good campaign mode and good online for free time."
16674,A beautiful game
16675,"This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing."
16676,"Not a bad game but it's 6 years old and should be bought much cheaper maderfaker, buy it somewhere else or on sale, because it's not worth 25‚Ç¨.."
16677,terraria rip off
16678,"Buy's game: Ok no hacking caillou just dont hack
5 hours later: You know what, i wanna host a hide and seek
De next day: Ima invite all my friends to get them to prestige 10 lv 70 unlock all because im a good guy!
De next day: Cheat detected? I dont use aimbot???
Checks Steam Profile: WTF VAC BANNED! I NEVER DID ANYTHING BAD! I ACTUALLY HELPED PEOPLE AND IT WAS PRIVATE MATCH!!

mlg/10 best vac ban simulator"
16679,"The Single Player is still one of the best CoD campaigns and contains some of the best action, suspense, characters, and gameplay of the series. However, I don't see much replay value in COD campaigns, and this one is no exception. Hans Zimmer score also makes the campaign fun as hell and ups the ante for every situation.

The Multiplayer is a different story. It's full of noobtoobers and hackers, even more hackers than the 360 version in 2009 when JTAGs were a thing. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun. In fact, it's even more fun than the 360 version. MW2 is pretty unbalanaced (noobtubes, OMA, Commando Pro, etc) but it's still a very fun gameplay experience.

8/10"
16680,"Great game dont get me wrong! I love this and would still be playing.. But stupid hackers are every where! My friend is now banned from modern warfare 2 because we were in a hacked lobby. YES, the hacker was fine, but not the innocent.. such bull****. He didnt hack yet he was banned. Good job VAC!!!!!!!!!! GOOD F****** JOB. Good game, non existent, I Bought it for PS3 recently too and hackers are there too. Sadly not worth the money"
16681,This game is fun when u dont lag lol but other than the lag its so fun
16682,OMG i became a true XxXMLGXxX quickscoper with this game now im in the Phase clan
16683,gg
16684,Well this game is one off the best cod games! Only bad thing is that there are too many hackers!
16685,Totally is very good.
16686,"I hacked it in the first day and then got banned 

10/10"
16687,Still one of the best!
16688,"Forgetable shooter, played the single player campagn, nothing stuck out in my mind.
im a big fan of story and fun in my games and this has neither, unless you are looking for multiplayer, avoid like the plague. there are much better games out there than this"
16689,good game ;)
16690,"I began my career with COD from the beginning...I didn't want to get into the modern warfare but the Husband talked me into it and I'm glad I did.  
The story line is a little ""unbelievable"", but it's a good game as a follow up to Modern 1.  Way too short for my taste however, I'm not a multiplayer. 
In single player, the action is hot an intense.  Situational awarness is a must.  Running & gunning is impossible.  My fav is the Favela.  
Lots of fun & action.  Well worth the price."
16691,i cri evri tim dat ghoost dehs
16692,"The aspect of the game is very interesting. Would I recommend this game? Of course. However, the game is full of hackers and modded lobbies that I would never EVER recommend the multiplayer to anyone who is wanting to play it. It's very rare to find a legit lobby to play."
16693,I recommend this game to people to are mature enough to handle games like these but other than that... its an amazing game!
16694,izi vac ban
16695,"is it worth buying the expansion packs?
do people still play them?
"
16696,Fuck yea
16697,bEST GAME EVER
16698,HACKER
16699,"When I was younger I really enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the campaign. I enjoyed the multiplayer. I enjoyed the guns. Everything. I guess I grew up, because now the linear campaign feels claustrophobic to the point that it's not remotely enjoyable. The multiplayer still has all the same problems that made people ragequit years ago. Crappy spawn system, terrible hitboxes, ridiculous kill streaks, annoying death streaks, and so much more. I will say that the multiplayer maps themselves are very memorable and it feels good revisiting them. To conclude I don't think this game is worth the 20$ price tag. There are so many better games on here with more to offer that cost less than 20$. So yeah, my opinion."
16700,"Literally infested with hackers. 90% of lobbies are hacked lobbies. Playing this game is like fucking a hooker, you could very easily get aids why playing this bug and pirate infested cess pool. Spend the $20 on something useful, like a blowjob or something."
16701,I though that there would be alot more hackers.  Probably like 1 in every 25 games I get a hacked lobby.  Its not that bad actually.
16702,"I no this game since I was a lil kid 
Bisnago aproves

16703,gr8 game could have done with more levels but the online stays epic
16704,"cheated --> vacs

16706,in my opinion this was one of the best call of dutys ever made.
16707,"The multi-player is hacked to pieces. If you don't have enough friends to host your own site, forget about it."
16708,Would play again but i feel done after 5 veteran runs and all achievements

16730,"One of the greats of its franchise!
 The storyline is amazing, the graphics still hold up (if you turn everything all the way up in the settings menu) and the multiplayer was once upon a time brilliant, but as I said ONCE UPON A TIME, it has died down quite a bit. Overall if you want to get this game for its multiplayer not its campaign, then purchase it on PS3 or XBOX 360.

9/10; Amazing!"
16731,"Poorly made game with mechanics that annoy the player rather than challenge them. One big one is the overdone red/bloody screen effect. Once it pops up, the player can barely see through it. Takes a while to get used to. There is also another issue, which links to the bloody screen bul-shiieet. Once hit, your entire view gets jolted upward. This weird alteration to the camera makes the experience increadibly annoying. Makes playing the SP at harder difficulties an annoyance. Its annoying not challenging. The AI is also increadibly annoying. It seems like these guys are on hax or something. There was one a-hole sitting down with a uzi, he was hitting me from accross 100 yards away. I call bul-shiieet. 

Re-playing this reminds me to stay away from COD. Battlefield has better gun play and better gameplay mechanics. COD is a lower form of game design. 

COD Dev Team = Shiieet

Also the lack of an FOV option is telling of how increadibly shiieet the dev team is. They couldn't even get an FOV option to work. You can argue that DICE also had problems with BF4, but it's because BF4 is a bigger and better game."
16732,Good
16733,Fun
16734,i love this game
16735,to many hackers and i cant play becasue the update paused and the hard drive is full thats bull
16736,"Great game just dont expect to play multiplayer

if you do find a multiplayer match (very unlikley) it is riddled with hackers

but to revisit the game or to play through the single player again then yes its just as amazing as before"
16737,"Still an amazing game, same this game wasn't created by valve or by a company that does give a shit about their competitive game ;("
16738,"its great! recommended for those players who want a not so realistic point of view of warfare, but a more high intensity gameplay. yes there are hackers, modders, cheater, etc. but that doesnt ruin the game. itsa also fun just to have around incase you and your friend are bored and looking to play. its defiantly worth the money. have fun! game on :)"
16739,I've been playing this game since it first came out and it's great!
16740,A pretty great sequel to CoD4:MW. Better than MW3.  8/10
16741,The best fps multi-player I have ever played.
16742,"Singleplayer has nice balance between fast-paced action and drama , and multiplayer is just awesome , except hacked lobbies."
16743,"got into a game were all bullets were grenades.

16744,This game makes you want to punch babies and scream at the top of your lungs to Allah Snackbar. Great experience.
16745,it ok

Anyways, jokes apart......

     Guys, i am playing this game right from mid 2010. But even today, when i open this game, i feel lyk it was just yesterday, i started playing it. Its awesome, its cool & trust me, its worth every penny which you spend on this game. From the whole COD series, only 3 games are cool (COD4, MW2 & MW3) & this game is the best of 'em.
So, happy gamin'  :)"
16751,Best game 2015
16752,awesome game
16753,just good
16754,"Best game ever made, just too bad there is so few hardcore seatch and destroy lobbys after so many years."
16755,"At the time of this writing, I've spent more time playing MW2 than any other game on steam. Multiplayer maps are among the best in the entire franchise. Definitely pushed forward the series the most."
16756,"Nice game!

16759,VERY GOOD GAME
16760,It is SO comforting to know that my favorite CoD MW titles still has a healthy online community still 6 years after the release of this game.
16761,"Best CoD to date. Can't say I enjoyed it much on PC due to the hackers but in 2009 on 360 was insane fun. It's a shame the path CoD has taken, the hackers are unfortunate also."
16762,awesome gamE. SO ADDICTING!!! worth the money
16763,"Singleplayer: Yeah its alright, wouldnt pay for it by itself.
Multiplayer: Hackers everywhere and my favoruite game modes are all empty."
16764,one of the best sequels out there. 9.5/10
16765,8/8 would not play agian
16766,"Just don't buy this game,its a waste of money,i am really sorry i bought it just because of the hackers and i lost all my attachements on a server and a hacker dominated the server,i watched the killcam and he was using aimbot:( i am really sorry for this game,it was the best game i had played but it doesn't worth the money,i would take my money back if i can!"
16767,yes
16768,"Good ol MW2 will never let you down, unless some tubed russian player will be playing with a danger close + scavenger perks"
16769,"This game is ok. But the hackers of the game on multiplayer just ruins the fun of the game. I want them to be delt with. And without them, I would say the game is still ok. Its also because of the graphics. I know, this was released in 2009, but for that you, there were way better games that had way better graphics. Overall this game gets a 7.5/10. I really enjoy it, but you guys still have to work on some of the game development. Well peace out!

16770,"A well-made CoD title. Before the dark times...

Rating: 8 out of 10, A gripping story coupled with superb multiplayer and significant replay value. This is quite possibly one of the last great CoD titles, along with Black Ops."

16772,i think this game is really awesome and who ever doesnt like this game imma murder them ffs
16773,this is the most broken ass piece of people actually think this thing is good
16774,"I've owned every Call of Duty, except Ghosts, and Advanced Warfare. I have to say, this is where it all went to shit. With the addition of lobbies only, and shit maps, and overall shit mechanics, this is the real lemon. This CoD is really what ruined SERIOUS competitive Call of Duty. I spit on the makers of this game.

Made for consoles, on pc, then ported for pc. Absolute shit.

-100/10 Would never play again."
16775,"they are letting the game die on purpose to sell the new products. the lobby is automatic so it is not possible to avoid hackers' maps, no protection at all. the matchmaking was bad even before but now it s pure garbage."
16776,one of the best cods... worth it
16777,"Love the game , full of action and epic moments , also a very skill demanding multyplayer"
16778,epic awesome coolness X a trillion. 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10
16779,"It was a good game
I had alot of fun
Then I got VAC banned
I cried a litte bit

It's a good game just make sure you leave a hacked lobby as fast as you can

10/10 Best COD"
16780,weiner
16781,do NOT get COD !!!
16782,yes
16783,i like peni   s
16784,I love this game..I was on a private match a few days ago with my friends and we was doing a sniper battle....it was totally unfair...cuz i was only level 4 at the time so after bout to deaths.....i sneaked up behind on of them with the a rocket launcher i thing it was the ATR or something like that...i was like ..GET LAUNCHED BITCH......LOL SO AWESOME
16785,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 offers an amazing online and single player experience. As far as single player is concerned, the plot of the storyline is really interesting and intense that keeps you attached till the end. It's not all about killing enemies in a battlefield like many other ordinary first person games. The storyline is structured in such way, that brings an abundance of emotions and suspense. In addition, the missions that are involved in the Spec Ops game mode are really enjoyfull and challenging. The huge variety of well built maps and different tasks included in the missions followed by rewards make the particular game mode extremely amusing. When it comes to multiplayer, words are not enough to express the greatness of this game. Personally, I believe that Modern Warfare 2 offers the best online experience in the ""Call of Duty"" franchise. There is not a single Call of Duty game so far that can be compared to MW2 when it comes to online experience. By the huge number of  extraordinary challenges, game modes, titles, emblems, killstreaks, perks, attachments, camos, pretty exquisite maps and guns, this section of the game is extremely addictive and absolutely close to perfection. The only problem is the small amount of cheaters that sometimes ruin the online experience. But not that big of a deal. For me, definetely a ""must play"" for fps gamers. It's a 9.9 out of 10 by me."
16786,"Best CoD E-V-E-R !
The hacked lobbies are EPIC! (yeah, annoying too, but who cares anyway)
It never dissappoints you (unless you are a sissy maid, lol jk!) :P
Community: we all know it very well.

So, it's a must have.

[And the good thing is that every year they always release a new CoD, so you can always wait a bit for the Special Treyarch's sale on Steam to get it for a lower price] 
:D"
16787,"love this game, and love quickscoping"
16788,"Wow, before I got this game I was getting lots of the opposite gender, but after I got this game I know my virginity is well protected. Also, I'm an MLG trickshooter now. This game has singlehandedly replaced my diet with Mountain Dew and Doritos. I would recommend this game if you want to be a virgin that masturbates five times everyday."
16789,"Best game, and best multiplayer game :v"
16790,"All time favourite game, don't buy it on steam, you can get it on amazon for ¬£6.75 + P&P."
16791,"Well it was fun for a couple weeks, then i got deranked lost all of my unlocks, and my whole screen is a minimap, diddnt get my money's worth.."

16798,One of the best cod's ever.
16799,"love this game,  it would be totaly awesome if they'd get rid of the leveling system. 
"
16800,"Great game, always loved it"
16801,"Takes place right after call of duty modern warfare. Gameplay and story wise was just great. Spec ops would keep you busy for awhile, roughly around 2-4 hours depending how good you are at the game. Multiplayer is def a no go. Since hackers have took over the game, every match you will get into, you will be fighting a hacker. Does that mean i shouldnt buy it? No it does, if you just want it to play the single player and follow the story that and spec ops will keep you busy."
16802,Infinity Ward should make skins to Call of Duty Moder Warfare 2 Multiplayer it would be cool. :P
16803,best game i have ever played

still crying :("
16807,"Fun for a while, but the community isn't as great compared to other fps games. Community is lacking compared to the CS series."
16808,so many hackers
16809,this one my fave  cods i beenn playing  cod for year onn xbox but i always come back to mw 1 and mw2 both grate fun but mw2 is  been out for  few years with newer cods comeinng out ppl move to thim seem all left behind nnow is hackers so many lobbys i get in i see wall hack aim but   to name a few and alot hackers  if u some how beat thim get mad and ddos thee good legit players out of lobby the devs made there money annd made a new cod and as lways left this one to rot sadly i still play it and still love playing it but so hard to get legit lobbys
16810,"Nearly 6 years since the release of this game. But the multiplayer still kicks major arse. One of the best game that was conceived. The online multiplayer still has lots of players.

If you are planing on buying this game, go agead, you wont regret. Some hacked lobbies here and there but other than that this game is still very fun to play as it was during its release . Having played through all the 10 prestiges in my xbox 360 before without any hack I brought this game again for PC and no, I haven't had a single regret. Plus in PC the graphics are amazing."
16811,This game is great but to bad the multiplayer is full of hackers
16812,"Good game, but has a lot of noobtubers and killstreaks."
16813,"I recommend it to others. Its a great game with many varieties of guns to choose from, many game modes, good players, and good maps.

Only bad thing is there are way too many campers and  some hackers. 

Nonetheless, probably the best COD game invented."
16814,"Too many hackers, too many ""instant 70"" servers, I really like the game, but at least playing the multiplayer on steam is not recommended at all."
16815,Good game
16816,"so fuking bad i can go play because ''steam must be running to play this game'' and i cant fix it fuk this!!!
"
16817,"Great game, bad anti-cheat. I have only owned this game for about two weeks and have already been VAC banned, for no reason at all. I don't hack in any of the games I play, and never have hacked in any games. I am dissapointed in VAC's anti-cheat, hope I can get unbanned.

Until they can ban players for legit reasons, I will continue to not play and dislike this game."
16818,Funny game
16819,"SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH
My il remember this game as best and first call of duty i ever played and ofc INTERVENTION beast sniper 
this call of duty doesnt have cheters belive me or not.Thare is no word dat can discribe this game"
16820,Best game 10/10-ign Quickscoping since 2009
16821,I like it.
16822,"The Single Player experience was very good, I really enjoyed playing alongside Captain Price, Ghost, and others in this old 2009 gem of a game. The multiplayer was a bit modded but alas, isn't every good game now-a-days? Oh well, I really did have fun playing online and getting through the ranks (although I am still only Level 70 Prestige 0 and don't plan on prestiging...) This game easily goes into my great Wall of Games as one of the best."
16823,"completely sick campaign,nice gameplays..sick and variated weapon system,still the hackers in online are like rice on a plate...in my opinion,this was the last good Call Of Duty..before it ...well..you know what i mean ."
16824,You shoot people.
16825,"10,000 players 500 hackers! Which will you be?

10/10 would choose to be hacker and derank 12 year olds for a VACation again."
16826,This game is good wven with a slow computer it only Requires 1 GB of ram and i know everyone has atleast 1 GB of ram so GET THIS GAME IT WILL MAKE GOOOOOODDDD MEMORIES

16828,ign: u can quick scope 10/10
16829,"Hmm I spent 10 hours on this game.And I know this is not alot of time,but this game conquers you after the first minutes.

16837,The best cod out there
16838,"Yes....If you belive me or not this was my first game! I higly recomend  this  game! Just there are 2 facts about the game whitch i realy hate!

1.I don't like Reloading
2.The VAC bans all good ""hackers"" (they make ASWOME servers!!
"
16839,f**king AWSOME love it!!!!!!
16840,"Amazing campaign, draw dropping story and visuals. 
Purchased again on PC to relive some old times with some classic COD features!"
16841,The multiplayer is a hacker ridden graveyard.  Do not spend your money on this.
16842,This game taught me that no one likes Grenade Launchers
16843,"I had fun with it while it lasted.
The campaign was, by the time, intense and a worthy successor to MW.  Playing the multiplayer was fun until cheaters took over and Activision stopped taking care. It was a shame in the end.

Good memories eventually."
16844,last good call of duty game
16845,very fun good for trickshooting
16846,It's a classic......
16847,Was a great game but like all old games the hackers have taken over and not fun anymore.

10/10"
16856,"Love the game. Only issue is I can't work out how to host a LAN game. I play COD4 at school, where online play is blocked. In COD4 you could open a server browser and easily find Local games. On PS3, I could do the same. Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to join a LAN game on this. (MAC version). If Aspyr could tell us how to do it, that would be ideal."

16878,Pretty solid console port fps.  about 5-10 hours of gameplay here.
16879,"Although COD is as addictive as heroin. With servers rotting away, hacked serves sitting comfortably in the festering ooze that remains, exploitable playstyles even in legit games, and a community of whiny/entitled man children, it was entirely a waste of time. I'm as ashamed of playing this game as a man confessing his substance abuse to his peers in rehab.

Prepare to understand the life of an addict being exploited by their dealer as any future installments will inevitably inherit these problems for increasing premiums of cash. Get ready to dive into the highs and lows of kdr, and the failure of your relationships as you begin to ignore people close to you or yell at them to 'make me a sandwich, whore!'

On the upside, the only teeth you'll lose will be from dental neglect, having consumed stupid amounts of mountain dew and doritos, for point bonuses, without bushing your teeth for days at a time in order to get a jump on other players during the weeks following a new release."

16881,wtf i whas using a mod but it say's i cheated wtf steam unban me now

16885,Awesome multiplayer and co-op. I just wish there were more co-op missions.
16886,The best cod in the cod series!
16887,"It is very good game but i choose the negative vote because the hackers ruined this game.
1.I lost my level progress by a hacker and i couldnt get it back.
2.There are a lot kids who kicks everyone out of the lobby except if you stand and they do 360 stupid shots.
3.A lot wallhackers and aimboters.
4.The nat is buggy and dosnt work with all routers properly so even if the port is open you cant host a game to avoid the modded lobbys.
5.They removed the Favela one of the best map on the game.

16888,game doesnt work :( I have not been able to play it yet all it does is freezes
16889,Those poor Russians......
16890,this game is trash

16892,"YES!! YES!! AND DOUBLE YES!! this game is AWESOME!! im a BF3 and 4 fan, but this game deserves a thumbs up!! nice work for such a OLD game :)  Im impressed!!"
16893,"This is my favorite Call of Duty game. It breaks my heart that I can't recommend it:

Not enough players to find a game without lag.

Too many A-holes to find a game without hacks."
16894,This COD have best Multiplayer!
16895,Best Call of Duty
16896,"mw2 multiplayer is a great game to play, even now, when its so old you can still come online and play a handfull of game modes. Tubes, painkiller, hackers, etc are all in the game, but when you can get into a few normal  matches it is very rewarding. The way multiplayer works is that you dont need tons of experience to be good, so anyone can do good in a match. Mw2 multiplayer is a great game"
16897,"This is a very good game, I think persinaly one of the best COD games ever, However...
There are lots of hackers and hacked lobbys, So stay clear of those!
But out of 1-10... Id give it around an 8 1/2

If any one can help, I went into a hacked lobby and now every thing in the game is unlocked. How do i reset? This game is no fun now because there is nothing to do. Please help.

But this is still a very good game, Apart from all the hackers."
16898,"Fuuucccckkk it! I made it somewhat far on veteran and for whatever reason it fucking erases my progress?! Fuck it!
"
16899,"I like this cod, but many cheaters"
16900,BEST FUCKING GAME EVER!
16901,dont get this game its full of hackers. like every call of duty becuase infinity award cant make a anti hack client
16902,Epic game all i have to say.
16903,Not controller enabled.  Fail.
16904,this game is pretty fun but lot o hackers and modders that can mess u up.trust me dudes or dudetts alot of hackers but fun and cool.
16905,COD4: Modern Warfare was by a unanimous verdict was pretty much the definitive modern shooter. MW2 was the last COD I purchased for a reason. No dedicated servers shit maps paid dlc stupid pot leaf doritos mountain dew bro gamer insignias. The campaign was meh and close minded and offered zero freedom of choice. Even if you chose to not shoot civvies in the airport the US gets invaded. Shoot Makarov to stop the massacre and get instakilled for going against the developer's wishes. The added kill streaks didn't do anything for the game. The 26 kill nuke was the most retarded mechanic ever. By nuking yourself your enemies and your team you win. How is that a win? Retarded wall to wall. Spec ops was fun if a little frustrating. Wasn't worth 60 bucks.
16906,"The best game i've ever played, can't believe that it's already 6years old and yet it still kicks most games asses nowadays.
"
16907,"great game till i got leveled up out of no where ad i just got back in this game now it keep getting banned from every server because im the cheat it detects
"
16908,One of the best Call of Duties!
16909,nice game
16910,"if you want to do a three-hundred-and-sixty ""no scope"" then this is the game you want."
16911,"Yes I am a little behind the times , its a old game . But the people that play this game are the most rude and racisit assbags I have ever met . I play two games on steam so far , killing floor which by far has the most likeable players I have ever met , even made friends with a few but this game , I really regret buying it . Oh it had great graphics , but that is about it . Way to confusing for a first timer plus no way that I found so far to balance the game play . I get tossed into a game with level 70 players I may as well just stay in one spot and be target practice . Maybe MW3 is better but I do not think the price on either of these games just because of the community is worth it . If I want abuse I will go and find a girlfriend into bondage , not some 20 something neckbeard who had played the game forever . Just wish I vould get my money back ."
16912,"This is the best game I have ever played. Everyone need to know how this game is cool. CoD MW2 has very interesting singleplayer and of course multiplayer. This game's multiplayer is best I have played before, I wasted lots of time playing it and to tell the truth I do not regret. So check this game out :3

PS. Good luck and have fun need players =))"
16913,A classic. Da bomb.
16914,Grea game. Wold be nice if the creater brought back the solid stand this one had...........
16915,this game is like a call of duty game of course but everyone plays it like its their job to kill so i like it but everyone takes the game too siericly i wish i can spell
16916,Love the Multiplayer! Campaign is probably one of the best in the CoD series 10/10
16917,10/10
16918,"This is a great game. It has a good campaign, good multiplayer, and fun spec ops (side missions) to do. The only problem I have with this game is that there is no controller suport(which makes it difficult to play at sometimes, at least thats what I think). Overall this is a good game. If your not comfortable to play a shooting game with a mouse,buy at your own risk. 

Overall I give it a 9/10. Highly recommended."
16919,"MW2, when it first came out on console(360), it was the best game ever. I stayed home 2 weeks and got 5th presteige because of the x2 XP on release and was on the top 100 for that period of time. 

Then the hackers came and boosting lobbies and all kinda meyhem, but the game itself is very fun to play, especially with friends. You can pick up strats pretty easily because its just like any other fps and most guns feature almost no recoil so it does take some skill to play but doesnt require you to know all the tweeks of each gun in order to use the weapon.

Single player is a lot of fun and the story line is great if you have been following along the whole time, and if not, cod4 through mw3 will do you justice with it's story and optional endings.

10/10 Can always come back and have fun on the game."
16920,"Yeah....

Its allright like"
16921,Is ok
16922,"Its a Good GAME but i get banned from ""Hacking""
Aparently playing with Self Texture is hacking yet i didnt even play Multiplayer Online.
Best Reinstalling Game ever.
And WAY to many hackers online *gets game goes online gets rank 70."""
16923,no kek

16925,"I highly think this is one of the best call of dutys. Not only is it still fun but i can play this game on normal graphics whit a 1.10 GHz prosesor easy. If that and it being one of the coolest FPS dose not sell it, then i dont know what will."
16926,THE CAMPAIN IS AWEEESSOOMME
16927,"Very awesome game. Amazing game has the best campaign for a call of duty game that I have ever played. It is worth every cent for this amazing game. The multiplayer was fine but multiplayer is just not my favorite thing with games. Spec ops missions were great too but there was only one with a new map in alpha, bravo, and charlie. Yet this game is worth every cent just for the campaign experience. 10/10"

16937,"An amazing game. I love the graphics more than far cry 3's. It is gorgeus and, for the most part, well-written. I love this game more than I ever thought I would. Every mission does something. Every mission means something. Other games will require you to traverse the world to get 5 ancient coins to upgrade your cat-shanking, then have you shank 8 cats so the villagers will give you 8 ancient artifacts so you can exchange them for a key that opens a door to the second half of the opening cinematic. This game moves you along at a good pace. The multiplayer is brilliant."
16938,Beautiful.. Just beautiful.

16942,"i had played this game 5 months after it had came out for PC and it was my first call of duty expirience on any system including xbox etc. I played it continuely for 2 years and a half whenever i could get any time i would, i would just snipe and use the scar-H and any gun i could gain expirience with! I had a quickscoping clan that was ranked one in australia named RazE Gaming i have had over 600 hours online and am about to download it again from the massive lay off of 3-4 years i havent played it , lets get back into the game ;)"
16943,this game was alright till the rampent hacking its still fun but chances are youll hit a modded lobby before you hit a legit game and the p2p system :/ !
16944,"Best shooter game I think there is. Has been my all time fav <3
"
16945,"Pretty fun game. The matchmaking was really nice until everyone moved over to Modern Warfare 3. Now it's impossible to find a game to get into. I begrudgingly recommend this game, but only get it for the single player."
16946,This is prob one of the best at it's time.
16947,"I would not recommend buying this game at this point cuz it is more than 4 years old.
The game has almost no players left on multi player and most of the time you get the same enemies over and over again.
Most of the gamemodes in the game have 0 players.
In total the game has around 1000 players."
16948,"great game, very much worth."

16957,"In my opinion, the best game in the franchise, and a fantastic example of a perfect sequel."
16958,Best game i ever played
16959,This is the game that I got VAC banned from. Don't buy it. Everyone hacks in it. Not one single legit lobby I can get it.
16960,"I remember the time when Activision actually cared about the games it's releasing. When the servers weren't overflooded with cheaters. When the DLC didn't cost like another game (hell, I remember when there were no DLCs at all). When players didn't spew trash in their mics in all chat, when the ""360 no scope"" meant nothing. When the main character was a person, not a dog.

This game is from that age. If you want to know, what was all the hype about the Call of Duty series, just play this one. It didn't get any better after this one, anyway.

I'd rate this game 9.0 out of 10.0."
16961,Good game gay3gay gay gay
16962,"Yes, I had a one day trial of the game on the Xbox 360 and it was a great game. Although, since this game is not as popular anymore since it was released a couple of years ago, that doesn't mean that hundreds of people won't play it.!!! Awesome graphics too."
16963,"Imagine a place like a kindergarden with children around 3 years old. Then you give to each of them a weapon (don't forget the grenade launcher), a grenade and a lot of anger. And done! You have Call of Duty!!!

0/10. Because a noob (that surely doesn't play better than me) killed me with a grenade launcher and painkiller."
16964,Love it
16965,THIS SI THE BEST CALL OF DUTY
16966,YAS!!!
16967,"My fav. CoD. 100% completed multiplayer (all chalenges) and I love playing with my friends with Interventions. It is a great CoD and it wasn't a big screw-up like MW3, but was different than CoD4."
16968,"For me personally, besides of CoD 4 the best CoD Game in History of Call of Duty."
16969,one of the best shooter ever!
16970,"It could have been fun. But there are no dedicated servers, so one of the players is chosen to serve as host, which usually results in a terrible connection and a lot of lag. Once the game notices that, it looks for another host. The original host is kicked after the host migration (because the game obviously has to be as annoying as possible), and the thing starts all over again. If no other host is found, everyone is just thrown out of the game.
There is also no way to kick or ban the hackers, which is great fun as well. The same thing goes for hacked lobbies - sometimes, you join a game that is modified, meaning some weapons can't be used, the game mode is different, your settings and stats can be changed and other things. Of course, there's nothing you can do about it.
Dedicated servers would fix that as well. Of course, those are impossible, because Activision says so. Giving you the ability to play the game mode you want without lags and with the ability to ban hackers could actually make this game fun! We obviously can't have that.
So: If you're lucky and get a host with a good connection, you can play the Team Deathmatch mode. No one bothers to queue for other game modes, because there's not enough people playing them - of course, hacked lobbies do have other modes from time to time. And if you're really, really lucky, maybe there's no hacker in the game either, so you can even enjoy it."
16971,"I only played the campaign. And that said, I really enjoyed the campaign.

Infinity Ward took a risk with one of the opening levels, No Russian, where basically you massacre an airport with Russian terrorists, only for the player character to act as a scapegoat, inciting a war between the States and Russia. The ensuing storyline involves home defense, playing as a United States Marine, and espionage missions where you fight your way in various parts of the world to gather intel in order to reveal the truth about the airport massacre.

Overall, the campaign was pleasant.

8.9/10"
16972,Got vac banned for using FOV Changer. 11/10
16973,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was good when it came out.

Now it is just sad. With all those hackers and their hack servers sending you to prestige 10, when you wanna level up yourself and earn all those things.

i managed to get prestige 4 before getting into a hacked server which turned me into prestige 10.

So i've done my fair share of resetting. But then i got tired of resetting every now and then and eventually stopped playing.

Back in the day i would score it 10/10
but today i will probably score it 3/10"
16974,Very good game but to many hackers...i don't want play anymore...Nobody protect us from hackers!!
16975,Still not ruined game by the all ways 11/10 BLAZE IT !!! 42000 OOOOO
16976,"Right, about time I made this review.

I remember this game, when it came out. Everybody was hyped for it, myself included. 
And unlike what you might expect, all my skyhigh expectations was suddenly very real. The gameplay was smooth (for a freshly launched game, mind you), the levels were well made, and the action was fast paced.

Now, even after several hundred hours spent in the multiplayer, and many new titles being released since, I still find myself returning to this game from time to time. the amount of players still playing, is ever dwindling, as can be expected with an aging game.

but the feeling this game gives you, of nostalgia, of pure fun and carnage, is unlike any other game out there (save for DOOM 3, and UT 2004). It really is, an all time classic. 

If you have yet to play this game, but like fast paced shoot-em-in-the-face-and-laugh type of FPS games, then this is for you. If you on the other hand like FPS games that require more though than duck, run, and shoot, this game (hell, this whole series of games) might not fall to your liking.

However, given that its drop in price of the years, althought still not cheap by any means, it's defo worth a try. If nothing else, to take on your mates, and have a blast that you will all be able to remember.

I hope this provided you with some usefull insight into this game.

All The best

First off - a lot of people are saying there is a large amount of hacked lobbies and hackers...and they're right. But the game is a simplicity. First you get the XP, then you get the weapons, then you get the kills. It's really a rewarding experience - for me at least. It's like a Call of Duty 4 MP but with matchmaking..."
16983,.
16984,Best call of duty campaign
16985,"In it's day, this was THE FPS (and the best strawberry jam simulator of 2009). Sure, it had noob tubes, MLC running and OP, no-recoil wepons such as the ACR; but it was great. 
And now the online's dead. And there's like, 10 more CODs. 

Play for nostalgia 10/10."
16986,Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was the most popular Call of Duty of all time. It has an engaging campaign and the visuals at the time were top notch. But its glory days have passed. The multiplayer is riddled with hacks and it is almost impossible to find an unhacked server. So if you are looking at this game for the multiplayer then I would look elsewhere. If you are looking at this then I would wait until the price drops but until then I cannot recommend this game simply because of its age and non working service.
16987,Needs to have the valve Cheat Symbol removed.
16988,Only CoD you should play 11/10
16989,"very nice game, its fun"
16990,"This game is good in gameplay and all that stuff, but there is one thing that makes the game unplayable, hackers.

Now, I'm not talking about aimbot or some lame exuse when I get killed or something like that. I'm talking about LEGIT hackers/moders. 

Almost EVERY multi player server you go on, it will be hacked. I can't even PLAY the game anymore because some hacker put this GIANT MAP in the middle of my screen! Even if I restart the game it's still there.

They also have acess to your LOADOUTS too, and some hacker took ALL my items from me.

Would I recommend this? Well, maybe. If you don't mind all the hacking and taking away all your items and giant maps on the screen. Just maybe."

1. TONS OF FUN
2. Annoying people
3. people telling you to go kill yourself (pretty common)
4. Hackers, not people aimboting and godmode just giving everyone unlocks which is ok
but hope you don't get VAC ban.
5. Lots of empty servers

This game is good and pretty fun to play when you get used to it, I would give it on a scale to 1-100 a
78/100
It's a good game and all but not as fun as it was Before...

17031,"Great campaign, but completed very fast.
Multiplayer is great fun to play with friends.
The co-op is also very cool to try to beat and achieve all stars."
17032,"I don't do the MP, so this is all about the SP. I put about 160 hours into this game on PC, completed all the missions multiple times on the highest difficulty, and have almost all the achievements. If I can do that, then better players like you will do great for sure. Overall, the game was not a waste of money, but it is sad to see a great franchise focus on the features I like least. I haven't bought a COD game since this one and based on watching other people play them, I am glad I didn't. If you want the best COD experience, COD4 or COD2 will serve you well. Never played COD3 since I don't own an Xbox or whatever console that was exclusive to. 

If you liked COD: Modern Warfare, this game will appeal because it is pretty much the same game with lots of minor changes. It expands on the trends that set COD4 apart from the original WW2 shooters that COD was built on, expanding the special operations focus and focusing on bond-style villains weaving fancy plots to run the world in some way. 

Technology also is greatly emphasized; COD4 was built on real weapons in wide use in the early 21st-century, while COD: MW2 makes commonplace what is rare or simply theorized even today. Most guns now have electronic sights instead of ironsights, automated weapon systems like sentry guns play a prominent role, and remarkably efficient UAVs with more firepower than a B52 menace the skies. If you want a more sci-fi than real-world experience of ""modern warfare"" then you have found your game. Incidentally, the poor RPG7 rocketlauncher remains a big part of the battlefield and remains unable to hit anything more than 30 feet away without a huge dose of luck. So much for modernity! 

If you like the classic ""common soldier fighting for his country"" theme of the original COD series, you will be in for some, but not complete, disappointment.There are maps where average soldiers still fight average soldiers from other countries, but where they are fighting often requires considerable suspension of disbelief. What is clear is that COD: MW2 is continuing the trend of the franchise towards special ops missions where the real story revolves around elite special forces units who battle sinister evil geniuses weaving great conspiracies. Common soldiers like Paratrooper Martin and Sergeant Moody are very much passe. If you want Splintercell without the stealth mechanics, this will do something for you. 

Like COD4, maps are tight enough to keep players from getting too lost and open enough, most of the time, to let players do more than simply charge straight into killzones. Some maps have tedious bottlenecks that will frustrate, so expect a few ragequits unless you are a masochist like me. So far, the grenade spam problem that makes many COD games very annoying is not too strong here; certainly not as bad as COD: World At War. You will have time to rest between rushes without too much fear of an endless rain of grenades appearing out of nowhere to punish you for your laziness. Infinite respawns are pretty reasonable in this game as well, so you aren't always going to lose for not having rushed after that last enemy getting shot. 

One huge feature that greatly limits the appeal of this game for me: NO PC CONSOLE! COD consoles have always been fairly limited in their utility compared to games like Halflife, but for reasons that make no sense to me, IW has decided that players don't need consoles and so now players have no ablity to fine-tune their game settings, use cheats, or even fix some issues that could have been done in the past with five seconds of typing. This massively reduces the playability of the game for me. Before this game, I loved to see the beautiful animations and graphics in slow-motion. Can't do that here and that makes me sad.

17041,"One of the most biggest invested games in the world. Infinity Ward used 200 million dollars to this game. And whats the result? Awesome single player!, but hideous multiplayer! What comes to singleplayer is that it is awesome because the story is well done and it is really fun to play it! Loads of weapons to choose to your missions and very nice graphics. 


On the other hand the multiplayer isnt too great. First of all all the best weapons are given at the first level (1-70 levels in multiplayer) I mean whats the point in that? Second of all chances of joining hacked lobby are really high! and finally everybody in the multiplayer rush with Silenced UMP which is so OP! Only good thing about multiplayer is their maps. They are done well!



Things i liked: Loads of weapons and attachments to them, Weapons can be modified, Singleplayer, Graphics, Callsigns, Damage system and Thermal Scopes.

Things i didn't like: Multiplayer, Community, Hackers, Overpowered weapons, 

Just because of its singleplayer alone it is game worth playing. Maybe you will like the multiplayer aswell... (MAYBE)

3,5/5 is my rating for this game."

17067,this game is really great. still after being around for a long time the graphics still hold up. also it takes less than 30 seconds to find a game in the multiplayer. overall its a good game
17068,If it wasnt for the cheaters and lack of servers I would still play it!

"
17074,"TL;DR: A good coop mission experience with cool visuals.  Not amazing but not bad.  Not a good multiplayer experience.

Rest of the review:

The missions are very single-player centric with no real reason for a coop buddy, but you can increase the difficulty level to balance the missions out.  The goals are typically to get from point a to point b without dying and while killing many people.

The multiplayer was OK, but now, well, it's full of cheaters and griefers.  I never really got into it in the first place, though, because I was more into Team Fortress 2.

The overall feel of the game is that of excellence.  Everything in the game looks and feels great.  Controls are smooth.  Character models are top notch.  Environment visuals are very good.  Gameplay is designed to be exciting.  Music is kind of bland, but sound effects and ambience are done well."

17077,"A hacker hacked my friends screen, and then i downloaded the hacked client he had just so i could try to remove it from my friends screen. And now i am banned from playing online just because i had a hacked client. So freaking stupid...."
17078,"I've had this game for well look at how many hours I have and it is a very fun game. The singleplayer missions are phenomenal and extremely fun. The only thing I would say that is bad is that it is not so secure. There are hackers all over the multiplayer system and pretty much have the power to play however they want. Although, there is still a decent chance you will not run into them on multiplayer. Overall this is a great game‚ò∫"
17079,Excelent multiplayer ruined by hackers. A good camain. Can't recommend due to number of hackers.
17080,Good
17081,"Best game every made in call of duty development i wish the old developers would come back and make a remake of this exact game with out the one man army noob tubes and pain killer. This new IW team is the worst i honistly have to say.
After Modern Warfare 2 came out call of duty just went down hill from there they fired they best development team in cod history"
17082,"it is the best game ever

17083,"This was a great game
I enjoyed it alot the only problem is the amount of hacked lobbies is just unbearable and now my minimap covers my hud

Dont buy this game now it too late."

17090,"What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.

Now, you may be asking, ""Why is the multiplayer dead?"" The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hickers and children. Hickers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hicker, another five are going to take that persons place. 

The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warfare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and ""clean"" of hickers and cheaters.

Some examples of hickers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:

Wallhickers
Aimbots
Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks
Hud-Hicking (Yes, it does exist)
Instant VAC Ban

The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.

Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.

I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.

If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.

Overall, get it for the spec-ops, and the singleplayer.

Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hicked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.

Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hickers...

-Cheers

17100,"I enjoyed this game. Many people consider it as the definitive Call of Duty, yet it mainly seems like every other. The campaign was memorable and I enjoyed the decent AI challenge. The greatest part of this game is the multiplayer, as most Call of Duty's are. The gamemodes that I could find a match  were Team-deathmatch and Free for All. The elephant in the room however is the number of hackers, which really kills the experience. Overall, a fun classic Call of Duty, but the community's age really shows."
17101,best cod ever made but dont play on steam servers unless you want your PC to get malware.
17102,GREAT
17103,"i like it! may be ""disturbing"" to some (killing civies)"
17104,"Great game, just as all the other games of the call of duty series has it a great singleplayer storyline. Follows perfectly on COD 4 (MW1) and fits perfectly before MW3. Multiplayer isn't that good since almost nobody is on there anymore. But still, great game!"
17105,Exactly what you'd expect from a CoD game; a bunch of 12 year olds sniping each other and camping in corners. 10/10
17106,"I still play the multiplayer on this from time to time, and for those brief moments it's 2009 again. Nostalgia obviously plays a factor but this game still holds up well and will forever be my favorite multiplayer game of all time. I have not experienced these hackers that others have warned about and the community is still active - you can hop on at any time of day and find a handful of team deathmatch, free for all, domination, or search and destroy lobbies.

17110,"This game was bad the way it was 6 years ago, it's still bad.

I'm not gonna go over an intial review, I just want to get into the heads of everyone who thumbed this up and want to know WHYYYYY did close to 12k users and 92% of them thumbed this monstrosity up?
users voted on metacritic on average 5.5 out of ten from all 3 platforms with PC at 4.0 and highest 6.1 on consoles...

I did not forget why this game was considered terrible and the start of the ""Cash cow"" Mass opinion which made dewritos and marijuanas popular
Until Advanced warfare came out but that only put the ""Breaks"" on the dying franchise.

Dedicated servers, Remember that launch date fuss? Nobody plays this damn game anyway and nobody wants to play running Peer to peer like it's the fall of napster or Bittorrent.
OP guns: Intervention, ACR, Shotty, Care package, etc, remember these issues?
Offensive missions:  Remember, no russian. This was just a marketing tactic because the writers are garbage.
and me, Why me? Because I supported this game, raged at it and spent over 100 hours in Multiplayer on this crap. (200+ on Xbox)"

17133,it is a awesome game to play beside the hackers.
17134,i highly recomend this game
17135,"Wall of text incoming:

I think it goes without saying every game has its drawbacks (COD games most of all, and it doesn't get any better as the game ages), but this is a Call of Duty game and it's one of the most-highly praised ones - the storyline is engaging, multiplayer is fun, and the Spec Ops mode is challenging (if that's more your speed). Weapons in the game are fun to use and each one has their own little niche for different players, whether you're a rush-in-and-hit-'em-hard type, or a-sit-back-and-let-them-come-to-me kind of player. 

Biggest gripes I could come up with for this game are the scant amount of perks available at the start and how much of a grind it feels like to level up. The most redeeming feature are the maps - most of them are fantastic and well-designed with different overwatch spots, cross-ways, multiple routes to take for flanking or getting to the objective, and a lot of maps force you to play differently than you would on other maps. Also, if you're at all familiar with the map Favela, for some reason it never comes up in map circulation anymore; it's weird.

If you're a fan of Call of Duty and you won't mind the chance to happen upon a modded lobby in multiplayer, dealing with players liberally using grenade launchers, or those players using the cheapest tactics they can so as to get that Chopper Gunner/AC-130/Nuke, then by all means get this game and have fun with it."

17145,Got a vac ban for cheating. No one wants to trade with me now. :( 10/10 can't play again.
17146,had lots of fun playing

17150,very bad!!!
17151,"as always the campaign of call of duty games, specifically the modern warfare series, is epic. the twists of the story keep you on the edge of your seat. i really enjoyed playing it :) this, together with all other call of duty games, are always recommended for fps game lovers everywhere."
17152,total shit .
17153,"10/10 nostalgia
 I play this game since i was 10"
17154,Call of duty modern warfare 2 is very fun game that you can play with friends and I recommend it to those who are passionate about shooting games!!!
17155,"This is ..well.. a CoD game and contains everything you would expect from a game in the series. I would recommend it for those social / casual gamers who like to be assisted by lots of hints, like shooting up stuff, enjoy good graphics, feel like they are always winning and especially if they are time bankrupt, with little time for the luxury of 'immersion'.  Skip this one if you want to turn your brain on during the game!"
17156,wtf
17157,"good game. awful players. they arent awful as in they are bad at the game, they are bad as in they use nothing but noob tubes or commando. Contrary to popular belief, there are actually almost no hackers."
17158,"A classic shooter from a bygone era of video gaming. It's not THAT old, but it feels so different from other games in its own series and genre. The story is ambitious and the musical score is fantastically implemented. The enemies are Russians. Indeed, that is a well treaded path for shooters. But, the game doesn't deamonize the Russians. It makes you feel sympatheitc for their cause, despite the fact that you kill thousands of them. 

It's high quality gaming at its finest. 

COD 11/9.1"
17159,So i had some fun with this in multiplayer... until i joined a server and quickly realized it was hacked and i then notice im level 70... so yeah that ruined a big chunk of the game for me and apperantly it happens alot due to my friends first game was hacked from what i know there is no way to avoid these servers but you can always prestige when you stumble upon a hacked server.. However this is not the end i suppose i can still find some enjoyment out of the game after all it is call of duty even if i wish i could get my 10 dollars back...  would recomend this game on xbox and play station Not pc
17160,"this game is great ;)
"
17161,I miss it so much T.T
17162,"Modern Warfare 2 is by far, and without a doubt my favorite game i have ever played. This game is easily one of the best Call of Duties made so far. The game itself, while recieving much criticism about minor issues, is still an amaing, well put together video game, of one of the best series ive played. The only problem with PC Modern Warfare 2 is the growing number of hackers, and the decreasing number of players. Its a lie to say there are still a lot of players on MW2 now days, but it IS wrong to say there are no people at all. It is still fairly easy to find a game, and the actual gameplay is amazing. The campaign is one of my favorites, with lots of action, and you can play it multiple times and still enjoy it. The multiplayer is amazing and is in my opinion, fairly rounded for a Call of Duty. Sure there are some things that arent 100% rounded, like noob tubing, but that doesnt change how good the game is over all. Final rating: 9.5/10"
17163,Fck the overpriced mappacks
17164,"very very good game, but too many hackers... just too many.."
17165,RECOMMENDED.HAHA
17166,"Brilliant. Not usually a big fan of the Call of Duty franchise, excluding the originals (they were great), but i found this game, especially the campaign thrilling and girpping, there is a vast variety of things to do in the campaign and it really draws you in"
17167,This game is a pretty good game. I like how they added spec ops.
17168,The story is good .... The multiplayer is shit.... Everyone is a noobtuber ......noscoper and everyone was hacked to level 70 .....dont buy this game for multiplayer
17169,this game is fun and i am glad peplo still play it
17170,The last great multiplayer FPS.

17172,"Call Of Duty has turned into an annoying fad in the children's community. It has been r4ped by them, and turned it into 360 nosckopin wid drugz n shiet. Simply, r4pe. But Modern Warfare 2 is by far the best Call Of Duty I've ever tried. I was never really a fan of the series, but when I got my hands on this and went on knifing sprees, I loved the game. Multiplayer is where the fun is, endless hours of fun and randomness! It's fun to knife the ""360 N0sKope"" reetards and see them rage quit because you keep knifing them and they can't even peform their show off moves on you.

9001/10 

IT'S OVER 9000!

Simply, if you want endless hours of randomness and fun, this game is for you! One of my personal favorite games of all time. This review was about multiplayer lol. Play single player if you wish.
I currently have 37 hours on Multiplayer, need I say more?

WARNING: STEER CLEAR OF HACKED LOBBIES. IF YOU FEEL THAT A LOBBY IS HACKED, LEAVE IMIDIATELY, YOUR RADAR CAN BE DELETED AND YOU CAN BE DERANKED! ALSO CAN DESTROY YOUR KD."
17173,"great game worth your money, but wouldnt buy it if you wanted to play multiplayer as you join a game to have fun and rank up and automaticaly your max rank and have everything due to hackers who have made the game theirs by tuning the games their way, so they always win and you cant play the game you intended to play unless you host a private match where you cant level up

this is dissapointing due to spending money on the game :(  !"
17174,"CoD: MW2 Single player is excellent - presumably as close as possible to being in a war movie that we're going to get with current technology. Compelling, fun, you'll forget to eat dinner.

CoD: MW2 Multiplayer is like banging your head against a brick wall. The best bit is when you stop. Totally stupid garbage, I can't believe everyone buys CoD for this shit and ignores the single-player element (which is much better). Players with the most kills are rewarded with control of weapons that allow them to massacre everyone else on the level. This has to be the only game series where this happens."

This game has all the charisma, storyline, and action other FPS's should try to strive to have.
I played through the whole game without blinking twice.
The plot is, in my opinion, the greatest of any FPS ever.
This is what COD was before OP shotguns and raging kids and other bullshit. And this is the last COD to give 2 fucks about a storyline. It is fantastic even if you haven't played COD4, which I HIGHLY recommend too. This and World at War are the two greatest Cod games to date by FAR"
17177,"Good game, downside was NAT type was strict. Other than that. 7/10 Good Game"
17178,"Love this game even with all the bullshit modded servers (that most idiots insist on having when they get host). Even with tubes and commando and the g18s and the camping and the snipers this is without a doubt the single best shooter ever. Totally recommend, just buy it cheaper on g2a or g2play because 18,74 is way too much for a 5 year old with about 1000 total players online..."
17179,"I'm a bit late for this, but man bro man dude man dis cray. MW2 still holds up to today's standards and what I believe is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series so far. Compared to recent releases, this game is like a sleepover on 4/20 blaz it yoloswag day when the MLG pros gather up and eat the cheese of the fruit of vegetables. You just gotta eat your vegetables if you wanna play this game. The story? Shepard seems like a pretty cool guy who you would have a sleepover with, but things take a turn for the worse when [spoiler] certain people die [/spoiler]. Overall 7/10 story would play again."
17180,I really enjoy the multiplayer of this game as well as the story line. I tend to play multiplayer more on this game then any other call of duty just because of the style of play. I enjoy the story and the visuals!

17187,"One of the best CODs IMHO, too bad not many players are online now, but still it's my favourite :)"
17188,Simply. THE BEST CALL OF DUTY EVER
17189,"This was the first FPS and the first M-rated game I ever played, I may be biased, but in my opinion, this stands as the best Call of Duty to have ever come out.

PROS:
+An epic story spanning all over the world, including Russia, Brazil, Afghanistan, and the United States.
+Amazing setpieces with powerful scenes, from a dicey escape from Brazil to an underwater infiltration in Russia to the epic Battle for the White House.
+Fun, interesting characters I cared about despite the majority of their lines being battlefield chatter.
+Nice callbacks to the events of Call of Duty 4.
+Far more weapons than its predacessor.
+Vastly more detailed multiplayer than Call of Duty 4, with different grenades, more perks, more killstreaks, and far more maps.
+TACTICAL NUKE! INCOMING!
+Cooperative Special Ops mode with all sorts of fun missions!
+Hans Zimmer does the score, and it is by far the best soundtrack of any Call of Duty.
+Amazing graphical improvement over CoD 4.

CONS:
-The story is confusing at first, with a surprise villain who isn't explained well. I had to read a sypnosis to understand everyone and their motivations.
-Multiplayer is unbalanced, wtih a handful of guns being amazingly superior to all other guns.
-Grenade launchers are still overpowered, and camping with grenade launchers and One Man Army remains an easy way to get a Tactical Nuke.
-Map balance is changed. Instead of there being many choke points which can be fought over or flanked (like in CoD 4), there's an insane open flow to all maps, making it so there's (at most) one or two hotly contested locations in Team Deathmatch or Free-for-all.

It's my favorite Call of Duty, but I can see why people don't like it. That doesn't stop me from having fun with it, though."

WTF Sledgehammer games i though you were going to fix COD. also im too stupid to DL an aimbot or a hack to unlock everything so that obviously is the games fault so fuck this game it SUCX."
17201,Best COD ever made
17202,"Bigger, better, and more bombastic than its predecessor, ""Modern Warfare 2"" is an excellent production. All of the good elements (the basic gameplay mechanics, environments, sense of ""epicness,"" and so on) have been pushed up at least one notch.

At the same time, the debatable elements have also gone up a notch. (This doesn't negate the ""better"" statement above. ""Modern Warfare 2"" is a one-trick pony, but it does that one trick in a way that feels generally more developed than the original.) I felt even a bit more constrained than I did in the original, with missions boiling down to ""move, shoot a bit, find an opening, repeat."" Because the thrill ride is so pre-planned, there just isn't room to try anything really interesting. This is especially unfortunate late in the game, when a certain mission that could have been an exercise in innovative defense turns into little more than ""find a good corner and bang away."" The early-game mission with strong stealth elements feels like a tease of what could have been - it was truly interesting, but nothing like it comes up again.

And, at the very end, the game tosses out its core mechanics in order to present a certain dramatic narrative. ""Press X repeatedly to view the cliffhanger ending."" Sigh.

These issues aren't deal breakers by any means. As a metaphorical ""theme park attraction,"" this game is certainly worth playing. You just have to realize that this particular piece of software isn't really any more than that. The developers certainly made a title to be proud of, but there's something sort of...intangibly ""shallow"" about how it all goes down."
17203,Campaign is pretty good but cancerous multiplayer cause the players are the most annoying little fucking noob tubing & camping rats ever.

With Blacks Ops the best Call of Duty so far !"
17220,"Meh, its oki but. not unique or a good fps shooter."
17221,It's pretty good
17222,"Brilliant FPS , It's the god of Call of Duty . But Infinity Ward and Valve really need too watch over this game . There is way too much hackers. Like once this guy was in a lobby rank 2 and all of a sudden hes rank 70. The story line is amazing . You in a snowy terrain then all of a sudden you chasing a guy in A Favela of Rio de Janerio. This is full with action just like the old Call of Duty 4 (Shoutout) . The one thing that they need to fix is it is really hard to join friends , pretty much impossible. The mute button does come in handy with the squeakers (little kids) that scream through the mic when they  get killed.
Very good game. Why are you still reading this? get this game NOW!"
17223,"can you help me with my texture erros
"
17224,very fun
17225,"In most multiplayer games, kids like to adapt what I call the ""naiive driver"" attitude, where cars going faster/driving more aggressive than you are crazy, reckless, cop magnets. while cars going slower/driving more passively than you are obviously in no hurry to get anywhere, they must be senior citizens in the driver seat and well the world would be better off without them.

This game is absolutely ridden with children like these. I consider myself a pretty good player (I get some ridiculous KDRs...) but as always, those who are better than you MUST be hacking. Those who are worse than you are fucking noobs and need to learn how to play.

In addition to the community complaints, I have a bone to pick with those who consistently use the most overpowered or trolling weapons. People like to justify this with ""its in the game"", but this fallacy is overturned when they realize that metaknight is in super smash bros brawl, the moon breaker laser was in Golden Eye, and the 1-hit-KO hadouken upgrade was in megaman X. Just because the programmers of the game wanted to make a few guns easier to use and overall better than others doesn't mean they meant for the grenade launchers and akimbo glocks to be abused all the damn time. Yes they're programmed into the game and if you buy it you'll have to deal with it.

Pros: I liked the single player campaign it was fun. Spec ops are fun too.
Cons: Community in multiplayer blows, hackers run amok fucking with lobbies and your customized classes and whatnot, some children will whine and cry while others will troll the hell out of u with cheap strategies and annoying classes.

Don't get this game I still play it because I'm good enough to fuck with everyone. That's about it."
17226,great game...
17227,"SP is quite short but keeps you on your toes, great game 7/10."
17228,"So this is difficult to recommend or not this game. 

The game is great. In all my library, this is the game I played the most. 

The single  player campaign is really what we can expect from a Call of Duty game : intense, but of course, a bit short, so I recommend you play in high difficulties.

There is a cooperative mode with small missions for 2 players. This is a very interesting feature. The missions have a large variety, and are quite challenging. There are awsome to play with a friend.

The multiplayer part : Great, not perfect because there is really overpowered combinations of weapons, but this game is great in multiplayer. It brought a lot of perks and killstreaks when it was released. The problem for me is the lobby system. There is no private servers or a server browser. So it is difficult to find a game with people on it since most of the community moved to more recent episodes.

If you want to play this game just for the multiplayer part, forget it. If you want to play the single player part, or coop part, go for it."
17229,"Just like any other COD game, if you like COD games in general then you'll like it."
17230,"Nice Story! Very well designed Special Ops missions. I wonder if Activision make all COD games like this(of course, especially story part)."
17231,"The game is still good man
Old but still gold.
May encounter hacked lobbies from time to time
But the multiplayer is still playable with dedicated players inside"
17232,Ramirez! Write this review for me soldier!
17233,"Best CoD game ever made. I r8 it 8/8, m8."
17234,"Game sucks, wouldnt even think about buying it."
17235,"ONE THING I CAN SAY....ACTION "" PACK""...FULL THROTTLE...A REAL BLAST""...BUT TOO MUCH HACKERS"
17236,"The only reason I recommend this game is so more legit players and hosts play.  An absolute unbelievable amount of hacked/modded lobbies.  There are regular cheaters (aimbots, wallhacks, etc.) but it seems that most were just interested in hacking lobbies

Game itself is pretty good."
17237,"i would highly recommend this game really to anyone. SP, MP, Spec Ops, you name it, its fine. Now the problem: the hackers. Tons and Tons! You wont be in a game without one. (for the most part) and i will admit, im vac banned from this game. i did hack (prestige hack, all unlocked) but im willing to make a new steam account and rebuy the game (not to hack) but to play again! so damn fun!"
17238,"If you are really into COD you will give this a 5 out of 5, however I give this a 4.5 out of 5 because of how entertaining it is. There are even some funny glitches to keep you laughing while going through a good but not the best that could have been provided for the game (not including the amazing airport level). If you are into the multiplayer of it the game play was quite entertaining for only at least an hour due to the lag was unbearable at times while at other times other people lagging could ruin your fun."
17239,This is a great game. Multiplayer sucks because there are A LOT of threatening modders/hackers. All I personally care about is this campaign. It was amazing and has a great story that you can play over and over.

17243,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."
17244,"Definitely one of the most fun in the COD series, but neglected badly on PC like others in the series...
You can easily see this by comparing the amount of players on this to COD 4. A game that was released 3 years prior and is coming close to its 10th birthday, has almost 10x more players. This is because the game was done RIGHT for the PC community, it isn't infested with game breaking perks like ""Danger Close"" which encourage the use of highly overpowered explosives that ultimately ruin the game. Not only is the game itself broken, the lack of dedicated server support means joining a lobby and calling someone a noob could result in everything you have done, being completely reset. 

I am not encouraging piracy by stating this but the truth is the truth. When the cracked FREE versions of the game are better, you should know you've failed... I could go on and on and on but it doesn't matter because this game will never be fixed. As I stated in the beginning, even though it's a VERY broken game, it can still be VERY fun at times.

TL;DR: Don't buy the game unless it's on sale."

17258,"So having played COD since I was 7 and having played 1 all the way to blops 2, I and owning 1,2,4,blops, mw3 and blops 2 I decided to buy and try the seriously over hyped and overated MW2. campaign was good when you weren't playing as the amerians. spec ops is a good memory of mine from playing the burger bar defense mission co-op on an xbox but this is by far the most overrated cod ever made. good for a game, bad for a cod game. that said, I still enjoy playing it tho."

17260,"Got vac banned because i joined a game,not knowing there was hackers.I left,then a couple of days later i was banned from multiplayer.

10/10 would buy again"
17261,"I can't believe how much time my clan has spent on this game. We always pop on for a quick game. The game play is great. Servers ahave always been good. It's a shame this game still doesn't have many players any more. Also the hacking is an issue, but isnt that in every game also. :)"
17262,Blew everyone up with a Nuke once and my whole team proceeded to yell Allahu Akbar for 5 minutes straight. Best game since a long time. 10/10.

17265,its a fun combat game to play

17267,"I,M AN OLD BOY 55 IF YOU NEED TO KNOW .
i,v been playing this and other games on multiplayers for years now.
i have played the best but i have seen the worst and you have got to admit 
to your selves that its not the game thats got the problem ( after all we make 
games to suit all needs ) its the players.
and what you want as one that counts.
if you want to trot along on multiplayer as normal thats fine,
if you want a hack involved thats fine.
if you want an aimbot thats fine.
but just injoye the game, after all its what you make it that counts"
17268,"Hands down, best CoD ever!!"
17269,"Modern Warfare 2 is by far the least traditional of the series, with the core package broken up into three main pillars of gameplay. Single-player fans have their main campaign, if you're down for more co-op gameplay either locally or via online connection you've got the new Spec Ops mode, and Modern Warfare's groundbreaking multiplayer is back, and truly better than ever. There's an overwhelming amount of content to experience, but with each mode being 100% standalone in nature, you're getting three completely different experiences all in one. That, however, also plays a huge factor into how your final opinion of Modern Warfare 2 as a whole turns out.

First and foremost is the single-player experience. As the anchor of the Call of Duty world, campaign mode is back, and it's intense. You'll instantly get a sense of just how far the improved engine has come when you're thrown into the bustling streets of Rio de Janeiro's favela, the ice-capped mountains of Kazakhstan, the dusty roads of Afghanistan, and other unexpected locales. On the visual side of things, Modern Warfare 2 is an obvious step up over Call of Duty 4 and World at War, with a stronger emphasis on complex terrain in the environments, weather effects, destructible objects, and the overall sense of action and chaos that comes with so many visual improvements. This is only complemented further by the increased attention to sound design, with the effects of many returning weapons being re-recorded,even more in-level chatter amongst your allies, and a truly captivating score by Hans Zimmer which builds based on specific in-game moments. Modern Warfare 2 feels like an action movie through and through, with the production values alone dating Infinity Ward's last game, Call of Duty 4, quite a bit.

At the same time, the single-player campaign has its issues. For starters, it's short. I've been playing Call of Duty 4 steadily since its release, and my first completion of the Modern Warfare 2 campaign came in at just under five hours on regular difficulty. Playing through on hardened will add another hour and a half onto that. Modern Warfare 2 is definitely more chaotic this time around ‚Äì partially due to the new visual effects and upped production values ‚Äì and with the improved enemy AI and tough scenario design you'll be fighting for every checkpoint. One of the larger visual changes to the game's heads-up display this time around is the blood splatter system. In previous Call of Duty offerings you'd get damaged, the screen would start to shade red, and you'd be required to seek cover before your vision returned to normal. Modern Warfare 2 employs a new system, actually having a thicker blood layer added to up the realism. There's been some discussion on whether the splatter is too distracting, and in my experience with the game it's far from an issue. You'll be able to take more hits on easier difficulty settings, so while a few well-placed shots will drop players on hardened or veteran modes the added splatter is an acceptable trade-off for more overall health"
17270,"The only good CoD in my List were CoD4 and Mw2. And then, everything changed.
It started to turn bad from here. Test it, feel the difference.
CoD4 had for example community servers, mods ect.
Mw2 has not this kind of thing 6.5/10"
17271,"It's good game is very fun 
Heores of America"
17272,it was alright i guess
17273,"Great game, RIP Ghost."
17274,"Well this game use to be amazing, and it STILL can be; if you play with your friends..
The multiplayer is now plagued with either hackers, or some CRAZY gamemodes, which you don't always get to choose from. People STILL play this game, so if you sit and roll for a new lobby for half an hour, you have a good chance to be matched up in the gamemode you wanted, playing with some awesome people.
Pros: Still an awesome game, awesome maps, good specops/ singleplayer
AMAZING TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS
Cons: Hackers, modded lobbies, not too many players."
17275,"Reason why the game is good:

-It has the weapon Intervention"
17276,"It was a good game,actualy it was the first ever game where you can trickshot.
But when the game reached lower number of players,it finnaly dissapeared from the mans eye.
It all changed when hackers fell in.There was hacked servers everywere.
All the reports of hackers,cheaters,modders,nothing helped,
not even VAC(Valve Anti-Cheat System).
But there was a thing that was good.
The hackers did not hack you,juts the server you were playing.
So maybe you get in a fun looby,like Prop Hunt,qs loobyes and a lot more.
This game needs more players so i recommend trickshooters hop in to this classic,and have a litlle fun trickshooting or quickscoping in this game.

I unknowingly joined one of the many rampant hacked lobbies that the all of the hackers were creating, was instantly max level and had everything unlocked, and then was subsequently banned.  Good job Valve...how bout you improve VAC and do something about the real hackers in these games?

Would be a 9/10, but the hackers and faulty VAC detection make this stank, festering pile of elephant feces a 0/10."
17309,"When you look at the total package, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is hands-down one of the best first-person shooters out there, and a truly amazing offering across any system. With that being said, our score comes with a disclaimer. For those planning to check out everything Modern Warefare 2 has to offer ‚Äì online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign ‚Äì you‚Äôre looking at a no-brainer purchase. For the strictly single player crowd, however, Modern Warfare 2 is surprisingly short, and doesn‚Äôt live up to the standard set by previous Call of Duty games. The campaign can be completed in as little as six and a half hours, and the missions make better scenarios and moment-to-moment adrenaline rushes than they do a cohesive, well-told story. If you‚Äôre going solo, you‚Äôve officially been warned. Look at the complete Modern Warfare 2 experience though, and there‚Äôs no denying its rightful place at the top."

17328,"Still the best Call of Duty in my opinion.  Advanced Warfare can take that spot if they addressed the  optimization and gameplay balance issues.
Still has a good sizeable community, however only team deathmatch and hardcore team deathmatch are the only game modes people play on actively.  The rest of the game modes are pretty dead.
No, the game isn't plagued by hackers as a lot of people claim.  I'd say 1/100 games there is one.
The campaign still remains my favorite out of all CoD campaigns.
Good fun for casual play."
17329,"[h1] Before I give my thoughts on the game, allow me to provide some info on how to improve your experience, especially with FOV (Singleplayer & Spec' Ops)[/h1]

[list]

[*] Locate your config.cfg file (Found in Steam > Steamapps > common > Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 > players). It can be opened with both Wordpad & Notepad, like a .txt file. There is also a mp_config.cfg, but I believe for MW2, additions there are either limited or completely restricted for obvious reasons (Unfortunate as COD4 did allow for a more limited FOV adjustment & other non-balance related commands).

[*] Find [b]seta monkeytoy ""1""[/b] (can be found easily by searching monkey with Ctrl+F) and change it to [b]seta monkeytoy ""0""[/b].

[*] Copy the following as shown (in [b]Bold[/b]) right below all existing text:

[b]spu[/b]

[b]set developer ""0""[/b] (You may need to change this to ""1"" initially, but switching it back to ""0"" after I made my binds, they worked just as before. You'll want to switch it to ""0"" as otherwise you'll get a lot of yellow dev text during many segments of gameplay that only the No-HUD bind can otherwise switch off)
[b]set sv_cheats ""1""[/b]
[b]set thereisacow ""1337""[/b]

From this point, you'll be able to bind keys to such things as FOV, viewmodel distance, HUD on/off, Noclip, and others (As unlike it's predecessors, Modern Warfare 2 doesn't allow access to the Developer Console). Just make sure that when you're done, Right Click on ""config.cfg"", go to ""Properties"", and then tick ""Read Only"" when you're done, just to make sure your configurations aren't reset when you load up the game.

The related articles from the [url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_2] PC Gaming Wiki [/url] & [url=http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Developer_console] Call of Duty Wiki [/url] can provide more information on what binds can be made.

Personally, I use:

[b]bind 8 ""cg_fov 80""[/b] = FOV 80¬∞ (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)
[b]bind 9 ""cg_fov 90""[/b] = FOV 90¬∞ (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)
[b]bind O ""cg_draw2D 1""[/b] = HUD On
[b]bind P ""cg_draw2D 0""[/b] = HUD Off (EVERYTHING aside from viewmodels is wiped clean, including subtitles until HUD is truned back on)
[b]bind 0 ""cg_gun_x -1""[/b] = Viewmodel position -1, X axis (Note that this will affect ironsights, so adjusting the Y & Z axis won't improve gameplay. Editing the X axis positively will take your viewmodels further, whilst editing it negatively will bring your viewmodels closer, which can be benefitical on FOV 90¬∞ & above if you want to avoid seeing floating shotgun shells or ""through the shoulder"" on a very select few weapons whose animations weren't fully suited to FOVs above 80 or below)
[b]bind - ""cg_gun_x 0""[/b] = Default Viewmodel Distance

You can assign any key you want for your binds (That the game's controls isn't currently using of course) and set any value within it's range you wish to such things as FOV (Say, you can have 85¬∞ or 96¬∞ if you wanted), but those are my preferences as they're far out of reach from my default controls and can't be accidentally pressed.

There are third-party tools to adjust FOV in multiplayer (Which unlike during Call of Duty: Ghosts' launch period, will not get you banned either by Infinity Ward & Activision nor by Valve's Anti-Cheat System). A Steam Guide here has the tool & details: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=154105687

Right, with that cleared up. [/list]

[h1]My Review[/h1]

Well, I can quickly state that while it's arguably one of the weaker titles in the franchise, it's definitely not the weakest PC release, despite being clear it's a console port. It runs very well, being not particularly tasking on HDD space nor performance by today's standards (Although being capped at 91fps may not be convenient for those with 120hz+ monitors or a real need for FPS, aswell as a select number of chipsets reportedly being unsupported for the Mac OSX port, which the PC Gaming Wiki article can detail if necessary). I certainly can't name any performance issues on my end.

[b]Singleplayer[/b]
The Singleplayer experience can be summed up as ""Call of Duty 4 cranked to 11"", as unlike it's more believable predecessor who rarely took away the player's control while the cinematic events occured, the setpieces are both in abundance & high spectacle, with numerous quick-time events to boot, for which many are memorable often thanks to the strong soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer & Lorne Balfe.

[b]Spec Ops (Co-op)[/b]
The 2-Player co-op experience, ""Spec Ops"" is actually one of Modern Warfare 2's stronger features. It's a mission based mode with a wide variety of gameplay elements & objectives, which either originate from Modern Warfare 2 & Call of Duty 4 or occasionally are unique to Spec Ops, all with a Three Star system awarded based on either difficulty completion, time completion or other mission unique tiers. Such things as a Snowmobile race & time trail, covering a co-op partner from a Black Hawk or AC130, or getting All Ghillied Up together, along with the more classical eliminate all targets, survive or complete-a-mission affairs. Whilst most of these can be played solo, there are a small number of missions that do require a co-op partner (Along with some where a Co-op partner is ideal to completing Veteran difficulty, especially with being able to revive each other presents it's own strategies). With the right buddy, it can be quite the fun!

[b]Multiplayer[/b]
I can only give you my experience from the Xbox 360, but based on the brief return on PC just for experimentation's sake, not an awful lot has changed. I don't know how abundant hacking remains (To which on Xbox 360, it was utterly rampant!) but I have heard concerns from players that not only is hacking still rampant, but you yourself could be at risk from being VAC-Banned just by joining a matchmade game with or controlled by said hackers (I've had a somewhat similar experience in Gears of War 2 when my stats were permanently affected by being matchmade with illegitimate players, aswell as an occasion I was matchmade with hackers on MW2 [X360], which although neither resulted in any official bans, I'd say the concern should be at least considered valid), so it may be wise to proceed with caution if you wanna play Multiplayer outside of Private Matchplay, or be prepared to hightail it if you notice anything very unusual. Regardless, I can probably sum it up as a pit of out-of-control chaos with ""noob-tubing"" & death from above everywhere! (As this is Call of Duty 4 Multiplayer cranked to 17, which I personally classify as not a good thing). Perks have evolved from their more subtle kit choices to something comparable to super-hero powers, especially when you get their Pro upgrades (Commando Pro being among the most notorious). As for the Kill-Streaks, well, instead of being the assisting tools of winning the game, a significant selection pretty much is the gameplay & game-winners to anyone who can manage to avoid dying. You can rain death-from-above on a massive scale with AC130s, Attack Helicopters, Harriers, Bombing Runs, Stealth Bombers, Predator Missiles, maybe more. And of course, reel in 25 kills with all that and you have it equipped, hit the Nuke to win the game! (Provided your team or the enemy doesn't do it for you before the bomb drops).


[b]Verdict[/b]
Well, it's a limited recommendation. If you are willing to put your brain away for some utterly disorganised chaos of a multiplayer, eager to gear up for a potentially challenging co-op mode, or want a short & somewhat dumb (as a whole), but highly explosive & cinematic singleplayer experience, then I can recommend it.

If you're looking for something more exceptional and/or refined, I can gladly say that the PC platform has a large quantity of offerings to cater to that need."
17330,awesome game had some really good memorys playing this as a youngster
17331,"Best Call of Duty game ever! Even better than Call of Duty: AW.

17336,Thats a really nice game :-)
17337,"Five years ago I bought this game in the blink of an eye, and the world  (people at Gamestop) just f****g watched.

CAMPAIGN - The campaign is a very good, action packed, fast paced, cliche thrill ride, like a Michael Bay flick, except instead of spectating, you get to participate in. It continues indirectly about 5 years (see a theme going on here?) after the events of Call Of Duty 4, and you play as a variety of characters and take part in a variety of over the top events in massive setpieces. One even is allowed to partake in the massacre of civilians, which might be in bad taste for sensitive individuals, but I honestly felt the whole sequence was an arbitrary catalyst for you to shoot stuff, and seems like IW just squeezed it in there for the shock value than actually advancing the plot. Not much else is to be said, but if you want a thrill ride, play it, it's a fairly short campaign, with a run on Regular lasting only about 5-6 hours depending on how fast you play. 

There is also replay value in Veteran Mode, if you are an achievement hunter like I am, but be prepared to die, see lots of red jelly on your screen, and a lot of ""eh eh eh eh eh ahhhh"" when you get shot every 15 seconds. I find it odd and stupid you grunt and groan the same way no matter who you play as, but the real question is, who the hell does that? It sounds more like something else was going on when they recorded that clip, and that's been in every COD since 4. Get some new sounds going on IW. Other than that nothing else to be said about the campaign.

SPEC OPS - More replay value action here, run through a bunch of recycled maps and assets from the campaign, alone or with a friend. Get completely torn up by Juggernauts in the Delta and Echo ops on Veteran. Rage quit and try again for insignificant gratification of virtual stars. Great fun.

MULTIPLAYER - 2009, absolute fun, with almost 200-300 hours clocked on my console version, its a blast just jumping into a game and blasting people away with M1887'S or Glockin' someone's grill up by drop shotting them. Lot of unlock, lots of weapons and killstreaks to play with, and the gimmicky prestiging, if you're into that sort of stuff.
The maps are similar, but not wholeheartedly recycled from the campaign, and 90% of the maps I enjoyed, and varied from long sightlines to close quarters height based combat. I dare say it was probably the best MP experience of the time.
2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 - The multiplayer is absolute fecal matter exhumed from buffalos, its absolutely abysmal, plagued with hackers, boosters, cheaters, noob-tubers, the list goes on. 95% use OMA Pro, Danger Close with a TAR-21 GL and noob-tubes across the maps infinitely, and you'd be lucky if anyone is using a assault rilfe, or even playing this game now. Since COD has now become a epitome of FPS and dished out annually, it is expected that support will be relinquished for this game, but that just shows how much Activision and IW care about their products after less than 11 months on the shelves.

CONCLUSION - Good SP experience, OK MP experience, if you play spec ops or have private matches, but don't buy it for MP, even for 10 bucks save your money, and don't be a fool to also buy all the map packs that you'll never get to because the game is pretty much dead, only populated with sad lonely hackers that feel some gratification cheating on a 5 year old video game.

I FOCKIN' RECOMMEND THIS"
17339,10/10 Amazing game. Astounding to me that this game is 5 years old and i love it more than Advanced Warfare.
17340,Best of the franchise in my opinion.
17341,"Its a great game! 




OMG NOSCOPE MOUNTAIN DEWWWW DORITOES!!! OOHHHHH (every cod kid)"
17342,XD
17343,I like ACR.
17344,"Let me apologize and say I am way late to the review party of COD MOD 2. This is my second playthrough of the game and I enjoyed it a lot on the 360. On the 360 it was my favorite multiplayer Call of Duty (with the exception of Black Ops 2, possibly) but it sure as heck was the most I played. I was a 10th Prestiege on the 360, where as a 2nd in BO2. However,  for my review on Steam I will not be reviewing the multiplayer. Haven't even touched it.

MW2 has 2 single player components, and sadly no zombies. Zombies are not in any Infinity Ward developed Call of Duty. The campaign is fun and and full of twists and turns to delight the player and leads directly into MW3 (which I will replay after I beat MW2). It's the sequel to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and picks up 5 years after. Modern Warfare (the first) had some amazing moments which were more dramatic than anything in MW2, though the end was pretty good. The campaign for a modern FPS is 4.5 out 5 stars. Spec Ops the Line was better, but you could argue first vs third person perspectives and how Spec Ops isn't a FPS. To say the least, the Modern Warfare games have better plots than any of the WW2 call of Dutys and most other FPS's.

Secondly, there is Spec Ops (the mode, not the game) in which you can play 1-2 players but comes downloaded with the campaign. It's short mission based levels that have difficulty stars leveled 1 to 3. After you unlock so many stars you    can unlock more levels for a total of 69 stars, I aced these on the 360 and have played some but they truely shine to be played with a friend (some even require 2 people). I don't think I will play many of these levels on this playthrough and it's not going to keep the game installed on my hard drive, that being said if you want a 4-5 hour interactive action movie. I recommend this game. I am sure by now you all have played it, if you haven't you must not play FPS games and if that the case this game isn't going to change that."
17345,Amazing game really recommend ok story but multiplayer is the best love its just amazing
17346,"svp debane moi jai rien fait <3

17351,"Finished Game .  Great Game .
   Excellent Lead In to   Modern Warefare 3"
17352,"This game has the best multi-player of all modern warfare. And even much better then BO2 and BO3. It is really an enjoyable game. The only things that makes it bad are, the hackers and noobtubes.

10/10"
17353,Really fun OG cod wouldnt get it now though becuase the servers are pretty dead
17354,its ok
17355,YES IT:S AWESOME :)
17356,the last best COD. pisses on everything after blackops 1
17357,Great game...  Archaic match making system makes multiplayer very hit and miss.
17358,"Best CoD made so far 
Love the killstreaks and weapons
Cons: needs a mod for a legacy browser (which i got)
super fun and addictive 
fast pace run n gun for mindless fun
The perks are probably the best part of this game 
If this game had the class customization of Ghost (but not the horrible ported gameplay) it would be the greatest game of all time (i would have all perks and a only knife then)
Multiplayer: Get a legacy browser mod or your not going to find a match
No hackers or cheats of anykind (people who say there're are just bad )

Havnt played it in years and i still am good my best match so far is on skidrow lvl16 M4A1 with grenade launcher, sleight of hand, stopping power, steady aim, Care package, UAV, Predator Missile
Kills 97 Deaths 50  playing against prestige 10's and some other randoms 
"
17359,Dis be shit yo.
17360,unforgettable game :)
17361,"Lot's of Modders/Hackers in the Community of MW2. It ruins everything about the game. 
There are occasionally unhacked or unmodded games which comes with high latency (ping).
Network quality is very poor; Host has 4 or 5 while everyone gets 1 or 2."
17362,"A very good FPS game that is absolutely ruined by the hacking.  

A gamer cannot play a game when another player 1 shots them from accross the entire map with a pistol/grenade/knife.

That isn't gameplay, that is grief play.  It's so bad i cannot recommend this game."
17363,"I love this game, but be warned! This game includes campers, trash talkers, noob tubers, hackers, lag and other(s). Campaign's story might be a little farfetched and slightly cramped but this game will blow you away. Players can play multiplayer or spec ops with friends, or with random strangers. The most important thing is to remember is to stay away form hackers/exploiters, they will change your rank, class name, and also they make you look like the hacker/exploiter by framing you, you are the one who gets the VAC ban, just like me."
17364,I played 604 hours on this game. It was good.
17365,good
17366,old but very ineresting game
17367,"WOW much no scope, very ping m8/10 would noscope again"
17368,Awesome stuff!

17376,"There is too meny hacked lobbys on this game. Buy the Mordern Warfare 3 insted. just saying

I playid this game om ps3 for like 300 hours but the pc version is just 
:/ bad"
17377,"Probably the best CoD multi i have played. Still people on multiplayer.

DONT BUY ANY DLC! It ruins your game because you won't find any games and you can't unselect it!
Only thing you can do is ask steam support to delete DLC from your account (and it deletes it forever)."
17378,Does a 1v5 gets kicked 10/10

17392,Still the best COD game...
17393,"The best call of duty. Too bad IW doesn't care about it anymore. Excellent game, still some multiplayer but only TDM, Domination, and a few FFA and SnD. Also, lots of hackers."
17394,Good shit

17405,"Join My group all Indians, and asians for call of duty modern warfare 2 Multiplayer. Low Ping guranteed."
17406,"When this game came out it was at a time when the Call of Duty series was in the height of its popularity and arguably the prime of the games themselves. Modern Warfare 2 smashed sales records and was one of the most played games on the platforms it was released on albeit less popular on pc. The single player has always been my favorite part of the Call of Duty series harboring back to the days of Finest Hour on Playstation 2. Its basically an action movie that you can play. For the people who say ""its not realistic, its completely insane to think this would ever be possible!"" that's the point. I enjoy the hell out of the whole game but the single player is my favorite. You play as various characters in an epic globe trotting campaign that picks up right where the first modern warfare ended. Its a bit short (4 to 5 hours and more if playing on veteran difficulty) but its a satisfying single player. The multiplayer on the other hand is a very mixed bag. There are so many design decisions that Infinity Ward made with this game that blows my mind. Guns that are insanely overpowered, perks that are insanely overpowered, really easy quickscoping which is absolutely infuriating in my opinion, overpowered kill streaks i mean the list goes on and on. Counter Strike pisses me off to no end but at least its balanced. This game is not balanced at all when it comes to the multiplayer. To be frank, the multiplayer is a complete mess and there are tons of hackers in this thing. The worst things about this game are the fact that there is no way to change the field of view so if your a person who gets sick from a narrow (65 to be exact) field of view, your going to have problems with this game. There is however a tool that you can download that changes the fov to whatever you like but unfortunately it only works for multiplayer. I will say that this tool makes the multiplayer much more playable. There is no dedicated servers, just a very bad matchmaking system. The multiplayer is very fun but its heavily flawed. The final mode is spec ops. This is very fun because its short little missions quite often based on single player campaign levels and you can play it with a friend which makes it much more fun. When you start there are 5 levels unlocked and as you go through you earn stars on each level you complete. Once you earn enough stars it unlocks the next set of missions and so on. All and all i say if you like the Call of Duty brand of gameplay you won't be disappointed or maybe you will i don't know. But if you don't like the Call of Duty style then there isn't one thing that will change your mind in this title. I do recommend it for the single player."
17407,best call of duty multiplayer besides cod 4. nuff said
17408,"ƒ∞ts Super Game!! Buy The Game
"
17409,"As a huge fan of Infinty Ward's Call of Duty series, I have to admit that this one, Modern Warfare 2 is my personal favourite. Well it is a simple First Person Shooter game with easy and simple mechanics (like almost every FPS game). I found the Single Player storyline interesting and awesome (great fights, and great scenes in general) and I have to admit that I wanted MORE of it when I finally finished it. Although there were many negative reviews and comments about it, and to be more specific, about the mission ""No Russian"" in which you are [b]asked[/b] if you really want to play it or skip it, I think that Modern Warfare 2 is a worty replacer of its predecessor Modern Warfare, which was a huge success for Infinity Ward. If I have to mention something that dissapointed me, this is the game's community, which is small and...unfortunately very toxic. This is maybe the only reason, why [u]I do not reccomend[/u] the [b]Multiplayer[/b] on this game.

I give this game [b]7/10[/b]"

You more often than not get in a match just to have the host leave and the game tries to find a new host but then crashes. That is if you even get in a match to begin with. This game has always been infected with hackers vs cheaters battles and the legit players stuck in between.

17514,Modern Warfare 2 is currently one of my favorite Call of Duty games. It's a lot more simplistic than the newer ones. I like to play it once in a while to see what it felt like to play it again(last time I was really in to it was in high school). It's still a lot of fun although it's a little depressing to see how few people play this game.
17515,"this game is epic, and is the best first person shooter game that I have EVER played"
17516,best game since 2008 or 2009 i  dont know anymore
17517,simbly... ebin
17518,I made 500H in multiplayer after release. I can call myself a veteran. I played on Alter-I.W too. It's sad. Cheaters took over multiplayer and there is no Alter IW to hang to. I miss this multiplayer. Single and CO-OP mode are still great.

17521,"Got this game when I bought my new laptop in order to bring back good memories.  However, as expected there's only small community of players left meaning that there are mainly only games in TDM,S&D,HC-TDM & FFA. In these games modes there are often hacked servers, low gravity, prestige, wall hacks amongst the other classics."
17522,+BEST COD OF ALL YEARS
17523,this game brings back allot of memory :D 10/10
17524,"u should def get dis game for mw2 there tots not hackers 

















Lel there is but still fun game with friends :O"
17525,Since this game other Call of Dutys are expansions for MW2.

Or any cod tbh
I FOCKIN' RECOMMEND THIS

Oh and i have played this game for 200 hrs or so so don't worry about that it says 69 hrs"
17527,"Well, actually, this game is the best one of the COD series. When I was still young I heard about this game in the news. That's really amazing, isn't it? I living in China and we don't have much news about games, but however, MW2 it.
With the fantastic story of MW, MW2 lead us to the top of MW series, even it was published in 2009, it is still a great game.
With 60fps on PC and the fantastic weapon custom system in the muiltplayer, and of course the great co-op makes you and your friends more easy to fight against enemies. So if you hadn't played this game before, I strongly recommend you to have a try, oh, before play this, you need to play MW first, that is the origin of all this MW series, and you will know how the story began!"

"
17529,played countless hours on xbox. as in probably over 20 days. but recently its multiplayer experience is no longer fun. cant find many people and most of them are hackers. sad because this is my favorite cod of all time
17530,One of the best CoD in the series !!! still enjoyable nowadays.
17531,"Awesome Game! Epic Graphics, Just Love Online!"
17532,Remember - no Russian.
17533,"While the first Modern Warfare‚Äôs story was implausible at best, Modern Warfare 2‚Äôs story was downright silly. This was the first Call of Duty game that truly started to feel like a string of set-pieces. However, at this point, the series had not yet fully developed into the farce it would become.

Modern Warfare was known for its big twist, which made its story great. Modern Warfare 2 tried to capitalize on that infamy by doing the exact same thing, multiple times. It did not have the same effect.

There are some filler missions in the campaign that you will not ever go back to after the first time, but some campaign missions are genuinely fun to play over and over again (Wolverines!, for example). There is replay value here. Also, they finally removed the infinitely respawning enemies that previous installments were known for, which is a big plus.

The Spec Ops missions were actually a highlight of the game, if you could find a friend to play with. Playing as a sniper team together, or having one person provide fire support from an AC-130 was truly enjoyable.

Modern Warfare 2 is silly, but it‚Äôs probably the last still-enjoyable Call of Duty installment."
17534,Just don't do the mistake what i do because the game it's full of hackers and btw if u will place a hack noane will ban u because it's just full of those wores.It's a good game but full of hackers.This game need a bit more cheat protection because it's easy to place a hack invisible to vac u just can domnate de FFA.I just got a hacker in l00by and he dosen't care about vac bans he sayed: -I play this game whit hacks like 6 months and noane catch me. Now seriously if this game will get a better anti-cheat sisteam i will just play every day.
17535,"I have stopped playing this game and returned to it more times than I can remember. For me the online experience is as good as it got in a call of duty game. The graphics look nice considering its age, and it can run well on old computers. The gameplay is amazing as well, and I find unlocking weapons and improving them addicting. The only problem is that nowadays, about 1/2 maps will have a hacker in them, since InfinityWard doesn't really care about it anymore. Worth buying, especially if it goes on sale."

17544,"An old game that was great back in its time when it first came out and had me playing alot everyday. But as with everything in life, all good things must slowly come to an end. This game is no exception. Now It's sometimes on sale and I don't really know anyone that bothers playing this game anymore. Muliplayer died awhile ago from a slow decline in player base and ""newer"" releases in the series as with more people using aimbots and cheats. . .This game had everything going right for it gameplay and balance wise. Unless you have a gamer clan, group or alot of friends that play this game in a private server for fun, then I highly recommend it. But If your like me, just purchase it on a sale for game your game library and move on to greener pastures my friends.  6/10"

17549,"Arguably the best COD game ever made with a storyline continuing on where COD 4 left off and making the story line acctually intruining all though it won't win any awards for it..

The story line is fun but for today's standards a tat too linear. The multiplayer is probably one hell of nice one with very fun killstreaks, weapons and maps sucking you in for hours on end. And probably a cornerstone for a couple meme's and MLG video's ;).

7/10"
17550,"Single player's alright, but Multiplayer is where it's at.

There are plenty of games that don't offer a chance to new players. On so many other titles, you get completely f-cked by other players due to the difference in skill.

This game is different. Instead of getting f-cked by other people, the game f-cks you instead. Half the time it doesn't work properly, and it's completely unbalanced with a degenerate community. Quite often you'll encounter a hacker, and it's not rare to get stuck in a modded server. There's no Server Blacklist included, so you can enjoy getting thrown back into the same sh-thole over and over again. Enjoy the modded server admins who DDOS you if you use a weapon that they don't like. 

All in all, it's the classic Call of Duty experience. This game is a known carcinogen and I thoroughly recommend it for ages 8 to slept-with-ur-mom for hours of aggravated fun.

EDIT (9th Jan, 2015)
The limited concentration that this game requires at the casual level, as well as its fast-paced low-strategy gameplay, results in the player becoming accustomed to passively playing with the potential for high success. Because of this, it will be somewhat difficult to start playing other games again, as you are used to no-tactics gameplay."
17551,gooood!!
17552,it is a good game if you have alot of stratig skilles and if you dont its still alot of fun to play

17554,"Great game

Singleplayer was ok, the side missions to the main story were great and some of them are a real challenge, was dissapointed you couldnt do them all solo.

Multiplayer was the last  decent COD multiplayer since its predecessor COD 4. 

Definately worth a pickup if you havent already played it or are into FPS."

17557,"VAC ist ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•

Ich empfehle Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 nicht, auch wenn ich √ºber 150 Spielstunden im Multiplayer habe. Das Spiel ist sehr gut und man findet trotz vieler anderer CoDs noch aktive Spieler. Selbst das Matchmaking st√∂rt nicht sooooo sehr, da heutzutage fast jeder ne Inet Verbindung hat die das schafft.... ABER dieses SCHCHEI√ü VAC (Valve anti Cheat) geh√∂rt nicht in die CoD Reihe.
Ich zb wurde gebannt weil ich PRIVATE gemoddete Lobbys gemacht hab, in denen wir Sachen wie GunGame oder Snipermods gespielt haben. VAC findet selbst, dass ein FoV (Field of View) Changer ein cheat ist..........
VAC geh√∂rt einfach nur zu Valve spielen wie Half Life, da die ihre Spiele darauf anpassen und so Sachen. wie die. die mir passiert sind, unm√∂glich sind (wer schreibt so nen Satz!?). Holt euch lieber einen anderen CoD Teil (MW3 hat auch VAC) , , da die ein eigenes Ban System haben."

17594,"Wow, hahahaha. I was astonished when I played Modern Warfare 2. I assumed this would be better than the previous one but not this much, hahahahahaha. Higher quality of missions, More dramatic story, Even more optimized gameplay, It was a fantastic battle.

 +) Optimized gameplay including aiming, choice of weapons, ammos, mapping, etc.
 +) Amazing Background music.
 +) Very dramatic story.
 +) Higher quality of missions.
 +) Mission select menu afterwards.

17598,"summary: I realy do love the old cod games (mw1 and mw2) this game was a total cod gamechanger and basicaly the only good cod game after mw1. it worths plaing and its way better than any other newer cod game.

gameplay.
 Its realy good as you get many ""powerups"" like kill streaks with include the NUKE. all weapons have a very real like phisics. One of the things i hate and always hated with cod games is that things are in the map are: undestracible, undrivable and more witch exist in the one year beffore battlefield bad company 2.

graphics.
There not bad at all although the lighting is not great textures are very nicely made and everythig looks awsome.

price.
I didnt by it from steam servive witch costs 25$ but from a store where i bought it for 18$ and i think it worths the money."

17607,"I bought an Xbox 360 last week just to play MW2 on it. Now I have MW2 on every console ever.

P.S. Many people state that there are many, MANY hackers on PC but to be honest, PC has the least amount of hackers on any platform, ESPECIALLY PS3 (99999999 hackers). If you want MW2, get it on either PC or Xbox. MW2 <3.

P.P.S (I have hundreds more hours on multiplayer)"

17612,This game just sucks you inside it! I really like how its difficulty slowly changes from beginner to professional.
17613,The best Cod i've played by far. And the very fun multiplayer component of my favourite Cod game.
17614,"Last time I played this game, 4 years ago, the community was very active! But this is the Single Player version. Actually real good, it is a nice starting point: strenght up here and be ready for multiplayer battle!"
17615,i liked :D  and i hope play all games :P
17616,"This is an amazing game!
But there is lots of hackers and im very bored of them..
Hackers basicly ruin the game, without them the game would be 8/10
but with them its a good 6/10
And i have been playing this game for a while, never getting bored of it
but sometimes i take a break and come back to it and continue like a baws!"

17634,"The BEST cod game in the series. The way you could change up your killstreaks allowed for each person to provide certain roles within your groups. One player could be NOTHING but hardline - uav 2 kill spamming to give perma-radar as long as the enemy didn't shoot them down of course. Another player could be sentry placing to make area's hard to pass by giving better control over the map. 

The only negative things I could say are OMA tube campers and commando bullshit."

17643,"Great game. I know it's old, and I know it's home to the ""ragers"", but I'm reviewing the game for the game itself. At highest settings, the game has beautiful graphics. With a good graphics card, there is no lag, and the guns are all very realistic. I also love the maps. Honestly, the only downside is the community. Sometimes, there are some very annoying little kids that come on and simply just annoy everyone. If they get killed, they will not stop saying that you are ""hacking"" only because you killed them. Very annoying. Anway, besides that, the game is fantastic, especially for its time."
17644,"It makes fun, but when you come in a modded Lobby or in a hacked lobby or when you play with big n00b the game sucks. ;)"

In all seriousness though, best COD campaign and amazing multiplayer, but sometimes you get put in hacked lobbies and while there are only around 1000 people who still play it you'll always find a team deathmatch server, especially if you have an open NAT type. 

I give this game an InterventionFMJ/10."

17688,"Sometimes, you gotta go back to the original that kicked the series off... For this series of CoD - Modern Warfare, it was Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.

It's sad when you consider these two games together. And it's on the basis of how the franchise has gone. CoD4:MW will be something that is close to my First-Person Shooter gaming heart. It had a good storyline. It had good graphics, mechanics and it still has good controls. Look at Steam. Steam even recommends it, though at the Store price of $49.99US, to THIS DAY. Maybe the price is because of all the maps that you got for free when you bought the PC version and updated it with the patches. I do not know... But, my opinion is that the price of the game should be cheaper since it has been out for some years since its 2007 release.

Anyway, Modern Warfare 2, it seems, has something going on behind the 'scenes', so to speak. Still a good game... Still quite good controls and still quite good mechanics. But what happened to the leans? Remember them? Lean left, lean right? Q and E default controls from CoD:MW... They left that mechanic go and I was p-ssed after playing through CoD4:MW part way and getting used to them, and then going to MW2... I was sad to see them go. I do not whether this game is a console port or not, but I must say that even the Wii game called GoldenEye had its own version of leaning due to its original controls. Maybe the developing team left out the code needed for it... I do not know.

Anyway, it's a good game, considering that it costs $19.99. Downside, no lean function/controls... DLC costs money (Approx. $30.00US).

Final verdict: Don't play the multiplayer, if you don't want to. Prestige levels are for the show offs. Waste of time. Enjoy it for the story and get a friend to tag along for the Spec Ops missions.

After seeing this game on Veggie Tales, I knew I had to get a slice of the pie, so I naturally purchased this title and played it all the way through, and it was pretty cool. I would highly recommend buying this game with a bag of doritos and a bottle of Mountain Dew, for maximum enjoyment.

17701,"Personal rating: 5/10
Replayability: Low
Budget: If it's on sale and you like the franchise, buy it. 
Lenght: Half a day. 

Modern Warfare 2 takes everything that was good about Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 and slowly starts decomposing it. 

Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 are both interesting games because of the story, but this half-assed attempt to continue a story that really just isn't interesting or captivating anymore, is just... Tiring. 

The gameplay hasn't changed, the graphics might be a little better, but in a game like this, you don't really have time to stop and admire the scenery anyway. 

The game is extremely linear and you're left with a constant feeling of frustration from not being allowed to make any decisions ever, and basically being treated like a side-character in someone else's story. 

If you've ever played pen&paper roleplaying games, this is how it feels to play with a game-master who loves his own NPC's more than he cares to provide a good game experience for his players. 

That said, if you can get it very cheap, it's moderately entertaining."
17702,Great storyline for single player. I enjoyed the variety of missions and the different options for Special Ops. Shame that some of the ad-hoc missions can only be played by two players online though.

17705,"Great mechanics to the game, I remember having fun withi this quite a bit. However, the multiplayer was a disaster. Like most games in the Call of Duty culture, Where would Infinity Ward be without it's subculture of hackers? The game was thoroughly infilitrated withint the first month of game-play. The matching system, was an absolute disaster. Even with later titles, they still never go the matching system down.

The game was graphically beautiful though. Finally, what's not to like about the ranking systems and weapons upgrades."

Buy it, we can play together."

are willing to play with a hacker every game or 2. But you'll get your chance of a clean one."

17730,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a followup to one of the best shooters to ever be made, Modern Warfare. This game is solid in every aspect, if you can ignore the implausabilities of some of the campaign you will be in for a fun movie like blockbuster adventure that takes you all over the globe. I will be honest I used to buy COD games for the multiplayer which is still fun but not my bag anymore. I enjoy COD for their immersive linear and exciting Campaigns. I loved Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare, and to be honest this game is just the impovement of the formula that IW started in COD4. The singleplayer is quite fun and again takes you all over the place with a miriade of characters. The multiplayer is quite good but be ware that IWs matchmaking system on PC is rather wonky and can be prone to lag and other issues. There are no dedicated servers for the PC version of MW2. That is really my only gripe. In addition to this there is some of the best coop I have seen in a shooter. Spec Ops mode is tons of fun you can play a ton of missions with a friend ranging from stealthy sniper missions that we all love so much, to absolute murder fests based on defending a position or missions where one of you commands the AC130 gunship and provides support for your friend on the ground trying to fight for life whilst getitng to a designated positive. Solid gameplay all around. Recommended.

17738,"Even tho its been about forever since I played this poor excuse to be called a game. I still feel I have to report it.... The Multiplayer SUCKS. nothing but lame hackers who are insanly trying to compensate what they are lacking tho I have to stay clean and not say what they are lacking. Even if Hacking isn't the problem... and it, itself is what broke the game... the ridiculous Unbalance and kill streak rewards that are nothing but I win Buttons with stupid over powered AI aircraft and choppers will certainly take anything remotly fun away.

Ofcourse their are alot of people that love that play style which I have to respect. What I can not understand, is how people keep buying these series of COD, expecting them to add some kind of anti hack engine when you know after so many series they havn't and never will. Those people I will always call insane. 

I hate this game so badly I wish I can remove this game from my library... NOT ASKING for Refund! I knew I will hate this game when I bought it long time ago... I just did out of peer pressure to play with my friends, so it is clearly my fault for buying it. I just simply want to get rid of it out of my Library permently like I never bought it."
17739,"Modern Warfare 2 is, in my opinion, by far the best Call of Duty game to date. Its Single player campaign will last you anywhere from 6-12 hours depending on the difficulty and if you decide to collect all the intel. The story starts 5 years after the first Modern Warfare and I thought it had a great ending. Overall Campaign is a great rollercoaster of setpieces and missions that drive the story and the characters around the world. It was great but its short length and lack of a complete conclusion keeps it from being perfect. If it was the last Modern Warfare game without the cliffhanger ending it would be almost perfect. the Spec Ops mode is a Co-Op oriented multiplayer mode that puts you and a friend together to take on a few mini missions. These are extemely fun and can be played solo, but I HIGHLY recommend you get a friend. Overall Spec-Ops is a great addition to the game and I enjoy it more than zombies. I dont really play the multiplayer so I cant give my thoughts on it, especially since its mostly high ranked players and hacked lobbies full of modders. I Highly recommend you get Modern Warfare 1 and 2 if youre looking for some good First Person Shooters with a decent story and amazing set pieces."

17745,Its a classic one of the best call of dutys but dont buy it now... u are late to the party. no1 plays it any more and most the people that do are hackers.. Sry.
17746,"If you are after a review of the Singplayer or Special Ops then my review will not help you. It will focus purley on the Multiplayer... I mean isn't that what 'most' of us play Call of Duty for?

Lets start with the map design... There is much variety between each of the maps. They range from Small, Medium and larger sized maps. Rust being the smallest, and Wasteland being the biggest. They sute each play style. Take Skidrow for example. You can run and gun through the corridors with an SMG or Shotgun, run around the outside of the map with an Assault rifle, or camp at either of the team spawn points with a Sniper rifle. 

The weapons are reasonibly well balanced, but there a few that are overpowered, and those are the weapons EVERYBODY uses... ACR, Scar-H, AK-47, UMP45, Intervention and the Spaz 12 are the most common you'll see being used. Then there are Noob Tubes, and Riot Shields. DO NOT get me started on those!

The killstreaks are fun to use, and are lethal, but earning a Tactical Nuke is far too easy to earn. Get a 7 killstreak, call in a Harrier strike, and you'll reach 25 in no time, as long as you stay a live.

The perks are balanced well enough, except for Stopping Power, which increases weapon damage. As if the weapons weren't over powered enough! And One man army, which in theory is a great perk. But it doesn't work well in practice.

The attatchments and camo's take a while too earn, and you'll have to grind through challenges to do so, but you earn a ton of Experience Points (XP) in the process.

The levelling system is, too me, near perfect. You'll reach 30 in no time, but then it starts to become a climb... Once you reach 70, you can of course Prestige and do it all again.

There is also a decent variety of game modes. Team Dethamtch, Free for All, Capture the Flag, Domination, Search and Destroy, Demolition... And my favorite Team Tactical. A mix between mods, 4v4.

Modern Warfare 2 is a must buy for any Call of Duty fan. The community is still pretty active, but it is sad to say there are a lot of hackers, which ruin the experience."

17764,"Probably the best COD game ever made, you know before they got super reharshed and attracted legions of haters .The gaphics are good, the story also and multiplayer is simply amazing. There is not much wrong you can find with the game itself. It's truly a great game.
That said, multiplayer is full of hackers and those bloody servers that instantly promote you to level 70 which is then a huge pain in the ass to fix. So that kinda ruins it all for us honest players.
Overall i'd still say the game is worth it especially if you have a few freinds to play with."

A simple web search will reveal tons of companies that make hacks for this game series, and claim that their hacks aren't detectable, and/or provide you special offers if you are found to be hacking using their tool, such as giving you a new CD Key.  In any case, I quit playing ALL COD games after about 1,500+hours in various series.  I love the graphics and features, but too many players cheat like a mofo.  You're lucky if you can play 1 in 10 games that doesn't have at least 1 cheater in it.  It's particularly funny when you have more than one cheater in a round, and they have to pit hack against hack to see whose going to win... who has the better cheats.  Anyway, COD's developers and/or steam doesn't give a flying phook about all the hackers which totally ruins the game."

The differences between MW2 and COD4MW are so vast that the only way to explain the difference is to equate COD4MW with  going to University, and all subsequent Call of Duty equating to going back down from High School, to Primary School, and finally arriving at Pre-K.

Absolute shit."
17797,"My favourite CoD game! I remeber the times when it has been just released! All my friends have been playing this masterpiece! Amazing gameplay, awesome graphics, fascinating storyline and stunning cutscenes have done their job! Also, MW2 has a co-op mode, which is really much fun to play with your buddies. And, of course, speaking about MW2, I can't but mention, probably main feature why this game is so cool! Yeah, you are right, I'm talking about its multiplayer. It is so exciting and dynamic, that i had nearly jizzed in my pants ;D. I still consider that MW2 multiplayer is one of the best among existing online shooters. 10/10! Newfags won't understand.."

17799,Good Game and Best Game Ever (Favourite Mission NO RUSSIAN) :D GOOD GAME EVER I HAVE EVER SEEN
17800,The only good call of duty game out there   R.I.P mw2    10/10
17801,Still good after all these years.  Shame more people don't play it.
17802,"GOAT Call of duty.
The rest is history"
17803,"Oh well, Not bad but I've seen better"
17804,Awesome game!
17805,Best CoD ever <3
17806,"If I had written this review 5 years ago, it would've been a Yes. Now, however, I do not recommend this game. 
MW2 was great for a while. It had awesome sounds, awesome gameplay, awesome guns, sweet killstreaks, really it was just a great fucking game. Of course, people exploit bullshit like noobtubes and commando, and people have gotten too obsessed with sniping. I join a game to fucking sit in the back and hardscope like snipers do, not quickscope. 
Now it's just hacked to shit. The chances of actually finding a legitimate lobby are lower than the chances of you getting a life. R.I.P. in peace C.O.D."
17807,My ingame time should say it :)
17808,"Great game love the missions
"
17809,"Well it's been 12 years since this game released and I still wait for a remastered version of the multiplayer. This game was so f#king iconic, it was a big part of my childhood (I used to play on xbox 360 back then), those were the days....with all that 360 MLG swag montages and cringe kids screaming in mic.

 The campaign itself was one of the best cinematic action story in the series and also the most memorable. The multiplayer was broken af and this made it so fun and amazing and the SpecOps was like an in-depth revisit of the campaign. 

I still play it, both PC and Xbox, and thanks to backwords compatibility the game is still active on Xbox while on PC the player count is around 2000 players daily which is good.

12 years later and i still love this fking game so much!"
17810,This game is very fun to play with friends. I enjoy it as it is easy to get the hang of and you get to skr3k kids
17811,"Modern Warfare 2 was my all time favourite out of the modern warfare series even though this game was filled with, (and I mean FILLED) hackers and modded servers that you would just happen to bump into, it was still fun and enjoyable to level up your gun to get the next attatchment and lunge 50 feet to kill a guy with a knife!"
17812,i LOVE this game!!!
17813,"This is a serious improvement on the first modern warfare and I congragulate infinity ward and activision in their effort to make a good call of duty. Sadly it follows a campaign form that exists in most call of duty games and it gets old pretty quick.

[spoiler]The sad thing is that the end duel with General Sheperd is exactly like the end duel with makarov, pretty much everyone but Price and Nikolai come out injured or dead, only to reintroduce a bunch of other people likely to die in the final battle or anywhere in the campaign [/spoiler]

I like how the game looks, all of the details and color seem so saturated. the only thing graphic-wise about the game it the AK-47 which has a desert camo instead of a normal camo. The attachements are nice and a great improvement from the last game. 

So overall the only thing that Activision needs to approve upon in the future is working on the campaign( no offense, but that might never happen)"
17814,best all round CoD ever
17815,"Great story, great shooter. Don't h8"
17816,"fun game, even though i havent played it for that long"
17817,"Yet another hit from Infinity Ward. this follow up of modern warfare has a well writtin campaign mode and action packed fps action. the weapons are pretty realistic compared to what you'd see on a modern day battle field. Also to make it worth its cost the special ops mode gives you acess to many highly challanging differnt missions after or before doing the campaign. the Multiplayer mode is fun and challanging, and you get to choose your loadout, and earn weapons by completeing challanges and getting kills, and winning games. however on all platforms of the online MW2 in my experience, many player's use unfair advantages like mods(cheats) but therew are good games just dont expect a realistic kill/death ratio.  3.5/5 stars     -SVEDKA530"
17818,Its good enough
17819,Best COD ever.
17820,"I got VAC banned because ""Cheats were detected"" even though I only pressed F9 to record gameplay from fraps. >_<

10/10 will go play Battlefield 4."
17821,"A great classic shooter and I personally love it:
1: GREAT STORY
2: Don't need a powerful PC
3: Have FUN!"
17822,"Its really bad, you know its bad but you didn't know its *this* bad, its so awful. nothing about it makes sense, the story makes no sense, the writing makes no sense, the general gameplay makes no sense. the gameplay is bad even for a call of duty game, its the most obnoxious first person shooter I have ever played in my entire life.

Do you know that scene in dumb and dumber where they have the most annoying sound in the world? basically that but for like six hours."
17823,"[u]Introduction[/u]
I've spent countless hours playing this game everywhere. PS3, PC, wherever you can imagine. It was and still is the best game i've ever played (in terms of how much i enjoyed it)

[u]Story(No Spoilers)[/u]
The story starts 5 years after the events of Modern Warfare. Imran Zakhaev has become a martyr, and his right hand man, Vladimir Makarov provokes war between Russia and the US. It's up to ""soap' McTavish and the Task Force 141 to stop him.

[u]Game Time[/u]
Approximately 8 hours.

[u]In detail[/u]
It's too late to experience multiplayer, since only a handful of people are still playing but the single player and coop missions are still playable and enjoyable

[u]Pros[/u]
+co-op missions. Best feature in my point of view.
+Interesting plot, great cinematic cutscenes
+During single player, you control either a Task force member or a US army ranger, depending on the mission, giving you the opportunity of experiencing war from the first line, but also the conditions of undercover black ops.
+Great multiplayer. Everything is well designed, creating an enjoyable experience.
+Great soundtrack, greatly implemented into the campaign.

[u]Cons[/u]
Sorry, cant find any :P
Concluding, i totally reccomend it since it's likely to attract players for multi on a sale. As i said before, it's the most enjoyable game i've ever played.

10.0 / 10.0 
Merged 700 hours of gameplay (2 accounts)


1. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].
2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].
3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 
[h1]4. Must Have [9-10 / 10][/h1]"
17824,"There was someone I played with who was so skilled, he was called a hacker and told to get skill."
17825,"Why the fuck do i own so many cod games.....because im a fucking retard








Maplestory"
17826,very good game bitiches
17827,I like games.
17828,this game very cool
17829,Great game if you're into Quickscoping and lots of in-game modifications
17830,"One of my favourite games, I love the weapons and the mobility of the players. It isn't too complicated either so I personally think this is the best COD so far."
17831,"Got the game, because I had it back in the day on xbox.
In seriously 2 hours I got into a modded lobby thus giving me everything, so there was no point in playing. A man ddosing me for no other reason, but the fact I used a riot shield and later getting into a few hacked games.

The next day I play with 8 other friends who all got it. Noone plays ground war, so we all queued up for merc. tdm so we could all go against each other (Worst idea ever). At this time we managed to rage at each other, being called ""XXXXXX"" by both friends and enemies.

Over all, for this 16 hours I have been playing now along with this I am told to drink mountain dew, eat doritos, called ""XXX"" or ""XXXXXX"" for using insert any gun here and to smoke weed ""because 420 blaze it"". Also, to not ""hardscope"" because all anyone ever uses snipes for is to quick scope.

Note: Looking back. Nothing has changed since the x box version. 
10/10"
17832,I like how u can play custom zombies.
17833,"I am  a huge fan of Modern Warfare, the plot is epic.
The multiplayer of the series is fun and different
Personally, i prefer the first games, but still It's worth trying MW Series.

I just feel a little constrained about the fact that I have met thousand of 12 yrs olds stepfathers through the matches."
17834,amazing game 10/10 more ghraphicssssss
17835,The campaign is great! But there are way too many people modifying the multiplayer experience and it seems to ruin the enjoyment.
17836,ALOT better than Ghosts...The best version of COD except modern warfare.
17837,Great game!  Not quite as good as good as CoD4 but it's more of the same stuff.
17838,"Great Multiplayer, worth a buy"
17839,"yeah, id really like my money back. I can't find 1 server online that isnt hacked/modded and i can't even play. This game sucks and i wish i didnt spend my money. FIX THIS SOON"
17840,"Verdict: Passable

While more technically competent than, say, Skyrim, it's an incredibly jerky, ill-paced game that tries to do too much in its time span.  Too many weapons, too many twists, too many bad guys, too many gameplay types.  It's never really content to allow for falling action of any kind.  As soon as you reach the final objective of a mission, it cuts to a loading screen, with hardly a line from one of your squadmates or anything to provide a moment of relaxation, a feeling that you've made it and, for the moment, you're safe.  Alternating between the Rangers and TF141 on a mission-by-mission basis for the first two acts of the game ruins any sense of continuity between the missions -- with each feeling about half the length of a Call of Duty 4 mission -- further exacerbates the lack of fulfilment provided by the end of each mission, because each mission ends on a particularly poor and jarring cliffhanger and you're thrown into the rising action of another mission in another place with different people before you've had a moment to decompress.  It may be that Infinity Ward was trying to keep the tension high.  But, if that is the case, they confused tension with action.  Yes, an all-out firefight can be tense, but it quickly loses its dramatic appeal the more you do it in a given span of time.  And, since you -start- the game in a firefight and do little else besides move from one firefight to the next, aside from some parts of some of the TF141 missions, you're basically forced to keep an adrenaline high for almost the entirety of the game's runtime.  This also prevents even minimal characterization.  So, when characters are killed, there is no emotional impact because there was no time or cause for you to become emotionally invested in them.  [spoiler]Even the death of Ghost is completely forgettable, because while he's present for almost the entirety of the game, he spends almost all of it off screen, and never does anything important or unique to distinguish himself from the rest of the TF141 mooks during the brief time he's a physical presence.[/spoiler]  While there are some things the game does well, such as the first mission with Roach and Soap and the way the end of ""Of Their Own Accord"" and the beginning of ""Second Sun"" tied together (the beginning of ""Second Sun"" honestly took me by surprise), they are few and far between, lost in the sharp scene changes and deafening non-stop gunfire.

I'd be lying if I said the story lacked drama, but most of what drama it has immediately falls apart when you think about how ludicrous the plot is.  The villain's plan was needlessly complicated, bloody, and destructive, especially given its purpose, which could have been accomplished much easier and cleaner with the clever usage of media and politics.  But what broke my suspension of disbelief was not how out of hand it got, not how far off the deep end the villain had gone to even consider it to be a good idea, but how willing the villain's lackeys were to let him carry on and how freely they seemed to provide their assistance.  It is clear they are trying to top the first Modern Warfare.  However, the first Modern Warfare was already pushing the limits of reason while still trying to set the stakes high.  Modern Warfare 2 front-loads so much ridiculous escalation, much of it climax-worthy material, that you really can't help but think every time ""It [i]can't[/i]get any worse.""  And yet it always does, and never in a good way.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say there was a team at Infinity Ward that did nothing but sit around and play ""One Up"" for the entirety of the script-writing process, just to come up with new ways to turn up the heat, regardless of whether or not they actually made sense in the grand scheme of things.  The scene of using foxholes and trenches to avoid machine gun nests on your approach to a ruined, Russian-occupied White House screams WWII callback.  Aside from that, though, it does little but try to show the player just how bad things are in DC by stirring up patriotic anger.  The same kind of patriotic anger that the game itself practically condemning, both in its plot and in the quotes that are displayed on screen after you die.  And, by this point, the game has gone on far too long with its messages of treason through patriotism for that to be the point.  Not to mention, the game isn't smart enough for it to have ever been the point to begin with.

When they announced the original Modern Warfare, Infinity Ward said they wanted to make the campaign feel a lot more like a film.  And they succeeded.  With a well-paced plot that followed a clear dramatic arc, parallel subplots that contributed to the overall scenario in a positive manner without weighing it down, missions that had their own miniature dramatic arcs, and the sense of danger and urgency needed to justify the faster-paced gameplay, Modern Warfare was a good action movie.  While most of the actors went without characterization beyond ""Spec-Ops hardass"", ""Military grunt"", or ""Total evil psychopath"", such archetypes are pretty much standard for military action movies, and they were neither over-done nor hammed up, and were almost always present, leading to a solid core cast you came to care at least a -little- about by the end.  Combine that with carefully-placed and well-handled twists -- the end of Jackson's subplot in particular was wrung out for as much drama as they could justify -- it was a game that, despite ending up as the spearhead of the subgenre that has taken over the FPS, stands out as an example of trying something new with a franchise without completely butchering the job.  Modern Warfare 2, on the other hand, is the result of trying to capitalize on the success of a new idea without understanding what made the new idea [i]good[/i].

If you're [i]desperately[/i] curious to find out what happened to Soap and Captain Price following the events of Call of Duty 4, or you just want to understand what all the fuss is about, Modern Warfare 2 is worth a play, with some emphasis on ""a play"", as in the singular.  If not, perhaps you can help unmake the rest of the franchise by silencing [i]its[/i] truth, leaving only the deaths of 30,000 Marines, and the sacrifice of the 22nd SAS to avenge them, that the horrors of that week would not return to haunt the future."

17871,Its Ok but 2many hackers
17872,"Surely the best Cod game ever. Amazing maps and guns, perks etc. Skidrow, Scrapyard, Rust, Terminal just to name a few. A great match making tool which makes finding a match so much easier. Cod4 is close behind though for its time though but if anyones looking to buy a cod game game i would definately say get this one, even though it is 4 or 5 years old, Still plays amazingly well today. 10/10"
17873,Epic game from the long list of the COD titles if you have ever played one of the COD titles then you will know what i am talking about !
17874,alot of hackers and modders but overall better than the call of duty games that followed this game. it is a good buy for a cheap price.

17878,A lot of fun!
17879,"The last good Call of Duty. Haven't played in years but decided to purchase on Steam in the sale and it's still worth it. A few hackers here and there but nothing serious to tarnish this absolute masterpiece. The community on here is larger than in Ghosts which says it all really. I wish I spent my time playing this instead of the fake IW's excuse for a COD game. 

Great memories. Great game. Great purchase."
17880,i like this game (y)
17881,"The switch from server based multiplayer to ""host/client"" based multiplayer has ruined this series.

IW made a HUGE mistake when they switched from developing for PC and porting to console, to developing for console and porting to PC. Sure, the development cost savings were sizable..... But the switch to the host/lobby system ended up screwing the dedicated PC users. Dedicated servers were a MUCH more secure way of operating games. Now PC based games are rife with modders, cheaters (I refuse to call them hackers, because they use cheats developed by TRUE hackers), and modders, who use every means possible to win a game. (yes, this was copied and pasted from my earlier review of COD:MW3, so suck it.)

This is an abomination of multiplayer gaming, and should serve as an example to PC users that want a GREAT gaming experience. A GREAT PC multiplayer game depends on the Server/Client model for security against cheaters, modders, and other tools who depend on ""software enhancement"" to win a game.

If you want a multiplayer game to be good (on PC), anti-cheat is a NECESSITY. I made the mistake of buying this game (CoD:MW2), AND CoD:MW3...... I fully regret wasting my money on these games, and Infinity Ward will not receive any more of my money until/unless they return the PC version to the dedicated server/Client model. Instead of their console stroking host/client model."
17882,"Endless crashes (only game that does that) + not as good as CoD4: Modern Warfare (not even close).

Score: 70 (Okay)"
17883,"hackers ruined the game!

i HIGHly dont recomend getting the multiplayer now if you

A: dont want to get VAC banned
B: dont want your game ruined by a 35 year old with no life
C: dont want to instantly get promoted to level 70 (highest rank)

17886,"Call of Duty! Now this has it's cons and pros! Even though this is the single player, This review is actually meant for the multiplayer version of this game!

Pros-
- Call of Duty is a fun game, You can play with parties of friends to group up and destroy your enemies online!
- Call of Duty is very customizable, from your player card to emblem, from which gun you use to which scope and camo and everything you can think off!
- Call of Duty also has many levels and presiteges so it should give you a couple hundred hours of playtime!

Now to every game there is always a con, as everybody says nothing can every be perfect!

Cons-
- Terrible community, they always swear, rant at eachother, curse eachother out, call eachother names, blame everybody but themselves
- If your looking for a team game call of duty isn't the best way to go, Maybe if your playing with a full lobby of friends then yes it works but when your matched with out people it's everybody for themselves to get as much kills so they can build up their streaks
- The match making is terrible, You might be the second level and on the enemy team you will get prestige masters level 60
- Since this is a old game their is something very annoying that we refer to ""Auto Leveling"" it's where when you are matchmaking you join a server which automaticlly puts your rank up to 60 and unlocks everything including all emblems and guns and attachments and missions for the guns! This can be very annoying but most of the time if your quick you can escape it, but if you can't you will have to prestige to reset everything except you will still have your emblems and your weapon missions and stuff like that!

I am giving this game a 7/10, I used to be a serious COD player but I really have moved on to being a serious CS:GO player, COD just has that terrible community which made me want to leave! Now since it's over 5 it still means I recommen it but this game is old, instead go spend 15$ of out the 20 you are about to spend on CS:GO and have much more fun! Believe me!"
17887,Great game. Great multiplayer and campaign. The number of hackers in the multiplayer are like ...urgh.... well basically every third player is a hacker. Also one man army + noob tubes pretty fucking annoying but that's the game. If you're getting for multiplayer only don't get this. Even if you only want to play private matches they dont work :(
17888,People complain about hackers... they're just scrubs complaining about getting rekd.

First of all, should you get this game?
[list]
[*] [b]Multiplayer[/b] - [u]Depends[/u], the playerbase is rather small yet you can have fun in a couple gamemodes.
[*] [b]Singleplayer[/b] - [u]Absolutely[/u] worth it.
[/list]

With the campaign and the special ops modes, you're going to have tons of fun. The campaign's plot is so dubious yet somewhat predictable, that you will not be able to stop playing it before you've completed it.
The special ops mode is for you and your friend to spend time with. You'll have different missions to complete, with various vehicles and weapon choices. With the vast amount of experience I have with FPS games the game was easier, yet completing the game on Veteran still remains a bit of a challenge. This difficulty level is something new, even when the AI remains dull and predicable, you'll need practice and fast reactions to survive. If you're looking for a challenge on an FPS single player, this game will definitely be a good choice.

17915,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the most overrated game in 3 million years. All you do is run and shoot and constantly die because your character is a wuzz and can't take more than 2 bullets to his legs. The story is the worst thing, I really enjoyed it, it was a flatout bore throughout the whole game. 0/10. 

Put in Shrek 10/10."
17916,"Brilliant game! A few glitches I found but otherwise a amazing COD game

17917,"i like it because of its story,weapons and great characters.But what I don't like is that the campaign has great characters but my favorite is Ghost.But it sucks when Shepherd kills him in the 3rd level from the last.Overall the multiplayer is good the maps,weapons,and the action is fun to play in.So i think Call of Duty:Modern Warfare 2 is a great game:)."

17919,"This game is complete shit. Please don't buy it. In fact, don't buy any Call of Duty Franchise products, because they're all shit. Instead switch over to a playable game like Dota 2 for example."
17920,GREAT GAME
17921,"The best call of duty game of all time. Despite the DLC being irrationally expensive, Call of Duty Modern Warfare offers the user an ample range of options as far as multiplayer is concerned with the inclusion of devastating killstreaks, astounding guns and useful perks, transforming the game to one of the most semantic games of the 21st century. A true landmark in gaming history!"

17925,"Certainly a big step up from Modern Warfare (cod 4).. The campaign is good fun and can be played a couple of times without being incredibly boring.. however, the multiplayer is a little over the top for my liking (the simplicity of the earlier cod multiplayers were more my thing).. Overall good fun for a quick play around but wouldn't spend a long time on it!"
17926,"[h1][b]DISCLAIMER[/b][/h1]
[b]The review you are about to read is based on my own experience with the game and my own personal judgment and rating system! No third party has impacted anything said in this review. This review is also 100% spoiler free, so you don't need to worry about that either.[/b]

[h1][b]Gameplay and Interaction (20 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]If you are someone that has played all the old Call of Duty games (by 'all old' I mean every single one up until about Modern Warfare 3), you already probably noticed that these games have that specific and iconic feel in the gameplay which was overhauled later in the franchise, or more specifically after the first Black Ops. I won't waste much time commenting the gameplay mechanics since these are the best Call of Duty had on offer for years. They didn't alter the interaction much from the first Modern Warfare game, but what they did is made it richer (not that it was bad in the previous one), and extra polished compared to the previous Modern Warfare game. Once you move on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, or by simply comparing the two, you'll see what I'm talking about. It just feels better and more refined.[/b]

[h1][b]Graphics and Sound Quality (16 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]This is one place where I have to cut some points because they did not improve the graphics quality that much from its predecessor. You'd expect that two years later, they would actually deliver some noticeable changes to the graphics, or at least make a few things better, or at least make the low resolution still images of the distant environment less apparent, but no. The only thing that has changed is the lighting, which ultimately isn't enough to consider it as a graphically more impressive looking game than the previous one from 2007. Sound quality, however, remained top notch as you'd expect. Not much has been added or removed from the sound side of the game, and the thing I love the most is the soundtrack itself. It fits every bit of the story and other game modes like a piece of a puzzle.[/b]

[h1][b]Performance and Optimization (20 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]Performance and optimization side of things now, well... this is probably the best optimized and most polished Call of Duty game ever created. It runs just great, multiplayer mode runs flawlessly and it's hands down the most fluid game I've ever played. The occasional stutter that was present in the first Modern Warfare game is completely gone. Random framerate drops from the previous game? Gone! It is perfect in every way.[/b]

[h1][b]Story and Replayability (20 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]I won't comment on the story much because this is the part of the game that has to be experienced by the player, you just gotta play all three Modern Warfare games, it's a MUST. Just make that leap of faith if you already didn't, and jump into the Modern Warfare trilogy - you won't be disappointed! Content and replayability wise, there's special ops (Spec Ops) mode which you can play with a friend. There's no public matchmaking for this mode, but can you just imagine how bad would it turn out with a random player joining the lobby? This is meant to be played with tactics in place and with someone you really enjoy playing co-op modes with, and yes, on VETERAN difficulty. Multiplayer of Modern Warfare 2 is just the most awesome-coo-coo bananas multiplayer game mode in Call of Duty franchise. It is hands down the best multiplayer mode you can find in all of Call of Duty, period. It's simple, it plays great, what else do you need? Noob tubes! Oh boy, what a classic![/b]

[h1][b]Animations and Movement Controls (18 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]Animations did not receive a major overhaul, but rather a bit of polish on top of already very well built foundation from the first Modern Warfare. It's meant to be that way, and Infinity Ward really delivered some stuff that further enriches the immersion of the game. Movement and precision of the controls (as I said in my review of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare) are among the best this industry has to offer. There's simply not a first-person-shooter out there that does it better for me than Call of Duty.[/b]

[h1][b]Final Score and Conclusion (94 out of 100)[/b][/h1]
[b]The conclusion is simple: this is simply the best Call of Duty game Activision ever published. It desperately needs a proper remake which I'm sure a ton of fans, are desperately waiting for. It's time to revive the good old days.[/b]"
17927,"What can I say about a classic? 

It just took everything that made MW great and took it to the next level. People might say no game will ever surpass CoD4, but this one did.

1. Visually glorious, back in the day I recall it being top-notch.
2. Fast-paced action at its finest.
3. Perfect-sized maps. Not the big shit ghosts delivered nor the rat maps found at BOII.
4. Interestign unlock and progression system.
5. Fine balance. Inb4 ""UMP45 is OP"".

Favourite CoD so far. 9/10 would rape."
17928,"Probably one of my favourite Call of Duty Multiplayer games of all time. Now is unplayable because the main servers are shut down and to play you need to patch it (illegally) and play on cracked russian servers riddled with hackers and cheaters. Was good, now not. Stay away."

17970,"Still my favorite in the series till this day, bought it during the 2014 summer sale and it's still good. Plays best here on Steam. I waited for it to be about $5 I think, may have been ten but it's worth a sale snag."
17971,It's full of hackers. 10/10
17972,"Wow what can i say? one of the most overlooked games on its release date. the series has since grown in recognition and frankly if you grab a couple of buddys a few beers and rocking tunes you can have a total blast with MW2. for 20$ it was a bit too rich for my taste but i picked it up anyway. easy to level up if you get lucky (or unlucky, however you put it) and find a hacked lobby. there are many hackers as of now since no one gives a real shit about this diamond in the ruff.
dont reccomend 0/5"
17973,MW1 was the best CoD. I think MW2 was the beginning of FPS games catering to the casual crowd and ignoring the competitive community.
17974,Guys This is a game 4 a Year!!!! Call of Duty Mw2 a twisted ending and some eastereggs! get this game and Join me and players in the game!!!
17975,"A great and excellent game but too many hackers, making it unplayable."
17976,"Probably the best in the Modern Warfare series. Well directed and well executed. Graphics are awesome (For a 2009 game) and the story couldn't be any better. The multiplayer with great maps and Co-op still give me a reason to play this game even after 5 years of it's release. 

My overall ratings : 10/10!

The only major problem of this game is the hackers"

17983,"At first I'm not a big fan of MW2.

And then I tried Call of Duty Online, which is basically readjusted from MW2.

Then I decided to try MW2 again, and I did.

Now I'm a big fan of MW2.

There is no doubt that my favorite CoD so far is still Black Ops 2, but now I can be sure that I love MW2 as well."

This game is complete garbage now, with Call of duty 4 still having 10x the playerbase, this game has a flat 300 players for its playerbase, half the games are still to this day filled with hackers, and not to mention errors that this game comes with as soon as its installed, its a shame this game has gone to shit, do not make my mistake and purchase this garbage, if you want something worth your money, call of duy 4 is still an amazing gem."
17988,V.A.C Banned my for no reson
17989,its a good ferst person shoter
17990,Very good campaign mode for the entire modern warfare series. The multiplayer is one of the best cod multiplayers
17991,"I don't even know who I can discuss with this but there has to be some sort of 24 hour policy to make sure the game your downloading works with your cpu -futhermore my logitech F310 remote. which is does not. I just spent and hour on the phone with them and they couldn't figure out why it doesn't work. does anybody know the publisher of this game and how i go about trying to get $ back please? Thank you

17992,"Best Game since BF2 AIX2.0 especially the solo O'Crista Rendentor Map however the only game i'm interested to buy is GTAV.
Still waiting for a Space sim game that combines the best of Elite original with Freelancer. Plus a graphically improved, DX11 BF2/Aix2.0  with 64 plus, single player bots including slightly  improved Ai.
If there are any coders and artists that want to sell non-COD/BF3/4 cash cows to really endow the gaming community with something worth investing in, I would suggest the above becuase that is all that will tempt me.
Multiplayer online is just full of hype-induced thrill takers blowing away late, adopting, cannon-fodder for the elite gamers self gratification, nothing to do with sharing the experience is why single player Ai does away with all the cheating scum bags that just turn people off."
17993,"I do reccomend this game although it has some stuff i diddn't like.It has a short story and i managed to pass it in about 7 hours which is really short.it has some boring moments where you don't even know what you're supposed to do or why.

those are the only major flaws i see.

But apart from that it has Amazing levels such as rio de janeiro afghanistan etc.. where u felt like i was legit in rio and it felt soo good.  It has alot of nice weapons and amazing graphics. The story kept me interested throughout the whole thing but the only missions i hated are the ones that take place in the united states.

since the singleplayer is short there is a mode called spec ops that you can play after you're done and it is really fun by yourself and with a friend. 

I haven't played the multiplayer , main reason is because i hear you get VAC ban for no reason.


if cod 4 was a 9/10 then this one is an 8.5 out of 10 but nevertheless it is a good game"
17994,Good game... too bad servers are hosted on a player's computer... lots of cheaters.
17995,"Well the story was deacent.  My biggest problem with the game is that in any given fire fight whoever shoots first will almost always win.  there is too much recoil from being shot that there is no chance to get returing fire on the targate.  Also, the number of enemies in each fire fight just seems wierd, there are never less than 20 enemies to kill at a time, for one person that is just not right, it makes the game feel fake."
17996,Great game :D

18000,Good game  in it's day
18001,GREAT! Best Call Of Duty Videogame ever made in my opinion .. Trickshotting used to begin on it back then
18002,"Modern Warfare continues with the developers imagining the beginning of a contemporary war with Russia, started by the infamous airport massacre scene. The main campaign has it's good moments hunting down hostiles in the favelas or trying to save DC under heavy attack, but is quite short as usual (or even more). Using the riot shield is a nice change of strategy and a lot of fun and the game delivers the adrenaline rush that's expected, but despite SPEC OPS (which is mostly the same levels from the campaign with a few mods - packing an occasional surprise for specific COOP missions) and MP, there isn't enough to grow attached to this title, you basically just want to play the sequel that delivers the full blown chaos that continues the story...Perhaps that was the point?"

18008,"Nice follow up of previous modern warfare. Game is smooth and well optimized. Graphics improved a bit more. Singleplayer performance, story is good as expected from Activision. Multiplayer is very good with balanced weapons and game mods.  Nice competitive gameplay makes you never get bored of playing multiplayer."
18009,"Hacked lobbies, script kiddies, noobtubers, commando knifers and an airspace filled with killstreaks. Every single multiplayer lobby is/has at least one of these, and it is bloody annoying. 

As for the single player, 5 hours of linear nonesense (Campaign) and an okish co-op mode (Spec Ops) that both pit you against AI of your difficulty choice, with objectives on screen.

If you are looking to pick up an older Call of Duty, just get the first Modern Warfare. Less bs. More enjoyable."

18017,Good Game
18018,"  I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community.  I really do.  But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game.  If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game.  Here is why.

  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that.  MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made.  It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons.  Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane.  I can recommend the game for the story.  But now, onto the multiplayer.

  Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer.  Now, multiplayer used to be amazing.  The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun.  Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks.  Why?  Because, hackers.  Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers.  Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed.  None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined.  If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date.  Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.

  Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that."
18019,"Great game, the campaign is good and leads onto MW3. Suggest playing before playing MW3.
"
18020,yes
18021,"Get to da choppa!!! Oh shit, they shot me."

18023,nice shooter
18024,how can i change a language russian to english???
18025,.
18026,i cant connect to iwnet
18027,"This game maybe good on console, but on pc this game is absolute garbage. Its full of hackers, noobtubers and hardly anyone plays, so most of the time you run into at least 1 hacker per lobby. 

I'm only giving this game a thumbs down because of how much this game is hacked. I recommand that is you want to play this game, go buy it on console because you will have way more fun."
18028,"Pretty fun game to play until theres those noobs that hack kill you
"
18029,call of duty mw 2
18030,"The fucking VAC ban is a horrible feature, i got banned from ever playing multiplayer modern warfare 2 because i accidentaly joined a hacked lobby ! they need to remove this feature for old games like the modern warfare series because it's hard to play without joining hacked lobbies, i recently payed 19.99 for this game & 1 week later i'm banned, Great game, horrible VAC feature."
18031,"Its a really fun to play game especially if you play with friends.This game is actually one of the best games ive ever played,the only thing that makes it look bad and unplayable is that it has around 300 people playing it and it will take hours to find a game."
18032,"One of the best call of duty's you could ever play. The spec ops is fun solo but much funner with a friend. The single player story is amazing. Better than Ghost. Multiplayer is much better. Creating classes is fun. Everything is fun about this game.
 
8/10"
18033,This game is on par with taking a sledgehammer to the face.
18034,"Trust me here , i played a pirated multiplayer version , this is the best CoD ,in the series , The single player is fun , also Spec-ops are fun the little stealthy missions are cool , But the Multiplayer :o Amazing :)
"
18035,"I don't know why everyone is saying this game is filled with assholes and hackers, I haven't come accross any of them, also this is my favorite call of duty game of all time and the only problem I can find with it is that if you want to play with a friend they need a good gaming computer to run it at like 60-80 fps"
18036,"You're gonna love this if you're used to the 90's internet.
300 people online at most, playing team deathmatch with 700 ping.
Such is life in rural Infinity Ward."
18037,"This game was mind blowing when it came out.
It had so many new features that the older cods didnt have.
The Singleplayer is very good. Its the continiuning from cod 4.
U are playing as a ranger and a special soldier in which is Soap your leader.
The mutlyplayer was pretty impressive.
All the new  killstreaks,weapons, perks etc.
The gameplay is fast- pased allthough there were still a lot of campers.
Famas was a were op gun and u got it in the 1st levels.
Danger close+ one man army was the worst thing in this game.

Conslusion: Its a great game 2 play with friends. U cant get bored, because of all the new features. But there are some bad things in the game. Hey no game is perfect.

18038,its a good game but its old personally if you have the cash the buy black ops 2 or the newest one cod ghosts i love it cause for me its the best in the series try it out
18039,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is a first person shooter set in 2016.As the title suggest,combat is set in the modern period and features assault rifles,rocket launchers,snipers,shotguns and other types of firearms in the aforementioned period.With a somewhat interesting singleplayer campaign and a good multiplayer,it is a very good FPS.

PROS
+Good varierity of missions avaible both in singleplayer and cooperative campaign
+Fun and fast paced multiplayer with perks and equipment

CONS
-Short singleplayer campaign

VERDICT
I give it a 8 out of 10.If you want a good multiplayer or cooperative experience with a friend,then this is the game for you."

It's literally the same thing, you jump around, bounce off ladders and call your friends faggots. The best thing about this game is definitely how real it is.

18064,"God damn, this game is amazing. But there is a reason why many people prefere it on console......"
18065,Got a VAC ban from it 10/10
18066,"This games fun, Its a classic and always will be my favorite for the MW series."
18067,best COD game ever
18068,Meh....
18069,IT'S FUCKING AWESOME
18070,the best game eva
18071,"I would consider this one of the greatest first person shooters of all time and the best call of duty that easily puts the others to shame. The story is simply fantastic {Makarov being the best COD villain} and the multiplayer is very well balanced and began to move away from the original games formula and became far more fluid with intense battles. The Killstreak rewards are not too bad, as in all Call of Duty game the best rewards come with skill. The community is still strong and hackers are very uncommon as most have moved onto other games. Rating: 10/10 Highly recommend buying this game!"
18072,Better than COD:Ghosts
18073,"Better and worse

Personally, MW2 is my favorite installment of the entire series.  Loved it as a console game and love how it plays on a PC even better.  It's just quicker and more fun on the mouse/keyboard side of things.

That said, the advantages of playing on a PC are quickly surpassed by the disadvantages of playing on a PC.  The multiplayer game becomes instantly boring due to the deluge of hackers putting themselves in god-modes, hacking your menus, and generally being tremendous pains in the butts.

If you want to just get on line and play - stick with the console version.  Despite a console being inferior for response and feel, at least the other players aren't as capable of being complete turds."
18074,I think infity ward should change the enemy like marviko and the endings are like the same in mw2 and mw3 but plaese make a call of duty mw4 but i really like everthing about mw3 it is awesome bye
18075,"The game has a very interesting story and the game is unique , in many moments when are many enemyes ,you just run for it till you get at the checkpoint , and multiplayer is good , the Co-op too . I totaly i recomand it !"
18076,"altho it is not new it is still a really high quality game includign the graphics, capaighn and multiplayer i even think this better then cod ghosts"
18077,"BEST GAME OVER MADE FOR CALL OF DUTY! I play ghost black ops 2 evry call of duty but this is best
"
18078,"This is the last Call of Duty I played and had a lot of fun with it! Honestly I believe this is the last good Call of Duty that they made, this one is actually inferior to its predecessor, Modern Warfare, which in my opinion was the best of the whole Series. Played the game a lot until it got to the point where there was a hacker every other game which would ruin it for me. Got to 7th prestige and if they fixed the hacker problem and people still play it I would recommend this over any other Call of Duty game that came after it."
18079,"Damned hackers got me a VAC.

10/10 needs more mountain dew and doritos."
18080,"Great game
The best game in the call-of-duty franchise

8/10"
18081,Best game ever made.Sadly most of the players are destroying it.
18082,10/10 would uninstall again
18083,"best call of duty ever made! HANDS DOWN

sadly not many people are playing."
18084,best call of duty game in the world. probably the only good one ever created...
18085,if you dont have this game you suck
18086,"The game is really fun, and i love the sniping but its just filled with noobtubers and people who play the game really wierdly."
18087,"This game. Oh this game. 
I first got it not too long ago. I played some multiplayer, thinking it would be infused with hackers. Actually, about 2 of the 25 games i played so far were hacked. So if your about to get this game, it's not full of hackers. Dont listen to the people who say that. I think that this is one of the best CoD's, along with CoD4. It's super fun to play, and even 720 silent shewt newbz across the map.
Multiplayer: 9/10

The campain of this game is legendary. You will never experience another campain like this again in any other CoD after this.
Single Player: 10/10
Overall:
69/10
oh, and a reminder, im the best quicscopr in this game, so dont listen to Radiant Cabbage."
18088,its kewl
18089,Best of all the MW games!
18090,A great game if you don't have problems with the NAT-type ;)
18091,Best Cod Ever!!!!!!!!!
18092,"Really good- Game of the year 2009. A thrilling first person game with realistic HD graphics and very pleasing user interface. I would rate 10/10. All COD lovers and everyone, its a must play from me. You might not like it as much but its personal opinion. Infinity Ward has done a great job from theme to picture quality to the characters. Try it guys!!!"
18093,Got into a modded game and got level 70 in one kill 10/10 would mod again
18094,gg
18095,12 year olds cussing more than sailors.... same BS game play as EVERY CoD... and players who in my honest opinion need to get outta the house a bit more...
18096,"Lots of fun, still cool today.
Sadly I got banned for an unfair reason, and won't get unbanned D:"
18097,"The best COD game in the franchise. Gosh, I luv MW2!"
18098,I got VAC banned from this game.

18105,"i wish the call of duty  makers will get reason and realize that the games after this one are much worst , and i hope they will go back to this format , insted of going to the far future and science-fiction . after mw2 the other games literally distroyed the name of the brand . im very disapointed from the way that this brand is going ."
18106,I laik.
18107,"fallen prey to ever Cod game that ages. it's over run with hackers and players who arent there to enjoy the game, but rather to irritate you with over powered wepons, hacks, and rude jokes (involving your mother)"
18108,"So here is my Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 review,where I should start?

1.Campaing:
 
+Very good singleplayer
+Awesome storyline
+Memorables caracters and missions

-Too short campaign
-Some sad moments

2.Special Ops:

+Very fun,especially with a friend
+23 Challenging missions
+Balanced Difficulties

-Sometimes is too hard

3.Multiplayer:

+Balanced weapons
+Create a class system
+Beautiful maps

-Hackers
-Hard Challenges"
18109,"Still the best online COD I've ever played and although short, the campaign is fun. Get it cheap though."
18110,It's great :D
18111,"nice, i likey likey it makes my peepee hard"
18112,"One of the best Call Of Dutys ever, its second to World @ War."
18113,If u want a cod for multiplayer this is the one its cheap and good also snipng is beast there are a lot of hackers though but you can just find a new game if u dont wanna b bossed
18114,8/10
18115,"I think it's the best game of the CoD series. If you liked the CoD4 you are going to love MW2 too :)
There are only 3 bad things in the game:
- NoobTubing
- G18-akimbo
- Annoying Laggers
Anyway, it worth it to buy and play a lot."
18116,!!
18117,theyre all the same what do you expect
18118,Best Cod In my opinion
18119,"I am a sucker for first person shooters in general, and this is a fun one. The campaign is about what you'd expect as far as the usual rah-rah USA jingoism that the Call of Duty developers crank out, but the gameplay is fun and I actually put a lot of time into the multiplayer and dug it."
18120,"lol, no matter what i say none of you will play this"
18121,10/10 would play again.
18122,Fantastic game. Great single player story. Nice controls. Good voice acting.
18123,awesome!
18124,"Spec Ops and singleplayer are fun, but don't even try the multiplayer - especially if you join a lobby with colored names on players."
18125,"This game is a classic.  Great gameplay on all of the different versions... Whether you are playing alone or with a friend or with a bunch of friends or strangers this game promises hours of fun.  MW2 is where many of us learned the perils of ""prone blocked"".  Years later it is still delivering all of what you are looking for in a solid FPS!"
18126,"If youre gonna buy this for multiplayer, like i did, dont bother now because i played 5 games and every single one had been hacked to extremity and unplayable so STAY THE FUCK AWAY!!!
Unless you bought it for campaign or spec ops or just generally enjoy having a srsly fucked kd and not spawning at all :D Enjoy!"
18127,this game is really cool
18128,u should play this game if u don't like it u can go home and bitch about it to your dad
18129,"Gret if you just want to play the story, but multiplayer is full of hackers now"
18130,Best Call of Duty.
18131,"I love this game , it was my very first cod that i played (:"
18132,Other than the lack of fish AI and empty multiplayer matchmaking it is a great game. Buy it on sale.
18133,"You can shoot people.

10/10"
18134,The last good CoD.
18135,The best multiplayer FPS since Team Fortress Classic. Too bad nobody plays it anymore.
18136,"Classic Call of Duty, Great game !"
18137,"Game was fun until the removal of the 4D1 client. Now it's shit. No mods, no FoV slider ingame, just a joke of a PC game."
18138,meh...
18139,"This games Single Player experience was descent but already was going a bit downhill from cod4 but the main focus here is Multiplayer wich by all means sucks since it's not ballanced and all these ridiculous strong weapons like the g19, aa12, model 1887 with specific perks are just ridiculous... Stupid yet addicting. Spec ops was good i liked it. So check it out but for multiplayer get some nerves of steel first ;D"
18140,Old classic.
18141,Best point and click game
18142,Once you beat CS: GO you can prestige to the real game for real men.
18143,in amazing campign and beautiful multiplayer

18154,Great Game and Best and funesst cod
18155,"the last good CoD, but at the same time its the first crappy CoD

besides the obvious balance problems, activi$ion decided to give the pc version possibly the worst slap in the face in history (considering how this game is basically a masterpiece) and removed mods and server browser, replacing it with overpriced mappacks and a horrendous p2p matchmaking system, leaving pc gamers with a shoddy port for an otherwise amazing game....at least until you download the modded clients




info on modded clients:
A l t e r I W n e t came out around 2010 in response to the console port problem mw2 inherits and allows players to play mw2 with a proper pc experience (server browser with admins to bann/kick hackers and a anticheat system preventing hacks whilst modded servers are also abundant for the fun of things just like in cod4 days), which has since been shut down by activision in 2013

then F o u r D e l t a O n e  came out, made by the same maker of A l t e r I W n e t as a sucessor, but that too has been taken down as of recent times

though all seems to have come to an end, the great justice contiues to persist, now with ""A l t e r R e v o l u t i o n""  and countless other modded mw2 clients that wish to uphold A l t e r I W /4 D e l t a 1's ideals of undoing activi$ions grave injustice

i implore that you play with these modded clients as they offer:
-Less hackers (or at least better enforcement against it)
-Proper vanilla experience in addition to modded servers and (hopfully soon) custom maps
-Less Lag (no more of that horrendous I(nfinite)W(ait)net matchmaking)
-Dedicated server browser
-Developer Console (for your basic PC needs like FOV and FPS counter)
-NUMERIC ping displays (rather than cellphone bars when looking at scoreboard)
-Makes MW2 (an already great game), an overall proper PC game


steam for some odd reason censors the names of these modded clients, so for simplicity's sake, just look up ""mw2 dedicated server mod"" and you should be on the right path to a proper mw2 experience"
18156,Got VAC banned first game i played 10/10
18157,Full of Hackers and Hacked Lobbies
18158,"By far the best game back in the old days, such a shame its dead now!"
18159,"Pretty Good Multiplayer, keeps you going for a while."
18160,"i bought this game awhile back but never had a good enough hardware to play. but now i have a geforce 210 1gb and mashed it up with my integrated graphics and now i have 2gb to play >:D i play on 800x600 and has almost 30-50 fps. great stable game once you have the recommended requirements ^_^ 10/10 and p.s. dont ask how i got integrated and pci to work with eachother, i forgot how now lmao!!"
18161,"Nuked in a full game without firing any bullets.

.. Decided it was time to move on.. Lots of blatant cheating ingame now anyway."
18162,"good original noscope simlator for 2011 and i played it alot when i was 5 years old..................
thx for fun times"
18163,"Being nearly 5 years since launch, looking back it still ranks up as one of the best CoDs. Multiplayer is still alive with peaks around 3-4,000 people daily around midday. Overall an amazing campaign, unbalanced yet enjoyable multiplayer, and spec ops to top it all off. Superb game, still worth revisiting, even for nostalgia."
18164,I only enjoyed the multiplayer a little. But single player was crap
18165,It's ye ol' faithful. Oh my how Activision has fallen
18166,campain is ok multiplayer is full of squeeling 5 year olds
18167,this is arguably one of the best games  ever 10/10
18168,This is AWESOME!
18169,It is an outstanding game #Swag
18170,"The base game of MW2 is very very good, however it is made worse in many ways. Hackers, exploiters, campers, grenade launchers, etc. can make the game a lot worse. I've been hacked 3 times. One took away my minimap. This is fixeable but difficult. Although i recommend this game, if you get it you'll have to put through alot. 

p.s.: im the best xXxXxqu1ksc0p3rxxXxXxXx l3git mlg 1v1 me scrub

*review based on 64 hours of multiplayer gameplay*"
18171,I like and it's good but there is  a lack of players.
18172,"In the Multiplayer its a fast and casual Shooter, its quite fun most of the time, but it also gets you raging very often.
It will not be fun if you are used to Competetive Games... I'm the best example: got almost 900 hours in this game, played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for 50 hours, and after that I didn't like it anymore.
The Singleplayer is very good as in almost every CoD.
If you like Call of Duty I definetly would recommend it."
18173,so much fun #killedyourmom24times #lol
18174,"Despite Infinity Ward selling DLC in all their games, microtransactions in their most recent game, almost never having to pay for server hosting, making more than most other game developers from tremendous sales... despite all of that, they don't spend the money on upkeeping their old games.

It's unbelievable that they drop support for a game once the next one is out, and the PC is always the last priority for them.  There is still a ton of life in this game...or even COD4, but Infinity Ward doesn't even look twice at them anymore.  Both games are plagued with a LOT of cheaters online.  It's almost as if the game has become like a 'Thieve's Landing' type of place... a place where all cheaters get together because they know there's no law enforcement there.  Cheaters cheating against other cheaters.  It really is something that has to be seen to be believed."
18175,mw2 is classic and the last of the great Call Of Duty games.  This game should be a part of everyones game library.
18176,No dedicated servers...
18177,It's okey
18178,good game

18182,"This game was the game that got me into competitive FPS games, and gaming in general. It had most fun and the best multiplayer experience I have ever had (and with sadness in my heart, will probably never have). I had 1100+ hours on multiplayer and 70+ hours on singleplayer/spec ops missions (on my lost steam account). It was the best investment in my gaming career ever. Had so much fun with this game. And I feel sad that time run over this gem (with addition of quickscopers and hackers). With a tear in my eye I grade this masterpiece 100/100. The best multiplayer game I have ever played.

18189,Best CoD that was eva made hacker/10
18190,"This game is Good but not great.  First off the muliplayer is a mess, in many ways it adds onto and improves on cod4's
 mechanics (such as customible killstreaks and pro perks as well as more weapon diversity).  But on the other hand you have
 bullshit like one man army noob tubes, commando, deathstreaks, Akimbo G18, and danger close that ruin the games balance and enjoyment. 
 
The single player campaign is good and tells a compelling story but there are some things that aren't well explained and can leav you confused.  The spec ops mode is just the campain exept with coop, fun, but doesen't really hold your attention for that long so feel free to skip it.  But what hurts this game the most is the optimization, never in my life have I ever seen a game so effortlessly ported to the pc.  The game is locked at nauseating 65 FOV (field of view) which will automatically makes the game feel weird to play since you are essenially staring through a pair of binoculars, thankfully there is an FOV changer that you can download for the muliplayer so make sure to get that if you ever plan on getting this game.  Plus there are, get this, NO DEDICATED SERVERS.  

Yep, no dedicated servers, basic pc features are non exsistent in this game!  The lack of dedicated servers is what killed this game, instead of dedicated servers we get a crappy host based matchmaking system where everyone has to leech off of one guys connection meaning if the host has a bad connection you will have to play with laggy hit detection for the rest of the match.  Oh and who can forget the oh so wonderful host migrations? Also the game is filled with hacked lobbies up the wazoo and some of them automatically rank you up to level 70 and give you everything ruining most of the replay value.  Overall Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a disapointment and don't let any fanboy convince you that it isn't.  I wouldn't recommend this game due to the how many asinine descisions were made with the port.  But if you are still intrested in getting the game then be my guest, maybe you will be more satisfyed by what you got then I did."
18191,"I love the story!  6 hours long, but if you like multiplayer its unlimited!  I don't care for too much Multiplayer.  So 6 hours for a great story with great moments.  I will go back and replay again soon, and I did check out multi and its just as good as advertised."

18202,"Basically the best Call of Duty game ever made, second to Call of Duty 4 though.

All the bad reviews are basically just saying how hackers are ruining the multiplayer, but that was even the same on console so, and it wouldn't surprise me if the multiplayer is dead (which makes me die a little inside tbh) but it's not hard to believe since Black Ops, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops II, and Ghosts have all come out since Modern Warfare 2's prime."

Never before had I passed all the missions on veteran difficulty nor found all the hidden in-game intels. Highly recommend, the plot is not only gripping, but also very enjoyable. Furthermore the soundtrack owes an applause since it was created by Hans Zimmer thus it has to be astonishing."
18219,"A great game to play with your friends, wether you are serious or just want to goof around. With a multitude of weapons, achievements and a teriffic single player this game can bring hours upon hours of fun. The most negative thing can, at times, come during the multiplayer with the host-setup, which more than once might give a fair share of lag."
18220,I bought the game for mac and when i start it 5 sec later it froze plz help
18221,"
This is the best Call of Duty that has been made. It had great map design, player customization, guns, and perks. It was an absolute blast to play and I spent way more time playing it than I should have. The party system was genius. Having the ability to play with friends made my online gaming experience 100x better. It was something that I coveted about consoles. Unfortunately, the lack of dedicated servers and the pathetic support from Infinity Ward really made this game unenjoyable after a year or so.

Some would argue that COD4 is the greatest Call of Duty in the series. While arguing against that is hard, I personally would rate MW2 above COD4 simply because it was a more enjoyable game for me. I have a lot of good memories playing this game and I doubt I'll ever play another shooter that I enjoy as much as MW2.

18230,Hackers and trick-shotters. This game is incredibly fun when those two types of people are non-exsistant. They will fuck with your levels and unlocks and of course they are rude little shit bags. Other than those no-lifes the game is very very good and well made.

18233,"I loved this game on consoles and PC in the beginning, sadly the multiplayer is now infested with hackers no matter what lobby you go to, simply put. Its a waste of money. The community is now miniscule at best due to the staggering amount of cheaters. Do not buy,"
18234,9/11 highly reccomended
18235,Best cod game ever
18236,Very good must play game when you dont run into a hacker
18237,i will just SAY.... BLEH!
18238,great
18239,Last good CoD game
18240,it's like cs but fun.
18241,One of the best games ever!
18242,"This game is just amazing.
"
18243,"Single player is not as good as 4, but sort of entertaining. It's more Michael Bay esque than I'd like, but still entertaining.

Multiplayer: Too many hacks, hackers. No dedicated servers. You're only able to play if it finds a minimum of 7 people, otherwise you'll just sit there while it searchs endlessly for a server."
18244,was massive fun when I played it and I don'tknow if you can see the amount of time I spent playing it but it was obviously way  to much. I did meet some great people though.
18245,My favourite cod game. Played more than 500 hours. 10/10
18246,"paras, ei en√§√§ ikin√§ volvo pls cod"
18247,"In 2014, the multiplayer is full of level 70 and infinate prestiege people which is impossible to play as a newbie (It's sad how all the 9 year olds kick my asshole in this game) so, unless you've got a friend to play the multiplayer with, don't come close to it unless you're a CoD guy.
The 'Spec Ops' co-op is great with a friend, challanging and action packed, so that's a plus.
And finally the singleplaer! (the part no one cares about cause it's CoD) It's okay, at times it can be pretty awesome, and most of the time it's pretty repetetive, even for a shooter. The story is a piece of absolute shit (but who cares, right?) and the graphics are pretty.
So, if this game get's on a big sale, grab it, and get a friend to grab it as well, but don't play this by yourself and DON'T buy this for a full price."
18248,My game is Orange and when i play it is in 3d!! please help me ! its so annoying
18249,"Okay so in this game you get to play as an EPIC soldier in the modern warfares with TONS of different weapons, perks and equipment, YOU NAME IT! The game is in complete balance and hacker free! The game content is endless!"
18250,amazing
18251,sugoi

18253,"fun spec ops, short campaign though, and  horrible mutiplayer. Full of campers and hackers"
18254,"+ Nice graphics
+ Great Single Player campaign and Spec Ops
+ Epic sounds...

- ... except gunshots
- Confusing story
- Unbalanced multiplayer

8/10"
18255,"Fun game, it really is, but way to many hackers now."
18256,"Gold, best CoD after MW1!"
18257,"Single Player:
Keeping this simple and easy, single Player plays out just like how I expected it, and I honestly enjoyed the campaign. Gameplay was smooth.

Multiplayer:
It depends on the perspective.
Ignoring the hackers, MW2's multiplayer was well constructed in terms of gameplay with a ""few"" broken aspects. However, the factor of letting people choose their classes makes it all fair game regardless.

Regarding the hackers and whining ""pros"", MW2's multiplayer is not exactly one of the best experiences I have had in my life. I really do not know what to say... From constant kids who use aim assist modifications to big mouthed 8 year olds who shouldn't even be playing this game (Hey that's their parent's decision, not mine). It really isn't something that I would want to deal with but it is something you can expect in the multiplayer.

The game is rated M for ""Mature"", being 17+. I would've expected ""mature"" players to actually play this game rather than young kids who have parents who can not raise their kids correctly.

Overall, if you are going for the gameplay, I recommend this game. But if ONLY if you are willing to deal with the (small) community of loud-mouths who talk big, but can not act without some form of modification."
18258,"I bought this game, mainly due to the fact that it was my first FPS I ever played, and the last game a bunch of my friends from High School and I played together. The nostalgia of just booting it up was awesome........

Then I got into a lobby. Instead of being able to process through the challenges and earn stuff (cos who wants a challenge lulz) some douchebag decided to hack everyone in the lobby and unlock everything. After reading forums on how to fix it, I finally got into another lobby. And douchebag #2 decides to hack the lobby again. Rinse and repeat for about 2 hours and I gave up.

10/0 would play again with the 20 somethings living in their mom's basement modifying game files."
18259,love it but people need to play different game types more
18260,Great COD game.
18261," still my favorite call of duty game to date, has an excellent multiplayer system."
18262,Great game overall. Only complaint is the overabundance of hackers.
18263,This game is really owesome :D
18264,yes
18265,just bes games of 2009
18266,daycare for third graders
18267,"CoD: MW2 was a great sequel to the first. Awesome story, equal to better graphics, tried and true weapon mechanics makes this a good game to have if you're into FPS. Unless you loath the franchise then that's another story. The game even has a short Co-Op feature for you and a friend to play and I can tell you it will likely ruin that friendship with the amount of difficulty it has. Stay calm and you can make it out with a friendship still intact."
18268,"Great game if you're looking for a fast paced first person shooter where the games doesn't last very long (~10 min). The multiplayer has died down a lot since most of the players have migrated to the newer call of duty games, but you are still able to find team deathmatch lobbies with ease."
18269,10/100
18270,One of the best CoD games to date - except World at War.
18271,"Fun To Play, If You Have Got A Clan To Do It With.
It Is Good For The Money Maybe A Bit Pricey Atm But Other Than The Ocasional Hacked Lobbys And Price Its Good"
18272,Played this game on my xbox and now I like to play it on here
18273,"I rate this game 11/10. Absolutly love this game, so many funny times on this game! Personally my favourite cod of all!"
18274,awesome game
18275,Awsome.
18276,ez
18277,"If you like playing with Hackers, then i high recommend this game!"
18278,"There are many other [i] Call Of Duty's [/i] such as Black Ops 2, Black Ops 1, And way more other CoD's but for me this would be worth paying for... You can get modded camo's all sorts of amazing things you can get, you can get in clans, even one of the best clans in you're (Country) Pretty much anything at times... You can go and play all sorts of game modes such as, (Fun Game Modes) Micheal Myers, Qs (<QuickScopes) Matches, and all sorts... I would definetly buy this game again. my rating would be 9.5/10 Most because of a few bugs not big deal anyway you should buy this game!"
18279,call of doody
18280,"Good game, decent story but MP mode is broken due to IWnet. This isn't console gaming, it's PC! I'll give this game positive opinion because it's enjoyable."
18281,I've been banned but I don't no why..
18282,Fun shooter.
18283,best COD
18284,this is my favorite call of duty i recommend this game to people who play fps
18285,When you want to fuck her right in the pussy this is the game you play
18286,i love trickshotting i recomend this
18287,"Containing arguably the best multiplayer of all the 'Call of Duty' titles so far (knife classes notwithstanding!), Modern Warfare 2 also contains a strong second act to the 'Modern Warfare' single player trilogy. With solid mechanics (before they got too tired) and memorable maps and characters, try Call of Duty when it was at it's peak!"
18288,Great game that kept me busy for hours.  I loved exploring the levels and just looking at the details as well.
18289,im saying its ok im saying because the graphics are diffrent then the ones you have on your syestem like xbox 360 and PS3 but other then that its good :/
18290,Way too short campaign but it was alright. The multiplayer can be good but its shit by todays standards. If you want good team based multiplayer with huge maps and customisation then get battlefield.
18291,The campaign is the only thing that shines in this game. And its a short one at that. The multiplayer is repetative and annoying.
18292,CoD sucks
18293,"Multiplayer is bad: sniper rifle don't kill in one bullet in the body... wtf? I heard some rumours story promised to be cool, but nope it wasn't.

Rate: 1/5
"
18294,<3
18295,Best Call of Duty Modern Warfare Game EVER!
18296,Good fun
18297,"The game overall has become one of my favorites of the COD series. Qualities that make this game great are that it has a gripping story line, the characters are interesting, and the how the game looks. The only part where I believe the game fell a bit short was in the special ops mode. Multiplayer was great and fascinating. The multiplayer mode in a way was a seed(example) to other games as its layout has been copied transitioned over. But other than that, if the game is on sale, I recommed getting it. Its a true classic in my library of games."
18298,"A very intense storyboard with extreme and emotional plot twists. Lots of action to keep you going, and a few intense gameplay mechanics - like climbing an icy mountain, or rushing down a river in an inflatable raft. Get this game if you wan to have an intense ride in a game! 8/10"
18299,Right before it all went to shit :D another fav title from this series!
18300,Best multiplayer shooter ever.
18301,i used to like this game then i got banned for  nothing if you want this game contact the steam people and tell them to help me im banned for nothing
18302,swag swag like caillou niggah
18303,Best played in parties with friends as teamwork is OP
18304,"I recommend this game, it may be old but there are still lots of players and its like a classic game."
18305,Bom bagarai
18306,"Even through it's flaws, MW2 had one of the best multiplayer experiences in it's time but hasn't held up as well as it's predecesor. Still fun though, for nostalgias sake! :D"
18307,One of the best game of the series!!
18308,doin this for the xp's :D
18309,i tric shotted some one acros de_dust2  and got 4 feed. 10/10 wouldnt buy.
18310,"It's call of duty, pretty understandable at this point, but be aware, I think this is a solid game with some fun single player and well done on line. I must say, modern warfare is their greatest trilogy. The game play is still the same, with some tweaks to kill streaks and regular weapons that I'm sure someone cares about, but I don't have the time to evaluate every damage change like this is a street fighter up date. It's a fun game to play with friends and when you have a huge group and can hit up the online with a solid net code, it can become real enjoyable, just be sure to mute players you don't know, unless listening to shrill voice 12 year olds is your thing."
18311,"Today i ran out of ketchup, So i had to eat pasta without ketchup and i enjoyed it.  10/10"
18312,"An enjoyable game, for both the campaign and the multiplayer, that rivals with its newer counterparts. Ironically, the biggest threat to this game isn't the newer COD games or the developers, its the players themselves. Over the years of off and on playing this game, I have increasingly found it almost impossible to play the game without having a hacker bonce my profile up to max level with all unlocks. If you want a good multiplayer FPS experience, but don't care if you instantly unlock every single thing in the game, then I reccomend this game."
18313,"This game is recommended by me becoase i thing it as fun and you can play with friends. 
"
18314,:)
18315,My favorite online game its awesome.....
18316,"This game is awesome!!!!

Playable and not bannable mods 

There is a mod that I really recommend you and that's AI Zombies mod

If you want to join to this mod than go to this group: Extreme Zombie Fighting Force"
18317,"Good game. But be warned of crazy hacks and modded lobbys. They could derank you or rank you up, i suggest staying away from modded lobbys and you should be fine."
18318,"It was okay, a long time ago."
18319,great!
18320,so much hours spent on this game. would still play it if there was an active community
18321,this game is totally the shiz nizzle
18322,Last COD where single-player kept the level. Multiplayer is great (473h on record).
18323,"MW2 has the best multiplayer I've ever played. The imbalance and OP kill streak made this game so much fun and addictive. Though singleplayer part is kind of too much noise and fast pace. Which made this part not as great as COD4. But it still is one of the greatest single player campagin. Got all the achievements on PS3 and XBOX, now it's PC time."
18324,"Buy this game, lets make it popular again, I absolutely do not like ghosts. I regret ever having someone I love buy it for me, I wanted to give call of duty ghosts a chance. Seriously, I wanted to. However Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer is much better and more simple."
18325,oh yea
18326,Sweet game!
18327,TIL everyone on this game has been with my mother.
18328,"
I wasnt a big fan."
18329,This game offers countless hours of good fast-paced FPS action.
18330,This Game Is Fun From Ai-Zombies To Deranks To Mw2_Lib To Troll I Love This Game
18331,"I would totally reccomend this game if you are willing to go into a privat match with your friends and play against each other. Other than that no. The multiplayer is destroyed and not fun at all. With all the hackers its not even remotley fun. Makes you wonder why game developers abandon good games to drive people to the newer ""better"" games like CoD Ghosts. Activison has become a money seeking company. One of the last good CoDs and will always remember it as a piece of shit game cause of my latest expirences with the multiplayer. And you can only play the campaign so many times before you are bored out of your mind."
18332,It's an awesome game.
18333,"Diamond in the rough in the way of call of duty. Easy to run, and cheaper than most games. All around good game
"
18334,I've eaten a few things in my time but it's still hard to swallow the fact that this is as good as CoD will ever be.
18335,Ruined my life 10/10
18336,"1v1 me rust fgt

18338,Dette var et serdeles festlig spill.
18339,Great Game!
18340,Very cool game with amazing story line and action.I reccomend this game for everyone who love shooters.
18341,"Great first person shooter. From the graphics (for the release-time) to the gameplay to the extensive amount of weapons, I love it. Honostly I like so much, if not everything about it, I'm just going to say the only thing I don't like. One, like any FPS, there are INSANELY good players on it so that until you get pretty good you will get destroyed when playing with them. But, besides that, I have no other problems, and if you've ever experienced the problem I just described then you know it's no big deal and it's still the best FPS out there, so I say--BUY!
"
18342,Hated it on launch. Grew to appreciate it's probably one the best ones.
18343,"Tuber, G18 Akimbo, UMP Silenced, Intervention.

18349,Still my favorite game of the CoD games.
18350,Lots of fun with this game.  Have logged many hours.  Classic FPS.
18351,yes very good there is fighting and guns and the main reason im posting this review is to get a steam badge but in reality it's actually a very good multiplayer combat game
18352,great game!!!
18353,Last real good COD imo. Fight me 1vs1 on rust if u disagree fgt
18354,Favorite game of all time!
18355,Best call of duty of all
18356,"Destroy 12 year old kids. Avenge mum.
10/10."
18357,The Best Game I Ever Played!!!
18358,Good game. Love Spec Ops! Hate the fact that there is no offline lan however.
18359,Still one of my favorites based soley upon the multiplayer maps.  They don't make maps this well anymore and that's why you see a lot of them rehashed in these current editions.  Too many hacked lobbies and tube festivals but overall this is still my favorite COD.
18360,"This game is terrible. Game is poorly balanced, hackers are all over the place, and the hosting system is so awful I hated myself for playing it.
"
18361,Best Call of Duty so far ( except Black Ops 2 ). Buy this right now
18362,"This probably has to be the best COD ever, not because of the average storyline, but because the online here, is mch better than what you'd find in any other COD game. The maps are great, the spawns are okay ( yes sometimes they really suck, but compared with the crappy spawns in Gosts, this one nails it quite good). 
But the thing that will get you really hooked, is the weapons, oh boy the weapons. It feels so good to use these guns, because, they're all classics. No hi-tech shit or anything, same with the killstreaks; no future banana peels, just really good ""realistic"" weapons and killstreaks.
The games graphics too, is in fact really good, and not too outdated. 
The game has few bugs and glitchess, and servers are ok. Now, the main problem with the COD series, are the hackers, i'll admit. There are hackers in this game, but not very many left because of the VAC (Valve-Anti-Cheat), wich permanently bans hackers, so if you'd experience this, just report them, and hopefully they will get banned.

This was just a little of my opinion, and for all of you who have'nt checked it out yet, this game is the best bargain on the whole steam store for only 24,99¬£. I'll give it a 9/10."
18363,"i love this game 
"
18364,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the best game in the Modern Warfare series of Call of Duty.
18365,very bad game
18366,d
18367,"Fun COD game, but it's old and people don't play it much anymore. 8/10"
18368,358 hours played. Enough said. I wish any of sequels would live up to this.
18369,It sucks. Now give me a badge.
18370,its shit
18371,Best Call of Duty!
18372,It is a very good game. Better than any other CoD game after it.
18373,Another great game for the series.  Get out there and play!
18374,So bad i never beat it
18375,its always fun to play mw2
18376,Getting a nuke and ending the match with a bang stills feels awesome. 25/1
18377,Probably the best Call of Duty game ever created. Take notes.
18378,2 Chains
18379,I hate this game...
18380,"Excellent story line / game play. Hours of fun.

Can't stand the multiplayer in any of the CoD series."
18381,Its a good game
18382,"This is where my career began as le MLG pro. I spent days honing my skills at quickscoping and noscoping and before I knew it I was doing 360s of buildings and getting throwing knife kills across the map. Calling down tactical nukes is really fun but my mum never gets the camera in time for me to record it. I smoke weed everyday. 

Gotta go, it's 4:20 XD"
18383,"For me the last of the good Call of Duty games. Extremely fun to play when talking multiplayer, many maps and game modes though finding other people to play with can be tough in some game modes. Pretty balanced across the board when talking weapons, but there are some weapons and equipment stronger than others.
Overall a very good purchase and extremely worth it's price
"
18384,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
 Don't get me wrong this is one of my favorite games ever but IW has completely given up on anti cheat and almost every single person cheats. Not like they aim too fast, like 4 c-130s circling around the map at once while the host flies around with dual grenade launchers telling everyone to get rekt
I repeat
 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME"
18385,Great game
18386,Love this game
18387,"No squeekers, but you sprint in reverse in every server because MODS FOR ALL. No normal games unless the host is tracing your IP and is lacing your computer with pictures of children, followed by a report to the FBI. Expect unusual gameplay, and fear the normal lobbies. Live long King Ulfric."
18388,pre gud/10
18389,This game sucks. Multiplayer's good though
18390,COD SUCKS COCK
18391,"One of the best of the Call of Duty series to date. Has a great story that is worth replaying just for the awesome atmosphere and set pieces. Multiplayer community is smaller than what it once was, but is still quite easy to get a game going. Highly recommend to play with friends!"
18392,"Fun game actually its easy too!
"
18393,not the best buy I made
18394,No CoD game will ever top this game. its almost the most active game of them still.
18395,Game was very fun. Spent lots of time on itl.
18396,This Game is Fine in some times. But in other times not because have some hackers like me...
18397,"If you're looking for a CoD game that isn't absolute shit, get this one"
18398,"Simply a masterpiece. No futuristic gameplay, only the basic. Skill and win."
18399,"Another classic COD game to bring back the ol' memories. Re-visit the lobbies with funny hacks and mods, raging noobtubers with One man army and finally trickshotters. Really need that 1080 nack-swap wrist twist bills doe. But the campaingn is just top-notch filled with suspense,actions and tradgedy. But overall really fun game, not sure if you should pick it up but now looking at the newest cod release, its definately worth picking up!"
18400,this game is nice.
18401,Always had a blast at this
18402,qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnm
18403,"th3 betsest gamez ev3r lolz u can shoot people haha 

""Its ok"" - ign 10/10"
18404,"It's where the series started to sour for me. Each game trying to one-up the last in terms of a controversial eye-catching moment got as old as the yearly re-release of basically the same multiplayer. The singleplayer campaigns have arguably been pretty good since the beginning, given the action/war movie vibe but MW2 is where the multiplayer took a dump with a focus on gadgets, killstreaks and dumb gimmicks over the actual gunplay."
18405,A+
18406,This was the best game in the series.
18407,disappointing
18408,"Best game after COD 4. I had very good memories which makes me feel very euphoric and intelligent. Too bad this game is now filled with hackers. My prestige levels were hacked by other players everytime I entered a server. I thought it was a good idea to level up using a cheat and I got banned.
"
18409,okai so here is deel u beter buy this gam or ul get foken 370 no skoped u heer me?//!one11 no but srsli this gam is aewsum aend if u fel l1ke getin gud at gam u betur 420 no scpe osme bichez lol xd  and ya list2n to mee becauz i r merk whalebergle
18410,still the best imo
18411,"You can throw knife in friendly's croutches to make them look like purnuses, I like it! :D"
18412,Very Fun
18413,"It's an awsome game with friends but once you go online in multiplayer, seems to be a lot of hackers or hacked servers."
18414,"great game! 
best money ive used in a while:)"
18415,Best COD ever.
18416,this is a good classic call of duty i mean when they where good
18417,this game is pretty fun not much hacked lobbies from my experience you will run into them once in a blue moon but even then the anti cheat system works like a charm here so do not cheat unless you wanna get banned.  it does how ever suck that this game does not support the xbox360 or ps3 controllers.  if you wanted this game for the nostalgia from when cod was decent and dont mind using mouse and keyboard go for it.
18418,Such a funnnnnn game. Its unbelievable
18419,It is as good as you remembered. Full of people who think that this game is good and never actually played a good shooter.
18420,"I love the Call of Duty games, especially Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and I am glad to announce that Modern Warfare 2 lives up to it's predecessor. The core gameplay is mainly the same, but you'll fight in new settings, with a larger arsenal than ever before. There is also Special Ops mode, which is a very nice addition. 

Although the Campaign is very good, my only real complaint is the mission placement. I really didn't like how it constantly switched between the British and U.S. missions. It gave me whiplash. I also found the Multiplayer to be dull, but I don't buy CoD for the Multiplayer anyways. 

Overall, the game is worth every cent.

9/10"
18421,would buy again
18422,"yes this is the game to play with your frinds, realy good multyplayer and the ranking sistem make it even more fun"
18423,Awesome
18424,"This game is fun in many ways. Starting with Spec Ops, there are 69 stars to get, 3 stars for all missions, some of which being time trials, racing, or air support which requires 2 players for. Moving to the campaign there are 19 missions you can play, and earn an achievement if you beat each mission on veteran, the fourth mission you can skip, because it is offensive if you're russian. Going to multiplayer, You can level up to rank 70 and prestige 10 times from there, and the tenth prestige, is your last, but allows you to go up to rank 70. There are 49 weapons to get, each for ranking up, or just stock starter weapons. On your primary weapons you can have skins on them, 2 of which are starter, but the rest you get by getting headshots with your weapon. You can have sedondaries too, but without skins, but do allow attachments, like akimbo, or sights. you can have 3 perks and starting at level 10, you get to choose your killstreak rewards, each unloacked bny ranking up, not in any particular order unlocked. Then you get a deathstreak if things aren't going  your way and you die 3-4 times. You can only start making your classes at rank 4. Then you get equipments like claymores or grenades and special grenadees like smoke grenades and flashbangs. Overall, this is a great game and I think you should get it any possible time you can!"
18425,"Fun game, but open to hackers. I was recently hacked and my online level was boosted fromm level 1 to level 70, which ruined the fun of gaining levels. ALWAYS RUN THIS GAME IN SAFE MODE!"
18426,Its aight
18427,Dat multiplayer
18428,Generic modern military shooter. It's a Call of Duty.
18429,"Can you do a -70% sale, so i can buy it second time to play?"
18430,Awesome game go play it!!
18431,Best cod game

18436,Good game.
18437,This game is good fun for maybe 20 hours. Good for some dumb fun!
18438,Multiplayer will keep you ocupied for hours. Great fast paced game. Ignore all the sequels this is where it's at.
18439,"Very good overall game, best story in my opinion, and the multiplayer is great. (other than the low life hackers who think the game is Call of Duty: Mod Warfare)"
18440,"mw2 was my opinion favorite cod dont get me wrong i got into the game when waw ended but i did have a chance to pull like 200 hours on cod 4 but ive played more on xbox mw2 , cod 4, waw everything else was terrible after mw3 they got very money hungry !"
18441,"One of the best, if not the best, Call of Duty games. Enough said."
18442,"Love this game from start to finish!
"
18443,Really good game so realistic besides the fact it bans you for hacking
18444,Best game ever!! Must play!
18445,"An old game, but still worth it!"
18446,"Really love it, its great."

18450,Love It

18452,"i have not played this one for i was always a fan of world at war and black ops. but this one was said to be the best before the third game. well truth is i can tell it used to be but not now. this game is infected with hackers, aimbots, map hackers, speed hackers, you name it and you can find it. oh did i mention that out of the constant 300+ people there most of them are hackers? ya see i can tell this cause of the severe landslide of 10th prestige level 70 players with prestige emblems/rank emblems you cant get unless you mod or hack or have a hacker give to you. i was level 24 when this happened but i joined a server via random matchmaking que and it put me in a server that was really laggy. then after about a minute a player on the console with a rainbow colored name said "" everyone gets level 70 "" then a loading bar popped up on my screen that looked like it was a campaign hud overlay for a mission done in campaign counting percents. well in my console it was telling me all my challenges were being completed one by one and one after another. i tried to leave the server but it had been too late. the hacker had made my once FAIR level 24 profile a level 70 profile with hacked emblems titles and such. being really pissed off as i was i refused to play for a day then said ""might as well just try to enjoy the game"" well among servers like that and other exploits i was also thrown into countless matches where people were running mods such as changing the team names of navy seals and the spetsnaz to ""dicks"" and ""pussy's"" as well as turning off everyones loadouts killstreaks knife button aim button and replaced grenades with throwing knives and forced to no scope with a intervention. then there was another server where one such hacker was calling every single kill streak reward in the game all at once within the first ten seconds of the match. another server i joined changed the map half way through. and to further prove my point. there is a server that someone is running labeled as a team death match server but its a team domination server. the host of such server is running a aimbot with a 50 cal and every time he takes a shot every lags. as well as he has turned off various loudouts and changed what is in them. i dont think this game is bad persay. but it is infested with hackers and Infinity ward and Valve's VAC service that is supposed to maintain the game is doing absolutly nothing about such problems. i would say get this game because its a good game in the series but unfortunately i wouldnt even look in its general direction unless its playing privately with a friend or two. ( if anyone will play it due to call of duty's reputation. i for one have only few people i know who play it on my friends list cause of the fad of people saying cod sucks cause it sucks nonsense) if anyone were to get this game i implore you to not even touch the multiplayer functions unless playing privitely with a friend. other than that this game is dead because of infinity wards abandonment of it as well as the VAC service being proved to be really useless in it. RIP Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. we knew you well."
18453,I played against an only Noob Tube Clan and went 8-39. 10/10 GG
18454,The multiplayer is essentually dead. Few players and half are cheaters. Would not reccommend this to anyone for anything aside from the single player (Which is meh as it is)
18455,"Possibly the funniest game ever. I mean, who doesn't love a bunch of little kids screaming they had sex with my mom, because I killed them?"

18458,"Was the best FPS i ever played. I liked everything:Single player, co-op missions, but most of all the multiplayer. The gameplay was by far the best i had seen until then, and all the maps were great."
18459,"Great arcade shooting, some decent level design, shame about the noob-tubes."
18460,multi player is srtarting to suck due to HACKERS and MODDERS
18461,"For some reason I am always placed in hacked lobbies, it sucks."
18462,"Amazing Multiplayer and Campaign
Spec ops could be better
To bad the hackers take over
Some of the maps look and feel the same as each other"
18463,EXTREMLY GOOD GAME!!!!
18464,Great Game
18465,Nothing extra special to shout about but a fun game to play.
18466,"Excellent, visceral FPS action, well worth a buy, at the top of the FPS chain"
18467,i havent played this in years and its still awesome
18468,"Arguably the best multiplayer in a call of duty game since it was released. Still good, minus the modded lobbies."
18469,It is obvious that this game is amazing ... :D
18470,Best FPS Story I have ever played.
18471,This game burnt my dick

18477,"Arguably the best Call of Duty game, and the last good one. The singleplayer story is dumb, and the graphics are dated, but the multiplayer is exciting and addictive. Really, what else do I need to say?
It's Call of Duty. It's a fast, fun, and relatively thoughtless game of shoot-'em-up. What's not to love?"
18478,Great Game!!!
18479,Game is full of hackers not fun at all.
18480,I'm a noob tuber and I approve
18481,Ok iv played dis game enough to give it a better review.  It's a pritty gg.  The controls and graphics r great compared to other fps games like arma for example.  After spending a while playing multiplayer i just had to play the singleplayer & the day im doing dis review is da day i started playing the singleplayer.  SUMMARY:awesome game
18482,xsss
18483,"Compared with MW3, it has epic story line and wonderful mutiplayer game. What`s more, i can play it on my MacOS immediately. However, to be frank, I`m a Large Field Fan. That is, if you want me make a choice among Call of Duty:MW2, Battlefield, ARMA, i think Call of Duty is the last thing i will choose. But, with it convenience, i will undoubtedlly believe that MW2 take the first place in my heart.

Last but not least, i think Infinity Ward should take their responsibility to some unfail action in multiplayer game(like hackers or cheaters)"
18484,Great game

18486,"Hi friends, played in the game, very much, from the game received the maximum pleasure."
18487,Best Call of Duty ever. It ruined my life at one point. Had to buy it again on this account.
18488,"Probably my favorite installment in the Call of Duty franchise. The campaign has an amazing story and I love the multiplayer. The guns are unique and interesting to level up, it doesn't take long to find a game, and the matches are fast-paced. A good buy for anyone that's into FPS."
18489,I like this game.
18490,ugh
18491,you suck!!!!
18492,"If you liked Call of Duty MW, then you will be disappointed. They completely ruined the awesome server system they had in the first MW and replaced it with this IWNet bs that doesn't let you choose the server you wanna join. Because of that it has become a paradise for cheaters, hackers and all sorts of rubbish. Combine that with the gameplay that has been more optimized for campers and snipers than ever before. Some of the perks and killstreaks you can acheive with camping are so overpowered that it ruins the whole experience. The single-players is just as good as the other COD games, but I bought it mostly for the multiplayer, so I would say it was a complete waste of money."
18493,"Was a lot of fun on xbox when it first came out, but PC is currently filled with way too many hackers."
18494,this is byfar 1 of the best cods ever great weapons some of the best maps outstanding charecters and story and spec ops mode make this game awsome
18495,"there are enough players still around im mw2 but the game itself is an absolute copy and paste from call of duty 4. the fanbase is one of the worst i have ever seen and they will shout at you for being more skilled than them. it is not fun at all with all these horrible people playing this game. call of duty is very well known for the horrible players. the gameplay is absolutely nothing new and is getting extremely dull these days. you are trapped inside a tiny area with a few other idiots calling each other f@gs, and being attacked by the other team which are also calling you and their own teammates f@gs."

I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for pro imaginary action"
18508,Good game indeed.
18509,"Black guy eating chocolate in mid battle
10/10










(no offense)"
18510,MW2 is a extremely fun game. I prefer story mode just due to the fact that multiplayer has to many hackers. Get the game expecting to have fun with the story and spec ops not for the online multiplayer.
18511,HUNTING MELONS 10/10
18512,"in my eyes this is still the best call of duty. Almost every thing about it is perfect, the only things that i hate is all the hackers, and the nuke, it ruins the experience alot when the hacker kill everybody and then nukes the map.
Overall Great maps, weapons, killstreaks...
its old but gold !"
18513,"To start things off this is one amazing game and is one to look back on and rememeber when games used to be classics but anyway this review is mostly going to be about the multylayer and how it differs from consoles and what expectations you should have when purchasing this game . If your only getting this game for the campaign then i think you'll find this is an amazing game and looks and runs good at least for my pc which isnt that fancy but once you go to multyplayer thats thats when things change not that theres anything wrong with i actually found it to be cool but theres one problem barely anyone plays when you log on you'll usually find around 700 to 800 players and there all in TD,domination, or demolition thats about it all other game  mode lobbys are like a ghost town. i found the mw2 community to be nice and helpful just dont mention consoles or you'll be starting a fanboy war. I found this game to be really difficult for me at least coming to pc from consoles but i soon got the hang of it and found it too be pretty easy. I know this isnt the best review and i dont really write them but i just felt like giving my opinion hoped this helped"
18514,This game is one of the best cod games. It has a good story and an awesome multiplayer communtity ( besides hackers). GREAT GAME
18515,"Dont get me wrong, this game is insanely fun! But, the fact of the matter is the multiplayer just has so much hacking in it its almost intolerable. The question you have to ask your self is, ""Is this Game worth the price, just for an okay campaign?"" Just something any futur customer should ask themselves before the purchase."
18516,Best of the CoD series imo... I wish more people would play it... :\
18517,This right here is the best game by far
18518,Top Class Online Expirence!!
18519,"I bought this game when it came out, because i liked the first MW and it was a fine choice. Though the campaign was a bit short, it was a fun trip, especially on harder difficulties, but the spec ops missions and the multiplayer made up for it. Some criticize the frequent use of killstreaks in multi, but boy, it feels awesome when you manage to get a chopper, the AC-130 or the nuke. Nowadays the servers are probably vacant, but this game still worth its price, if bought on a sale."
18520,Modern Warfare 2 is better than MW3 on my opinion :)
18521,"Fisrt and farmost..i gave a thumbs up so all can see...DONT BUY GAME !!
NO SERVERS AT ALL...Steam will sale game but wont retun money they say sorry go to infinityward sight.....site closed down?
(((No servers means no play)))
sooooo dont waste ur money like i did please. i have always been a faithfull buyer on here not any more. im done spending cash on games that have no return value (atleast wal*mart you dont need a reciept)

S!XX."
18522,nice game
18523,Counterstrike was fun until I go this game.  Amazing Campaign Great Multiplayer Overall A Great Game
18524,"Pretty hight price for a forgotten child of IW.
Game has no dedicated servers and instead they run on a players connection. Every match lags and host changes are frequent.
I still play it cause of the nostalgia."

And don't tell me it's all about the multiplayer, I'd rather castrate myself then be subjected to the majority of slavering manboys who find themselves so addicted to this type of multiplayer. But all said and done, it does scratch the itch for rampant enjoyment of giving the gift of gunshot wounds, and I find the story and acting enjoyable, if not on par with something hollywood produced. But then, Bioware didnt write it :P"
18532,SO  LAGGY
18533,good
18534,very good
18535,"The last good Call of Duty game.
Single player is perfect, but you need to know the story of the first Modern Warfare to get the maximum feeling of how awesome the campaign is. Single player gets 10/10.
The multiplayer is great. I remember how excited my friends and I were when we were controling the Apache or my favorite AC-130 bombarding all enemies from above. The bad thing is that in multiplayer there are many grenade launchers spam players, some of the weapons are to powerful among the others like Glock 18, UMP, grenade launchers. Hackers is a common problem in this game. Overall it loses points in the hackers and balance problem, but because of there is no other good FPS game I give it 8/10 for the multiplayer.
Take it, it is worth to give it a try."

18537,I would love to say a must have... but this makes CoD4 looks seperior. And the Yearly-New CoD game destroys this franchise.
18538,It's the best game of all time!
18539,GOOD GAME THE BEST CALL OF DUTY EVER
18540,ZU GUUD =DDDDDDDD
18541,"The greatest CoD game of all time. i seriously can't write a mini review without spoiling it. you gotta play this game!
The console version has hackers. surprisingly this version doesn't. you can thank VAC for that!
Spec Ops is also really great! you don't have to play it if you don't want to, its just some thing you can do if you're bored or have no internet connection so u can't play multiplayer. some are insanely hard. so its recommended that you train up so u can take on those hard missions.
Story: 10/10
Multiplayer: 10/10
Spec Ops: 9.8/10"
18542,"5/10
Okay game in my opinion at the time. It did not do much to stand out with all the shooters that came out around the same time frame.  For that it got ""average"". I prefer the realism and gameplay of Battlefield over this shooter. There are newer versions out there so I (if this was the only option for me) would skip this and get the newer CoD that has more ""realism"" and overall better feel. Plus more people are playing online on the newer one and more players = better match making leading to a happier gamer :)"

18550,Almost as good as MW3
18551,its good for intense multi player ( recommanded)
18552,the best <3
18553,no wonder why this game is game of the year 2009. This game is really good.
18554,hi there can someone help me please um i bought this game and tryed to play it . only allows campyne to work but when i choose mulitpplayer it lauches the game but never open all i see is a black screen can some one help me
18555,is good
18556,A REALLY HUGE BLAST This game is still exciting i play tons of cod but this will be remembered as the best from the storyline and gameplay is really great but the multiplayer have some downside like hackers but its that many as people says overral though infinity ward knows how to make a good shooter genre
18557,"this game is awesome. i love the killstreaks
"
18558,"This game is bullshit. It was the first CoD title leading the series into console bullshit without dedicated servers, without a good community without anything. It had good potential but it's full of killstreaks and full of shit. Sadly I have this game in my account. SHIT!"
18559,"Wow Finally, Now give me Black ops 2"
18560,i think alot of the Kids at School used to play this and alot of other Normal Things  like Going to School and Having a Job and it came out in around the year 2007 ish and i think at that time it was considered pretty Regular to play it at this time and nobody was going to think you are weird
18561,"If you love FPS Games and rushing, CoD in general is the game franchise for you. Sadly there are many cheaters in this game, mainly custom maps and gamemodes, but you will see aimboters or some guys with godmode. Still it is a nice game and if you get a normal lobby it's fun to play."
18562,"Great single player including special ops. The multiplayer is good apart from the hackers which there in a lot of the games you play but except that it's alright. If you are looking for a good cod game with good multiplayer, you are better off with cod mw3, ghosts or black ops 2. Overall out of five stars I would give it a 2.5.

"
18563,This Game was the greatest game after Guild Wars i ever played!
18564,"The plot line was interesting, the campaign was short, the spec ops was a nice addition to adding game play, the multiplayer isn't bad but is frequently hacked. Over all I probably wouldn't get the game unless it was on a special sale (which is what I did)."
18565,"I really liked the game specially peer-to-peer hosts. It would be nice to have dedicated servers as well but to know you are not depending on any third-party service in order to play Multiplayer, it's a whole different story. I've played it alot (as you can tell by my hours) so I highly recommend the game."
18566,great game; lots of fun; some portions though were too much like a rail shooter; did feel like an interactive movie
18567,"it was good until i was slapped with a VAC ban.  i wound up with 0.8 hours on record from starting out, and now I can't even play it online.  i did nothing at all, so I wasted the 20-30 bucks for nothing.  if you want to play this game, you should do it on console personally, unless you can make a private match and keep hackers out.  this one was the best one to me and i feel raped over this."
18568,"To be perfectly honest, I'm not the biggest fan of the call of duty games. They all started to become exactly the same. none or minimal new things would change between games. Eventually I got this game just because i had 20 bucks to spend. So far the game is AMAZING. i haven't gottent through all the stuff in the game because I'm constantly switing between Spec. Ops, Campaign, and Multiplayer, I never spend too long in one thing. I am fancinated with how well Infinity Ward did.
I strongly recommend this game.

18570,I got banned even though the hack didnt work

18572,Different than before
18573,"Okay let me first start off with saying this... This game is NOT worth $20!!!!!!!  If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor & wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.

Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out & searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day.  So you're not always going to be able to back out & get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out & then just rejoin the same modded server.

The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same & when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.  

As far as hackers & modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long & you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!

All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection.  It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game & the number of active players grow every day!"
18574,"This is a very good game, It has a good solid storyline and some awesome missions! Only a minor problem is a bad AI, and too much returning themes.

+Good missions
+Fun in Coop
+Good story

-Mostly the same.

Sucks.  Joined a lobby, I had no way of knowing that it was hacked until a mod menu popped up.  It put me to lvl 70 and unlocked everything.  This ruined the game.  I have never experienced a hacker before today."
18577,Great game! worth the money for sure.
18578,The last good Call of Duty.Maybe the best in franchise after COD MW.

18580,"Spent 900 hours in this game, destroyed my mindset,stil flame to this day
10/10"
18581,"EPIC!!
"
18582,"Certainly not worth the 20 quid my 'good friend' (Algis) convinced me to spend on it, but getting it pre-owned from a retail shop is ceratinly worth it. Probably the best COD - The Noob Tubers."
18583,"Even though there's bearly enough people playing anymore to get a match in something other than Domination or TDM, no multiplayer COD feels as good to play, the franchise took a steep step downwards after this and continues to do so. Even with most matches containing hackers and an unbelievable amount of tubers it's still fun to play, if IW or Steam would figure out why so many people are getting a DLC error on startup perhaps it would become populated again.

People moan about the game because of other people, not because of the game, the game is amazing, and the people are still nicer than anyone you'll meet on Rust or DayZ.

10/10."
18584,Very good shooter game..
18585,Gutes altes MW2 ^^
18586,Game is crud. Reported to the FBI. 10/10. I wouldn't even waste one hour on this pile of crud.
18587,one of the best call of dutys there have been i would recommend this game to anyone!!!
18588,"[b]Overall: 10/10 - LEGEND![/b]

This product is most entertaining with an epic storyline and a quite modern gameplay in the middle of a war in our times (21. century). The arsenal is huge, the attachments are many, the graphics are pretty damn good, the sound design is good, and the [b]best of the best - in my opinion - the [u]music design![/u][/b]
Special Ops offers many different operations with tasks to accomplish in different difficulties and will entertain a lot when playing with a good friend.
The foes you are terminating are also somewhat different: Dogs, Foot-mobiles, Vehicles, Juggernauts, Snipers (hidden) and other dangers.
[spoiler]I did not try out the multiplayer, so I cannot say anything about it yet.[/spoiler]
+ Epic storyline
+ Cool characters/NPC's
+ Best music design
+ Pretty damn good graphics and emitters
+ Difficult, yet less of a challange
+ Game lenght is okay. When I played the campaign the first time, it took me 6 hours and 32 minutes to beat the game. (No, I am not a speedrunner. I am to ENJOY games, not to rush them.)
+ (Voice acting in english)
+ Action! Action! Action!

- I recall the graphics. The surroundings (Terrain, Walls, Doors...) could use some more work to improve their look.
- VAC disabled for user control. No, I do not protect or support cheaters. I do not like the fact, that there is no option to disable VAC Protection for private servers.

I must say: This Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 is a(n) (r)evolution of the previous Call of Duty episodes. It has evolved far more different than ever before (Much like Black Ops 2 did).

Over and out."
18589,"graf ok. but i hate that all this 12 year olds gonna ""qickscope"" and flame about so cald ""hard scope"" why would you qickscope in war?"
18590,Guddo gam
18591,"I just get swept by all the notsalgia and fond memories from the time I first played it, everytime I play. So my views on the game are partially biased. God, I wish I could bring those days back. 

Now, about the game. The graphics are crisp to this day and the multiplayer still gives me a reason to hit it up every now and then. The Campaign is pretty intense and challenging, just like its predecessor. Sometimes it gets so intense, it tends to challenge your emotional stability. Especially the part where... Okay, no spoilers. 

People still play this, so yeah, to those of you think this game is dead, it isn't, not yet. I have played all the 3 games in the series and this was the best, for me. Just a wee bit ahead of MW1, and light years ahead of MW3. 

[i]Edit : The only concerns are that of hackers plus these goddamn unlock-everything servers that you get connected to without your notice that instantly promote you to level 70. Happened thrice till now and resetting the stats is pretty complicated.[/i]"
18592,its k
18593,"No need to buy it for the multiplayer now, it's dead. More dead since the death of Alter IW Net and Four Delta One (4D1). Buy it for the Campaign and Co-Op though, still very worth. This game made me kill a lot of hours when it was played in 2009-2011 (1391 hours + most played lol!). Can also play the Co-Op alone.

Buy it for the Single Player, or wait a few hours in the multiplayer lobby to find a game (around 10k people on it atm?)"
18594,old time good stuff
18595,"A decent enough shooter, I really only play for the campaign, which is interesting enough but can be repetative at times. Decent story/plot keeps things moving, even if it's not the most realistic thing ever, it is entertaining."
18596,"The SP Game itself is excellent also the Spec ops, very fun always fast paced with a b*tching soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, The MP however is filled with hackers.

But the Mac system requirements are an absolute joke. 
You need a computer 4 times as powerful to run it than the PC version, GT640M for Mac minimum? The card didn't even exist when this game came out!

Aspyr, fix your bloody port, its faster in wineskin and cider with a GT 320m 256MB!"
18597,"I lost 30,000 rates in the blink of an eye....

And the world just f**king watched. 

Today, there will be no shortage of reviews. No shortage of likes. I know you understand..."
18598,"Well... I'll be damned... MW2 finally came to the Mac. Well, This is probably my favorite pick of the MW series: I love the maps, it has a nice array of weapons.. Yes, it is good stuff. I quit playing the game years ago due to all the cheating, but the few games I played today seemed pretty legit. BTW, the game runs just great on modern Macbook Airs 2013 and up. Just choose a short range class and run around because you wont see too much on that tiny little screen :) Great fun, nice to be playng again."
18599,Great Game! Spec-Ops is my favorite part of the game! Plus it's the only true Call of Duty........
18600,"Despite my purchase of the game to chase nostalgia of a simpler time in my life, I don't think that this is a game you should buy. The multiplayer playerbase is small and riddled with cheaters and custom servers that max your level because of course they do. The singleplayer is the same as it ever was, and by that I mean I liked it at the time, but it's hardly going to win any awards.

If you want to buy something from this period in Call of Duty's life, I'd recommend World at War. It's got the roots of the series, taking place in World War II, and it has the fabled ""Zombies"" mode that adds some value as well. Not to mention, all the DLC for WaW is included with the base price, and there are a large number of additional Zombies maps made by modders for you to peruse to extend your playtime far longer than you could with this.

If you must, buy it like I did. Otherwise just don't buy Call of Duty at all, it's not really a series worth investing in for the most part in my opinion."
18601,its fun
18602,"Call of Duty: Modern Warefare 2 is out now on Mac! Video impressions and review below.

18609,This game is good I LOVE ITTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18610,"This game is awesome to play

18611,it is a good game but it needs a lot of fixes like nef the m230 and the dual g18 and also people need to start moving !
18612,Hammer Game
18613,"This is the last great Call of Duty. But like any game it has it's flaws.
1. The launchers
2. Maytardom
3. Last stand
4. and of course the hackers(btw you only see the hackers once in a while)
Even with all these flaws this game is still if not better than Call of Duty 4(MW1). So please buy this game, we need more people playing!"
18614,"This game is awsome !

The missions on the single player - V. fun 9/10
Co oP Missions - V. fun 10/10
The graphic is amazing ! and all that game is awsome !"
18615,"Installed this the other day and still find it the gold standard for FPS. The graphics engine still looks great after this time.

The music is great
Graphics engine still very nice.
Story for the campaign mode isn't bad.
The array of weapons is nice.

The only thing I'd comment on is the fact that pulliing a knife out of your chest at the end of the game is highly dubious.


By all accounts, CODMWF2 is superior than the rest of the garbage that Treyarch and the new Infinity ward team produced. I was sad to hear about Infinity Ward's break up and it is likely that we won't see another succesful gaming franchise post Infinity Ward.

18618,lol
18619,"With the music of Hans Zimmer and the cinematic scenes, you're sucked into the game and spit out after you‚Äôre done. The single player is rather short. It will take you about six hours to beat the game, but you get an intense, breathtaking,and memorable ride the entire time. The game seems to be a little scripted, but it isn‚Äôt annoying for everyone."
18620,"Last good Call of Duty.

It had quite nice graphics for the time it was released and sometimes it looks better than Ghosts.
It's lag/glitch/bug free compared to Ghosts.
It's last CoD that has nice Original Sound Track worth epic film titles.
It has nice game design.
It was unique for the time it was released (had tonns of new feautures compared to CoD 4 or WaW).
It has nicely written story. Still some parts doesn't make sence but still much better than the last CoD titles.
It has fights those look much more realistic than any CoD that came later. Less explosions in your face, more tactics, more immersion insted of ""we put more pew-pew-pew and kaboom so it looks like cool skrimish there player doesn't get harmed"".

Most importantly, it has guns that feel and sound more or less like real ones. No carboard shooters.

It has stupid matchmaking system in Multiplayer where you can't chose a server you want to play on (only gamemode) and sometimes you get connected to a hacked server with shitty custom game mode (zombie survival). You disconnect and try to get to another server with same gamemode but get connected back to the same server. Pefect.
Too bad Acitvision closed down Four Delta One project - normal server browser system with server admins and much less hackers. Looks like they follow steps of EA - challenge everything to make gameplay less comfortable."
18621,"Singleplayer review: Action movie quality storyline. Some plot holes, but honestly this, COD4MW and MW3 are the gold standard for modern military shooter storylines. So who am I to complain. 
Coop: great fun. Just wished that IW had included controller support and split screen as per HTPC set up."
18622,Amazing
18623,The last game in CoD franchise that i really enjoyed :P. Never get tired of it.
18624,It's full fo hackers and good luck getting a refund... f**k this game.
18625,Good singleplayer game 11/10
18626,This game use to be good until the hackers came along which IW don't do diddly squat
18627,"This game is absolutely shit, too much hackers, campers and people that spray with G18s... I recommend people to buy ArmA or Battlefield instead of any of the shit CoDs"
18628,"Note : I have on my other acc 11hrs and 100hrs on mp.

This is my No.1 Call of Duty of all time. The best campaing that ever has. The most epic CoD in my opinion. Best soundtrack as well. HANS ZIMMER, WE LOVE YOU FOR MAKING THIS GAME SO EPIC <3"
18629,The Legend! The Best Call of Duty ever!
18630,This game is awesome
18631,420 Blaze it FGT
18632,did this for the badge
18633,this game is probably the best on steam and i rcommend it 101%
18634,this in my opinion is my favorite cod game of all time!!
18635,"MW2 was the first ego-shooter i played seriously. I had several hundred hours of fun with this game and I think my friends can relate with me. Even if the newer CoDs are getting hated, I think that this game is really good. I could talk about the content of the game but i think there are a lot of reviews talking about it, so I won't;)"
18636,"Not having been able to play this game for years (because for some reason they didn't maek MW2 for the Wii, my only other gaming system) and finally getting the chance to open it up and play through the campaign in one day was a blast. The story was very interesting, gave me chills at multiple points, and kept me fully captivated throughout. Ending was great.

Only downside: Multiplayer. Good luck finding a legit server that doesn't instantly boost you 40 levels upon getting a single kill, or making other players invincible. Worth the 20 bucks if you've yet to play, but just be sure to play the original modern warfare first. That's partially what makes it."

"
18644,"Last good Call of Duty made. Even with some unbalanced weapons like Grenade Launcher, Thumper, RPG, etc. Still beats the most recent COD's.
The singleplayer storyline is amazing! ""SOAP!""
Had a lot of fun playing this game, unfortunatly Activision doesn¬¥t care about their games. ""Why should we update COD X if we can make COD Y and get a lot of money"""
18645,One of the best game ever!!
18646,"Call of duty:modern warfare 2 is a superb game that manages to set a new level for the call of duty franchise and also bests its predecessors(which is a not a small achievement).

pros-
.The campaign is short but exhilirating.It provides a great pavement for the multiplayer.
.It has epic missions like cliffhanger,No Russian,Endgame,Just Like OLd Times..etc.These missions raise the bar for all future call of duty.
.Expertly directed set pieces and on rails moments.
.All this is backed by great level design and challenging A.I.
.Incredibly addictive multiplayer.
.Multiplayer adds more depth and layer to the one featured in cod 4.Every match you play unlocks something making you feel a great sense of progression.
.Good graphics.
.Spec ops is another great way to sink your time into this game.

cons-
.story is little ridiculous(but who gives a fuck? its call of duty!!)

overall score-10/10"
18647,"It is a extreme shame this amazing game is branded by such a disgusting series, it isn't like any of the other titles in this series you see this one is actually good, I have spent so much time playing this game, and it has brought me to meet 90% of the people I know today, I will always have a special place in my heart for this game, and it angers me greatly, that a big amount of people have never even tried it because of its series. I am afraid its too late to try it now, almost all the servers are dead, and the only way people can play it is by finding a private server, like 4delta1 etc."
18648,Hello My input on this game is great I love the multiplayer create a class function from the newer games and its nice to play the game that it originated from. The only bad thing about this game online is since its old now there arent many people online most of the time except for mid-day also a lot of people hack. I dont mind people who do simple hacks (I would never do it myself) but some people are hacking so its an auto aim or there is this one hack that makes everyone in the game run super fast and jump super high. There was another time is when it was a team deathmatch and it wouldnt count kills it just stayed at 0-0 and everyone left. for single player the story line is great and immersive I highly reccomend it and I know this game is said to be the best COD game ever and i agree
18649,This game is so fun and so enjoyable to play. It's a must buy!
18650,its ok
18651,One of the best games I've ever played. :)

only bad thing is NAT screwd up thing, cant really play co op"
18655,its a epic game for killing people recommend to get the game
18656,Good game
18657,dont buy this barely anyone play this and there are sometimes modder and there no mods to make this game better
18658,"Get modern warfare 1 or black ops 2 instead, something with dedicated servers."
18659,"This is a brilliant game, unfortunately the multiplayer is slowly dying. Its corrupted by shitty Wallhackers and such, the only thing lacking from this is a sever browser. 8/10"
18660,"its a really nice game, but way too much hackers, once you joined a hacked public match you enter the prestige mode, so you cant play the game by yourself, really gay, so pls make the game antihack or something"
18661,"Probably the best Call of Duty, that has a Multiplayer which is so much fun."
18662,"Campaign is just AMAZING and action packed to the fullest!!!!!!!, Multiplayer is AMAZING like SHIT!!!!!!!!! it's so great :D"
18663,"Best single-player experience in Call of Duty franchise, characters, atmosphere, gameplay, story, missions, locations and simply graphics. There is also coop which has many good and fun missions with even nostalgic ones from CoD4 ;)"
18664,jeg kan godt li mw2 og jeg kan godt invite jer til min steam guild s√• spor mig
18665,"I don't really recommend it, But it's up to you all. I played a few days and a few hours. But all i see is Hack servers. Leveling up, people wall hacking, people using cheats to fight there games. There not really doing anything. Just let the aimbot do it for them. I do really miss the fun of the game where it was a challenge, now it's just childs play where people hack there way through. I guess I'll just play on the 360, the only thing I have to worry about is Modded controllers. But I found a way through that, so it's no biggie to play. Just if Punkbuster and other hack shields and stuff were more well equip to handle hacks. I would def. Give this game a 10. But all I see is 2. Half of the game you will mostly find just hack servers. And the rest is just that people are trying to play without having all this trouble. But some want to find hack servers so they wont have to play through. I find alot of unskilled players in this game. But I'll leave it up to you to choose whether this game is for you to play."
18666,Same COD as all the other CODs.  Loved the single player campaign. Didn't bother with the multiplayer (lack of dedicated servers). Are they even still up? 8/10
18667,Last of the best Call of Duty's. Everything after has been rehash crap.
18668,"Very good, nice game, recomended all games of serie.
Muito bom o jogo, apesar de n√£o ter os melhores gr√°ficos ainda assim representa um bom desafio para a placa de v√≠deo, jogabilidade √© a mesma do Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.
Contras: N√£o tem muitas possibilidades de ajuste de qualidade gr√°fica, o jogo tamb√©m √© extremamente violento, principalmente na parte onde bandidos invadem e exterminan todas as pessoas de um aeroporto, √© muito forte a cena, por√©m vale a pena comprar.

18669,U can get banned randomly permantly when u did nothing wrong i dont recorment it
18670,The best part of Call of Duty series. I hope one day they made another good game of Call of Duty like this...
18671,Trolololololol !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18672,THe Best game of call of duty
18673,Best Of COD
18674,"As far as First person shooters go Call of Duty is hands down the best! Modern Warfare 2 happens to be the best call of duty game ive played! I bought this game on my pc because i loved it soooo much on the Xbox 360. although the controls are a little hard to get used to, once you have it its loads of fun! MW2 was the first COD i played but this is one of the best games on steam if not the best. P.S. (the sales on this game are great i saved $10.00 when it was on sale!)"
18675,"After 10 hour of playtime a hacker made me and a friend level 70 with all guns and attachments.

Was fun until then. Except for the dozen or so modded lobbies and 10 shitty hosts before the hacker.

Don't buy this unless you enjoy playing with hackers."
18676,Cmon guys I need a play friend :)
18677,Its a fun game but becomes hard when you choose prestige mode
18678,One of the BEST games ...
18679,Super Jeux je le recomande a tout le monde et plus au pgm et trickshoter
18680,Best CoD
18681,Best CoD for sniping ever!
18682,"Unplayable, as much as MW2 is a great game and was a great gam, on PC multiplayer is simply unplayable weather it is the crappy PvP (i think it is, without dedicated servers) or 7/10 servers getting hacked and completley messing with the game, not only the game but your computer can get messed up eg. them setting high settings (luckily my computer is good so it can cope) or freezing your controls up, disableing your ability to quit and i was also having trouble to even alt ctrol and delete out of the game. So yes its a good game but unfortunatly it is now a dead horse with hackers kicking it. So i would not recommend multiplayer and will stay away from those quite frankly scary moments of being hacked."
18683,Great game especially if youre new to the game
18684,A very good game =)
18685,Possibly the best Call of Duty game out there. All the games after this started going downhill in terms of fun. Highly recommend this one if you are bored of the newer CoD games.
18686,Best CoD ever made its the first game that i bought on Steam. Everything about this game just amazing Characters Multiplayer Soundtracks Storyline its just absolute amazing.TextBook Fps game
18687,Best game ever <3
18688,This game is awesome!
18689,This is a great game and the single player is amazing. And the multiplayer is fantastic (except for the hacked lobbies here and there). I would recommend this game to any call of duty fan.
18690,"Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is one of the most popular games in the Call Of Duty franchise. I am one the biggest fan of this and other Call Of Duty games. But every game has it's flwas including Call of Duty such as: When the missiles blew up the sattelite, it came crashing down right at the exact spot where Ramirez was and so they were lucky. Also, how did Price even get in prison. But those are the little questions that no on really pays attention to. The thing that caught my attentio was how the enemy who remains the enemy ""Makarov"" helps out Price even though they want to strangle eachother. Also it was unique on how the main hero kills the main villain, with a throwing knife, now you dont see that in any other game. Also you had no suspicion that Shephard would betray you until he does."
18691,"The game has a very good story line and its interesting to play
R.I.P GHOST

9.5/10"
18692,"in my opinion one of the best call of duty games ever made
but i  dont recommend this game to buy 
its because there are not a lot/none playing it..."
18693,Best COD 10/10
18694,ive been hackd by a F***ing retarded hacker b!tch and now i cant f***ing play it anymore... DO SOMETHING! :'(
18695,isn't it a time for an 80% disscount?
18696,It's Modern Warfare 2.
18697,dis is dank
18698,Last CoD game that worth its money.
18699,"I'd say this was the turning point from Call of Duty.  This game was good, but not better than original Modern warfare, or COD2 before it.  After this game, the Call of Duty franchise massively declined into the laughable remenants we have today"
18700,"Modern Warfare 2 was the game that got me into gaming.  With a truely epic Campaign (scored by Hans Zimmer!), a challenging Special Ops mode, and addicting multiplayer, this is Call of Duty at its finest.  The second it goes on sale, pick this title up, you won't regret it.  My personal pick for GOTY 2009."
18701,"Yes, people still play this.
Only TDM, FFA and Search and destroy etc. Dont think youre gonna get into a hardcore demolition game!"
18702,"Super game, well worth playing."
18703,I like to shoot guns
18704,"If you want to get a Call of Duty game, get either this, Call of Duty 4 or Black Ops."
18705,I love dat ! <3
18706,5/5
18707,"its ok, but they have really overpriced."
18708,Legit (I only play singleplayer so dont trust me)
18709,"I played this game while eating Doritos Loco's‚Ñ¢ from Taco Bell, while also eating drinking my Moutain Dew because it is gamerfuel. 

I called 3 people children after they continuoulsly said they have had sexual intercourse with my mother and reported them to the game developers. 

Anoher man even told me he would come to my house, stick a dildo in my anus while also fitting a ring around my flaccid penis.

After this experience, i would definately recommend this game to any person who is wiling to have sex with any man.

10/10, better than Omegle and Craigs List"
18710,"Originally, i wrote a positive review. in hindsight, ive since deleted it.

Sure, MW2 is one of the best CoD games ever created, but the game was released in 2009. its now 2014, so the graphics and gameplay are seriously outdated, and there is now zero support from IW. yet Steam still charges the retail $89.99 for the game.

I PAID THAT UPON RELEASE!

there is zero justification to pay this much, especially considering the community has dwindled exponentially, and moved on to MW3, BOPS, Ghosts etc.

even on special at the moment for $49.99 there is still zero justification to pay so much for a game that is so old. honestly? you would be better off buying CoD4 and have the joy of private servers.

it makes me sad to not recommend this game, but with the blatant price gouging by both Steam and Activision, there really isnt a choice. i just hope this review will stop alot of people wasting their hard earned money that will offer a sub-par experience at best.

off the top of my head, i can think of a dozen games that are more worthy of your hard earned $$"
18711,Awesome game!! WHat makes it even btter are game clients!
18712,"Yes, I have Modern Warfare 2 and would love to play it!!!!!!   It stopped working!  Everytime I try to play it, it tells me steam must be running!!  Well it is running!!!  I have called activision several times and steam has no VERBAL contact!!!  Only emails with remedies that you need to be a computer genius to make it work!!!!!!!  My other call of duty games work.  Modern Warfare is in my library just like the others but won't let me play!!!  Makes no sense!!!!!!  Activision tells me it is a steam problem and steam is no help!!!!  Why doesn't steam allow verbal communication!!!  Iam at the point I want to uninstall it and purchase another but I am afraid it will not work either!!!!!  Any Fixes out there!!!!!

Would love to recommend it if I could play it!!!!!!"
18713,"Not Dank enuff for me too hard to 360noscope, not MLG! 


But seriously the only people playing are haxors and the game is a poor port."
18714,no i want a refund its to hacked to play

10/10 Would uninstall this again!! Best uninstalling simulator ever!!!"
18718,"very good. you wil play it over and over again, i give it 9 +"
18719,Don't bother buying this once great pile of shit. You will instantly run into hackers.
18720,"Nice Game But Really Bored After Play It For A Long Time,And The Only Mode That Work Was Team Deathmatch.No One Play On Other Mode Like Capture The Flag Etc,The Gameplay Was Awesome I Give 6/10 For The Score"
18721,It was a hack game peace of junk
18722,"Modern Warfare 2 is my favourite from cod games, it has the best multyplayer of them all, maps are amazing and it just feels great."
18723,Nah...
18724,Best CoD ever made.
18725,its pretty interesting game i suggest it :D
18726,Epic
18727,Very fun game@ you can play a lot of time and it feel like it's two minutes!
18728,"For me this is the 2nd best Call of Duty game only to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. Sadly I do not recommend you purchase this in 2014. Graphically on my Windows 8.1 machine with GTX760 and 16GB memory the game has serious issues with jumping frames and gives the impression you're experiencing severe lag. (Can't find a fix anywhere!)

Moreover, as you'd probably guess with any Call of Duty game, it's been destroyed by kids who think they're hackers. Having some wannabe hacker remove your rank is not un-common. Fair matches are not impossible to find however you never know who is using a mod or what advantage they have given themselves. 

Also be warned there are no leaderboards and only a few of the game modes have any activity. Search and Destroy is completely dead. 

It's a shame each Call of Duty game is abandoned by the developers so soon after final release, especially considering how much the gaming community has given them. 

(Played 4 hrs on multiplayer)"
18729,Do I have to explain just come on click that buy button please...
18730,Great game!
18731,"JUST PLAY IT AND U WILL SEE!! 
You will love it <3"
18732,"Nice game , but so much hackers ..."
18733,By far the best Call of Duty campaign of all time that I have played played it all in one sitting on veteran and I regret nothing. SO MUCH FUN! A must buy just for the campaign.
18734,One of the best call of duty games... ( dont buy mw3 .. it is just a dlc of mw2)
18735,Snarp snarp.
18736,It's a good game :)
18737,trash
18738,Great game
18739,EPIC GAME
18740,Last game the Call of Duty did right...
18741,u wot m8? 1v1 me rust quickscopes only.
18742,One of the most succesful Call of Duty's ever!
18743,"This game may have tubers, hackers, and painkiller noobs, but it is still fun to play, and one of the best Call of Duty games released so far. Also it is still better than ghosts."
18744,Very good if u want to play 2on2 matches
18745,"So many years after its release: Only reliably working mp mode is team death match, you can scrap the rest.
It's been a splendid game though."
18746,Is there any reason that the dlc is still 15$ for this garbage game?
18747,owned
18748,"Personally, I didnt really enjoy this game. I thought tey could have done better and I regret buying it. Yeah. Includes Multiplayer"
18749,It is cool.My favorite game.
18750,Sucks
18751,"Great game, worth every penny.  Get it, play it, love it..."
18752,definitley the best FPS game i played
18753,great game to pro at it so i stoped!
18754,"Lot of modifications which are on the servers, also a lot of cheaters. Anyway playable but not good as far as i remember after 1st day after premiere."
18755,"I have to admit I was one of those 13 year olds playing this game. Well, back in 2009, when it came out. I'm 18 now however, and I have to admit, I love the game more now. It is a throwback to a time where I scrapped up $60 to grab it from the local video game retailer where I lived. To be honest, I didn't understand how to play the game when I was that young. I just shot wildly and would have tantrums playing it if I lost. I didn't end up having fun, and I'm sure I ruined the game for everyone in the matches I played. What I can say, is that I have grown to respect the game now, and that comes with age. It's not about the best kills or the best quickscope, its about playing the game to have fun, not pull a ""Ohh, 1v1 me you Fgt, I'll no-scope you!"". Games are meant for fun, not to be the biggest A-hole on the interenet. And it's no place for 13 year olds, the maturity to play the game may not be 18 for the content, but you need that maturity that comes with age to play these games. 

I do highly recommend this game for the reasons as it is a highly fun and addictive shooter, That is meant for Fun.

Graphics: 7/10
Story: 8/10
Gameplay: 8/10
Multiplayer 9/10

Overall: 32/40

Tl;Dr Great game, buy it for a throwback if you haven't already."
18756,"Very good game, probably with cod4 the best Call of Duty of all time. Unfortunatly there are not so many people anymore who play this game and also the game is full from hackers and modded lobbys :("
18757,good game. would def rec. should play.
18758,Great game but really the vac is a pain in the as!
18759,dis is fucking awesome c:
18760,Great Game!
18761,Thanks for getting me vac banned. Although i didn't use any cheat :) because i joined a fucking hacked lobby so i am banned.. -_-
18762,I sunk an unhealthy amount of time into this game and truly enjoyed the competitive nature of it. Unfortunately the game became overrun with cheaters and Activision seemed more interested in churning out DLC rather than fix the problem. Because of that I cannot recommend this game and in fact have never played a COD game again.
18763,Black screen on widows XP I can¬¥t launch it!!!
18764,"Nostalgia hits you so hard with this master piece,I would reccoment this game to all people who's to action/shooter games!"
18765,Amazing multi player better guns and always aim for the acr (best gun ever)
18766,It's really shit but it's funny to laugh at the ones who take it seriously.
18767,"Steam ruined this online game, period. Lets have some server list to join from."
18768,It wont let me play multiplayer
18769,"Worse than MW, better than MW3. Is ok"
18770,good game but now less people r playing and so many hacked lobbies.
18771,This game has held up well against the years. It was the fisrt CoD I ever played and the first game I bought on steam. It is truly enjoyable.
18772,"GREAT GAME!!! Its worth buying it. Campaign is fun, special ops is fun, and multiplayer is amazing!!! Get Modern Warfare 2"
18773,"The multiplayer's pretty fun (except for the hackers) Spec Ops is good, and the campaign isn't half bad."
18774,"Used quite some time on this game. The only bad things is that there's not really any big differences from the previous Call of Duty games, and there's too many DLCs"
18775,hell yeah awasome!!!<3
18776,"By far my second favorite Call of Duty(Black Ops comes first), descent CoD-graphics, interesting physics and fun guns. Awesome to gather some friends in a private-lobby and shoot at eachother."
18777,"I like this! Of course and Scandalous Mission (""No Russian"")"
18778,i
18779,"i enjoyed this game so much on the xbox 360. ive gone from one format to an other pretty much my whole gaming life. this game is by far my favorite cod and its 5 years old. i always enjoy this game no matter what im playing on
"
18780,"COD MW2, was one of my most played games in the past, funny to play with friends ... gonna give you a few hours of laugh.
Good to play when you have nothing to do.
I Recommend"
18781,yes i truly do
18782,"The best game I have ever bought, hours of gameplay and fun with friends!"
18783,"When Steam will do something with all the hackers?.  It's a shame that all people that wants play legal we can't, and Steam do nothing. Please, i pay my game and i need to steam do something about it."
18784,its amaze balls best cod out of all the cods so far nothing has even come close to mw2
18785,This game still has an amazing community for a 5 year old game! And it still is the best Call of Duty becuase it's just sooo smooth. I would definitley reccomend buying this becuase it still has more players than COD Ghosts
18786,"Graphics and gameplay almost made me praise the great sky bird

69/420

Blazing"
18787,Reliving the old days from 2009. SOOOOO GOOOOD
18788,Its a masterpiece. Its a masterpi......IM A MILLIONAIRE. MILLIONAIIIIIRE PEOPLEEE

18797,"One of my favorite games. I really recommend it so just give it a try!

10/10"
18798,Best game ever can't get enough of playing it!
18799,One of the best CODs
18800,one of my most favourite Call of Duty series!!
18801,"0/10 

Some kid said mean things about my mom with barn yard animals."
18802,Great mulitplayer besides danger close noobtubes
18803,full of hacks
18804,shit
18805,"it was a good game
"
18806,fun game singleplayer is fun but multiplayer is awesome and played with frends you got an awesome game you get little mad at hackers or noob tobers but its an awesome ggame and u shold play it still my best call of duty game :D
18807,"""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare"" and ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2"" are the best Call of Duty EVER."
18808,"Great game. In fact this is my first steam game. This game is one of the bestest cod games ever, anyother series ruined it. It doesn't use much specs and runs well. Only problem is that multiplayer is complety gone. If you manage to find a match its most likely hacked or modded. Everything else makes this game fun."
18809,the best game ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18810,"Good game,"
18811,11/10 my life gone
18812,Look mom! Noob tubes
18813,epic!
18814,Good game cool but not long story mode .
18815,amazing multiplayer
18816,"Good game, but price should be lower by now."
18817,"It's very good
"
18818,"Awesome story game is pretty much fun.
I would rate it 9.2/10"
18819,"Best game ever made. too bad the pirated version is more updated and actually enjoyable.

I would love to see them fix the flaws it has right now and have some sort of official game servers support like cod4 does. Hell just make this Free-to-play already and give permission to 3 party communities to continue their development but it's not going to happen. it will be remastered down the road and ruined before we know it like MWR"
18820,"No matter what, I keep on coming back to this amazing game. While it has its issues, of all the games in the Call of Duty franchise it is by far the best and most refined. 
Hours upon Hours of fun, and while I wouldnt recommend paying for more than half off, it is something you should get if you don't already have it.

96/100"
18821,Reviewing Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 is very good
18822,really good game i love it so much that i was playing max settings and i had no problem but when i cracked the game at one point it lagged so buying off of steam is good choose
18823,"Solid contender for worst PC port (Behind Ghosts). Console is disabled. If I wanted to play at 65 FOV and 90 FPS cap I would buy a console. IW why cant you make/port games? Dont buy this garbage on PC, its a waste of good space. WouldNotPlay/10"
18824,this game is epic like hollaholla get dolla 420 blazeit
18825,i love this game it is so fun
18826,If this game was a potatoe. It would be one good potatoe.
18827,"Really fun campaign/spec ops. Even though it takes a while to find a multiplayer game now, this game is worth it for the single player/co-op alone."
18828,Personally this is the best Call of Duty (Multiplayer Wise) in my opinion.
18829,Best call of duty ever!!
18830,Dont buy this game its the worst i spent 20 dollars on thegame and got vac bann the first day i played ... I DIDNT EVEN HACK!!! Dont waste your money on this game buy gmod or call of duty mondern warefare 1
18831,Was fun while it lasted but then it became a hacker only game
18832,"Don't get the game from Steam. This is old, yes, but it wasn't when it came out and notta thing has changed since it has come out. Worst match making service ever. No multiplayer options just in, if you get in your lucky if not you were warned. I don't get why a multiplayer game don't get support. This is a fun game and tons more fun in multiplayer. So if you must have it find an alternative way to play and don't support the companys that don't support thier product."
18833,A real mans game
18834,inredible game hours of fun i would definitely recomend this game to anyone interested in the FPS genre
18835,The last great Call of Duty
18836,"Really fun game. I've played it lots both on console and PC. The campaign is the second-best campaign in CoD, CoD 4 being the first imo. You can also play the second game mode which you can play in co-op and get three stars in all missions and stuff, I did it on the Xbox and it's really fun to play with a friend.

Multiplayer is pretty good. It's not as dedication-rewarding as the newer games, prestiging resets everything litteraly so it's not very fun to prestige. The guns are really fun though. Lots of traditional weapons such as UZI and M4A1, good off-hands (shotguns are secondaries, overpowered but fun). All the guns are fun in their own way if you know how to use them. Attachments are as usual. Red dot sights, silencers, noobtubes (which are horribly overpowered in this game and has never been fixed, probably because IW doens't care about gaming experience), nothing new. You can unlock different versions of attachments by using that attachment which is pretty cool. Using the Red Dot Sight unlocks Holographic Sight, using underbarrel grenade launcher unlocks underbarrel shotgun, stuff like that. Emblems and titles are really cool and well-made imo. Killstreaks is nothing new. Care package, chopper support, airstrikes, controlling AC130s weapons and being a chopper gunner, stuff like that. They're cool and fun to get but not original.
Maps are really cool. A russian snow map, a woodland map with a really cool cabin on a hill, tight urban combat in an afghanistan-like map, love the maps in this game. They're the best maps in any CoD game imho. You can also buy a map pack that gives you the maps from CoD 4 (not sure if all of them) which is really cool

If you're a CoD fan then this game is nice to play sometimes when you want a good CoD game to not dedicate yourself to or take seriously. Of course, there will be hackers, as in all IW CoD games."
18837,By far the best cod yet and I'm wrighting this in the era of cod ghosts
18838,good game
18839,"This game is really well made. The campaign is really awesome with an easy to follow story line. The mulltiplayer is very fun and exciting except for the usual asshole online, its brilliant!! Definitely worth it :) 9/10"
18840,"B3ST GAM3 3V3R L0L0L0L0L0L0L0L
BATTLESHIT SUX! C0D F3R LYF3"
18841,I just want to show my play hours
18842,"This game is really great,I love the story line and i do like multiplayer.But the thing is there isnt alot of cheaters online,The only way to avoid them is buy the DLC."
18843,"favorite cod ever but wish it had controller compatability
"
18844,"I highly recommend this game to all CoD veterans out there, since this is one of the best CoD's out there.
A huge props to IW for implementing many new features such as wide variety of killstreak selections, plenty of new attachments (excluding Grenade Launcher and maybe Thermal Scope which can be really frustrating when a troll or all-season camper uses them), ofcourse new weapons and customizations for multiplayer characters such as Ghillie suits for snipers, can be unlockable via in-game challenges.

The singleplayer campaign is just as epic and breathtaking like it's predecessor CoD4 (maybe even more action-packed than before).

Spec Ops missions are great addition to a game too - just get a friend and play co-op online or take a challange and do them on your own.

Last, but not least. The multiplayer connection - it is smooth as silk. The hit detection in this game is awesome! No shoot first and die bullsh*t like in future installments.
Personally this is my 3rd CoD that i enjoy the most, and i'm sure that you will like it the same as i do or even more. Nevertheless, the game is out for some time, but good stuff never gets old, so grab your gear and go dominate some noobs, soldier!"
18845,"hardest but second best cod yet.

if it's not about the graphics but about gaming, this game is for you! intervention is my best sniper in cod, and it's from this game. pretty ballanced weapon damage compared to bo2. but sometimes you might find hacked servers around the place."
18846,This game is so cool specialy the multiplayer and I recommend it.
18847,"I love playing it. By far my favorite CoD, just dont be like me and get mw2 liberation and get VAC ban. ITS A HUGE MISTAKE. But overall its worth the 20$."
18848,too many hackers needs fixed but still a beast game.
18849,"I don't recommend this game unless you're looking for a short single player campaign and some ALONE coop fun.
However the multiplayer and coop parts are totally broken, in MP almost every lobby seems to be hacked or modified in any way and playing this game over LAN is merely impossible due to the matchmaking system and the always online ""Feature"" of the Multiplayer. Coop is also very complicated since you have to open ports on your router to sucessfully host a game, same goes for the Multiplayer part.
Furthermore Activision and Infinity Ward don't give the slightest bit of support anymore and new hacks and other tools aren't recognized by VAC."
18850,"One of the best Call of Duty games out there, and a must have for every gamers collection."
18851,"hell yea
"
18852,"Single-Player: Eases you into how to play the game, holds your hand, then holds your hand up until the 3rd level. Then things get awesome!!! From facing off the local militia deep within the favelas of Rio de Janeiro in South America to sneaking into a heavily guarded base hidden in a mountain range in Kazakhstan, you'll be gripped by the stunning graphics, storyline, and all the different weapons you get to try out!

Multi-player: Multi-player maps are adequate, challenge system is okay...the real problem is hackers. Hackers. Hackers. Hackers!! Because of them, you can lose all your custom classes and have them replaced with the hacker's and instantly have your Multi-player progress and all your challenges are 100% complete (bad for those people who want to earn their way to completion). I don't know why Valve or the guys who created MW2 is not stopping this.

Special Ops: Now for the best! Special challenges that can suit your hardcoreness. You can also play with a friend, too! 2 missions are required with a friend. MY FAVORITE!! Try to get all 69 stars from all 23 missions. From blowing up cars to killing off waves of enemies to killing new difficult enemies called ""Juggernauts"". 

Took me about 50 hours to get all the achievements.

THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN $20, I think. I love it."
18853,"geat stuff, just too many modders and hackers"
18854,worth hacking.. for 1 hour
18855,The game is seriously funs!
18856,best game 10/10 m8
18857,Muy bien!
18858,its very fun and i think its the best modern warfare
18859,"It's just another COD, mainly designed around multiplayer which is pretty much dead by now. It's not impressive in any respect, just a shooter like so many others."
18860,"Nice bro! I remember when this game came out was great excitement, perhaps even more than the first part. The most favorite part of the entire series, made ‚Äã‚Äãa major breakthrough in the understanding of network games (battles). Still interesting to play it is a pity that due to mismanagement in this game bad now (I hope in the future developers will finally realize, finally did)."
18861,"As for singleplayer, it's good, but too short and lacks options.

As for multiplayer, all it is is a cancerous daycare center for 9 year olds."
18862,"Last CoD game I ever played. It was great while it lasted. Then I got too good, never lost, so I quit."
18863,dis b cool all da time broz.
18864,niceeee
18865,"The best call of duty IMO. 

The story is great, the multiplayer has lots of challenges to complete.

The game never gets boring!"
18866,Very fun
18867,it was a meg alright game not one for fps
18868,Hackers have ruined this game on pc unless you are one of the arrogant assholes who likes ruining games for everyone else DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!
18869,"IT's a good game, but hackers are crazy on this one. and then you geta VAC ban and you cant play it any more"
18870,I cry every time I remember how good this game was. I cry everytime I remember I bought the other games.
18871,awsome game
18872,best game)
18873,Bom Jogo Melhor que o mw3!!!!!!!!!
18874,I've learned that my mother has slept with a lot of guys without me knowing. Useful tool.
18875,Last good Call Of Duty Game.
18876,The best COD
18877,10/10
18878,buy this game ull get hacked and already be max level and have all the guns and theyre is modded lobbys like infection which is really fun you should get this game one of the best cod games
18879,"Steam needs to do there job, bann the f'n cheaters. Twice this week my game been corrupted, had to delete my files and start over. This is a big pain in my ass. Fix this crap please
"
18880,It's good i recomend it!!
18881,The best graphics of all Call of Duty¬Æ games. (my opinion)
18882,"shit

18898,The best CoD. Hands down.
18899,great game
18900,"A very good game its like cod 4 only like cod4(2.0) it is much better then cod 4 but still hold that same feeling like cod 4
"
18901,"An epic blast, a worthy sequel to the highly successful original.
Includes many improvements and a fresh new single player campaign while keeping the tradition of a polished game engine."
18902,nice
18903,its a really fun party game and also its easy to just launch and have fun. 8/10
18904,"Good fun, if a bit old"
18905,Dud its sick bro
18906,"November 10, 2009: The best day in Call of Duty history, but what has happened to the multiplayer in the last four years and four months? Well it has degraded to a few thousand people playing on a good day. Hackers are few and far between but you may encounter a few. Watch out for the deranking lobbies! A bit of server instability with a ton of host migrations if you get in the wrong lobby. The same game you know and love! 7/10"
18907,Best campaign!
18908,its a chil game
18909,best cod made C:
18910,This Game is the best Game what I play in my life
18911,A fun game from a few years back.
18912,"Before u buy this game make sure ur laptop/desktop is in perfect condition and up to date because this game is so laggy i could barely move the corner without getting killed by hackers.
Also single player is even laggier but works fine."
18913,"This game is heavily over rated, the campaign is ridiculous, the spec ops is only enjoyable if you are teamed up with a friend, the multiplayer has no dedicated servers, over-powered killstreaks and guns and has no option to alter my FOV
i rate modern warfare 2 2/10"
18914,GOOD Game! :D
18915,Go back to CoD 4 and you'll be good.
18916,"For it's $20 dollar price tag it's probably one of the best choices for Call of Duty's out there. The main problem being is that there's a large amount of hackers in the game, or hacked lobbies. Still, you you want an occasional Call of Duty game to play, this might  be a good pick up."
18917,"Good game shame about the hackers who ruined it so then you have to try out the dedicated server clients out there that have some form of enforcement on hackers.

But still this game is one of the few that are very good in both single and multiplayer based.

"
18918,"I have been playing this game since 2009, and I still enjoy it to this day. The only thing I could have wished for is more involvement on Infinity Ward's part as multiplayer is infested with hacked lobbies and hackers. I strongly suggest that, if you're still interested in playing this game, to look into a custom client for this game; they have dedicated servers support (servers in many continents), and almost zero hackers."
18919,"This Game is no diffrent from the other cods just pc Controllers Are easy to remember If you not played Mw2 try it out it has Diffrent Kinds Of game modes

18924,One of the best games I ever played!
18925,Very fun and complex game at firsy then very FUN
18926,"-Really nice multiplayer game, sad the times move."
18927,best cod ever...
18928,"i like this game ,its my best game"
18929,yes
18930,This game. Such a classic. Was one of the better CoDs of the time. Inifinity Ward always knew how to make a good CoD until Ghosts. If you got to play this one during its prime then you know how amazing it was. It is still fun to play now from time to time but of course the hackers can get old at times.
18931,"my prblem was fixed, i love this game, best CoD ever.
MW2 FTW"
18932,i totally recommend it
18933,Lots to shoot at and even more to blow up :-)
18934,"By far this is the best of the online COD's.    The later COD's are lackluster  copies of MW2.   That is why they threw in Zombies, to hide the fact that the new COD's were lacking in graphics and are not as challenging."
18935,Awesomeeee
18936,meh
18937,The best game ever!
18938,"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled :DDD its a joke... lot of cheater, lol respawn system, good game with lot of sux thing.... now ~unplayable:D good game, but now i think i waste 25euro..."
18939,Really good game aswell
18940,Nice addition after MW1. No one plays it anymore. Great LAN game though
18941,This game is werry Nice!!!! :D

18943,"I'm sad the servers aren't as plentiful as they used to be.  But hey, there's like 10 more Call Of Dutys that came out after this.
And hey, if you think those suck (probably because they do), I hear there's one coming out in 2014...and 2015....and 2016.....and maybe, just maybe (it's gonna happen) 2017.  You're probably wondering why I know this.  Because America's fucking stupid.

I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

0/10

Would suicide again."
18944,The last good Call of Duty by Infinity Ward
18945,my favourite game mw2 <33
18946,This Game is so prety!! I nead frends (played MW2) !!!!!!! and play team! My english not good
18947,"Still an amazing game, most enjoyable cod game out there in my opinion"
18948,much wow
18949,"The best of the series, best Multiplayer, best campign and most memorable Spec Ops. This one goes down as my favorite CoD game of all time.
8.5/10"
18950,"I Love this game so much.
i love to make kids/people raging...
Its beautifull...
They raging...
I Luv it so much..."
18951,Best game :D
18952,Good game
18953,A classic...too bad no one still plays it.
18954,10/10
18955,"MW2 single player is by far the best, but I would avoid if your looking to play online multiplayer unless you enjoy cheating, hacking piece of crap players that still suck even when they cheat...servers are all full of cheating dick heads that ruin a great game! generation of waste"
18956,"If you liked CoD 4 and want to play the last good CoD, give MW2 a shot. It's a great game, singleplayer lasts only 4 hours but has that epic feeling to it, coop missions are quite good and multiplayer has lots of modes for you to lose hundreds of hours on:)
Deep in customization of your weapons, killstreaks with challenges like: don't camp, get 25 kills without single death and NUKE a whole map, you can decide who wins:)
For CoD 4 fans I would mention: smaller but easy to learn maps, good old all around weapons like barrett, MP5 or desert eagle, and finaly for snipers, unlock sniper's camo for desert, urban and snow teritories, and use silencer along with better scope or heartbeat sensor on your riffle. - And unlike in BF3 and 4, game doesn't crash every 5 mins, and you're not showing your position by having long range scope on.
"
18957,Good game. Apart from better graphics the story continuity is good as well. Still like the original
18958,Very good game
18959,Best game of all time.
18960,i was put in a modded lobby and then ban servers are bad need fixing still after so many years
18961,"really fun, A lot of the hackers play this now, And just to play with the majority of the people you need to spend around 50$ however I feel nostalgic about this game due to it came out when I JUST started playing on Xbox360 and I was in love with it ever since."
18962,"Singleplayer, good story, fps.
Not heaps of groundbreaking gameplay, but a bit of emotional attachement to your character, even with swapping."
18963,Amazing Gameplay and co-op maps (didnt play multi since i bought it 3 years after its release)
18964,Best FPS storyline EVER
18965,"Awesome game, huge snowballing-Killstreaks.
Extremely fun to play, as long as you are Host"
18966,I downloaded the game and it doesnt let me play multiplayer. the game wouldnt allow me to select a game mode. what seems to be the problem?
18967,Nobody plays it anymore but this game is my favourite cod 11/10
18968,"Most people remember this game as the last good Call Of Duty Game. The multiplayer is good, but you should probably buy this on console. The multiplayer is entirely plagued with hackers. The neglect from Infinity Ward and hacking has gotten so bad to the point where hackers can ruin your game, and since Steam cloud saves your data, it's impossible to fix in some cases. There's no word from Steam when the community asks for soloutions.

There are groups of legit players who play private matches, if you can find one, it's fun, but that's more of a tactic to avoid hackers for people who already have the game.

Some of the things hackers can do is change your resoloution, your minimap size (to the point where it takes up the whole screen.) These problems can be fixed by deleting you config files and verifying your cache.
They can also corrupt your rank, and this can't be fixed, unless you get into another hacked lobby and they rank you up to 70.

This is a GOOD multiplayer game, but I'm going to thumb it down because of how prevelent hackers are, and people should know about. Unless you already have people to play with, I wouldn't buy it for PC."
18969,This is one of the best Call of Duty game they ever made. It has the best campaign . Wish all new COD`s were awesome as MW2...
18970,Really good game! <3 trickshots for life <3
18971,I told my friend to 1v1 intervention  360 noscope last nice only but he didn't want to. This game is good anyways.
18972,Really good game!!
18973,one of the best call of duty appart from waw (world at war)
18974,best cod
18975,Wooooooot Guns!
18976,"The best Call of Duty to date, in my humble opinion. Great story with an awesome finish."
18977,"100% recommend,  end of the discussion !"
18978,Awesome
18979,THIS GAME IS HACKED!!!!!!!
18980,"Great game, btw my favorite gun is the tar21"
18981," Out of all of the Call of Duty game titles, this is one of the best. I own many of the titles of Call of Duty and this is just amazing. The missions are fun, the veteran mode is supisingly hard and this is just the most amazing Call of Duty I think I have ever played. You guys have to get this! 

                                                                                                                                                   My rate: 10/10"
18982,"it's ok
10/10
-ign"
18983,i really like this game so much i want to buy one
18984,"Mw2 is a very good game. It has great sniping, and the sniping has influenced me to get good at it, and has isnpired me to make cod edits. Although I have encountered at least 5 hackers using hacks such as god mode, and aimbot. This game sometimes makes me rage a bit though. This game also feels like a pc port, because of the lack of a server browser, and no ability to mod, which is a feature cod 4 had, which is the best cod overall. I also really like the maps, and there was no map that felt too big, or too small. I also like how it has the NUKE killstreak, which is caused by a player on a 25 killstreak. This killstreak is very cool, and it ends the match, but can be frusterating when someone else but you gets one. I also havent encountered no lag durring my expeerience when playing this, but overall, the good things about this game make up for the lack of some features. So I would recomend this game."
18985,"ive always been a big fan of the COD seris, but mw2 took my gaming expiernce to a whole nother level. i love this game because of the simple but unquie gameplay that everyother call of duty can not provide for me, i fell has if its a matter of skill (besides the noobtubing) and not how high you can throw a hunter killer drone. i currently am part of a 1v1 community within this game, i am a spawntrapper which allows me to feel like i am smarter then the game, i stand in certain places at certain times which allows me to control the spawn position of another player. anyway, great game. Putting this one in the books."
18986,"call of duty: modern Warfare 2 is a brilliant game and can still e considered one of the best call of duty games to date!! the storyline is flawless so far ( i havent completed it yet) but it is brilliant thus far! the multiplayer is just brilliant only wish my internet was good enough coz im lagging for days, anyway thats that"
18987,"Nice Game No Lags But MultiPlayer Is Very Hard  ^^
"
18988,real good game. but not a lot of players any more
18989,"One of the best COD games to be honest, only thing that it needs is just a bit more weapons and player customization."
18990,"very good. 8 OP guns and rest are shit, allows for better killstreaks"
18991,"Pro: Really fun to play
Con: Too many hackers"
18992,"Campaign is another dull, Brown People/Foreigner Murder simulator 2009. Lacks any wit or intelligence present in COD4. The multiplayer is hailed as the best of the series, but then again what do 11 year olds know? The only redeeming qualtiy of this shit fest is the Spec Ops missions, which are occasionally fun to play."
18993,In my opinion i think this cod made its best on everything (from campaign to multiplayer).I really enjoy it and i hope u like it too!
18994,"Made my friend rage-quit!

5 out of 5"
18995,I miss this game... :(

19016,very nice cod play game. very worth the munney
19017,Does not work.
19018,full of wonder game just waiting for u
19019,"This game was so addictive when it first came out. At the time I had a PS3 and horrible internet so most of the time I ended up bringing it to friends houses. I finally got good internet and I spent the next 6 months constantly playing the multiplayer.

The thing is, I bought this game last year for the PC, fully aware that the online community is practically dead....but, it didn't take away from the game. This is one of the only modern COD games that I can actually say with full seriousness that the campaign and co-op alone is enough to buy this game again.

8/10, would buy again."
19020,"TOPPEST LEL
MAXIMUM RAGE
10/10
UNBREAKABLE"
19021,"I really like the game.  I hate the fact that I have to deal with Steam just to play the damn thing when I want.  I just wanted to play real quick for a few minutes because I haven't played in a few months.  I can't because I have to wait 11 freaking hours for the game to update!  Really?!  I didn't want to play online or anything multiplayer, just a couple minutes in the privacy of my own home.  Just because my game didn't have the latest updates was not going to take away any enjoyment for the hour or so I had available to play!  I have had it with this crap!  I have most of the call of duty games and all of the modern warefare games.  I am going to get rid of them all in a yard sale this spring and as God is my witness from now on any game that has anything to do with steam is not coming in my house!  I don't care if it's the best damn game ever made and the characters crap gold nuggets onto my desk!  Thanks Steam for ruining these games for me and pissing me off today!"
19022,Great Game BUY IT
19023,"720 noscoped a chicken, while my throwing knife landed in a, helicopter blowing it up. 10/10"
19024,It got boring really fast :/
19025,"This isn't one of my top CoD's. For starters its completely dead no one plays, P2P hosting, and that makes getting into a good game with good rego is hard."
19026,"One of the best CoD games I think I have ever played. The gameplay is wonderful, heaps of fun 10/10 would play again"
19027,"I would have to say MW2 was the best release IW ever came out with. I never liked the idea of moving onto the more recent titles (black ops, ghosts, mw3, etc.), and I still don't.

Just know: as with most CoD games, any modifications to the client side of the game could poetentially end you up with a [b]VAC ban[/b]. I did - Over 3 years ago, simply to enable that stupid zombie mod I seen everyone hosting time by time. IT requires the console to be opened, and that is a no-no. You WILL get the ban hammer, and you will not be able to play multiplayer.

It can be quite addicting; and I find to be the most advanced and realistic FPS there is out there to date, as it always has been to me. While Other CoD titles that have recently unraveled themselves provide more game modes, you still want to give Modern Warfare 2 a shot. Especially if you don't want to bother spending $60 for Ghosts, have never played a CoD title, and want a little bit of a hint at what it's like."
19028,Fun shoot em up.
19029,"Hackers, tubes.

19030,The game is verry nice but lately there are lots of cheaters....

19035,"The second emplacement in the epic trilogy.

[b]Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2[/b] picks up the story where Modern Warfare left off. In the same genre of singleplayer and multiplayer, as the previous one.

In addition to the [i]updated[/i] graphics engine, Modern Warfare 2 brings an amazing story and impressive character imersion into the story, with [spoiler]a high quantity of plot twists and[/spoiler] explosive moments.

Whether you enjoyed the previous, or not, and even if you hate the Call Of Duty franchise, this is probably the one and only [b][i]YOU MUST BUY[/i][/b]."

19039,"there are many things to recommend this for, namely good choice of weapons and ever evolving skill upgrading system. But EA need to do something about cheaters, because there is no way to get rid of them or ban them somehow. My vote for some one button complaint to be send right away so that decent players are saved from cheatheads.

I am not going to mention graphics, sound etc. The summarised impression I had was very good. I enjoyed playing this game and I have nothing bad to add. Of course thw ""WOW!"" factor was slightly lower that other games I've played. I would give this game an 8/10"
19044,stronk
19045,Full of hackers! Buy at your own risk

19047,this game is amazing its a great fps game and good gameplay

19049,Great game

Wow."
19051,its ok
19052,gotta have this game on OS X platform !!!
19053,Not balanced for lean.
19054,Best shit ever!
19055,very meh.
19056,Its an okay game. Multiplayer is where the main fun is at. Hackers are sometimes a problem overall if you want a good C.O.D but have a semi decent pc I'd recomend this.
19057,"I play 3 years long this game,i like it )"
19058,"This is by far my favorite Call of Duty. Of course there are a bunch of cheaters, but what game on the face of the earth doesn't have cheaters (besides old games)? This game practically revolutionized the Call of Duty experience with the new killstreak system and graphics, and paved a road for the future installments. This was a balanced game, and even when I was losing a match I was having fun. This is a game that can basically keep you playing for a whole weekend. I would definitely reccomend this game."
19059,"one of the best games in Call of Duty series, multiplayer still very much alive in 2014. well spent 25‚Ç¨."
19060,The multi-player is the worst adventure I've ever seen.  Could I get my money back now?
19061,"Infinity Ward's just get out! If the developers can use one, then it assemble driving action, quiet passages and perfectly orchestrated script sequences into an intense experience is. Modern Warfare 2 is an incredibly intense experience. But it could be even better if you could put someone with a mind to the story.

SINGLEPLAYER: 81/100
MULTIPLAYER: 89/100"
19062,this is a great game and slo is any of the COD games love it !!
19063,The best FPS I have ever played!
19064,"This was the first and last COD I ever enjoyed.
Agree or disagree with that statement, I don't care! This was the break through title that started the series into the massive franchise it is today. Most people will also disagree with me on that too and claim that it was the original MW (1) that does this, sadly I disagree, and with good reason, MW2 brought the smoothest NETcode in an online title that I had ever seem from any title that was released at the time. You now have that level of seamless quality for all multiplayer experiences and I believe that COD played a big part in this for the gaming industry.

I will say, I have played most of the other CODs and I have never managed to get that same feeling from them, sadly. I‚Äôll be really honest and found that BF has turned into the game of my choice in the current day, but that‚Äôs another story
"
19065,"Great game, sadly not that many people play it."
19066,It is good but to many hackers I got hack and coudn't see when i would play multiplayer i would see the map on my screen so no more PC games for me I am Just going to play my xbox one
19067,"This was my first major start in video games. Sure, I had played other smaller games as a kid, but this was my first legitimate purchase of a large game. 

I love this game to pieces. I probably have like 500+ hours on my Xbox, and I think I have like 100 or so on my PC. Really great game, I don't care how unbalanced or non-supported it is today.

Definitly trumps and Treyarch games, which just flat out suck. For some reason, it is just so easy to jump in to, and the movements are very smooth, unlike that seen in the Call of Duty's today (of which I refuse to play)

My favorite game, by and large.
I still play once in a full moon, but no one is ever online in game. Lel"
19068,"Short, though intensive SP campaing with over accurate enemies and useless team mates."
19069,episk
19070,"The BEST game of the COD series in my opinion. Great single player ermssive gameplay, and fast pased multiplayer with decent weapon customization."
19071,nice
19072,"Not into the CoD franchise, 5 oppy guns in every game that everyone uses, quick scope shit like someone can do irl, and full of retarded 8 years old. And yeah, i do play battlefield, 10 times over this shit community (not that there arent faggots there..)
"
19073,"This game is Awesome,first person shooter.Its my favourite game,I like the storyline,multiplayer,spec ops,I love this game.
But the price of this game is horible,25 eu for 3 ear or more im not sure of it,its kind of wtf... I pre-order this game but my friend bught this 1 month ago for this horible price....
But Yeah its fucking awesome game :D"

19076,"Fun, compelling game, arguably one of the best of the franchise. The plot seems to have a few holes, but the locations are varied and interesting enough and the action is intense enough to make you not notice for the most part."
19077,"Call of Duty games tend to get a lot of hate. I got this one for free with a graphics card a while ago. After having it sit in my library for a few years, I figured I'd play through the single player campaign. This is a review of that.

This game is total garbage.

A nonsensical story held together by average shooting mechanics riddled down with tons of red goo on your screen.

Here's a plot summary:

Makarov, a Russian, is bad... apparently. So we go undercover, murder a lot of Russians, get killed, start a war, shoot more Russians, free some guy from jail... who fires an EMP at America, go back to finding the bad Russian guy, get betrayed by our commanding officer for no reason, murder tons of Americans and Russians, talk to Russian bad guy who helps us, and then kill a bunch more Americans, then have a stupid knife fight ending with the commanding officer who tells you that he did it basically ""so people enlist in the military"". Roll credits.

I feel like this should all be an elaborate ruse, but I'm pretty sure it's not. Sad.

19085,BEST GAME EVER!! :D
19086,"So many HAX!
"
19087,"Modern Warfare 2 carries the good tradition of its predecessor. The campaign is nonetheless too short, and it feels too inspired to the previous one; on the other side, the multiplayer carries a lot of improvements, and Spec Ops is a well crafted coop mode. If you consider buying for online fun, this is the game that will steal your life for the months to come. If you're up to an unforgettable single player experience you might consider other more lengthy and original titles."
19088,Destroyed my ChildHood 20/10
19089,"A nice game. Petty that is FULL with hackers and dodgy servers.
Also is a nightmare to start. It take ages to connect in multi player."
19090,Probably the best of the Call of Duty series!
19091,"The game itself is good, but the foundation of players it has is horrible, and here is the primary reason: Too much hacking. Every game has a serious, offending hacker that ruins the fun for those who merely want to play the game. They either render themselves invinvible, make themselves capable of firing randomly and killing the entire other team, shoot another player through obviously solid objects such as mountains and hills, and they even warp the game mode (you may select Team Deathmatch, but they will alter it so that you are actually going into Domination or any other mode.) If you really want to play the game, then this is not the option. Just go with Xbox or PS."
19092,"This is probably the #1 Call of Duty game ever made.  I love the multiplayer on this game and have a good 900 hours into it.  This game is actually well built and the multiplayer maps have variety.  The guns actually sound like guns and the game is such a simple design, yet so fun. 9.5/10"
19093,One hell of a game
19094,Steam is fucked up got banned for nothing
19095,Good game
19096,"This game is bad. Very bad. All my pretentious friends told me so, all my normal friends told me so, but with a metacritic score of 86, how bad could it be? I thought while ominous music played in the background.

Pros:
- spunkgargleweewee if you're into that sort of thing
- burly white dudes kill other people with large guns that have military sounding names

Cons:
- frustrating
- levels feel all the same
- the person you're following always moves too slow
- F***ING GRENADES EVERYWHERE WHAT THE F**K!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- is everyone in this game retarded?
- will make you question why you haven't stopped playing yet

That said, it's got good multiplayer."
19097,"this is one of the best games from the modern wrefare series the campaign is about six hours long ( I beat it in 5 on normal)
multiplayer is tons of fun when you dont run into a game with annoying mods or hackers. ( aimbots, wall hacks, double riot shields-.- etc.)"
19098,This game is my childhood and will stay forever in my heart... God bless to the creators.
19099,"This game was the last good Call of Duty.
10/10.
Its just sad how Activision is torturing the franchise"
19100,nice game
19101,"COD MW2 is not good at story and singleplayer but multiplayer and spec ops are extreamly fun to play. I can't recomend to buy it now, because game has been released back in 2009 and servers are pretty empty. 
MW2 Had it's time and left me with good memories."
19102,"Absolutely love this game, best COD I have ever played!"
19103,"MW2 is a good COD game. The only few things that I still don't like about it, is the fact that there are still hacked lobbies and infinity ward is doing nothing about them. Your score will most likely get boosted to max if you get into one of these lobbies ruining the whole process of unlocking things as you rank up. The other sad thing about this game compared to COD4 or MW3 is that there are no dedicated servers. Other than this the game is great. It does have the best quickscoping of any cod. So if quickscoping is your type of skill then you need to play some of it here. :-)"
19104,"921 hours on record for Multiplayer only lol. Need I say more :P Buy it. Let's revive this game. I appreciate how it never had dedicated servers and is hosted by someone in game. This is how the game's online lobbies have survived. People still play and it is a tight community where most people know everyone else by now. Too bad the DLC's never go cheaper, it takes away from people wanting to purchase it now. It'd be a great game to go on a sale and reignite a hype. Id recommend it if you have the money to spend. I have a clan of Hardcore Mosh Players (current players) and we are around 60 of us. The people are still there, just need to add them when you meet them. Please put the DLC's and game on sale so we can get more players again steam. So many great memories, and still more to come. I can't bring myself to uninstall this masterpiece, and dropping nukes never felt so good.

19110,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
19111,Awesome!!!
19112,Great game!!! Would recommend this game to everybody who enjoy to play first person shooters.
19113,Best COD released but its crap now cuz of all hackers
19114,"any bulgarian who play CoD MW2
"
19115,Overrated
19116,"Just like ""The Terminator"" said, this is the last GOOD Call of Duty game ever made (other than World at War). The Single-Player is great, and the Multiplayer WAS good up until a bunch of hackers, campers, & spammers came along and killed it completely. That's why there's barely anyone that plays it anymore. Especially now that Black Ops 2 and that new COD: Ghosts came along. Don't worry though, there are still some people who play this game, just not much!

All in all, this game is worth the money. But mainly for the SP. (in my opinion)

Spec Ops: Meh, i'm not really into this game mode that much..."
19117,Lots of fun
19118,"YES
"
19119,"This game had its glory days, but now the game might aswell be dead.

Currently everyone playing is sup3rl33t360MLGv1rg1nzzxxx, or you enter a hacked lobby and your rank is gone.

"
19120,awesome single player and multiplayer!!!
19121,"The Call Of Duty series has seen better days. With releases like Ghosts, will COD die and be forgotten. Ghosts is TERRIBLE!
But this game, Modern Warfare 2, was and still is THE LAST GOOD CALL OF DUTY GAME! Every game after MW2 was not bad but not good either, except for Black Ops, maybe. 

CAMPAIGN: 7,5/10
The campaign is set 5 years after the events of Modern Warfare. USA is under attack by a new terrorist, Vladmimir Makarov, and of course are YOU the only one who can save USA and the world from World War III.

You play as 4 soldiers: PFC Allen, SGT Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson, PVT James Ramirez and CPT John ""Soap"" MacTavish. ""Roach"" and ""Soap"" are from Task Force 141 and Allen and Ramirez are from the Army Rangers. The missions are different from the TF141 and Ranger missions, which isn't very surprising. The TF141 missions are more stealth missions rather then a full scale war, like the Rangers mission. If I had to choose my favorite Ranger and TF141 missions it has to be ""Cliffhanger"", (TF141) and ""Wolverines!"". (Rangers) 

The story took me about 4 hours to complete on PS3, and I haven't completed it on PC. It consists of three acts, each with about 5-10 missions, in total 15-30 missions. It's a decent number of missions, but it could've been more. 

The set pieces are sometimes great, sometimes not so great, but overall it's good. It's ranging from large cities to oilrigs and prisons. Overall, pretty good.

MULTIPLAYER: 9.5/10
In every COD game, is there a multiplayer feature? YES! This is definitely the best part in the entire game! With loads of unlockable perks, weapons, camos, titles and emblems, THIS IS AWESOME! 

+
- Great quantity of unlockables
- Decent graphics
- Good music

_
- Only 12 players in a private game
- Small maps
- Hillarious but gamebreaking GLITCHES

Overall rating: 8/10
This is still my favorite COD game and will continue to be so. With loads of errors and loads of sucesses, Modern Warfare 2 is the last good Call Of Duty game."
19122,"Three years after its release, I have disovered, this all encomposing first person shooter. Graphic rich enviornments, mixed with intense head-on action, in both 'Free-For-All' and Team based non-stop action. Its no wonder, even after three years, I have no problems finding game lobbies to jump right into. This is a must have."

19124,The best Call of Duty. Everything went to shit after this game. Nice to see people starting to pick it up again.
19125,This And Team Fortress 2 are the WORST games to play on if you are skilled..... False VAC bans .-.

19135,"Awesome game must play game of the year
all call of duty are same in multiplayer just buy one"
19136,"The best Call Of Duty!
This game is very good!"
19137,"One of the best FPS releases of Call of Duty since vanilla (COD1) and COD2. The mechanics of the game are smooth and responsive, while the multiplayer maps are well-designed. The now popular in-game awards system and stat tracker was debuted on this release, which adds a lot of fun and challenge to the usual competition. Unfortunately, it is not unusual to run across blatant multihackers on the public servers. Overall, this title clocks in as one of my favorite shooters- even above the counter strike series."
19138,"Love this game I finished the single player mode in a week:
and I just keep geting better and better every day on multiplayer"

I wish more people would come back and play this game again. Definitely would recommend it, 10/10. This is one of those games where you'll be screaming, sweaty and your heart will be racing #Classic"
19152,Meh
19153,GET IT!
19154,"Short and sweet:
For me, MW2 is still the best Call of Duty game. The grafics of the the new COD's are not better than in MW2. The gameplay is fantastic. The story is good and nice to play.
BUT: multiplayer isnt playable sometimes, especially after 8 pm. at this time it would be a wonder if theres no HACKER or CHEATER in your lobby.
I love the game anyway."
19155,"Introduction

Ok I have a confession to make, I have spent way too much time on this game and this is the reason why I couldn't study for my HSC, people say World of Warcraft is addictive, yeah, right.

Graphics

Graphics are great for the year it came out, nothing mind blowing like Crysis, but appealing to look at.

Sound

Guns sound solid, voice acting is superb, you won't be questioning anything about sound.

Gameplay

Campaign: A fun enjoyable experience, a great tutorial for multiplayer I would say, but of course if you're following the actual story than you'll be pleased too. Really has it's epic action and plot moments.
Multiplayer: Extremely fun, simply too addictive, considering you're a good player of course, if not you'll have a completely different experience, but nonetheless there's a reason this game's multiplayer sucked up 500 hours of my time and ruined my HSC :/

Skill Required

If you've played an FPS before this should be easy, what really matters is the way you approach situations and the custom loadouts you make, all about planning and deception.

Fun Factor

Too much fun, only game I've experienced true addiction, I never want to do that again. I want my 500 hours back and want to spend it on something fruitful like cancer research or charity work.

Overall

It's been a while since Modern Warfare 2 came out, you wont find much players playing Multiplayer now, but in it's prime time man it was golden fun, only buy it now if you are into the Campaign, and if you're lucky try and get some friends to play Multiplayer with you, you won't regret it, much.

Graphics: 7.5/10
Sound: 8/10
Gameplay: 9/10
Skill Required: 6.5/10
Fun Factor: 9.7/10

Overall Rating: 9.5/10"
19156,"8/10. I'd place it higher but I played this right before playing Secrets of the Magic Crystal and that blew this game out of the water. If they added horses and unicorns, this would probably be a better game."
19157,"Pretty cool campaign, considering pretty much no one buys a CoD game for single player.

Multiplayer is FUCKED UP with the obligatory hacking and shit.

A shame really."
19158,awesome
19159,"well its defanitly asome is you like killing shit

19161,"Getting all of the single player achievements was fairly easy. The three last echo bullshit missions were a pita.

Fun to play with friends when your 12-14 years. If I had the chance to go back in time and play with them again, I wouldn't. Fucking 12-14 years old poons whining all the time.
But it was fun at the time. Good Game (with friends)"
19162,Verry Good Game its The Best Call of Duty ive ever played !!!
19163,The best Call of Duty for years!
19164,"Probably one of the best Call of Duty Multiplayer games that currently exist, too bad the PC version does not allow controller without any third-party software.

I however do will recommend this game for people who enjoy messing around, hardcore gaming and senseless killing.
"
19165,"I find this as the best call of duty game ever. A compelling story with plenty of plot twists, to a great multiplayer experience, to the tactics used in special ops, the fun is endless, and I used to spend days playing this game. A definite 10/10, and a candidate for my favorite game ever."
19166,Old but Gold!!
19167,love it!!!
19168,One of the most finely crafted video games to date. IGN gives it a 10/10

19171,"Love MW2

"
19172,"Just thought I'd pick this up again after a few years playing black ops 1+2/MW3/Ghosts....nice to play one of the older versions, its amazing to see how far this game has come along. Must admit I do miss all the overpowered weapons and noobtubers LOL"
19173,5Years. But still good game
19174,Great game.
19175,"more of the same, it is ok but not worth any of the hype it has been given"
19176,"A very well balanced game with a lot of little kids and ""moms getting fucked"""
19177,buy dis game or u no gaemer
19178,"plenty of guns


100/10"
19179,This game is still standing over its predecessors. It's still a good game considering it came from a shit company. This has been my super vague review.
19180,A game that non-Call of Duty players need and Call of Duty players need! This game is action packed with explosions and WAR! This game will blow your shoes off. Would recomend +14 up.
19181,My all time fav when it comes to Call of Duty
19182,Fits ALL your Quick Scoping needs.
19183,"i keep getting hacked and it says lowering level or whatever and when ever i go back on my mini map covers my whole creen can u possably tell me what to do to get rid of it?
"
19184,COD SUCKS!
19185,i love this game got my pc back so going to play it more:)<3
19186,"Shit PC port. Cant alt-tab, cant change my resolution, i get framerate drops all the way down to 5 FPS every 60 or so seconds and i have a good enough PC to run it. The story is ok, I think it's good, but since the PC port is so bad i cant enjoy it. This game is nothing new though, its still the same game when it comes to multiplayer etc. just with a few new weapons and maps. I would not recomend this on PC, buy it on console since iCOD:MW2 runs much more smooth on them."
19187,"Bitch, this is a good game"
19188,"With all its pros and cons, we always go back to this game. Very good specially with friends. Fast and fun action."
19189,Its Call of Duty. Its good. Probably my favorite COD out there. I love the campaign and the ways to play it are endless. It did get a little annoying in multiplayer with all the hackers and people who just spam. I also dislike its lack of realism. I shot a guy and he just exploded. No death scenes. Its also short. You can beat it in 10 hours. Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 Gets a 8.5/10
19190,Best Cod i played on PC
19191,"one of the best cod multiplayer ames ive played,very lively and fun"
19192,"This is probably the last decent game in the COD series, they go downhill rapidly after this with poor lazy ports from the console version."
19193,love it thats all i have to say ;))
19194,Kicks Off right where COD4-MW left off... a Stellar game worth the cash
19195,"Clever and action paced scenarion in single, but very very short, very fast gameplay and a ton of upgrades in multiplayer, if you find it at a good price in steam sales buy it FAST!"

19200,"As a CoD veteran (CoD, CoD:GO, CoD 2, CoD:MW, CoD:WaW), i was VERY disapointed with this game once i played it for the first time. And im still a bit disapointed every time i load it. Activision tried to be a hipster and killed actual servers the thing every FPS so far was OK with. But no... Activision have to make changes, even destroy dedicated servers in order to look like they're doing something out there. That step was a TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING MISTAKE. And unspeakable disgrace. With one move they destroyed MW:2. Still its a great COPY of a game, after a while you can get used to the damn thing."
19201,"IT IS TERRIBLE IT SUCKS DONT BUY IT 
"
19202,the best game i have ever player <3
19203,Awesome!
19204,Very Good Game. Just buy it
19205,"Good game the campaign is amazing and epic. Sure you might say ""He's just a CoD fanboy"" YES I AM A FANBOY AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?! BECAUSE THIS GAME MADE ME ONE! Thats how so good this game is. Sure The newer ones might not be as good as you think. Like Black ops the only reason why I like that game was because the Zombies everything else was boring. This game has eerything good. Good online play and an amazing campaign. The best Call of Duty game i played yet!"
19206,"Rushed out, didnt have anti cheat support that actually worked. Whole Multiplayer seems to have fell apart only 2-3 months after release. No Dedicated Servers (Biggest mistake) Uses an Xbox like Service to match people up for games. Horrible Horrible Horrible."
19207,"Besides the obvious fact that CoD is going straight down in popularity, this game is actually OK. The multiplayer, up until VAC was implimented, was a hackfest, then they managed to cut down on more than half of that. 20$ is a bit pricey for this, but if you have some money to throw around, then this is the game for you."
19208,"This is by far the BEST Call Of Duty game i have ever played, the 2nd best is World At War. Modern Warfare 2 also has an amzing storyline."
19209,shit
19210,MW2 is the best game ;D

19220,"Great game, it's better now that the game is older less hackers"
19221,"Good game with great graphics, the only thing is i have a 2012 video card and the graphics cant be maxed out without lag, cant be my processor cause its definietly fast enough to run this game. I dont know if my graphics card is already maxing out the game from default and the added options just mess up the game? idk. great game though with lots of action."

It would make a good entry into anyones game library. I am glad I got that chance to play this again after all my time spent playing the Xbox version."
19230,"echt empfehlenswert, denke 1150 std sprechen f√ºr sich, au√üerdem will ich xp :D"
19231,"I should preface this with the admittance that I am not a fan of First Person Shooters.  I played the original Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games before the franchises became more focused on special effects, shock value, and multiplayer than they were about storylines; but I had a falling out with the story when $60 games couldn't be expected to offer any more than three hours of enjoyment outside of dealing with the horde of snotty kids online.

I did, however, play through Modern Warfare 1 and 2 as they went on sale, and I was thoroughly impressed.  As you can expect just by looking at the store page, the game is visually stunning.  What you don't see, however, is the storylines (plural) that you follow as Army Rangers and Spec Ops fight to ensure America's continued global dominance amidst emerging threats (MW 1) and to ensure America's survival as all hell breaks loose (MW 2).

While the single player game is challenging (frustratingly so on some parts), the story line only gives you about 5 - 6 hours of gameplay.  What this game offers is continued single player play through challenges outside of the story arc, giving you an alternative to braving random games with complete strangers - who, let's face it, are probably better than you!

All in all, I'd give the game an 8/10."
19232,"Ich habe mw 2 schon l√§nger und finde das mw2 einfach das beste modern warfare ist geile grafik usw .
der MP ist gut gestaltet und macht auch spa√ü die maps sind f√ºr anf√§nger nicht zu schwer und nicht zu leicht .
Ich pers√∂nlich find mw3  ka**** es ist ein schrott spiel weil es nur camper und RPG-noobs gibt und von den hackern will ich garnicht anfangen weil es dort mehr gibt als bei mw 2 
Also mein fazit wenn ihr ein Cod haben wollt was spass macht holt euch mw 2und NICHT mw 3"

19238,"This game has always been my favorite. It has the best graphics, guns, killstreaks, etc. Don't get me started on how much fun this game is. It sucks that no one is playing it though but i would definantly reccomend this game! Rate: 4.5/5"
19239,"This game is just amazing. The perks,weapons,and most importantly the single player. It was just amazing. Jumping on snow mobiles from Russia all the way to the Favelas. A most needed game on your game list. Trust me you will love it.

19244,"Swag, since it's cheap now. Great pick up for you and your friends, if you just wanna get into the fight and play Multiplayer. Best Multiplayer out of the Call of Duty series due to the Customizations upgrade, besides the lack of Dedicated Servers which I give props to the first Modern Warfare.

Over all I recommend this game cause the multiplayer is great with just a small group of 4 friends and the Community is nice besides the constant crying of camping and nade-launchers."
19245,Awesome game worth $20 got it for $15 single player is fun spec ops is also fun multiplayer is fun and addictive but as long as you don't end of in a server full of hackers your good 10/10
19246,good game
19247,meh
19248,Great game Good graphics awesome multiplayer great campaign Good DLCs
19249,I have so many hours this game is ridiculously fun.
19250,"Great game, best COD game to date"
19251,I only play campaigns so if you want to know about multi player I can't help you. This campaign was AWSOME!!!!
19252,"Great Singleplayer, Hacked Multiplayer."
19253,since modern warfare 3 got released the servers will prolly be empty and I mean EMPTY. don't buy
19254,"In my opinion a good game, yet always the same... Played it for a lot and had fun while doing so.. Though cant stand the Call of duty series anymore.. Time for something new!

Added: Zombies in CoD Stay cool :-)"
19255,"Neither the best, nor the worst Call of Duty game.

The single player story is nice and the single player is fun to play. But, of course, its only 6 to 7 hours till its over. 
The multiplayer can be fun, but sometimes youre pretty fucking close to smashing your keyboard. 
This game is like an on-off relationship, you start playing, and if you have a good run, you continue for several hours. But if you are surrounded by idiots and campers, you just rage quit. 
But i think every shooter game is like this, so dont decide by this point. 
If you liked Modern Warfare, i think you should like this one, too. 
And if ou like MW3 then you seem to like every shot you get, so, of course, also this game. 
Have fun :D"
19256,still good to play
19257,"CALL OF DUTY - MODERN WARFARE 2

Call of Duty MW2 is probarly the best game ever made. I've spent thousands of hours playing this game on Xbox and PS. I've been having so much fun with this game, its crazy!

  Trickshotting, Nukes, Sniping, Montages.. I've had so much fun with this game, and im gonna have alot of more fun!

Unfortunatly, its dying out. Hackers, low amount of players are a big problem."
19258,Still a good game to play despite the time.
19259,lol
19260,this game is rally great for  everyone!
19261,"Amazing game.
One of the best CoD's ever created. Graphics are pretty cool, as for game which built on 15-years-old engine.
The story didn't really changed from the first part, but the main bad guy here is General Shepard.
Anyway, this part got the coolest multiplayer mod from all CoD's!
I strongly recommend this game, for the people who wants to try something new (e.g old, but they've never played it before) and for the people, who played only counter strike or any online-shooters before. I think you'll enjoy this one.
My mark: 9"
19262,"Really...Really fun, but #1 cause of vac bans in COD players because hacked lobbies."

19285,"[i] Originally posted on July 17, 2010 [/i]

MW2 contains nothing new. Very similar multiplayer to CoD4 (same formula) and very similar single player to CoD1 (exact same formula). Infinity Ward has proven once again that it has no idea how to innovate. Of course, why should they, with one of the best selling franchises of all time. And if these were all of my concerns, this would still be a pretty damn good game. However they only scratch the surface.

Graphics/Audio/Presentation- The graphics engine for the series has not visibly changed in nature since call of duty 2. Despite what infinity ward says, I have seen no visible innovation or improvement in the engine, with the exception of new skins or slightly higher resolution models. This is because of the limiting hardware of current consoles. The game consequentially looks mediocre at best and is not well optimized on the PC. It runs rather poorly. The cinematic effects of course are rather good, with blood splattering your screen when you are hit and good usage of the first person perspective in cutscenes. The audio is for the most part good, with voice acting being quite good, but the gun sounds are rather tinny and canned. They don't really sound like real guns if you've ever fired one before.

Story- The story is complete trash. Straight up. CoD 4 had a ridiculous premise, but at least it was somewhat coherent and it made some sense. Mw2 is even more over the top and makes NO SENSE AT ALL. no exaggeration, the plot seems to have been written by someone with a penchant for cinematic effects and a complete lack of storytelling ability. I wasn't even sure who I was (or why it mattered) more than half the time. I had to look up several articles online to even get a sense of what the plot was about, but it still doesn't make any sense at all.

Single- The single player gameplay itself is very linear, and really hasn't changed since CoD1. Regenerative health is maybe the only exception. ridiculous amounts of enemies shooting at you, and only you, ineffective allies, chase scenes etc. nothing new here. Exciting, but old and incredibly unrealistic

Multi- The multiplayer is clearly the game's greatest strength. They have taken their addictive FPS/RPG multiplayer leveling system from CoD4 and refined it, and for the most part, it works very well. Unfortunately. The PC version of the multi is incredibly deficient. No dedicated servers, no mod support, no server browser. No choice of which map to play, or any choice. You are matched using P2P technology with other players on a random map in the gamemode of your choosing (what a luxury) and are forced to deal with whoever is selected by the system is host. It is an insult to PC gamers everywhere. In addition, the game costs 60 dollars, and the map packs are 15 bucks each for 4-5 maps, which any decent company would include for free in content updates. Multi is also completely infested with hackers, and VAC is unlikely to do anything about it.

Coop- spec ops is a nice addition for playing with a buddy and can actually be quite challenging at times.

Overall, the game is CoD, through and through, and if you don't mind the thought of the unchanged gameplay, the price tag, the lack of servers, the hackers, and the overpriced map packs, you will have a good time, and get many hours of fun out of this game."
19286,Great game! ;)
19287,lost my social life because of this game. 10/10
19288,Epic game with a very cool Multiplayer. A real classic shoter.
19289,"** IF YOU PLAN ON BUYING THIS GAME, THE PROGRAM ""MW2Config"" IS ESSENTIAL. **

C'mon... it's MW2.

People say the PC version is a butchered port, but I've found it to be just as enjoyable on PC. In my opinion it's even better on PC. It's got more stuff than CoD 4 but less stuff than MW3."
19290,"its fap worthy
"
19291,"Everything a COD game set in the modern age should be.  Interesting SP story, great mission based Co-op and good graphics for its time.  Worth your time and your dime.

It's an FPS built around co-op.  The backstory is detailed and interesting and teamwork is often critical to success.

This game is about co-op.  Other game modes exist but the real fun is reaching objectives with a buddy along.  One thing you shpould remember is that every COD game since has based it's gameplay on this game especially co-op (when there is any.)

That means your best introduction to modern COD games is with Modern Warfare 2."
19292,great game
19293,"Hello, it is that time again for my expert reviewing of all the new and hip modern games. 

Call of duty black ghost 4 is the sequel to everybody's favour shooter, Transporter 3. With new next-gen graphics all from 2007, a deep and compelling story from the greatest man on earth, Uwe boll and the same content you've been wanting since last year, DICE have really stepped up their game in this latest instalment.

When you first start the game, you'll be in the menu, but when you click ""new game"" you're thrown straight into the actions. Right away the opening cutscene will amaze you with life-like visuals and sounds that make you feel like you're right there in the room. After you've skipped through that crap, you finally get to shoot stuff and save the world. At this point I closed the game and uninstalled because violence offends me.

For $90 you can't deny that this is a bargain and you should buy at least 3 copies for yourself and others. A masterful movie with great actors, superb sound, explosions and russians, I give this banana/10. Would bang"
19294,I will allways love this game.
19295,Still love it! :)
19296,really fun game. buy it or else....

19302,I love it. Classic FPS.
19303,It¬¥s better then nothing. Well almost..
19304,By far the best Call Of Duty game ever made!
19305,"What can i say. Masterpiece of it's time. Still the number one CoD game after CoD 2. This game was made by THE infinity ward. It's awesome storyline from original Modern Warfare and multiplayer that shines to this day. Of all FPS games, this one takes the cake with weaponry such as ump and intervention(!).

19306,"The story, the gameplay, the events made this game awesome, if you want to play I suggest you to buy all episodes of Moder Warfare, one of the best gameplayed ever! Call of Duty."

19315,"The game in which the COD-series began to get worse, although I liked the single player campaign very much.
The multiplayer section I really cannot recommend, due to the too hectic nature of the online experience. Everybody just runs around with multiple badass weapons and a loadout of superhuman perks. Just like the wet dream of an 8-year-old. On top of that we see the gunship who comes in when a camper gets a killstreak, and who seems to be able to kill dozens of enemies in or out cover, does not matter whatsoever. BANGBANGBANG I defenately would like that back in the days when I was 8. No sorry this is not modern warfare but a disguised version of DUKE NUKEM"
19316,FUCK YOU INFINITY WARD YOU PIECE OF SHIT
19317,nois
19318,"My favorite [i]Call of Duty,[/i] surprisingly. I remember grabbing this when it came out in 2009 and playing the hell out of it. The campaign, while it is the shortest of the series, is very fun. Makes you want to play level after level and not stop, Roach's levels being my preferred ones as they have the biggest environmental variety (at one level you're fighting the militia in Brazilian slums, and the other you're infiltrating a Russian oil-rig), with a copacetic soundtrack by the one and only [i]Hans Zimmer.[/i]

Spec Ops is a great addition to the game and pleasant to play with a friend, what disappoints me about it though is that most missions are composed of reused campaign maps, which feels lazy, uninspired, and rushed. It is also a shame that you can only play it in co-op by inviting/joining a friend, as there is no matchmaking and servers list to find randoms. You will need a friend if you want to complete every single mission too, as some require two players in order to be played.

This [i]CoD's[/i] multiplayer has in my opinion one of the best map designs of the series, Highrise, Terminal, and Underpass being my favorites. There's a nice balance between long and short range combats for the most part as well. 70 levels, 10 prestiges, and many things to unlock, perks and its pro abilities, attachments, camouflages, weapons, titles, emblems, and it's all addictive to do. Sadly there's likely to be frustration over the weapon balance, since a significant amount of people exploit what the game offers, and create [i]overpowered[/i] combinations. Be aware also that there are no dedicated servers, only matchmaking. This piece is not without flaws, but it is still a joy to play. Nice job Infinity Ward. [b]8.2/10.0[/b]"

19323,"Multiplayer is broken, don't bother. They're not going to fix it any time soon. If you play CoD games solely for the single player campaign, then whatever, but if you play CoD just for the multiplayer, you'll find that you'll enter a hacked lobby and you'll have your UI messed up and that the game will be totally unplayable and it won't matter if you reinstall the game because the problem will persist."
19324,"Great multiplayer
not to shabby campagin
spec ops pretty fun
but its like nothing happened after Call of Duty 4

i say 10/10"
19337,best. game. EVER!!
19338,Just buy the original mw you will have a better experience.
19339,"Let me start off by stating that I play my FPS games on the console. I just love the layout of the controller as opposed to the keyboard/mouse combo. That said I won't play this game online because I'm well aware of the disadvantage us controller wielding players have so this is a review for the spec ops and single player portions of the game. 

The biggest gripe I have, and actually the only one is that there is no native support for the controller so you have to either use the keyboard and mouse or download other drivers and they have a tendency to jump around at times when you try to use the controller. If you're a FPS console guy like me just don't go online with it and you'll be fine and if you're a PC FPS gamer then you're golden. 

The campaign for MW2 is hands down the best in the series. Pretty decent length, they do a very good job of getting you to feel attached to the characters so when something happens to one of them you're feeling the loss of a buddy out there not just some random NPC. The story is deep, the music is excellent and the gameplay is very well done. I'd recommend the game for the campaign alone. 

Spec Ops mode adds a lot of time and replayability to the game. There are 23 missions spread across 5 categories with each mission having a completion grade of 1-3 stars. The more stars you get the better you did and the more difficult missions you can unlock. The missions are based mostly around events that happen in the campaign but there are a few (including my favorite, [i]Hidden[/i]) that are from COD 4. 21 of the 23 missions are single player and 2 of them are co-op.

All in all a great game even without touching multiplayer and still has great replayability. Even after you get all 69 stars in spec ops mode a lot of those missions are still fun to go through. Modern Warfare 2 is a classic and a worthy member of the Call of Duty franchise."
19340,The game is very nice but i wish there wasn't so many hackers in it.
19341,"This is the best Call of Duty game in the franchise, forget all the others after it, and only play the ones before it for that pure nostalgia feeling. 

Have you ever wanted to ""1v1 quickscope"" someone? Well now you can.
Have most FPS games been dissapointing so far? Well not anymore.
Did you want to cum all over your keyboard as a child? Mate, you're about to cum all over the best FPS game ever.

Stop reading this review and go buy this game now, you won't be dissapointed."
19342,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a 2009 first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The game is a sequel of the hit game, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare however it did not live up to the original. In my opinion the franchise started to do very poorly from here. Every COD game started to feel like copies with different maps and guns but the same engine. One of the biggest issues were that if you got a certain amount of kills in a row you can nuke the game and your team wins even if your team was losing and the other team was about to win. In theory it only take the effort of one person to win the round."
19343,"I cant seem to play multiplayer or online
"
19344,I would recommend this game to people who are IW fans and are serious about there Call of Duty Playstyle!!!
19345,"Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2.

I loved this game when it came out and simply ruined any other Call of Duty experience I had because they never reached the height of MW2.

Single Player :
I played this back in 2010 I think and I don't remember much of it , but it was fun for one time play , it is the continuation of the story from MW1 , if you were in the story at that time , you probably will like this too.
Single Player won't prepare for you Multiplayer so no you don't need to finish it to be ready for Multiplayer.

Co-Op :
Same as Single Player , I played this once with a friend and it was fun while it lasted , few mission to take on with a friend and have some fun , it is nice and I wished that the Single Player was more like the Co-OP or atleast if you could play it with a friend like CoD5:World at War.

Multiplayer :
This is where I spent the majority of my time at 2009 , I used to play this game everyday almost the entire day after getting back home from work or University , I was obsessed with the Multiplayer to the point of reading about all the weapons and their damage and what each attachment does.
99.99% of my playtime which you can see is around 1400h is in the Multiplayer , I return to MW2 every year after each release of the new CoD , I have them all from Mw1 to Ghosts and nothing comes close to MW2 , the servers are still active , I can find games even at 5am in the morning.

Pros : Fun , addictive when it works , alot of depth even though most players don't get that deep , All the weapons are amazing and fun and distinctive and each weapon has its unique style and sound , I find the sound of guns and the feel of the guns in this game can't be surpassed by any CoD.

Cons : If you are good enough in this game , you will be called Cheater or Hacker or Scum , sometimes you will be kicked out by the host simply because you are better than him or if he gets pissed off at you , you will occasionally find a cheater in the game that will ruin the match for you , but you can always just leave and join another match(Helps to change mode).
The game lacks Dedicated servers , this game could have been the ultimate Call of Duty if only it had Dedicated servers , a Host leaving mid game can sometimes end the game and it is annoying.

DLC : I wouldn't recommend buying the DLCs at this point , I am sure less people have the DLCs than back in 2009 and back in 2009 I was struggling to find games with good Ping , I can't imagine what it is like now , the game has enough maps without any DLC and they are fun , I put nearly 1400 hours in it without DLCs , I am sure you can find enough fun to last you few hundred hours."

19369,"Easily one of the best shooters ever made. Despite all the controversy Modern Warfare 2 extends the Modern Warfare series to a point where it just couldn't be better, and so it happened. This game should be taken as an example for future shooters, campaign and multiplayer wise.

Must play."
19370,"I can't believe I'm doing this.
Back in the day the game was absolutely fantastic - amazing killstreaks, weapons, maps, so much to do. Today, however, the game is filled with people either exploiting balance issues (grenade launchers + OMA/Scavenger + Danger Close, commando + tac-knife, UMP+SP etc) and hackers, which absolutely ruin the multiplayer experience. If not for it, the game would have been A FUCKING BLAST, but the only blast in it is from explosives.
I can't really recommend it for the campaign either. The gameplay is fantastic, but it gets too chaotic and, to be honest, the entire Rangers arc of the story is pointless IMO. 
One good thing I can say about MW2 is spec-ops mode. While there are not that many missions, they are absolutely fun, plus can be done with a friend.
In short, I really want to recommend MW2. But I can't. There are too many factors ruining the experience. If you really want a BotG CoD, go get Black Ops 2, Ghosts, or even MW3 for that matter."

Only recommending the singleplayer."

19406,The benchmark!
19407,"While Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 might not be able to reach its prequel in terms of fun, it still provides the player with a great multiplayer experience and a suspenseful single-player story which constantly maintains a convenient atmosphere.
If Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is your first Call of Duty game, you are definitely going to have an awesome time playing it and it won't disappoint you."
19408,"One of the best Modern Warfare games i have ever played, the multiplayer is great and the single player was not made in a couple minutes. Yes, it has a couple hackers but over all a very good game!"
19409,"EXTREMELY ADDICTED

19423,"However nowadays the game is dying, this is & will be the best CoD multiplayer experience ever! Intensive campaign and a brand new spec ops. But f*ck those noobtubers and campers. :)
9.5/10"
19424,Best-est.
19425,"The peak of the modern day Call of Duty games. WIthout doubt every game after this just simply did not measure up to the greatness of this game and its predecessor. 

BUT (and this is a big one) it is no longer safe to play on the multiplayer. People have been working for the past couple years and they have figured out a way to get into your computer and destroy it. Heed this warning and DO NOT play this game on multiplayer."

19427,"An amazing game, dispite what battlefield fans might tell you. The story line is amazing and gameplay is fantastic. Sure It's differs from other shooters, but there's nothing wrong with it. Plays like a charm.

Too bad the multiplayer died out somewhat at this point and still lot of hackers out there."
19428,"One of the better call of duty shooter games specially for the campaign and the online fragg fest. Blackops 1 is better but the campaign isn't.


If its on sale buy it if you've never played the game before."
19429,"1v1 me rust, intervention only. Still relevant"
19430,"Exactly 4 years ago I got this game so I wanted to write a quick review based on my previous experiances on this game. Please note that everyone has their own opinion so I am just stating what I feel. 

Firstly the single player story line which links into Modern Warfare 3 is very engaging, at times emotional and even intense. I have enjoyed completing the single player twice and am considering re-playing it very soon. (on the Playstation3 though). Overall if you include the time spent on this game on both the PC and PS3 it will be around 300+ hours which i feel is a well spent amount of time for a game. At this current time sadly with the release of new games this game has become more innactive, especially on the PC and servers are becomming more ""cheat based and hacked""; however from my experience in the past this game has been very enjoyable with it being fun to raise up your rank as well as customise your weapons of choice. With a variety of different game modes and and killstreaks this game really is one to put on the shelf as a modern classic. As I said this review is based entirely upon my own opinion so you all are entitled to your own opinion which may differ from mine. But definately a great game. At this time though it is best getting on the XBox360 or PS3 rather than the PC which has become more innactive due to other game releases over the last 2 years."
19431,"Amazing game, maybe its not an new one but the game is fantastic."
19432,"bulya as game. got bulya stuff on it and all bulya guns. i think its bulya and is like numel in th bum. bulya as game bro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

19433,never use the liberation mod on this game u will be vac banned forever
19434,The best cod
19435,Shit the games so fresh my dog..
19436,"This is in my opinion, the best Call of Duty game. I keep coming back to it."
19437,"You won't find a better single player Call of Duty game around, except maybe Black Ops 2.

Should you buy this? Maybe. See the section on the Multiplayer for the big warning about this game.

This is a great single player game, because it's such a well-rounded experience in general. The gameplay feels sharp and responsive, and incorporates and improves on Call of Duty 4's mechanics. The levels in the story, and the spec-ops bonus missions, are well planned, well-designed, and varied, taking the player all over the globe from South America to the White House, all over Russia and to the Middle East. The plot is far beyond what you would expect from a mil-shooter today, willing to subvert the jingoistic American Police State that these games often build up. It's not Shakespeare, and at times falls to pleasent stupidity, but again, it generally rises above the rest.

The multiplayer.

If you want to buy this game for the multiplayer, DO NOT. This game is quite old now, and several new generations of COD have come and gone. The game also features console-style P2P gaming, so the lack of players has hit the possible pings hard. Half the game modes will be empty, and the other half will be playing against people across the globe. There are mods out there to reinvigorate the multiplayer with servers instead of P2P (rightfully so, as it is insanely adictive otherwise). Look into these options before you buy this game, because to get anything out of MP, you'll need to download one of them."
19438,"lots of fun!, its a really great game keeps you playinng verry addicting"
19439,This Is The Gretest Call of Duty to be released.First off as always the reason why this game still succeds is the gunplay. it's well done and feel as smooth as can be. the story in my opinion is pretty interesting and good enough to keep me going. But the one reason why i still do play is because out of all the cod campaigns i've played every different mission's location where it is set is different from the other and is sweet. spec ops is well done and is greatly fun to try and get a higher score as well as playing it with friends. Multiplayer...it's multiplayer it's pretty generic but generic is a good thing. Out of all i'd give it a 10 out of 10. The only call of duty i would give a perfect score buttttt the online servers suck dick so...if thats added in 7.5 out of 10 For Multiplayer Score.
19440,good game i love it
19441,The best COD game I ever played. Much fun to be had. People will return!
19442,this is the only game Ill play
19443,"Best FPS game for me. A must buy if you're a FPS fan. Great graphics, story and gameplay. The best COD out there although I've never played ghosts or BOPs 2 yet. For me COD MW2 is a must buy. A 9/10"
19444,awesome game
19445,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is always great for the fun, even thou I loved fourdeltaone and prefered to play Modern Warfare 2 in that way I still love the game. It's proberly the game where I like 1v1ing the most, trickshooting, even thou I'm not a trickshot fan, and the game still surprises me from time to time. I would like to thank god for the fov changer, makes the game even more fun. I will highly recommend MW2, It's old but gold. Play it with some friends or put on some music and relax.

6/6"
19446,"Dis is guud, gud gud gud. i think this game is gud cause its gud. lolz so gud"
19447,"Coming from Modern Warfare, this game is a massive upgrade. Almost all systems have been improved upon. For the CoD player, this game is a must."
19448,"I WILL ONLY TALK ABOUT THE MULTIPLAYER PART OF THIS GAME :

A great game ruined by ignorant developers.

This game had a huge potential to be the best Call of Duty ever created. Sadly , the developers cared more about money , not the community. The VAC System is useless considering that cheaters can bypass the VAC-Bans without any problem.
On top of that , deathstreaks , noobtubes and some perks (ex. Last Stand , Commando , etc.) and the nonexistence of dedicated servers made it even worse.

The guns are mostly balanced in my opinion, only a few guns being better than others (UMP , ACR , Spas , Akimbo G18's).
Killstreaks are also really good and satisfying to get.
I can live with the annoying perks but not the way VAC works (or better said , doesn't) and the nonexistence of dedicated servers.

Honestly , I still think this is one of the best Call of Duty games ever created , but I can't reccomend the Steam version of this game."
19449,"this game was terrible, i had it for a weekend and during that time there were so many hackers, also you cant pick what server you want to go to, its all automated."

19462,recommend for qs and ts its fun so bye
19463,i think the best cod there is
19464,"OK, I know that this particular title is a few years old now, but it's still got some swag. The only problem now is finding good games from servers that are ""official"" and not hacked or ""Custom"". The graphics are still pretty good considering the age of the title and gameplay is addicting to say the least when you find the right pals to play with.

If you would like to enjoy some old-school CoD action pick this title up and give it a try!"
19465,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the main game we point the finger at when we look at the negative aspects of Call of Duty, and rightfully so. Before I delve deeper, I would like to start out by addressing the controversy between Call of Duty and Battlefield. While I do prefer Battlefield, I do NOT despise the COD franchise. I had moderate enjoyment with Call of Duty 4, and a blast with Black Ops 2. However, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is easily my least favorite in the franchise. Without further ado, lets dive in.

What does Modern Warfare 2 do wrong? The first place is the campaign. While the story was decent in the game, it was a big disapointment. To no suprise, it is a linear corridoor shooter, as you mow up enemies and stop evil Russian men. Nothing new here, and there is no motivation to play the campaign. The only REAL motive I can think of is if you took alot of enjoyment in COD 4 campaign, and want to see what happens to your favorite characters in the franchise. 

Next we have Spec Ops, which is a spectacular addition to the game. The minigames are superb in this game with great level design, and is a blast with friends. I took alot of enjoyment holding off enemies, mostly due to the replayabilty and freedom of this gamemode, in contrast to the Campaign, which forces you to put rockets on certain targets. 

Finally we have the multiplayer, the heart and soul of the game. And let me tell you, is it horrid. This is not because the game is not ""realistic"" enough - come on, we are in an arcade shooter. It is because mechanics are bad. Yes, they gel well, and the game doesn't feel clunky, but they are just flat out bad design choices. The first issue is create-a-class, which looks very dynamic at first, but essentially boils down to a handful of gun and attachment combos that are overpowered. This makes gunplay boil down not to skill, reaction time, or map knowledge - but who has the best overpowered gun. Same goes for perks and deathstreaks. I would have much more enjoyment in making a class, and finding a setup that suits my playstyle, in contrast to this game.The game also has no emphasis on teamwork, mostly due in part to killstreaks that cater completely towards racking up more kills. Not to mention, hacking in this game is horrid - but that is a whole 'nother story within itself.
 
To conclude, Spec Ops is not worth purchasing this game. While it is fun while it lasts, you will be forced into multiplayer, which is terrible. The games' mechanics only allow a handful of good classes, and that is the only way to do well in the game.  Combined with a lack of emphasis on teamwork, the game becomes a muddled mess more than a competitive arcade shooter. If you want the best experience possible, I would highly reccomend picking up Black Ops 2, which fixes many of the problems addressed above.

19466,This game... This Motherf****ng game... is one the THE BEST GAMES i ever played. I had so much fun playing with all of my friends. that i played it for 519 hours... (and counting) its outdated now but its still worth buying!

Campaign has a amazing story line continuing from CoD4!
Multiplayer is probably one of the best multiplayer modes in Call of Duty history, and in my opinion is 10x better then MW3.
This game is surely the predecessor of Call of Duty 4."

"
19501,it's heaps sick aye
19502,"          I have been a long time fan and avid player of the Call of Duty franchise.  My amateur career in CoD started back with the first release of Call of Duty back in 2003.  Now, ten years later, the franchise is still going strong with the release of CoD: Ghosts.  To date, out of all the CoD games released, I have logged the most hours into MW2.  In my personal opinion, I love this release of the franchise.  From the map selections, to the killstreaks, MW2 is in my top tier for the CoD games.  Even though players say that hackers, cheaters, and modders have ruined MW2, I firmly believe that it is still among one of their best releases.  
          Now, for a FAN BOY moment... I <3 Activision and Infinity Ward!!!!!!!!!!!! but I digress.   I highly recommend CoD: MW2 to anyone looking to enjoy an awesome FPS, and perhaps one day be good enough to hear everyone screaming at you through their mics.  Good luck to you all and have fun with it.

<(o.O<) ^(o.o)^ (>O.o)>... gg"
19503,Good campaign besides the controversial Russian mission. A lot of scripted events but it's alright since the story is so cinematic and short. Spec-Ops is lots of fun and probably awesome in co-op. By the way is the AA12 supposed to empty its magazine in a second? WHOA! Didn't try online.
19504,"Terrible. The story line is weak and short. Multiplayer? LOL Yeah the biggest fail ever. NO dedicated servers, NO kicking/banning, NO choice in what map you play or any other options OTHER then gametype, NO leaning, unbalanced weapons/perks/killstreaks, retarded respawns on overly busy map designs that leads to always being shot in the back by someone respawning or being killed by a camper, cheaters run rampant and are blatant because there is NOTHING you can do about them. Oh maybe VAC will detect the PUBLIC hacks, and ban them a few weeks later...maybe. It just keeps being worse. Lack of a console to tweak settings or even to display your frames per second!!!! Laggy as f*ck, as expected with no dedicated servers. Also what would appear to me, having their employees or simply people they pay to blatantly lie saying how good the game is. All of this for $10 more then PC games go for.....what a rip off."
19505,"Its an Amazing Experience, From Survive on  ""Free to Kill"" to be Teammate on ""Domination"". Show your Skill, earn Experience to end the Warfare!!!!!"

19508,"In its prime MW2 was Amazing, With friends it could of been the best fun you have ever had playing a PC game. But from 2010-2012 many hackers, Quickscopers and noob tubers made the game frustrating. Nowdays the game is still populated decetly and most of the Hackers have moved on to more recent cods. In 2009 i would of highly reccomended this game, But now you would probably not enjoy getting killed over and over if your a lvl 1. If you can find it for a cheap price buy it, if not maybe buy a recent shooter. GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON RIP"

Graphic : 6/10
Gameplay : 8/10
Story : 8.5/10
Overall : 8/10"
19512,"The best MW of the COD franchise to me. The campaign is very intense and has these 'hollywood blockbuster' moments that blow your mind. As every COD, the game is using the same engine as previously but its not ugly, and it didn't bother me that much. The gameplay is very linear and has nothing new to offer. The Multiplayer can get very addictive. You die very quickly (and kill quickly too) and will respawnn many many times during domination or team deathmatch games. The killstreak can get very unbalanced sometimes, with the chopper sapwnkilling in one hit at the base. MW2MP is for the players who like fast action FPS.
Overall, its a good game. Imho, worth a 88 out of 100."
19513,This game gives me wood.
19514,"The nostalgia I get from this game is just ace. Before PC i used to bum off Xbox360 and this game was the social pinnacle of my life at one point. Everyone was playing it.Its such a brilliant game and I don't believe  that any call of duty has beat the genius integrity of MW2. 

Plays different on PC (Obviously)
Getting into a server is instant
Class creation :D

19518,bestes cod ever !!!
19519,1v1 me de_rust2
19520,Best Call of Duty ever made. Where it all really started. Kind of.
19521,"Call of Duty¬Æ: Modern Warfare¬Æ 2 was the last amazing Call of Duty.  The single player was well made, stunning, and replayable.  The Spec-Ops mode is great for friends to Co-op and are still fun to try out on your own.  The multiplayer is great, only real issue is how many people camp and abuse the Noob Tube (tube is only an issue every now and then).  So lets explain the problem with the tube, One Man Army and Scavanger allow the player to have infinite Tube ammo it would have been as simple as a fix as blocking perk 1 when the tube is used.  Overall if you are new to the franchise and haven't played this game, buy this one this is the clearest image of the peak of the series.  I give this game a 97/100."
19522,"Awesome game, in my opinion the best call of duty"
19523,"all it needed was DServers and it would have been great :(

fun while it lasted

19528,"Heyyo, UGH! One of my worst purchases in a while.. friends told me how great this game was, and at first? It was pretty fun.. until people found the cheapest and most broken combos... like the dual 1887 shotguns.. akimbo rifles with grenade launchers and ""slight of hand""... made me rage. This game is so broken."
19529,just another call of duty game! would not recomend playing online due to the fact its packed with hackers!

19533,If you want to play the MP just don't. Most but not all lobbys are hacked. It is really hard to get into a lobby that is not hacked. To me the story is good. There are a desent amount of weapon. Good game. But if you want it due to MP DON'T BUY IT.
19534,This is very fast pace action game. ive spent over 100 hours in this game on the first few day i had it. This game is well worth its money and is highly recommended.
19535,"Too many Hackers...Ruin the game. One hacker gave me hacks, and that is one reason that I got banned from it because some guy gave me hacks while I was in game then reported me for using hacks which I've never used. Now I am VAC banned and can't post a letter so I can't get unvac."

19537,ghost dies. the guy with porn stache kills him. 2/10
19538,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2

Over all I think ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2"" is a good game. It is a first person shooter so that means you play the game like as if you see it through your own eyes. The reason why I like it that way, is it makes you feel like your more in the game! How ever it does not have third person view so that means your not able to see you character's body when your waking, crawling, or sprinting around. You can also a just the settings so if your computer takes a long time to load up the game then you can a just the game to work better for your computer (I think thats always nice to have that option).  In the Main Menu there are three different modes you can choose from, there is ""SPECIAL OPS"", ""CAMPAIGN"", and ""MULTIPLAYER"". Also for 'SPECIAL OPS'', and ""CAMPAIGN"" you can raise or lower your difficulty from easy through hard. Any ways of these modes are really fun to play!

     SPECIAL OPS, are just simple single missions that you can play solo or with a friend. It basicly takes ideas of the missions out of the Campaign and makes a senario out of it which you have to survive traval to point A to point B, to just surviving as long as you can!  theres lots of missions you can play in Special Ops.
     
CAMPAIGN, is good because there is a good plot to it. Although in the campaign you switch characters alot which might make it confuseing to some people. Over all I liked the campaign. 
     
MULTIPLAYER, I like multiplayer because its a good way to socialize with friends and family, I think its very addicting too, because I am always wanting to level up my character to the next level and unlock new items!

 I personally think this is a fun game and I recomend you buy it if your interested in it! That is my conclusion  thank you trayarc for mw2 and dont for get about Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare &
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"
19539,Good game
19540,Excellent game! Great graffics Good story line Perfict for me.
19541,"I think I've put enough time into this game to say that it's the greatest Call of Duty out there. If you're looking for one of the most classic multiplayer games with fast paced action and quick reflexes, this is your buttery manchild. 

This game isn't in your steam library? What the fuck are you doing with your life!?!"
19542,8/10
19543,"Grr.

Ok, functionally this game is excellent. Lots of guns to shoot and lots of things to shoot at. However, the improvements made to these areas come at the price of the story and variety that CoD4 had. The result is a cheesy ""cold war goes hot"" story where the Ruskies invade America that is just not very well done (if you want a good story in that setting, go check out the game World in Conflict). And while there is some of the sneaky funtimes of CoD4 that balanced that game against the intense firefights, this game is almost entirely big firefights. Make up a list of every thing you would expect to see in your typical hollywood action movie, and chances are quite alot of what's on that list is somewhere in this game. This is the sequel CoD4 got, but not the one it deserved.

Oh yeah, and multiplayer's here too. I actually did try that out in this game a bit, but after a while I stopped due to a mix of being terrible at its high-pace and annoyance at having few to no chances to try out the Spec Ops co-op missions which were actually kinda cool.

If the only thing that means anything to you is shooting guns in games and explosions, then you can have fun here. But if you like story to go with it, then this game will dissapoint."
19544,"Spec ops fun, fun campaign, fun multiplayer, fast paced killing, but you may need mw2config so when you join hacked lobbies and get power leveled to level 70, you can reset your progress."
19545,coop mod is realy nice

19547,just the best cod ever!!!!
19548,"I remember how few years back, CODMW2 was released. Some chose to boycott it, others bought it. Some hated it, some loved it. For me personally, having spent few good weeks in a decent COD4 clan, which at its time was a game, where a lot of DFBHD community moved to, I remember CODMW2 being like brick, which destroyed fragile dreams. Suddenly, there were newses about lack of dedicated servers, lack of mods support and suddenly - there was no hope that CODMW2 is ever going to reach heights of COD4 and its community - and if only we were exaggerating it - reality turned out to be even worse. Yes, I'm judging MW2 by the prism of esport gaming - one of my favourite memories were of a time, I spent playing COD4 in clan and then comes MW2 - no mods support meant, no promod. This meant, that all the balancing issues would pop up with high skill esport scene, were never going to be addressed. Lack of dedicated servers meant, there is always going to be at least one person, who can potentially react faster than others. There were DLCs - which at this point in time meant, nobody in esport scene is going to even play these few more maps. And obviously - then there was one of the laziest implementations of VAC, ever. And finally - esport killing FOV, set at ridiculous 65 horizontal degrees. Everything combined, created one laggy mess of a game, full of cheaters, only made worse with near unplayable FOV. It was a mess and luckily esport-wise got nowhere. But even skipping whole esport scene case - casual-wise it wasn't relly that good of a game either. It's just that PC port was so poor, it either made me feel sick due to low FOV... or made me quit, thanks to people shooting using aimbots, wallhacks and a tons of other crap.

Furthermore, at its time, I didn't really like CODMW2 for its singleplayer, either. I remember most of my friends being extremely impressed by its singleplayer campaign, but I found game's heavy hand-holding extremely irritating. If only I knew, this problem is going to infect almost the entire shooter genre... yes, if there is reason for what happened with shooters for the last 4 years - for the existence of atrocities like Aliens: Colonial Marines, Duke Nukem: Forever, Homefront and many others - it's sadly that other developers tried to copy MW2 formula, despite for the fact it does not fit and it would have never fit their games. CODMW2 was pretty much the first military shooter, with such an incredibly scripted singleplayer campaign, where a player is constantly hold by a hand and told what to do and what not to do - where to go. This is where linear shooter ended and scripted shooters started. Admittedly, all credit to MW2 - it still manages to make for some interesting cinematic experience and some action set pieces are really good. It's just a shame, player is so often a viewer of this story instead of a hero.

I'm going to say this - if you don't mind scripting much and being hold by a hand almost the entire game - and if you really want to know how the story develops after COD4 - if you can get MW2 on sale (5‚Ç¨) - you should have a decent fun with it. Don't expect however to play much of a multiplayer - it's essentially dead. For multiplayer - buy good old [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/7940/]Call of Duty 4[/url] or much better PC-wise [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/42700/]Black Ops[/url] or [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/202970/]Black Ops 2[/url]."
19549,Too much fucking shit going on. Its way too fast paced for its own good. (and not in a good way like tribes is fast paced). Feels janky with everything. I can't believe I wasted over a hundred hours on this piece of garbage.
19550,"Well, it's Call of Duty. 

The single player for this game kinda fell short. but it made up with such an excellent multiplayer.

 In my opinion this had the best multiplayer of any COD game. This game was the first to introduce the throwing knife which added a new type of trick shot to the game, as well as the intervention (the best sniper rifle to ever be in a COD game IMO). Quickscoping and silent shots were possible. Very good killstreaks. Just a solid multiplayer through and through.

8/10 (for the multiplayer only)"
19551,Gaaaay
19552,Last great MW game. Everything after is just garbage
19553,Recommend this to everyone. One of my favorite CoD's out there to this day. With me having 100 hours played I am impressed xD 9/10
19554,You can shoot people with guns. A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
19555,"A let down compared to COD Modern Warfare 1 (COD4).
COD4 was so good, it still has people buying new versions of Call of Duty hoping to relive that first reboot again...

I must admit, I do not remember the single player storyline, although I played through it to completion, it was not memorable."
19556,"4 years old but still the best one, rip new infinity ward"
19557,"I'm not going to talk about graphics here, it's COD, it was fairly shiny at release but nothing special, framerate locked to ~90 + standard player.cfg file (use it to modify those ping bars - useful for identifying shitty hosts).
Single player is fairly engaging when played for the first time, although once you play through it for nth time and get all of the intelligence pieces, you can finish the campaign on veteran in roughly 4 hours :)
Coop system is OK, parts of the campaign cut out and given some extra context, interesting implementation of stuff like sentry guns and predator missiles here and there.
Multiplayer which I spent over 700 hours on (lol) is a strong average (lol2), no dedicated servers mean host-based matches with average pings in the 100-150 range that sometimes give you the 'realistic' bullet travel effect, you do get used to it after a week or 2. Prestige system was hacked immediately, if you have a friend with some hacks, just ask him to host a server and get prestige 10 to unlock all weapon slots (only benefit of prestiging, IMO). The incredible amount of lag and shitty lobby management at release made my parents question the existance of god. It has been fixed after time though. 
On a positive note, there are new guns, with much higher level of customizability, but the idea of a shotgun being secodary weapon vs e.g. a pistol gave me mixed feelings (not that I wasn't using one). Perk system has both improvements and flaws, with marathon/lightweight/commando combination being the worst, where enemies on small maps simply run around knifing you from time to time, same goes for One Man Army with GL, tactical insertion and good camping spot -  it's just as annoying.
New killstreaks including the infamous nuke which pretty much makes you a cheater and make everyone leave the lobby is easy to earn with any 'static' (sniping is not camping!, just because you can quick scope, doesn't mean you should) class and a Harrier/Chopper or AC130/Nuke combo. 
I was banned for unknown time period (for""cheating"" - using AK-47 with FMJ on campers) back in 2010, but after installing the game recently I found that I can play again, although the playerbase has dropped significantly since then. 
Lastly, I could recommend this game for anyone who is flexible enough to get over all multiplayer flaws and master all maps to easily own enemies, or wants a few days with a nicely executed campaign and co-op mode.
P.S This was the last COD I have bought, and AlterIW/FourDeltaOne has clearly shown us why (both projects have been closed due to ""copyright infringement"" bullshit)."
19558,"This game is pretty sick, Get it if you have some friends who will commit with you;) <3"
19559,"awesome game, and its fr people who are good strategists and have a mic to boss around with their team"
19560,Good game when you don't end up in a hacked server.
19561,Cod..
19562,No i do not recomment this game in Pc anymore! i have this game many years in multy accounts. Game is 50-60% full of hackers! get it at ps3 or xbox i dunno!
19563,"You wont find a multiplayer match for ages, no one plays anymore (in australia). Used to be good back in the day though."
19564,"Pretty neat game. The single player campaign is nicely made and easy to learn with the training course in the beginning. Love that you can play challenges with your friends. The multiplayer is also nice tho it sucks it's so easy to hack and make modded lobbys. It's too bad there are so many campers and noobtubers. 

I would dare to say this CoD is the father to all newer CoDs. Not much have changed since this game and yet this is the one i love the most.

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ"
19565,A classic.
19566,"I had tons of fun with this game at one point, as you can probably tell by my hours played in Multiplayer. There's no denying it's quite a fun game, well, was a fun game. 

In it's current state (referring to the online) it isn't worth buying. There aren't as many people playing anymore, and you'll probably get caught up in the same two or three lobbies, half of which are modded. 

By the off chance you land yourself in a fresh lobby with no hackers, then you'll still have to deal with an FOV locked at 65, which for many people is just absurd. (You can find a third party launcher than changes the FOV without getting banned by IW, that's what I used for a while). 

At one point this game was teeming with competative, fair players. It used to be one of the only COD games, besides CoD4, with a decent community. Unfortunately, the game now houses boatloads of hackers, modded lobbies, and little incentive to keep playing.

Anyway, great game if you have the patience to ignore these major flaws, but I cannot recommend it anymore in it's current state."
19567,One of the greatest Call of Duty games so far and will always be the best one for me. Every map is fun in this game sadly to find a multiplayer lobby that doesnt have a hacker in it is becoming harder and harder :(
19568,Nice brainless shooter.
19569,the base
19570,"Amazing game. Extreme care of details. Excelent voices, music and special effects sounds.
Fantastic campaign that from time to time still draggs me in to play again and again. The plot is also excellent and the characters still remain sympathetic, persistingly coherent and amazing. 
Black ops extracted from the campaign are also amazing and entretaining. From the whole ""Modern Warfare"" series this game is probably its highest point. There is nothing I don't like about this game. If I could rate it up to 10 stars i would give it 12."
19571,This was the last good COD game in my opinion
19572,"Keep firing, @$$holes!"
19573,"Love it, Love it, LOVE IT! By far, one of my favourite shooter games to date. But there's not too many people playing the game.
"
19574,"Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoD MW2) is the game that ruined Call of Duty Franchise. 

Let's start with singleplayer. Singleplayer and escpecially Co-op missions were still somewhat ok, but singleplayer also had many things that I didn't like. First of all the singleplayer was filled with too many cutscenes. At least I play games to play them and not to watch movies. Of course the plot is important, but too much of cutscenes is just too much. 

Another problem was that the plot was just too ridiculous. This is connected in many ways with with the third problem. The thing that I really liked in previous Call of Duty games and especially in the first Call of Duty game was the feeling of fighting with other soldiers (unlike in most early FPS games, in which you are a lone wolf) or how it was said in the cover of the manual of the very first Call of Duty game: ""No one fights alone"". This no longer applies in CoD MW 2 and the games following it. In CoD MW 2 you no longer fight with large group of fellow soldiers. Instead you fight alone or with only a couple of guys at most.

Now to multiplayer, which was the real disappointment. In the first Call of Duty game the maps were larger and more open but for some ridiculous reason the maps kept getting smaller and had more and more bottle necks as the series progressed. I could somehow cope with that until this game and i might have coped with it still if it had been the only problem, but it wasn't. The main problem that I have with this game are its ridiculous killstreak rewards and killstreak requirements. In CoD 4 the killstreaks were still somewhat acceptable, but CoD MW2 is no longer an FPS game. It is a game of killstreaks rewards. That is just not fun. The CoD games after this one have continued the usage of ridiculous killstreak rewards and because of this I will probably never again buy Call of Duty games. (To be honest, I predicted that this game was going to be horrible, and as a result I didn't buy this game, but instead got it as a gift.) Multiplayer part of MW 2 also suffers from decision to not to have dedicated servers.

Grade for Singleplayer: 6/10
Grade for Multiplayer: 2/10

Edited 26 Nov ember 10:29  to correct annoying typo.
Edited  to change ""the maps were large and open"" to the maps were larger and more open""
Edited 14 January  23:26  to fix a minor typo.
Edited 18 February 21:03 Lack of dedicated servers added."
19575,"""sips monster energy"" back when COD was good..."
19576,"The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has to be one of the best FPS Multiplayer games i ever played.

To start of, i am going to say that MW2 has the coolest looking weapons i have seen.From the ACR Magpul Masada, to the Magnum .357 Revolver.The variety of maps from snow to desert, favela to building roofs.

It is truly a breaktrough for its launch year (2009).Although the way the lobby system works is fine, it could have been updated later to be better.Because maximum player count in a match is 12, i would prefer 18.Also later they did offer 2 packs with maps,and they are awesome (although, again, the price on steam is a bit high for few more maps...).

Taking all in as a rating:
Gameplay : 8/10 ( running could have been faster without the perk and standard maps bigger)
Lobby : 7/10 ( if the lobby doesn't find a game or something isn't right, it kicks you back to menu)
Other : 3/10 (running backround programs like Skype or Team Speak 3 won't interfere with the game, but you can't minimize the game to answer Skype or TS3 if you don't use Ctrl + Alt + Delete.Sometimes even that doesn't work)
Final result : 18/30

Oh yeah, this is my first review."
19577,GHOST C:
19578,"realy nice game even for its age, when it was out is was an better game than ghosts now is!"
19579,Fun
19580,"9/10
Best cod"
19581,"Im sorry to say that this whole franchise died after CoD4:ModernWarfare.  That edition was as classic as CounterStrike. 
Yet they wanted to milk their gamers further.. and further.. and further and here we are 2013 around 6 games later.. 

No soul left in these games anymore."
19582,<3
19583,"I love it, the plot is good, you get good guns and the mm. is good"
19584,"I avoided this noobfest for a long time. I don't like Activision and don't want to support them financially. Along with EA, they are all that's wrong with the gaming industry. Finally, when it was $5 on sale, and I had done my google research to find that you COULD play on dedicated servers thanks to a community made mod. So I gave in and bought it. But then Activision decided that it was not OK for people to play their game on better servers, and shut it down. I should have known better."
19585,"Modern Warfare 2 is a good game, one of the best of it's series following behind CoD Modern Warfare and MW3, It recently has been corrupted with a numerous amount of Hackers, Especially on Multiplayer, With that sucking the fun out of Multiplayer, I give Mw2 a 4/10 stars"
19586,Probably the best $20 I've ever spent. Love this game! Still great just like back in the day!
19587,"Great multiplayer, second greatest COD game right behind COD4 MW1"
19588,"Very similar to CoD MW3. The sucessor of Call of Duty 4. Here is Call of duty: Modern warfare 2.
Modern warfare has console-like servers (as in MW3 and Black ops II), not community servers, which i hate.
There is a mod which lets you play on community servers, and that mod is more active then the official game.
The Sp is fun, special ops (co-op) is fun with a buddy, and multiplayer is fun.
The multiplayer is what most people buy CoD for, so i'll talk about that.
Since the way the servers are, if there is a undected hack, hackers won't be banned.
there's not really a large community on the stock game, and i find the servers to be a bit more laggy then normal games.
Slight of hand + Stopping power + Steady aim with a decent rifle and rapid fire attachment makes a easy OP class.
I had a bit of fun on this game, i prefer CoD4 to it.
"
19589,"Call of Duty MW2 was undoubtly the top of the series - or at least in my honest opinion. The sequel to the award winning MW had to deliver something special. It did. With a great single player (considered it's a FPS, then I'd like to call it great) continuing the events from MW1. Not that I'll spoil these events since it's your task to discover. 

Furthermore MW2 has a ""new"" (at the time it was released it was new) coop. Treyard had their zombies in WAW, so Infinity Ward had to make their own coop, what they made was the so called ""Spec Ops"". It's missions where you have a special objective to do. Either get from A to B fastest, kill all enemies etc etc. It's very fun when you're playing with a friend!

The multiplayer in MW2 was the best COD MP in the series. Adding some ""Kill streaks"" to the game, made it various, and it wasn't only ""shoot'n run"". Now you could call in a ""Predator Missile"", ""Helicopter"" or even a ""Nuke"". The weapons felt balanced, and they had different kinds of maps. 

Sadly the servers are almost empty, and you'll have to wait for eternities for joining one. But when you do, you'll probably think it's quite fun."
19590,"This is one of the best call of duty games to have been released in my opinion. It introduced new features like chosing your own kill streaks. 
The single player campaing is very fun, it continues with the story and characters from modern warfare 1.
The multiplayer is very fun as well. The maps are great and the weapons are fairly balanced. You can have so much fun playing this game's multiplayer.

If you haven't played it already I suggest you do. I have played over 700 hours of multiplayer and it never gets old."
19591,Probably one of the most memorable games that I have ever played.
19592,"This is by far the best and smoothest CoD game that I have played. The gameplay is great, and so is the story. The singleplayer campaign obviously was one of the best at the time. The multiplayer can be great, but what I don't get is why steam doesn't save it when you say... play on another computer. Like I had to reformat my pc, and my multiplayer progress was gone. I hope that was fixed in later games, because I know it happened with the original Modern Warfare game as well... but I didn't have that one on steam. Just regular old CD on the PC. :)

Multiplayer can be great, but can be boring at times too when people hack. I would suggest either getting BFBC2 or if your computer can handle them... BF3 or BF4. They have good stories too, but I mostly play them for the multiplayer that keeps me entertained."
19593,"Everyone may say that the CoD series is complete crap, but as an outsider when started playing this I actually had some fun here. There wasn't as many idiots on the voice chat as I thought there'd be, and after you learn how to play you'll be having lots of fun. I mostly played this with my friends, because otherwise I didn't find it really as fun. Don't be alarmed by the $90 price tag either, just go to a local gaming store and you can pick it up for <$30. It may not be the best shooter ever, but I clocked some good hours with my friends on this, so I'd reccommend it :)"
19594,"The game is fun. Unremarkable and short singleplayer. Fun, but mostly abandoned multiplayer. The multiplayer community is split across a number of map packs. The game still costs a lot because activision is seemingly unwilling to discount it to a reasonable amount.

I would only recommend this game at $5.

I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time."
19595,"Der beste CoD Teil :) 

The best part of Cod :)"
19596,Best CoD
19597,"Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them. I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this. 

CAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):

The campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3

SPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):

The Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.

MULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):

The Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this. 


Conclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision.

Things to be aware of - 

There is no direct controller support for this game. 

If you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there.

MW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you.

This game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.

At the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.

If you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.

There are no words to describe the masterpiece that is Modern Warfare 2. I can safely say that this is the best video game in history, and it will never be surpassed. Magnificent. 10/10, there is just no comparing it to other plebian, simplistic, run of the mill video games. *tips fedora*"

19643,"The once great bastion for fps players to engorge themselves on terrific multiplayer action. Founded on great level design, a robust assortment of guns and perks to form ""builds"" and a somewhat mixed bag community this game will forever be in the hearts of anyone who enjoys fps. That being said, the golden egg that was revealed to gamers everywhere was quickly shat upon by the very hole that created it. IW's complete and utter lack of support and greedy ways lead to the downfall of possibly the best fps thats been on the market. Only a moldy husk remains, full of hackers and people who simply play to break the game and troll others. IW realized they had the fps audience and quickly moved on to produce one abortion after another bastardizing the franchise into something none of us will recognize soon."
19644,"A great FPS with an engaging story. A good way to get into the CoD or MW series. The graphics are nice, too.

19646,"One of my favorites in the cod series. Modern Warfare 2 was the perfect cod earlier in 2009. The Story was so damn good and the feeling playing it overall satisfied many players. Even tho I got banned for using a mod menu in my own lobby, which pollutes my pretty steam profile it's the best classic part I've ever played. I can recommend the story, but the multiplayer is not that much fun, because there are many cheaters nower days. But in my view the numbers of cheaters went a bit back.

Get a nice deal and have fun playing it!"
19647,10/10 child of prophecy trickshots people call you noob if you don't sit your ass tight so they can get dem subsss many optik slowscopes and such. tube is trash and noob weapon and only game that snipers run around and miniguns camp. 10/10 would recommend to ages: 1-120 (121 if you are male) trickshotting is most mlg skill you can perform and my balls have never been bigger before i got this gaem. would buy again. basically only costs some of your college fund (u r ages 8-14 if you buy game or you get ban) so get it now!!
19648,"This is my story.
I've bought this game several months ago and I really enjoyed it untill today!
From (Random date in the beggining of October 2013) untill January 6th 2014, the game was great I really liked it, but today (7th January) in every server I join is either hacked or looses connection. I think today will be the last time I'll play this game. 

Oh, I also forgot to say, that I was level 42, but after a 5 seconds game in a hacked server, I got to level 70!
I want to enjoy the game normally, not getting in a hacked lobby every time I search for a TDM server! These FUCKING hackers ruined my CoD MW2 experience! 
THANK YOU HACKERS!!!

You may see that this review was posted on the 20th October, yes at first I said that this is probably the best CoD ever, but now I understood how much I was wrong :("

19661,"Many might say it is over-rated, I'd say not. This game is awesome! A linear FPS game, with a mix of playing as an army boy who traverse the battlefield shooting other army boys, military-style; or playing as a specialized Task Force, killing enemy in Stealth, breaching doors that has hostages and shooting terrorists in slo-mo, dodging enemies and missile-loaded choppers on a snow-mobile, and more!

Campaign last around 5 hours or so. Replayed once to earn the Veteran achievement.

Spec Ops is nice if you got a co-op partner. For me, it was lagging ALL the time. Took me a while to figure out how to make my NAT type open, in which after that, all the lag is eliminated. Make sure your router's uPnP is enabled.

I never play the multiplayer, no comment on this part.

My score: 9/10 (buy it for the campaign)"
19662,DONT BUY THIS HACKED PIECE OF SH1T. 85% You will end up playing with subhumans. No wonder the sales were good when 1 out of 3 had to buy an new copy to cheat. Buy COD4 or World at War. At least there you wont be put into an position where you bend over and take it like a little b1tch.

The graphics are for a such an old AAA title still okay and with a good 3d vision implication very immersive. Music by Hans Zimmer shows that computer games playing with in the major league of blockbusters. Personally I like MW2 more than MW3 and I start to consider it even better as Black Ops 2... just talking about the Single Player. Overall, I'll give the SP a decent 7,5/10."

Overall, extremely fun game, spec ops is excellent, so is multiplayer and campaign was awesome. Worth buying."

19760,Modern Warfare 2 is another solid addition to the Call of Duty series.  It has a few upgrades to the critically acclaimed Call of Duty: Modern Warfare such as co-op modes and an extremely in-depth perk and equipment system.  The biggest downside however ‚Äì is the lack of dedicated servers.  This change drastically decreases the multiplayer longevity and variability and keeps this game from being worth the normal $20.  However it is still an enjoyable entry in the Call of Duty series worth $10.

19801,THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19802,"This game's campaign basically just drags you through a series of set pieces for 5-6 hours.  Some of those set pieces were interesting and novel enough that I got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of this game my first time through, but I tried going back to this game and couldn't make it through the first act--the complete lack of player agency combined with the sheer ridiculousness of the game's narrative made it impossible for me to derive any sort of enjoyment from the game.  Quite disappointing, because I've replayed the first Modern Warfare game numerous times and enjoyed it quite a lot.

Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer is imbalanced and broken in the way that is hated by people who take the formulaic ADS FPS multiplayer seriously, but I personally like it for exactly the same reasons.  If you are the kind of person who loves blowing up scrubs who rage at you for using the ""noob tube,"" you may enjoy this.  Modern Warfare 2 certainly isn't the only game to let you go all-out with explosives, but Modern Warfare 2 is a Call of Duty game, and for that reason it almost feels like cheating to go online and use the grenade launcher as a primary weapon.  When I'm playing a video game, one of my favorite experiences is the feeling of ""I can't believe I'm getting away with this"" and on some level, Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer delivers on that.  I can't really recommend MW2's multiplayer mode to most people, and I can't say it's a good or even a decent game, but I'm glad that it exists."

Here to set the record straight...

19909,"(I've played Multiplayer for 707 hours, Singleplayer for more than the 5.2 hours stated, I used to play Singleplayer a lot at a friends house, before I got a copy for myself.)

The first game I played seriously online, and a game that (despite it's shortcomings) is one of my all time favorites. I don't think I've ever played a game so seriously on the PC after that.

(I know this isn't a real review, in fact at the time of writing this [2017-10-24] I had already submitted a review with just the text ""Yea..."" [@ the Date 2013-05-02], so I wanted to at least say something more, but a real review I cannot write, because this was such a long time ago that (while I mostly remember it) I do not remember the details enough to make a real review, and besides, I doubt anyone is reading reviews of this game anymore anyway, lol.)

Basically:

* Cons: 
* IWnet.
* Nukes.
* Cheaters/Boosters (Though that is not by the game itself.)
* The whole ""trash-talk"", ""In-your-face"" and ""Look at me, I'm on YouTube making CoD-videos, talking with an uneccessarily loud voice while acting like I never do a bad match because I (naturally) only show the matches/clips where things go great for me""-kind of mentality that seemed to really rise with the dawn of this game, lel.

Pros: 
Everything else...I think."

 The gameplay is excellent and isnt difficult for newcomers to feel overwhelmed.Graphics are superb and level designs are brilliant from a trip through a wartorn Iraq and the slums of Brazil and piloting snow mobiles.

A large range of weapons are avalible for you gun down plenty of enemies from the shotgun,sniper rifles,granade launchers to you're trusty assualt rifle.To conclued this game has its flaws not really the games fault but the multiplayer aspect of it is ruined by hackers and cheaters online that has made many honest gamers just not bother with it which is sad really at least the single player is great.Rating 9.5/10"

The Good
- Singleplayer. Follows on from COD4. Is action packed, features new styles of gameplay, new weapons, gadgets, and a wide variety of playable characters and settings.
- Multiplayer. Although some perks are ""over-powered"" or ""n00bish"", it is generally rewarding and fun.
- Spec Ops. Although limited in variety, it is great co-op fun!
- Soundtrack. Very well crafted and suited for the title.

The Bad
- Graphics. Looking a bit old now, re-using the same game engine.
- Audio Quality. The music is great, but the sound effects are dissapointing.
- Killstreak perks. Rewards players with almost unbeatable weapons (nukes and AC-130's, come on...)

19990,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoD: MW2) is a thrilling sequel to the original modern warfare game from Activision. It expands upon the same elements that made the original so enticing but takes a step backwards in multiplayer for its lack of dedicated servers. Still, CoD fans should rejoice since the game still provides a Michael Bay-inspired single player campaign that continues the story from the original modern warfare. It should be noted that there are two DLC packs that add to the multiplayer experience."

20007,"now is the time for reminiscing, dear readers, so let me hearken back to the heady days of modern warfare 2: multiplayer (not to be confused with modern warfare 2: commit literal terrorism in what might as well be 24 fanfiction)

this game is, was, and will forever be garbage, standing as a monument to the greedy corporate interests of robert 'bobby' kotick and their taint upon the medium. the ad campaign was a comedy of errors, memorable for using a fucking [i]eminem[/i] rap, and then that one stupid grenade spam psa that Bad Company 2 blew them out of the water with. not that any of these goofs really mattered because brand loyalty had all but ensured the twelve billion copies this game sold, but whatever.

multiplayer!... was also garbage, but managed to not be the worst in the series as time marched ever onwards. compared to the first, there was no sense of community with the lack of dedicated server support, boiling gamers down to the roving bands of barbarians many had simply assumed them to be. many would speak ill about the balance but it's something i tend to downplay: they obviously wanted the game to be more caricature than simulation and it's perhaps the one thing I'll hold to mw2's merit: it was a videogame.

that said, I would easily recommend it to any amateur scholars or interested parties as part of a case study on where it all went so [i]horribly, horribly fucking wrong[/i]. there's a lot to unpack here.

oh, there's a plot in the game, too, but aside from captain price blowing up space there's really not much to touch on. it's dull and I've read more compelling self-help pamphlets."

this was something EVERYBODY played, then modern warfare 3 happened, everybody moved to it and MW2 died.

it had something I did like about mutliplayer- and that is sustainability- a sense of progression, even if it is a stupid grind, at least there's clear and obtainable rewards. (too many F2P shooters and thier GODDAMN EXPIRING PARTS, die please.)

after this game, modern warfare went down the damn hill, way down the damn hill."

If you're going to play any game in the newer line of CoD games, it should be this one!"

A review by Richard Valkinsenn.

EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.

---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----

""Rangers lead the way!""

Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious ""No Russian"" mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.

The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.

Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.

Campaign Verdict:
I liked it.

---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----

""Tactical nuke incoming! It's over.""

Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a glorious train wreck.

In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game, which is made worse considering all the good qualities this game has. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.

Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.

Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.

Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.

Multiplayer Verdict:
It could've been much better.

Until next time, this is Richard,
Signing off."

20047,"The singleplayer/co-op are extremely fun, but the multiplayer disgusts me like nothing else. Worst THING I've ever paid money for. I wonder why people still play this online. CoD4 was far better.

- - - EDIT - - -

I revisit this game every now and then to see if it has changed or become any more playable than it was since the last time I played it, and I end up being disappointed every time. I wish I could ask for a refund after putting 300+ hours into this massive steaming pile of crap, but frankly, nothing will ever redeem the amount of hours it had taken away from my life, hoping that THIS time, I will actually have fun with this game - like I did in CoD4.
Nothing will ever redeem the amount of years it took away from my life expectancy due to the frustration I experienced every time I played.

I recently installed this game to take me away from the university stuff, just to turn off my brain for a few minutes (and because CoD4 keeps crashing on my PC for some reason). But honestly, this game makes me wanna return to studying or doing assignments, that's how bad it is. Maybe it's just destiny trying to tell me I should be working on school projects instead of wasting my time on absolute trash like this, I don't know.

Honestly, I just wish I could be banned from this game in order to prevent me from getting nostalgic again.
I genuinely advise everyone to stay as far away from this game as possible. Play CoD4. Have fun. Save yourself the money and the frustration - and for those who are about to get nostalgic: This game sucked hairy donkey balls when it came out, and it's just as bad, if not worse, as what it was after its release. No wonder Battlefield started to become popular after the release of MW2...

It is genuinely the worst fucking game IW had ever released (up until 2009 anyway), and I wish they just stopped making games after CoD4."

20058,"I realized that I hadn't reviewed this game until today. It's so weird. I don't know if it feels timely, but whatever. This is not a review, per se. It's an experience I went through.  

I got this game back in mid-2012. I first joined Steam around 2009, I was very new to PC gaming, and back then, Steam was giving me more problems because I had a hell of a capped internet, and I didn't have a good enough PC to run absolutely anything. Though, I have a soon-to-be 8 years old Steam account, I'd say my PC gaming formally started since 2012. With [i]Saints Row The Third[/i], [i]Team Fortress 2[/i], [i]DotA 2[/i] (which I absolutely hate, and haven't touched it in AGES), and finally, this big guy here. 

What the hell can I say about [b]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2[/b]? Well, recently a buddy of mine joined Steam, and he wanted to see what kinda games he could get so we could play online together. I listed the usual. But, I was very hesitant about recommending this game, because I thought this game was dead. [i]Activision[/i] used to be one of the game developers I looked up to when I was a kid, and now they're a bunch of [b]Call of Duty[/b] a$$ worshippers who are milking that franchise and will never stop at it. But, this conversation we had, well, it made me so curious that just a few hours ago, I installed the multiplayer component for [b]Modern Warfare 2[/b] to see if absolutely anything has changed (and I always expect the worst). Turns out I was somewhat wrong.

I got this weird feeling when I got into a match. My first map was Wasteland. I went through my classes to see which one I should use. I haven't changed my classes in years. The name of my classes still remain the same. I first used the class that's got the ACR with a Red Dot Sight attachment. Felt like feeling butter when you shoot with it. Then later the Silenced UMP with a Beretta M9 with an extended knife attachment. The sound of my submachine gun's bullets when they hit my target are just music to my ears. I eventually switched to the class with the Intervention with an FMJ attachment. I bet I must've looked extremely surprised that I pulled off a quickscope after years of not doing it, especially during an intense firefight. Then I heard the dialogues the player characters keep repeating. I eventually mocked them, too, just like I used to when I used to play this game extensively. And my horrible luck returned, too. I'd hide in cover for a minute, and look around carefully to see if anyone will make a move, but once I get out, some noob-tuber pops up out of nowhere and takes me out with a single tube that doesn't even explode. And I rage. I swear at God for being a d!ck. I swear at the computer for being a d!ck. Then I continue playing until I either smash something in my house (like my water heater switch, which I punched in after a botched Black Ops II match, or the bathroom sink, which I broke in two after another botched Black Ops II). 

But, this time was different... this time I chuckled. This time I smiled at it. And sure, I was a bit disappointed that that happened... but without that, the game would feel like it's missing something. Absolutely everything I experienced back then when I first started out on Steam, it came back today. This feeling, it was complete emotional euphoria. I remember being part of a dumb clan filled with kids below my age. The drama I experienced back then was just cringeworthy. The rage I experienced when I got rekt in this game was like no other. This game gave me anger management issues. But, it also gave me a sense of hope. If you could counter-attack a constant noob-tuber with some tactic, then you can accomplish absolutely anything in life, if you put the effort into it. 

And today, I experienced all of that. And I was freaking happy that I did. This was [b]Call of Duty[/b] when it was [b][i][u]GOOD[/u][/i][/b]. It's like coming to visit a forgotten friend for a cup of tea. It seems pretty stupid to even consider meeting with him, but once you get past that, and just take the chance, you'll find yourself talking about a lifetime worth of stuff with him, and before you even know it, you're on your 5th cup of tea. 

I thought downloading this game would be a waste of time. Surprisingly, and thankfully, it wasn't. I'm glad that my forgotten friend still has some more will to go on, and I hope it stays that way, even if the future for him grows grimmer and grimmer. From now, I'm going to spend at least a bit of my time with him. If he goes away, then I'll be there for him. It's the least I could do for all the weird experiences he's given me when I first started out. 

In short, if you plan to buy the game, hell, why not. Maybe what we could all do is buy the game, increase the player base, and revive it. You don't have to buy the ""new"" shit. Maybe public matches will be a pain because there are usually hackers in this game (I haven't run into one yet). But, it's a whole lot better than flying in jetpacks, or supporting an installment that apparently craps on the very history of World War II, and costs more than a month's worth of food.

[b][u]Edit[/u][/b]: Huh, I guess I did post it, but meh. I don't even remember what I said about it. Well, you got a better review right here, regardless."

20071,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (Singleplayer + Co-Operative + Multiplayer) - 7/10
NOTE: The multiplayer aspect of this game is dying, so keep this in mind.
If you are buying for singleplayer and co-operative on it's own, which is quite doubtful, keep in mind this game will only provide so much content. The singleplayer is repetitive, short and lacking, while the co-op requires a dedicated person to finish the challenging, and often irritating, nature of the missions. 
I would ONLY recommend this if you have friends that are willing to play with you, and you are also interested in the multiplayer (which requires friends as well, as the community is dying). 

Scoring:
-1 for lack of graphics support (FOV, fullscreen windowed, etc)
-1 for lack of dedicated server support and dying community
-1 for pricing of content (lacking singleplayer and co-op content)

Graphics: The game doesn't look horrible and it runs on almost any PC you can find. The game supports 1920x1080, various levels of detail, 4x AA and other small adjustments. 
The game does NOT support full screen windowed for multi-monitor ease of use.
The game does NOT support FOV adjustments, or high level graphical changes.

Singleplayer: The sequel of Call of Duty 4 or Modern Warfare 1 (and prequel to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3), the game continues where you left of in COD4. I shall not go into detail of the singleplayer story, as that would result in those that haven't played having the experience spoiled. The singleplayer is fairly straightforward. Kill a bunch of enemies, press a bunch of buttons in sync with what the game says, and watch the cut scenes. The game isn't that challenging, with the singleplayer aspect taking around about 10-15 hours to complete on veteran (the hardest game difficulty) depending on your skill level. To expand gameplay amount the game has achievements scattered through singleplayer and co-op, which include finding a bunch of hidden items, passing certain missions at certain difficulties, and various other challenges such as killing chickens quickly. The singleplayer, while it may immerse some, is one of the game's weak point, with it being completed quickly and without much trouble. 

Co-operative Play: You play with one other player, in which one of you hosts and you choose out of three difficulty levels, which grant you stars; 1 for easy, 2 for normal, 3 for veteran. In total there are 69 stars in all, granted by completing all 23 challenges laid out before you and your partner. Most of the levels are similar to singleplayer missions, but these can be quite interesting with two people as it changes the challenges for two people. Included in the 23 challenges are time trials, elimination of enemies, races, and stealthy missions, among others. Despite the limited amount of levels in this game area, the missions given to the party involved is quite difficult and you'll be spending several days trying to discover the most efficient way of beating the game.

Multiplayer: This is Call of Duty's main focus, multiplayer. The game starts you out at level 1 with a set of predefined classes to get you to learn the basics first. Custom classes allow you to modify your character setup the way you want it, allowing you to customise weapons to your playstyle. This game has various unlocks as a result of using weapons and completing in game challenges, and these may be beneficial to players. The multiplayer scene contains no dedicated servers, and as a result you will often run into servers that give horrible ping, as a result of the low amount of players in the game search pool. Find a group of friends that live fairly close to you (chances are if they are in the same country you'll still get great ping) and host a game between yourself in either private or try to create a lobby as a big party. The multiplayer contains no Steam achievements, although connection through game lobbies work pretty well through the Steam friends list. The multiplayer can be entertaining if you find a reliable, low ping lobby with a bunch of players that aren't 10."

""Matchmaking, no dedicated servers, and no anti-cheat system besides VAC which was designed to go hand-in-hand with dedicated servers.""
""You're getting a raise!"""
20075,"Jeder der CoD mag, sollte dieses unbedingt besitzen !
Ich habe (fast) alle CoD's aber MW1 bleibt das beste, aber dieses kommt direkt danach an die 2. Stelle. Leider h√§tte ich von der Kampagne mehr erwartet.. wenn ich ehrlich bin war sie ziemlich "" ausgelutscht "" ,innerhalb von 3 Stunden hatte ich sie durch... aber der Multiplayer ist Klasse! Leider gibt es viele Hacker..
Von daher ein 8 von 10 Punkten."

20085,"Today's Review: Call of Duty (6) Modern Warfare 2

There are several things to say about this game as the amazing driven narrative storyline, the incredible graphics, the intense action, the heartpounding moments (such as the ""No Russian"" mission), anyway there's A LOT to say about this game. One of the reasons i made this review is to add myself to the enormous amount of ppl that said that COD should have ended with this game and the franchise would be saved, instead activision and infinity ward choose to push their luck 2 far ending with a mediocre game like COD MW3 and the absolutly hideos COD Ghosts, yeah they did it and i hope they regreet it cause the first one was pretty enjoyable, at least decent, but ghosts was one of the worst games ever made (and with the budget they had that's an insult) but let's go back in time to MW2, right here we have all the strong points in a FPS game, it's been said tho that the game itself was a mod of COD 4 that activision stole from a modder and made a story to actually sell it as a game, witch i believe is true, but for the facts we're given the game it's awesome in any posible way, it's stronlgy recommended and if you never play a COD before, play this and Black Ops 1 and stop right there, you will thank me.

Metascore 97/100"

20088,"Where as some might call this type of game ""SpunkGargleWeeWee"" I actually enjoyed this one a lot. Sure the story is not fantastic, but it has atmosphere coming out of the wazoo, the productions values are second to none and the gameplay, while familiar, is still thoughly enjoyable. 

Short, but sweet (6 hours of single player mission is enough for me)  it's like playing a Hollywood blockbuster, and sometimes that is not really a bad thing.

Plus a special note on the end credits which are very well done in an original way."
20089,This a very nice game
20090,"I recommend this game,amazing spec ops misions,a lot of action and more."
20091,One of the best FPS games I've played.
20092,really good game aslong as u got a good pc and you dont get banned for no reson like i did D:
20093,"Continueing from the first Modern Warfare, shit is really hitting the fan when the world goes fucking nuts! The story is good in my opinion but in this instalment, they went overboard with the explosions, actions and the like. Sometimes so much that they have to repeat a move from a few chapters before. And that makes me slightly underwhelmed. Still a good story and nice if you want to feel like being in an action movie."

Not much to say about MW2. The graphics are improved from Modern Warfare 1, Campaign was decent, same goes with Spec Ops. Multiplayer has more and new tweaks to the gameplay, but a lot of cheaters still exists in this game. Not much people playing this game as expected since its getting old now, but it would be better if they fix the rest of the bugs instead of abandoning the whole game and let the cheaters/glitchers ruin the game. The price could be much cheaper but its Activision so I wouldn't expect them to lower the price from $90 to $50 or less in my region."

[h1]Action[/h1]

In its prime MW2 was amazing, with friends it could of been the best fun you have ever had playing a PC game. Single player was epic and awesome, never got repetitive in a single run although not as replayable as some other shooters.

The Spec Ops mode was a brilliant idea. Yet again, very challenging and innovative. Great fun if you and your buddy want to sit down and play.

Multiplayer isn't really special but it also a great deal of fun, too bad now days it's mostly filled with hackers.  In 2009 i would of highly reccomended this game, but now you would probably not enjoy getting killed over and over by cheaters. Spent a lot of time playing it."

20297,"Despite all of the negative opinions I have about the sell-out AAA franchise that is Call of Duty, I have enjoyed all of the MW Single player campaigns. Modern Warfare 2 does lack in the field of a lasting story that captivates you and makes for an unforgettable game. This title will unfortunately do none of that, but the way the game places you in thrilling moments and makes you feel like your contributions to the missions are noteworthy makes it feel very cinematic. The graphics are very polished for its time and the engine is very optimized for great performance.  The single player campaign only takes about 3-5 hours, but those 3-5 hours for me were very much enjoyed.  If you are thinking of buying this completely for a single player experience then it might not be a smart buy.  The multiplayer is almost dead, as of about 4 months ago, it took about 20 minutes to find a game sometimes, and with no dedicated server support, that is unlikely to change."
20298,"I like to be somewhat aware of what's going on in gaming, and this is the biggest series of them all, but the premise of this is beyond stupid. Not to mention it's like a ride at a theme park - lots to look at, but just keep running..."

20301,"The campaign is even more bombastic than CoD4 story-wise. Still fun, though short at 5 hours. Spec-Ops mode is fun and challenging on veteran difficulty as long as the most social aspect of your life isn't masterbating vigorously at 4AM."

A major complaint I have is the friendly NPC's that help you on your missions.  These guys suck and provide slim to none for help, but that's not without saying the game wasn't difficult.  I died a lot.  Half the time I couldn't see my enemy and the other 1/2 I'd walk into an ambush.  Great fun and ran flawlessly on my rig.  Didn't get a chance to play MP."

20323,"A great Call of Duty game with lots of replay value in it, thanks to the Spec Ops and Multiplayer modes, this game is a 3-on-1 package, offering a lot with a decent price. 

Modern Warfare 2 has stunning visuals, with the music composed by Hans Zimmer making the game's soundtrack so enjoyable, the single player might become one of the options, along with the addicting multiplayer, to buy this game! The already-perfect Create-a-Class, that defined Call of Duty's gameplay since CoD 4 also makes a return in multiplayer, with more guns, perks and killstreaks to choose from.

Unfortunately, due to the lack of dedicated servers and the majority of people focusing only on the latest Call of Duty titles, you will have a hard time connecting to online matches instantly. For that, Four-Delta-One offers a Dedicated Server mod for those, who want a fluid, seemless online experience with no delays in joining what-so-ever. Keep in mind, though, that Valve's VAC Protection will not work in this matter, so you should download this mod at your own risk (don't worry, there's no viruses in this mod). 
Still, as long as you have friends playing this game, the fun never stops on your end!"

Welche f√ºr ihre packende Story und bei teil 1 und 2 noch zu der Erscheinungszeit ""Herausragenden"" Grafik was sich beim dritten Teil durch den Konkurenten ""Battlefield 3"" nicht mehr sagen l√§sst. Kurz gesagt ist Modern Warfare 2 eins meiner Lieblingsspiele, da es mich durch die packende Story einfach √ºberzeugt hat. Multiplayer hat das Spiel auch etwas aber durch Waffen die einfach aus der breiten Masse herausstechen also sogenannte ""Overpowered"" Waffen oder kurz ""OP"" Waffen ist das Spiel einfach unausgeglichen was aber nicht so sehr erkennbar ist wie im Nachfolgerteil Modern Warfare 3. Alles in allem eine klare Kaufempfehlung von mir!"

- Groundbreaking multiplayer (except for the hackers)

20381,"It was good back in winter 2009.. sadly the community ruined the game with all sorts of tweaks to the balanced game, such as infinite grenade launcher ammo using the OMA trick or even running around knifing. Worst of all maybe - quickscoping and trickshotting, worst things that happened in history of mankind.. even worse than Twilight (Yes, I am that serious). The problem is not only in the community, however. It's IW's fault as well for not patching up the constant issues and I'd give a perfectly good example here - Team Fortress 2. Patches and fixes are issued 2-3 times a week and are ~4-10 MB size which is basically nothing ! 

Around 3000 people play this game daily and you might think that's not a pretty low number but considering about 2900 of them are playing TDM which is basically pointless run-n-gun and then spawn rape until they switch gamemode. About 90 of the remaining people are on S&D where they set-up killcams and trickshots 'cause it never got boring and it's so 1337"

MW2 is a very good shooter with dynamic campaign and good multiplayer with quite big amount of guns, accessories, camouflages, ranks and achievements to unlock. It has it's cons - mostly a poor destruction of environment model and too small maps but it's stil worth of playing.

20466,"5 years after the events of CoD MW, the ultranationalists in Russia secured the power, through legal ways. However, while the moderate wing is trying to preserve the stability and the relationships with other countries, a special team, with John McTavish at its head, is trying to retrieve an important piece of technology in Russia. But when an old foe is provoking a Russian-American war, it's up to McTavish and his team to prove that a terrorist from Russia is behind this attack, though there is also a traitor in their ranks. Besides, during the war, a Private is fighting in Pennsylvania and in Washington to repel the Russian Army, trying to avenge the death of those killed by the old foe - though they're not aware of that.

You take the role of a mole, Joseph Allen, that will be one of the factors in the war though he didn't know that he was used for that purpose, of Roach, a member of McTavish's team, during the quest of finding any tie to the terrorist Vladimir Makarov, of a soldier, whose name is Ramirez if my memory serves well, that fights for USA's liberty after the wrongful invasion of Russia and of Soap, the hero from the previous game who will reveal himself as a familiar face for the player.

Anyway, you need to play MW to understand why there is a war between Makarov and an American General, though the confirmation happens in the sequel. Anyway, between these points of view, you have the American soldier that isn't even aware of the plot, the mole that would like to explain the events but can't because well... he can't, the team searching for proofs that will wash USA's name from the affirmation that they're behind the attack. None are from the Russian's side, though the moderate wing doesn't know about Makarov's doing and that they were really reluctant to declare the war, and that seeing the story through Makarov's mind would be a long descent into a mad mind.

The gameplay is still the same as COD: you shoot, you take cover, you avoid dying, you have no respite because of the enemies or the type of enemies that are harder to kill with these armors, you direct missiles to the ground, you have timed passages, you drive vehicles.... everything of that without having time to sight as the gameplay is still nervous as hell.

However, apart the campaign, you have also missions to do in co-op (or alone), with different difficulties, like for the solo mode. And you have also a multiplayer mode, though I have to admit that I didn't play it, as I'm not interested in it.

The graphics are also quite good, for that, I must say that I'm never deceived by that series. Even the little part in space is quite interesting. Anyway, fighting for the White House is a nice experience, and it's by night!

But what I prefer in Call of Duty, it's the soundtrack. These tracks are really marvellous and fitting to the dramatic war inside.

So, yeah, I don't know if the CoD that followed are as good as Modern Warfare or the WWII-era. But I know something: Modern Warfare 2 is a great sequel and a great game."

It is clearly superior to any BO entry or Infinite Advanced crap. The only bad thing about this game is that the player count is dwindling due to the game being ~8 years old + no dedicated servers. 

Most guns are OP, most killstreaks are OP, all the maps are really well designed (except for Derail which is surely not a 6v6 map). Hit rego is really predictable and consistent in this game which is severely lacking in all the newer entries.


Also, for singleplayer get COD 4, for multiplayer get MW2."

"
20516,"Back when CoD used to be a fun, innovative shooter franchise that everyone loved to play. Nowadays, its just the same shit over and over without real improvements in graphics or gameplay. This game was  a milestone in the shooter genre, I would say. It was the first game that featured customizable killstreaks and brought in other very solid game mechanics aswell. Sure, it had its flaws(the spam of explosives,some weapons) but all in all, this game should change the franchise for ever and lay the path for future games. However, there is one horrible thing that was also ""invented"" with this game, the 12-year old quickscopers that called themselves pro and also whole quickscope-clans such as FaZe. Its like a virus, from which the franchise never recovered after. Worse even, it established itself in the Internet and among the developers and today, this franchise is nothing but a quickscoper-killstreak-spam.

As much as I love this game, I wouldn't recommend buying this anymore, simply because it's as good as dead, with the occasional lobby filled with cheaters still playing. Even programs such as 4d1 or Reapz are either dead or filled with cheaters aswell. Nice to have played this game while it was still alive. If you havent played this to date, you truly missed out a chance to play a great game."

At least COD BO3 actually changes the multiplayer by ripping off titan fall, but at lease it isn't the exact same game as a previous COD game.

20557,"Awesometacular sequel of a Great game!!!)
My Score - 9,5"
20558,"In 2007, CoD:MW (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare) was released into a community that has a seemingly insatiable lust for more shooter action. They weren't just given another shooter, they were given a game that really pushed the genre considerably. Amazing single player campaign and adrenaline-pumped, fast-paced multiplayer action with perks and weapon sets set the new standard on how these FPS's are done. It left it's mark on gaming as a whole, so a sequel was inevitable and gamers couldn't wait. In fact - according to an eye-witness who works at my local Game Stop - MW2 ""...became the best-selling game in history before it was even released"", all being pre-orders (of course, #1 sellers are subject to change). Imagine their dissapointment when they got this...

Plot 1/10

..was so convoluted, I can't tell you what it was. Everybody wants everybody dead except the protagonists, and the only solution is...killing everybody. It's a movie written by Michael Bay. That's all I have to say about the plot without spoiling it. If you don't care (which you shouldn't), highlight this big, black box. [spoiler] You meet Soap in the third-person, but it's so akward and out of his character to hear him talk. Then when you get back to playing as him, he stops talking again. For the main character of the first game being linked into the second game, he's just so seemed; so tacked-on and uninteresting. All the characters from the last game are ""magically"" back too, despite being shot in the back of the head with Desert Eagles. Captain Price is back, but his acting and dialogue couldn't be more out of character. He went from rough, clever, and a cold sense of humor, to this...My Little Pony....thing. He's overly polite with no backbone. Imagine Mufasa suddenly with the mentality of Patrick Star, and you're not far off. Further, everytime I hopped onto an escape vehicle, I knew someone was going to shoot me because it happens like 4 times. When General Shepard reveals himself as the bad guy, it wasn't exciting. It was met with a loud YAAAWN. The twist is where the game's story slips into a void like a balloon into a hurricane. The player also ""dies"" too much. Not in gameplay, but more like a scripted event/cutscene thing. Once again, *yawn*. The only intriguing part is when the EMP wipes out most of America's power. You and your team navigate a deathly-silent ghost town. It's eerie and very realistic; the best part of the game. [/spoiler] The ending also plays out like every other cutscene in the game: ""Good job, now let's carry you off and tell you who the kill nex-"" CREDITS; THAR'LL BE A SEEQUEL!

Graphics/Sound 8/10

I'll put these in the same category because I don't have much to say about them. MW2's sound and visuals are everything we expect from the series: excellent. The guns, the dust, the lighting, character models are all beautiful, and guns, tanks, explosions all sound great, too; so why an 8/10? Attentive gamers will notice that a majority of this game's voice cast is from Mass Effect. In fact, several things were just ""taken"" from Mass Effect. For one thing, your CO's voice is the voice of Captain Anderson, and the voice of the general is the voice of Admiral Hackett. Oh, and the general's name? Sheperd.
There's nothing wrong with being inspired, but I call this a lazy, rip off. Infinity Ward wasn't even trying. Maybe I'm just being picky, but this really rubbed me wrong despite Keith David's long career as voice actor for military-esque media.

Gameplay 5/10

Finally, gamers are starting to see the light with the release of CoD:Ghosts. It's the same. Darn. Game. Same rail-shooter scenes, same set pieces, same ""set bomb and run away"" scene, same door breaching scene, same, same, same. We've been playing the same game since the original Call of Duty in 2003 and before that with the Medal of Honor series. It's been 11 years of the same game. It's time for CoD to die. You run forward, you kill the next thing that moves, and steadily march to the credit roll. Everything about it is so banal; boring to the point of painful. The graphics and sounds aren't enough to mask the bad gameplay and story. A pretty package doesn't make the bad contents good. You've played CoD before. Enough said.

Multiplayer also went downhill with unbalanced weapons and killstreak abilities that broke the game entirely. When you get 3 kills in one life, you get a UAV that reveals all enemies on the radar. However, these streak rewards stacked with one another, so you use the UAV to get a few more kills, and get a chopper. The chopper automatically gets you 5 more kills giving you an AC-130 gunship. Use THAT for a few more kills, you get a nuke that ends the game instantly. Sounds pretty ambitious on pen and paper, but in game it means: first to a 3 kill streak WINS. Hackers also had their way with the game and Infinity Ward/Treyarch/Activision or all three refused to do anything about it. I've heard rumors that the same hacks that worked on MW2 also worked on MW3 and Black Ops. Watching this trend, I believe it.

 If you want an example of customer service done RIGHT, let's ask Valve. Some time ago, Steam was glitching up and improperly banning players from accessing MW2. Gabe Newell wrote a personal apology to these gamers, and offered them a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2). While that was generous and very polite, that might have been a bad idea for the poor people that play L4D2, because all the teenage @***holes from this game are now trolling the L4D2 community (as if that game wasn't bad enough.)

The Verdict

Visually, there's little to complain about. MW2 is very realistic by sight and by sound. Some of the settings are creepy with ash blotting out the sun and smoke rising from decimated vehicles and climbing corpses to escape combat. The whole world is going crazy, but they couldn't make the player care less. Traversing the beautiful world is an uphill hike to the credits. Yearly releases also means the community will be widely divided and chopped thinner and thinner with each release, so there's no point in trying to play MP. MW2 is big pass. Maybe get it for 5 bucks and beat it once. Final score: 3/10 Almost no reason to buy it."

20581,"So much nostalgia thinking of this game. Back when there were no snowflakes, political correctness crap and when nobody got triggered but any sensible topic. It was the total opposite, you got insulted by squeakers from all sides (high octane and philisophical argumentsv in lobbies, everyone worked for Microsoft, toxicity everywhere, got insulting if you were hosting the match). A wonderful multiplayer experience.

Everyhting about this game screams over the top and overpowered. The campaign and co-op were explosive fun and highly entertaining. The multiplayer was unbalanced, everything was overpowered like killstreaks, guns, noobtubing but those elements made it so memorable. Shame there weren't any dedicated servers.

MW2 is an unbalanced gem that will have a special place in my online gaming experience. It also made great meme content."

20583,"The game of our generation, sets the standard for all strategy-based combat as well as thought provoking gameplay. 9.875 out of 10."
20584,Most addictive online multiplayer everrrrr.
20585,"You shoot guys, and have stuff happen to you all without saying a word. Yeah you gunt a few times, but your opinion is never voiced and no one seems to care about that.

Mutliplayer can be fun at times and very very very aggrovating at others. If you're new to the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare scene, just skip the others and pick up MW3, you're not going to miss anything from the first 3 Call of Duty Games."
20586,Strongly Recommended!
20587,"A good sequel to Modern Warfare I in terms of singleplayer but when it comes down to multiplayer I'd say stay away, too many hackers and no dedicated servers.

Positive things 

- Solid Singleplayer Campaign
- New weapons (Always a good thing)
- Special Missions (Or whatever they're called in MW2)

Negative things

- No dedicated servers
- Hackers

Basically if you're looking into MW2 for the campaign then yes I recommend it but if you wanna play online I say you'd better off with a another game."
20588,its AWESOME
20589,Great Game
20590,Affengeil!
20591,"Well DVD Box says everything 'The BEST-SELLING First Person Action Game of ALL-TIME

Edit 4/7/2017: The Multiplayer is infested with hackers,tryharders,trickshoters and the toxic immature community, making public matchmaking really annoying.And this is quite bad because it's defently one of the Best in the series if not [b][u]The[/u][/b] Best(Regarding Singleplayer,Co-Op & Multiplayer).I recommend going for a newer title or a different franchise to be honest.They simply stopped paying attention to their games,their support is completely off and now even VAC has abandoned it to its fate.

I'm not changing the review from Recommended to Not Recommended because it's not the game's fault,but rather the whole facts that lead it to this point."

Infinity Ward have injected a mammoth dose of adrenaline into its pituitary gland; the gameplay is indefatigably intense and the set pieces are stupendous. Every mission is exciting and memorable, dispelling any notion that the first entry was merely a flash in the pan.

This is a tempestuous sequel that raises all the stakes.

Die Story ist wirklich gut inszeniert, man f√ºhlt quasi mit, was den Protagonisten widerf√§hrt und ist mit Leib und Seele dabei, wenn es dem Oberb√∂sewicht an den Kragen geht.

Einzig und allein die Gewaltdarstellungen halte ich f√ºr etwas √ºbertrieben, das zum einen und zum anderen, es sind leider immer dieselben, die hier als Zentrum der b√∂sen Macht dargestellt werden."

20680,"MW2, well.... MW2 is a game that is known to almost any gamer, because it was a sequal to a great game COD:MW. The singpleplayer mode is really good when you play it for the first time. The second time i tryed to play it, it was rough for me and i had to convince myself to play SP. The story was great and was fun to see for the first time, there were amazing parts where you worked as a spy of the government and had to be with a terrorist gang and had to shoot everybody around. MP of MW2 is really good and is fun if you havent tryed it yet. Offers a huge variety of weapons and misc items in-game. I loved the game because of the beatiful enviroment and a fun shooting system aswell as huge amount of different types of guns. If you havent played it, try it for sure it is a good game and has a lot of influence in the gaming history."

If you do not take in account the disappearance of mods and dedicated servers since CoD 4, PC versions of CoD are quite good, and this one in particular is surely not the worse.

It has an epic campaign, nice coop missions and an outstanding multiplayer, with some cheated weapons but a great arcade feeling that makes every kill enjoyable. The actual price is a bit too high. Nevertheless, wait for the sales, bring some friends with you and enjoy one of the very best arcade shoorters available on PC.

20814,"Sure, the Call of Duty franchise has really become ""rinse and repeat"" in terms of design, content, and gameplay, but I'm writing this recommendation based mostly on the multiplayer elements. While Activision really disappointed PC players by not providing dedicated multiplayer servers, the P2P based hosting is alright- certainly not as reliable as a true dedicated server, but enough to get the job done. The fast paced gameplay, plenty of unlockable weapons, mods, and perks all make for a fun online experience. The leveling system, unlike some other FPS, is quite fast and rewards leveling. As of this writing the online community is still quite strong, peaking around 15k during the day.

20854,"More realistic than MW 1, good pace of campaign, some missions have plenty of replay value and great and extensive co-op."
20855,"A game for 13 year olds.
Boring and linear maps, incredibly imbalanced weapons, and a bad community.
Oh, and no dedicated servers, just to screw you over that little bit more.
Single player campaign is way too short, multiplayer takes years to get going (and is bad, anyway).
Should be in the bargain bin, but they're still charging something ridiculous."
20856,"This game sucks big floppy donkey dick, and manages to lick the balls while doing so. No dedicated servers, no bug fixing, no votekicks, useless anti-cheat system, no direct X 10 support, denial of ANY problems whatsoever, because Robert Bowling is an avaricious, egocentric slut-monkey."
20857,"Awesome game,  you should try it. There are lot of reason why, first the stunning graphic, everything is really detailed. By the way, who don't want to defeat Sheperds? Do it now : ), The Singe player is a really good Story-line. Even, you can CO-OP with your friends in Special ops, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo( Fuu.. Really Hardcore,  
They play with juggernauts.. lot of juggernauts.) But the best in this game, is the Multyplayer mod, with it's great funcions. You can choose from 40+ weapons, even, you can put attachments on it to make your simple rifle to be a Millitary Armory ; ), Killstreaks are really wounderful. there are lot of way to get aid, support, or a tactical nuke :D. There are death strikes, if the things start  to go to a bad way."

20863,"The game has a lot of choices of weapons that you can use to kill the enemies, like: pistols, smgs, assault rifles, light machines, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, grenades, and mines. The only downside to it is, although it is a good game, no one plays it as much now that Black Ops and MW3 is out. I would have given it a 5/5 but I give it 3/5 because of the multiplayer population, but it shouldn't be brought down by that."

20867,Meh
20868,"An excellent production single player campaign. Infinity Ward did a superb job at bringing detail and depth to every element that deserves a standing ovation. It is extremely detailed with tons of action. My biggest issue was that I found the story difficult to follow. It jumped around from country to country and person to person making it impossible to figure out who were the good guys and who were the bad guys and where you, the player, fit in. Regardless, the presentation and the execution are both top notch and very enjoyable. Throw in stellar graphics, quality game play, and a pleasing variety of equipment and missions. I cannot praise the single player campaign enough--a game that's actually worth its price tag."

20870,"One of my all time favorite games. Excellent gameplay, good graphics. If only it had proper dedicated servers, and IWNet wasn't such an epic fail, it would have been almost perfect.

Still though, fun game."
20871,"MW2 was the last great game of its franchise. To start off, the story is actually pretty good. It's short, but the characters have good personality and the story was pretty tight, with a fun twist towards the end. Spec Ops is a nice sort of ""Challenge"" mode, though nothing to get excited over. If you're into challenging your abilities as a FPS gamer, then you'll like it. On to the multiplayer, I believe it's fun. I don't know what it is exactly, but the feel of the gunplay is very nice. I'm a fan of the customization as well as the perks that the game offers to your soldier. The major issue regarding weapons is there are quite a few combos that were left untouched and overpowered, but fortunately most people quietly agree not to use them since they believe them to be cheap. Also, the game has been somewhat of a graveyard and host to hacked lobbies, since Infinity Ward has essentially abandoned it. Despite this, I still recommend the game for its value. Pick it up on sale, and you wont regret it. The game is not completely dead, and from time you time you can get in a multiplayer and have a real good time!"

20875,"Over-the-top military action, same basic package as Modern Warfare 1 but with prettier graphics and a bit more controversy.
As usual, the TF141 segments are not nearly as fun as the Ranger segments, but they are the ones that play the story forward, unfortunately, whereas the Ranger parts feel more like afterthoughts.

Part of the storyline feels completely ripping off Homefront, story is convoluted and hard to follow and rather short. Barely 5 hours of gameplay. Glad I got it for cheaper.

Not even going to bother with the multiplayer...

If it's 15$ or less, not a bad deal. But more than that? Meh..."

Buying it for 25 euros was a waste of money and I regret it. Even if it was 5 euros, I'd be upset."

Hell it's so good that they re-released this with a different number on the packaging! Silly, over the top/  Rambo gameplay. Most exploitable tactics in a game ever (stacking killstreaks, noobtubes, quickscopes, etc). If you want to play a game with a serious face and/or you are easy to rage then avoid this like the plague. On the other hand, if you want a fast, reflex-based game with a HUGE fun factor then you won't be dissapointed with this one. Fun is its main incredient. Just a heads up: buy this on a sale (standard 50% off, no more, no less, every once in a blue moon, when Bobby Kotick leaves his office to bathe in a bathtub filled with 100$ bills)."

20907,"""still rocks. no ded. servers but still better than BlackOps."" - Thats been my Review... until now.

Dont get me wrong, this game is awesome and I love playing Multiplayer. Oh wait. I loveD. But since they sued ""AlterIWnet"" and ""4deltaone"", which did a pretty great job with developing some modification for this game (New Gamemodes, New Maps, Dedicated Servers...) it just got horrible.

Sorry InfinitiyWard - but your policies really suck. No one buys this game anymore. No one plays it anymore. So why do you even care if somebody makes it playable for the last remaining fans?

""Black Ops"" was the last CoD I bought after MW2 - and I did regret it - it felt like playing in mud... But those lawsuits against 4deltaone make it clear: CoD is dead (for me!), I will switch to Battlefield, DayZ and ArmA. R.I.P. CoD, its been a great time. ;)"
20908,Multiplayer sucks because it is horrible to play on non dedicated servers because you must wait for the game to find random players ... It takes only 5 minutes to play from the moment you started the game WTF?
20909,It's Call of Duty.

20930,(‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©¬æ)   Probably The best game in the Call Of Duty series. Out of all the other CODs I have spent the most hours playing this one. I even enjoyed playing the single player. Only issue I had with this game is it didn't have gold camoes. JK I really don't care about gold camoes.
20931,"Games amazing, IF, you dont get a game thats modded and lagging and super jumps and broken. The game is FUN if you have a decent host and can actually knife people and do the basic functions that the game allows you to do.

20995,Simply: the best
20996,I can only recommend it :)
20997,"Out of all the Call of Duty games out there, this one has to be my personal favorite. I remember starting the series with Modern Warfare 2 and loving it, but there are downsides to playing it now, especially on PC.

The numerous amount of hackers is what will make or break this game for people. Usually the hacks aren't that big of a deal as you can leave the lobby, but there will be those hackers who decide to put you at level 70 and prestige 10. When this happened to me I didn't make much of it, but later on I noticed that my level had been reset along with my many hours of time played. It is disappointing that players will have their levels reset for something they couldn't help, but the hackers are simply ignored. It wasn't that long after having my level reset that I decided to stop playing the game.

You need to know what you are getting into with this one. Don't get me wrong. This is the best Call of Duty that I have ever played, but there are many downsides that a consumer needs to be aware of.

If you are looking for an alternative with less hackers then the best that I can recommend would be Black Ops 4, but keep in mind that it is no where near as good as Modern Warfare 2. It is still a good game, but it's hard to live up to the gameplay and map design of this one.

If you can live with the amount of hackers then this one is a must buy."

Gameplay is smooth and intuitive, very easy to get a grasp on.  Only hard part is learning the maps which it 
has in spades plus map packs.  Abundant game types for every type of player.  Plus a co op mission for when you complete the campaign to further the story.  Well worth it's price as is after 3 years from release.  Quality game from front to back. 10/10."

21061,Good game.
21062,"My only real problem with this game is its lack of dedicated servers. Why this is a problem is because it robs people of the ability to choose what server they want to play in, and so you never know what kind of game you'll end up in. It also makes you more likely to encounter hackers, and not just the usual ""wallers"" or ""aimbotters"", but the kind that make it so their servers can do anything from being a zombie game (which isn't that bad), all the way up to auto leveling you to max level. Oh, and you don't have the ability to kick/ban people. As far as I've heard, there is a special program that you can download for MW2 that allows you to kick/ban, BUT SERIOUSLY!?? That should have been included in the game design in the first place. But besides that, the game can still be fun and enjoyable... of course once you get past all the problems this game has."
21063,cant get any moar PRO than this
21064,"Not a bad arcade shooter. Deviates very slightly in the single-player mode from the usual COD approach to gameplay (straight-jacketed, die-often-unless-you-work-out-exactly-the-strict-order-of-move-shoot-run-precisely-as-the-linear-design-dictates), but not enough to really set it aside from equally entertaining tasks like pulling teeth or sawing your own limbs off.

At least it has a story you can enjoy... but I expect that the contraversial let's-kill-lots-of-innocent-bystanders level sold more copies than the storyline, and that's why it's there (no such thing as bad publicity - maybe they'll have a 'throw puppies off a cliff' level in a future sequel.

Multiplayer is okay. Longevity is encouraged by having a 'reset' button (""prestige"") once you've ranked up. Ranked up fully and nothing else to do? Why not start again from scratch? Guys, this is not how you extend shelf-life - we could just delete our save games for the same effect.

21143,"Like all other COD games other than the multiplayer, the best part is the campaign. I must say that the group at Infinity Ward has really outdone themselves on newest COD campaigns. The campaign itself is so real, and so dramatic that it makes you love each character in your squad. Jumping back and forth between members of the CIA, 141, and the Army Rangers the overall plot is very exciting and also easy to follow. Many times the tables will turn to situations you never saw coming.

21184,"My time played on record only shows single player activity, as STEAM separates the two (single and multiplayer).  My total time played in Multiplayer is 970 hours.

Update: Now that the game is infested with hackers, I can no longer recommend it.  It isn't a rare to end up in a hacked lobby which will do anything from deranking you to altering your unlocks to changing settings in your mp config file.  Playing the game requires keeping backups of all your stats and MP files.  More information about this can be found in the forums, so if you are considering the game at this point, be sure to inform yourself about all of the serious issues affecting it.  It may not be worth the hassle.

Is the game playable and fun? Sure. And in some instances, when you find a good host and players who want to have an enjoyable time without noob tubes, commando, or other nonsense, it can be really fun. But just beware, it's infested with hacked lobbies, people running exploits, and a less than respectable community. If you can stomach all that, you can find fun in it.

*Original Review:

Quick pacing and nonstop action keeps you moving forward to the inevitable end game of the single player at around a 5 to 8 hour completion time. This is good if you are looking to jump into playing an hour or so at a time as each chapter of the campaign is relatively short. The action on display is compelling and the thrilling score, outstanding militaristic dialogue, and visceral imagery keep things constantly engaging. The story, as epically scaled as it may be, is a little too contrived. Modern Warfare 2 decides to up the ante with a full scale invasion of the United States. The U.S. is under siege and the stakes are high.  It is unfortunate then that the reasoning behind the whole ordeal, while tragic, is somewhat farfetched. The multiplayer is excellent, yes, with superb shooter mechanics and fluid gameplay.  It is also somewhat rage inducing.  Prepare to be noob tubed to kingdom come. That aside, it is fast and great fun."

I'm not denying that it has these, but with all of those people having moved on to Black Ops, the multiplayer is actually quite enjoyable. The singleplayer, of course, blew me away the first time I played it (just like those Michael Bay movies). Great the first time through, maybe even a few replays, but it does lack a bit of replay value."

They should also make the guns much more realistic. Another downside, is this game has no dedicated servers. You can't tweak the game either.

More action-oriented if you ask me, and where the story in the first one was somewhat realistic this one takes an over-the-top approach (but it also has some great scenes). Multiplayer is still the same (and still great) with some slight tweaks and extra features. And then there's the co-op, which is kinda fun and sometimes challenging as well. The graphics still look pretty good and the sounds and voice acting are great. Not everyone may like this game, but if you like solid first person shooters this is a must-play.

21313,This game is fucking bullshit. I recommend this game for kids. The MP function sucks shit. Stick to the console version. And play BO instead. The MW series is shit on crack.

21342,"Borrowing themes from American invasion epic Red Dawn and TV series like 24, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 attempts to capture the insanity and life-and-death situations of real-life combat. Once again you hop between several engaging story arcs as you globe-trot on missions to stop a war and ultimately bring a madman to justice.

Right from the outset, MW2 fixes one of the issues some people had with the original game's story -- instead of setting the action in a fictional Middle Eastern country, the game opens up at a firebase in war torn Afghanistan. Though pixel counters would say otherwise, this game still looks amazing in action. Whether sprinting down cramped alleyways or racing down the side of a frozen mountainside MW2 moves at a frenetic pace that rarely stutters."

21349,"As much as I despise the Call of Duty series for its lack of innovaction and annual rehashing of the same gameplay and plots, I can't fault it for its tried and true formula. The franchise is so successful because whatever it does, it works. No matter how much I want to hate it, this game can sometimes be a blast, especially played with friends.

Now this isn't a game for everyone. Personally, I feel that online matches require little to no strategy (compared to Battlefield games). It's mostly run and gun and for some, you'll spend more time looking at the kill camera than playing.

The single player plot is nothing special. You have your terrorists and you have your  nation at peril. The execution is amusing though. There are a few cheap shock factors but as needless as they are, the scenes work. The campaign being only several hours long, there's really no reason why you shouldn't play it, especially since it serves as a tutorial to the meat of the game: multiplayer.

Grade: B"
21350,Intense close quarters combat for those fast-twitch types.

21362,one word: kindagoodish
21363,"So... this game. This is also probably the 50 millionth review you've read for it.

The single player pretty much took everything that made Modern Warfare 1 great, repeated it ad nauseum, then tacked on a omg amurrka is under attack theme. It didn't work.

Some pros with this game though is Keith David. Because Keith David. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202966/ - He can Oscar Mike me anytime he damn well pleases.

Other pros are the Ramirez, do everything meme. Regardless of what anyone says, that meme is solid gold and I laugh whenever it comes up.

The multiplayer features 3 maps, lots of optional downloadable content at cost, hackers, and bitching. If you want to succeed at this game's multiplayer, just attach a grenade launcher to an assault rifle, use the Scavenger and Explosive Damage perks, and provide your team-mates with some morale-boosting Heavy Metal micspam."

Compared to MW1 I like having the ability to pick my own killstreaks, pro-perks, and the maps. MW1 did let you choose which server you wanted to join, but I have had good connections thus far with the auto-server selection."
21374,"Guns, Action,Guns,more action and explosions. MORE GUNS."
21375,"A great game in the Modern Warfare series. It is the second installment in this series and one of the best ones. The single player game makes sense and is alot of fun to play, it doesn't take long at all to beat. The multiplayer portion of the game is were all the fun is. But with all the people trying to hack this game there is alot of hackers in it. The game when there are legit players is alot of fun to play. It can take awhile to reach max rank in multiplayer maybe 30-40 hours for the rank of max. Its a great game and shouldn't be passed up if your into the Call of Duty series. Ive loved playing it and I know you will too!"

There's a healthy variety of modes to choose from, and some favs come back, as well as some less-than-favorable ones. If you like fast-paced combat and run-a-muck, shoot-'em-up combat, this game is for you. If you are more tactical, play Battlefield."

This game is very fun, the next story after MW, now campaign is fun like the CoD4 MW campaign, story altogether is great!

There is a mode called Spec Ops which you and a partner if you want can do 23 different little missions like you got Alpha, get off the bridge for example.

8.4/10

MultiPlayer:

The Create a Class is much simpler then the Black Ops CaC, which was bad. You just play a mode and gets into a game for you (under 120 ping) and not that much lagg unless host is crap.

There are parties so you just invite friends and play, not like Black Ops where you can't make parties with your friends and play..

Major faults: 
1. lobby gameplay, not server support.  
2. tiny maps, tiny teams, limited gameplay options.  
3. Nuclear weapons.    enough said.  
4. cheaters.  This game has valve-anti cheat, which means it does not have anti-cheat."

I loved everything about CoD up until this game, and as far as the amazing single player experience I think that still stands, but the replayability for me has disappeared with MW2.

- BUT it has HOST-System over IW-NET wich often sucks totally cause of lags and Lobbys.
Lots of Cheaters on it, too (like Aimboter and Wallhacker).
Host can also modify the Game, like levelhack, emblemhack and so on.

21522,"one of the worst Military games I ahve played in Multiplayer, the single player is allt hat is worth playing.  Internet play is as loggy as they come and there is no Dedicated server, so you are relying on a Host that is probably infested with Spyware from the Giant Google Partners.  Stay away from this POS game, because you knwo after you get threw single player your stick with Shit.  Stick to Modern WarFare it's better, and So that you fuckers know, CoD is on the Death Bed, and the Development teams are considerign the Suspenion of future releases.  Right now there isn't a version planned for next year (At the Time of this Review)"
21523,Best game of all time
21524,"Este si que es un juego realmente bueno , aqui tu puedes HOSTEAR ! crear tu propio servidor para que la gente entre, lo que me gusta es que aqui puedes hacer de todo . correr XD matar de hs y muchas cosas , los camperos quizas es lo que lo mata pero esos wns vay con ninja pro y los fileteas xDD ! asi que eso es un muy buen FPS !"
21525,Ce jeu est exelent !
21526,"There are two seperate components to this game.

The single player is fast paced and action packed, but extremely linear. A few stealth sections are present, and are OK by FPS standards. It fulfills its purpose of teachingthe player the controls well enough to play the multiplayer.

The multiplayer is fun in theory, but several problems get in the way in practice.

No dedictated servers ensure near constant momentary lag. 

The player base is not very mature, and there is a good number of cheaters.

The unbalanced perk system permits EXTREMELY unfair advantage.

There is no votekick option.

Waiting time in the lobby is quite long as there are many players who purchased the hilariously overpriced DLC map packs that you most likely do not have. The only way to get around this is to pay 90USD for a title that already has a sequel, which has only served to lower the player population.   

If you really like the gameplay style, get Black Ops for the console."
21527,"This is a good FPS with good mutiplayer. The single player game is fun, but short.  The mutiplayer is hard and competitive.  The reason why I never sunk very many hours into the mutiplayer is because the game has poor built in communications and most ""groups""  and ""teams"" are on IRC, Skype, or other talk items.  So basically very few people actually talk in game.... another words I just felt like I was playing skirmish with bots because there is very little chatter and everyone is not having fun, but instead acting pissed off at everyone else."

21540,"The single player game is fun and relatively engaging for the 5 hours it takes to complete.  The story is nonsensical with only the barest thread linking action pieces together and since you play a multiple characters the plot understanding fragments  further.  Oh, and the plot requires you to suffer and die a lot and on purpose.  So annoying to be kicking ass like a mofo only to have the game kill you up because you didn't wait for the scripted event to begin, or worse when you're laid low by a plot-mandated injury that you'd normally be shrugging off due to regenerating health.  Understand the single player game is locked on rails like a roller coaster crossed with a shooting gallery and your expectations will be properly set.  My serious complaint is the game dresses itself up to *look* like real-world military units, but the missions and orders you receive are ludicrous from a real-world POV.  Fun to play for what it is.  Not worth $60, but ok at $30."

21564,"One of the better Call of Duty games in the series with the option of customising kill streaks and a shotgun as a secondary weapon. A top of the charts FPS shooter focused more on fast reactions and arcade enjoyment than simulation.
Coming back after a number of years, this is still one of my favourite FPS games but it doesn't run too well anymore. Online the frame rate drops and it can be prone to stuttering (not great when playing competatively online) and it's not due to hardware issues. Also you'll find severs littered with hackers due to the age of the game.
Single player runs fine."

When first released this game was Brill (A little buggy but still great fun), then along came the inept bitches moaning about certain guns that they kept dying to, (their strategy wasn't at fault, oh no, it was the guns) and the game got 'fixed'. which f~~ked it up. its still a great game, but don't try and use a shotgun, as it has the only ammo in the world which disappears into an alternate reality once it reaches 7 feet, but you can mp5 and/or pistol someone from 1000Yds+ so....

SINGLEPLAYER 
the story absolutely makes no sense. its just about action.

MULITPLAYER  is full of cheaters, last stand, martyr and aikombo noobs  that just camp, bunny hopp or lay down while shooting.

if you get a connection you play a few maps and then the connection randomly interrupts again cause the privat server solution is crap.

the game is also full of rank hackers, wallhackers and other cheaters and annoying for people that have at least a bit skill.

its the WORST of all call of duty games.
i never wasted my money sucessfully like for this epic fail game."

Nah, really it was quite fun. I was a fan of both CoD and BF, so hey. The campaign is fairly engaging, and I'm not sure about the multiplayer anymore. If you want MP, you'd probably want to get MW1.

Campaign was really fun though! (As was spec ops with Pyro Maniac!"

21632,"This game is a hugely popular and fairly overhyped game. 

It's offline is excellent, the main story line is a great storyline to follow, even if you are new to the cod series (a lot are due to the hype) you should get the gist of the storyline, however i do suggest buying Call of duty 4.

Coupled with the offline storymode, there is a new addition called ""Special ops"" which can be played (and some require you to play) with a partner / friend!
Very addictive and fun, with many hours of entertainment.

Ok onto the multiplayer mode, it is an AMAZINGLY addictive game, very competative however your kill death and win ratio will not effect your current rank. You rank up, until you hit level 70. You can then proceed to ""prestiege mode"" Which sets you at level 1, with a new symbol (you can do this 10 times, unlocking new titles and emblems. Be careful with killstreaks! They kill fast.
I suggest, Scavanger, cold blooded, ninja for perks.
Have fun!"

21636,If you like this kind of linier shooter then Modern Warfare 2 is one of the more polished of its ilk. I don't think the story is a patch on Modern Warfare and I certainly didn't feel as involved this time around. However the other aspects of the game such as the MP and the Special Ops mode are solid.
21637,This is my favourite game! I like it more than god of war 3!!!
21638,BS. Very easy short predictable game. Multiplayer is out of interest for me. Way too expensive. Even today still 59.99. Makes me feel sick of activision. This game sucks and I do not recommend it to those who truly loved COD2 and havent ben against Treyarchs CODs as well.

Graphics, sounds, music are all great, gameplay is perfect; and the multiplayer is superb, but could be a bit frustrating if you're not an experienced FPS player.

21690,"An ok COD. I think this COD version is going to be the last decent COD for PC. The Devs and Pubs are now paying more attention to the console gamers than the PC gamers. The story is not bad, it just has it's hiccups. The AI is very weak, and it is just a run of the mill shooter. Multiplayer is hit or miss. You can be running through and have a good game, and a hacker comes in easily since the VAC is implemented poorly compared to other games like CSS, and DOD (the game client uses the hosts systems instead of dedicated servers with VAC always running.. The game will still give you a decent run for your money if you want a good action game, but I would wait until the price drops to $20 or less."

21711,"great FPS, but its not the singplayer or the multiplayer (against other human players), why this is one of my favorites. i love the special operations mode. playing it coop (only with 2 players) is sensationel... pls, give me more spec ops maps !"
21712,you shoot people in the face especially bunny hoppers.
21713,hell yeah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
21714,Hooah!
21715,"Awesome multiplayer FPS, highly addictive :D"
21716,Can't afford BO for now but I do smell good.
21717,"Fan af 1st person shooter spil, s√• er dette et mush have.
Sevlom at Black Ops er udkommet, er der stadig flere tusinde der er online herinde hver dag."
21718,My grandma is a sexy beast
21719,Get this game guys! csdark
21720,"Intense detail! amazing multiplayer action, Great game for the holidays"
21721,"Hate/Like it. I hate the whole story behind the game's creation, the publisher etc. 
The story is bull***t, and the developers know that.
Non-dedi is a no go, and Cheaters have taken over. This is no skill, it's pure aimbot/wallhack!
Still - it's fun to play with honest people on invitation-games. Won't buy the following games though because of all this german cut-shit, and of course Activisions CEO, who is a - nah, won't write that down."
21722,warta grzechu
21723,"smooth gameplay, online has many modes so the importance of teamwork is varried"
21724,"It's just Call of Duty with more gimicky crap. It tries its hardest to capture your attention by copying intense war moments from classic war movies like ""Blackhawk Down."" But you'll lose interest in the story by the time you perform a 100 foot jump with a snowmobile as if it were nothing. The multiplayer is frustrating and annoying because EVERYONE online is a jerk. The game is very well polished and you'll have fun if you are a Call of Duty fan. But I was hoping for more of a COD4 experience and was very disappointed to say the least."
21725,DONT BUY IT. ITS A TRAP!
21726,Hell yeah!
21727,"If I had it to do all over again, I would tell the makers of MW2 to go fuck themselves.  The server matching is ass and works corectly only about as often as our fucking government does.  For those of you keeping track, thats almost never.  Last word, its shit with servers run on an even shittier system."
21728,One of best games in my collection.
21729,Best game ever
21730,"The single player campaign is very short, but it makes up with the fantastic storytelling. The multiplayer is brilliant."
21731,"best mulitplayer fps game ever made.. Better than black ops with its graphics, gameplay and weapons. You really should try this before you die"
21732,"This game is good
"
21733,The best multiplayer i've ever played
21734,Nice game! For everyone!
21735,The Best game of 2010!
21736,"Runner-Up to ""Game of the Year 2009"" on my blog, Choicest Games. A solid performer, this sequel to Infinity Ward's immensely popular Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare once again blasts you away with a short, but sweet single player campaign. The campaign is so immersive, it makes you feel like you're in a Hollywood action blockbuster. The multiplayer is fun too."
21737,Un Classic
21738,"Good game in my opinion, it does however, hold its flaws. What I particularly didn't like about the game was basically the exploits within it, and the hackers. With Black Ops now stealing the spotlight, I think there aren't many hackers anymore in this game. I've recently gone back and played some matches and it's better than before. When compared to Black Ops, I can honestly say this game runs much smoother than Black Ops regarding multiplayer. SO I do recommened this game, it isn't in my opinion, the ""best"" but its a nice time consuming game nonetheless."
21739,"Single player mode is more creative than in world at war
Special ops is OK but i find nazi zombies more better and creative
alltough the game doesnt bug so much like in COD 5"
21740,"The singleplayer is lackluster, the multiplayer is horrifically laggy, don't buy it for more than 2 cents. A shame upon a formerly good series."
21741,J√¶vlig Bra!
21742,its so awsome ! its the best game ever  made<3
21743,"It's bullshit
frustration-factor 50% - fun-factor 50% my opinion"
21744,"This is an excelent game i recommend to everybody who likes FPS games. It s great optimalized, has a good game experience and more. It would be the best with the map package :D"
21745,this game is XXXXing amazing!!
21746,"Infinity Ward was really on to something with the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game. It's a shame that they were a bit lazy the second time around in making this one. While this game is far from being bad, this may be the first Infinity Ward game that lacked any type of personality; and the lack of dedicated multiplayer servers doesn't help the matter. Whie I would still recommend this game, I'd tell you not to go into this game expecting a masterpiece."
21747,"Nothing saids arcade shooter than MW2, but you might want to pick up Black Ops since its newer."
21748,Helt klart den b√§sta single player inom FPS!
21749,"There aren't many people who play games who haven't heard about this and this is for good reasons ... firstly it's a FPS which looks amazing, the storyline is really good but it's not just the main game which is awesome, this has special ops which can be single or multiplayer allowing you to complete missions with other steam members or you could just play against the internet community in multiplayer.  The multiplayer is quite good and there are packs which you can install to include older maps for COD4 which were popular.  All in all it's quite pricey but it is in my view a must buy for any committed fan of the COD series :P"

wether your casual or hardcore, you can always just jump in for as long as you want and have some fun, specially when you get killstreaks and get to fire a rock from the sky towards a bunch of idiots.

21762,BULLSHIT GAME
21763,"one of the greatest games I ever played, so far... on my computer.... which is crap by the way"
21764,"I would give this game a mixed review if it was possible to do so.

Looking back, Modern Warfare 2 was a fun game - and one of the first overpriced games on Steam originally priced at ¬£39.99. The single player experience was short, at around 6-7 hours which was one of the biggest complaints at the time when it was first released. This was however made up for it's multiplayer with many memorable maps and fun experiences throughout with many game modes to choose from.

Modern Warfare 2 was one of the best in the entire series, I would say third place behind CoD4 and it's remake Modern Warfare. The multiplayer did however have its flaws and annoyances like struggles such as: 
-Connecting to host lobbies with friends, cheaters using wallhack or aimbot (here and there)
-DLC maps that you had to pay for (a very unusual thing to do in 2009)
-No LAN mode
-No dedicated servers which often lead to users having to host the game/server on their machine which meant that if their machine was bad, your ping/performance was as well. There were times where the game would completely pause to 'migrate to new host' if the host left the game.
-No modding which the previous games allowed. Some people were VAC banned for trying to mod the game to have custom gamemodes such as zombies and other things.
-A lack of updates for new weapons and other content etc. However, Activision and IW were releasing a new game year after year which meant that new weapons and content was practically non-existent.

Despite all of the flaws that shouldn't had been there, it was still fun to play and I hope that it's remake (I assume they're remaking this game) will be just as fun, if not better.

If you just want to play Modern Warfare for the single player experience then you can purchase a remaster/remake of it at Blizzard's Battle.net - I am not sure how different it is of this game but I assume just a graphical upgrade."
21765,"RAMERIZ, TAKE OUT THE CHOPPER WITH YO PENIS!

That pretty much somes this game up."
21766,"It's EPIC.
Best FPS of 2009. (9.5/10)"
21767,"Excelente jogo, especialmente sua campanha e seu modo co-op, Spec Ops. Uma pena que o multiplayer seja extremamente desbalanceado e tomado por cheaters :\"
21768,"""Tem muito cheater nessa porra...
pena....

pois e um bom jogo."""
21769,"nothing but EPIC....(if no one hax)

21775,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 ist das bisher beste CoD was ich gespielt habe.
Zwar ist der Singleplayer vorausschaubar macht aber trotzdem Fun.
Der Multiplayer macht mehr spa√ü als der SP.

Fazit: Gutes Spiel lohnt sich zu kaufen. :)"
21776,"(Multiplayer) Most overrated game of the year.
-Not balanced for shit.
-Overall boring gameplay.
-Not being able to access console... No dedicated server, mod or map maker.
-Adding new maps should be free but instead costs a sick amount of money.
-No anti-cheat allows hackers to rule.
-Most of the game is based on randomness. Care package exampel: You might get ammo whilst someone else gets chopper.
-Most of the things are overpowered, it doesn't take skill to use the harrier strike, chopper, nubetube and more...
-Using the Perk commando will get you kills easy as shit without skills. 
-Takes time to join a game and joining a game with a friend will disconnect you sometimes. You're not allowed to choose what map you wanna play nor server. Someone in the game is picked as a host which might cause lag and connection problems.
+Various maps, killstreaks and weapons (such a shame nothing is balanced).

Simply put, this game sucks and lacks skill and gameplay.
Final score: 2/10"

21787,"Aye it's me again writing another recommendation. MW2, a very hated game... Why? I couldn't care less to explain, but okay. People flame this game for being unbalanced and WAY too unrealistic (are you new to COD you fucking haters, it's not new that it's unrealistic) anyway, killing 11 people in this virtual warfare gives you 2 options if you unlocked those. Either you open up a laptop and control an AC130 or steer an incoming apaches gun. You can also lunge (teleport) at people by using ""Commando"" and remove fall damage (does not include surviving trigger_hurts by jumping down from example highrise. Yes ""Commando"" is gay, yes ""AC130/Chopper Gunner"" is gay when someone else is using it. But! If you are a big Call of Duty fan and all of these sick killstreaks sounds fun to you, then go ahead and keep reading. Modern Warfare 2: The Call of Duty with most attachments guns and killstreaks. Oh right, they also combined perks like. YouTube the game if this was good, cnt rit mur see u bitchz."
21788,This is NOT a recommendation. Great game flawed with lack of dedicated servers. Pitty that IW wasted such a potential.
