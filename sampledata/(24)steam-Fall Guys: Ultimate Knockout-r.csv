1,Fuck Epic Games and this shit they pull.
2,"Fall Guys is great, it can also be really hard though. I enjoy playing this with friends mostly because you can either spectate after you die or play along with them or compete against them, all of these I enjoy! I can be annoying though when people grab you and then you trip or fall into something that ends your time in that game but I still enjoy it either way. Plus, no the game is free to play if you do not already own it on Steam you can get it on the Epic Games Launcher for free. I call it a win win situation because if you do not like the game after testing out, you are not out any money."

11,"Ever wanted to shorten your lifespan? Always wondered what you'd look like without any hair? Well buy this game and find out, fucker! 

Guaranteed to send your blood pressure to the stratosphere or your money back, Fall Guys is the perfect example of what team games look like when you remove all forms of communication. Ever wanted to see how little we've advanced from our primate ancestors? Try out the thrilling ""See-Saw"" level!

Now available on Epic, because [i]nothing[/i] says quality or trust like moving to a bare-bones marketplace, part-owned by the Chinese Communist Party!"
12,This game is packed with fun and its worth 20$ I had fun playing every game lose or win i had an amazing time
13,fuck this game i love it
14,"It's a lot of fun. The only downsides I've found so far are: You can no longer acquire it through steam, and you'll see a lot of the same maps, even though there's a large library of them."
15,Fun to play with friends !!!!!
16,"O jogo era bom, até a epic games colocar que é requisito ter uma conta deles pra jogar."

39,You need friends to play this game
40,Was a good game until they decided to convert folks crowns into Kudos. That move alienated me and I'm sure a lot of other folks who actually purchased Kudos for money. I really hope the devs get a serious kick in the pants because it was a greeeeeedyyy move.

142,"Best shooter on the market. Fall Guys is the game that sparked a beloved Microsoft franchise and put the original Xbox on the map. It reimagined the first-person shooter (FPS) genre for consoles and popularized many of the controls and functions that such games would use for decades afterward. Fall Guys received an enhanced remake in 2011 for the Xbox 360 that featured updated graphics and a toggle function that lets you swap between Classic and Remastered visual styles.

As part of the new Fall Guys Collection, the updated Fall Guys: Fast Food Skin Pack boasts 4K graphics, ultrawide monitor support, and other features you'd expect from a contemporary PC game. It's an outstanding remastering, one that only suffers from niggling audio and visual issues."
143,its great download it now

153,This game was alright but after they done collab with among us I want to kill myself. Among us guys are worst guys ever (no hate) but they are just very bad and evil.
154,"I would recommend this game to other people because it is now free and i love this game. It is very easy to play after a long day and i love the characters, would recommend it to younger people who are trying to find games they like, that arent age restricted as there isnt anything bad in it :)"

174,"Such a great game and probably one of my favorites. Disappointed with the Epic takeover and the direction with having to purchase everything now instead of earning outfits through gameplay alone...but it is what it is. Love playing in team games or solo shows. Definitely recommend this one. Unfortunately, if you are not grandfathered through Steam purchase previously, you'll have to look elsewhere to download this one."
175,silly legs
176,yes!
177,"
lost all my hard earned crowns only to pay for skins that used to be obtainable by playing the game. Epic has put it full of garbage microtransactions. shame on them. Id rather pay to get the game and have acces to all the content than have a free game full of this garbage"

190,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realise that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realisation, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.

Thank you"

192,Its a fun competitive game. Got it when it costed money and it was worth.
193,The game lives up to its name. My guy definitely fell.
194,Highly recommend this game! Great to play with friends and you can play as a solo player. It can be very addictive!!
195,I never played a game that made me cry more than my ex did. Well done
196,"epic games aside, the amount of downtime in between rounds/games makes this game pretty difficult to play. you spend more time in briefing/loading screens than you do actually playing."
197,"Every time there's any sort of update and every so often after that matchmaking completely stops working. Overall game is fun to play and I usually hate PvP but its mainly navigating through obstacle courses rather outright vsing other players for the most part and some obstacles are fun to navigate through, but for some odd reason there's these random windows where most people can't play. Last time when playing in a party it would kick people from the party so we can't hear them. But they would still be in the match. This time my squad couldn't even que up. It would say ""leader cancelled matchmaking"" when it wasn't happening. Theres some sort of trend going on lately with buggy PvP games that's been affecting the actual gameplay. This game's bugs don't affect gameplay but it affects being able to play at all."
198,FUN GAME.
199,"Lot of fun! Please, add skins of Dr.Simi (Mexico) and Pios Chicken (Peru)! 😁🥰"
200,Taken off Steam - no longer relevant

Epic Games taking it over made the game all micro transactions and the winning doesn't even feel rewarding at all anymore so why bother."

358,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

365,"The game is boring and, ironically, feels lonely, to me.

The gameplay is slow/movement is slow and bumbling. It makes it so anyone can play because anyone else can also trip and fall. There is a good amount of randomness and chaos to the game, which seals this game is a casual experience. For me, I prefer games with more style and skill expression.

What's especially sad is playing with friends. It is such a crowded chaos that you don't really get to interact with your friends, especially if one of you gets eliminated early. In the case of elimination, you have to just sit there and wait for everyone else to finish, which is even more boring."
366,Did you know the Fall Guys' canonical size is 6 feet tall?
367,"its fun game to just mess around with friend, laugh and have a good time."

390,"It's fun, and addicting. However there are some up and downs

The seasons take too long to come out i get this is so all players can get their remaining season pass items
But i seriously think that they should stop delaying the season pass cause it makes it boring for players who has already beaten the entire pass, second. I think they need to have it where you get kudos each game or something not JUST by challenges too bad us beans are waiting for the new season to come out but anyways. Other then that i give this game a 7/10."

410,"It's an overall simple party game dedicated to play with/against friends in online public lobbies involving beans being absolutely squished into each other. The mechanics can be sometimes bothersome to deal with when you're crowding with several other players, but that's what the nature of Fall Guys suppose to feel like and should be. 
It's not difficult enough to piss person off, but also frustrating enough to annoy the heck out of you via the physics of this hilarious game. Overall, I love it!



TL;DR: If you are not into party games and dislike very weird in-game physics, it's not for you. But otherwise, GLHF!"

Just another game epic has ruined."

626,THIS ISZ A GOOD GSAME AOULD SAY TO DENITLY PLAY IT
627,borin 1/10 I hate this game with every cell of my body
628,i love it
629,this game isn't worth 20 bucks. i tried to get my refund since they made it free and steam just hates me i guess :/
630,itz cool

649,yes
650,Really fun game to play but sometimes gets frustating whrn you can't pass the level.

652,Cute beans
653,"even though i have 51 hours in the game its only because it was good before, you know, epic came and made it f2p which just ruined what this game was because epic only cares about money, and so almost all cosmetics are now paid and maps are now kinda bland. the first season i played this game in was season 4 and that probably was the last season with good maps, season 5 and 6 had ok maps at best and now the only ok-ish map is the race (not where you need to get 2 loops). unless mediatonic had a good and valid reason to get bought, and not because of greed then that would be fine. but letting them removing the fun aspect of the game just to get more players and encourge them to pay for stuff was the downfall for not only me. the only thing i can say is if this world was communistic then there wouldnt be any problems but most people have greed in their veins, and that includes mediatonic and epic games, which is just sad to think about
you can slander about me as much as you want, but who cares about other peoples reviews, right? its just like everyone is egoistic. weird (not)"

677,What is up with this overlay stuff this game was great ever since it went free to play the item shops crap and the skins cost more than the game... should've stayed with steam sellouts.

693,Super fun. I always describe it as Mario Party minigames but in a battle royale. Plus they do a great job at updating the game often and adding new content. Highly recommend!

708,"I am a 51 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 13 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
709,fun game with friends and solo

767,"Epic Games ruined this game. It used to actually work and skins were obtainable without having to buy them with real money. Thanks Epic, you really do all you can to support Steam and make sure it never falls from being the best store for PC users. Every single employee at Epic has ligma. No one is safe."

776,"Fantastic game, exactly what you want to play when you just want to play a game. Super fun with friends in a team. I rarely win, but if you want to unwind for a short amount of time, the games themselves are short, its fast to get into a game and the player base seems to be made of normal humans and not bots, which means you have an actual shot to win. Enjoy your jellybean on legs."

813,I've never seen such a small amount of content added to a game that's made such a large amount of revenue. The game only supports 16:9 displays and they refuse to make it work on the Steam Deck by default even though it works quite well with modifications.

991,"Epic Games buying this game ruined it, they removed crowns which was the currency you earned through playing the game to then buy cosmetics, Epic Games however added their usual copy paste formula to this game the same way they did with rocket league and Fortnite by adding a dogshit battlepass and item shop and now every cosmetic that was once free to obtain by simply playing the game and enjoying it now costs real money. Just another game epic has ruined."

1032,"You want to play with friends? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME! 

It's so entertaining and it's so exciting! Learn those patterns and maybe you can make it! Your own buddies pushing you around so they could win? EVEN FUN! 

Again, I really do recommend this game!"

1046,small beans made me hungry
1047,"I used to love this game!  So many of my friends purchased it due to how much fun they had playing it with me.

But then Mediatonic sold out.

Once Epic Games purchased this game, I became nervous for this games future.

And now here we are, a few months later, and you can't get any fun costumes without Show Bucks.
""But Brawl, they give away 1500 showbucks...""
to which I respond ""Yeah, they charge 800 for the battlepass and all the costumes that people want are 800 too, meaning that you're going to have to purchase Show Bucks.""  How convenient right?  Totally not an awful business practice designed to force people to spend money on a hollowed out titled.  /s

And now, they are doing the same awful game manipulation that game like NBA 2Kwhatever or Fortnite have.  Matchmaking has become increasingly hostile.

I no longer recommend this game that used to be one of my favorites.  It's now just another modern game that is ruined by the Games as a Service Model.

PS:  #%*$ you Mediatonic for lying to me and everyone else when we paid $20 for this only to get ripped off down the road.  You suck and I hope companies like yours just implode and when the Gaming market crashes and you become the focal point of the entire gaming community that just constantly bashes all of you for exploiting children in the name of profit."

1060,"Fall guys is such a fun game. I absolutely hate what epic has done to this game. they ruined the cosmetics. sure, its free which means yes, get the game. But back when epic didn't own it you would buy skins using crowns which you got for winning and the battle pass was free. unfortunately the game was dying before Epic owned it. This game is still alot of fun and reminds me of the show wipeout. Get  a few friends and play together, makes it a lot more fun."

1075,"Bought this game two months before Epic decided to make it free and add microtransactions. I'm so PISSED. I still really game the game and play it with friends, but I also loved playing by myself to collect Kudos and have rewards, to buy silly costumes I could show off next time I played with people.
Without that, the game is really not rewarding, and became for me just a cool party game. That's a shame."
1076,descending fellas
1077,nice
1078,"so many fun times with my friends, fall guys is a great game, nowhere near to one of my favorites, but it sure is a blast, its free now, but i do have some problems, crowns don't mean anything anymore, crowns used to be a currency, winning means nothing now, but if you are looking for a free game, this is a good option, very excessiable and fun."

1117,"I am a 53 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Fall guys. 
I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing Fall guys and glancing in his room it looked like he was having a lot of fun. 
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. 
This was awful for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son 
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam 
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
 since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing this game. 
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games 
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought 
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

1142,"Very lovely game, but at times can unfortunately lead players like myself to;

• have alarming desire to inflict harm onto literally any and everything
• experience Severe Anxiety
• become aggressively racist
• experience tourettes"
1143,good game
1144,kinda like fortnite but without guns
1145,yes
1146,"I have been making it to the final in duo show with a buddy most of the day. Everytime we made it to final, we had hex-a-gone. That one is good, but gets extremely annoying when you play it everytime. The physics also don't make sense sometimes and I go flying or a small tap from an object or can't get up from a small fall even though more than half my body is on the floor and my arm is dangling off"
1147,fortnite but for children
1148,fun video game
1149,It is challenging but also very simple I enjoy playing this with my family alot
1150,"You know the worst thing about most battle royale games, is that after getting first place, you've basically completed the whole game and the only incentives to keep playing are emotes and costumes you can wear in a game that you're just kinda lukewarm on.

Also, Epic Games sucks. For a company that claims to pride itself on being open to competitors and developers, it sure acts like it wants to be a monopoly at times. You HAVE to use an Epic Games account to access this game you've bought on Steam.

I would recommend checking out this game if you don't mind suffering through the Epic Games Launcher, but especially now that progression in Fall Guys is locked behind a seasonal paywall, if you've not been that interested in the game before, and presume that maybe there's enough new content added in the last half-year or so to make up for Fall Guys's most blatant issues, notably, some levels just being bad, and not being able to do anything while matchmaking, sorry, but no.

(i paid for this game back before the Epic Games buy-out, and yeah, thanks for the legacy pack, i guess. it's like getting a fall guys bottle opener or something, wow, what a nice token of appreciation, i say sarcastically, then i go home and put it in a dresser drawer and never think about it or this game again.)"

1178,"I got tired of this pretty quickly off release because it only had a handful of levels. Now that there is much more variety, I have come back and am loving playing it."
1179,because epic games did a good job reviving it
1180,gud
1181,","
1182,fun to play
1183,"Epic games ruined this game. Took away the crown currency and replaced it with ""Showbucks"". For the players that bought the game before it went free to play it took all the crowns earned and changed them into Kudos which is now useless. It can now only buy hats shoes and titles but not full outfits like before. 

In the paid battle pass if you grind all 100 levels you can get 1400 Showbucks. This is good for one legendary skin or around two normal ones. 

So even if you grind the paid battlepass you still won't be able to afford much especially if they drop a collab only available for a few days like they did with the Pusheen collab. This essentially means all the outfits now have to be bought with real money."
1184,sec
1185,"Bought  it on Steam, need to play through Epic games. Game cant load, it doesnt appear in my epic library and Steam wont refund. Fuck this DEV, fuck Steam and FUck Epic games. And fuck you too Gaben, you are fucking rich enough you dont need to steal from poor african kids you fuck."

1211,"Been playing since Day 1. Couldn't really play during the BETA because I wasn't lucky enough to grab a nice key.
But regardless. I was an early pre-order supporter for the game. And never have I regret the decision.
The game is actually exceeded all my expectations since Day 1.

Now that the game's F2P and back to season 1 with a P2P season pass (if you didn't had the game before) 
It's a lot more different.

But here's my cons and pros on Fall Guys:

PROS

-GREAT party game. Don't get me wrong. You can enjoy as solo. But this game is insane as party. It's just something else.
-COSMETICS. Game personalization is something that I really do love in games. I love when I do look different than other and making my character kind of look a bit different than the other players with the current game cosmetics (costumes ect.) this is something that has kept me DEEPLY hooked with game since release. With great additions on the collabs as well!
-ROUND DESIGNS are unique and some actually challenging. Some rounds have VARIANTS that spice things up, that way that round will sometimes spawn differently every time you play it.
-CROSSPLAY/PROGRESSION/PLATFORM... Enough said :)
-CONSTANT updates and EVENTS
-GAME PASS (EPIC FORMULA) So to explain this. I have to give to examples: Fornite & Destiny 2. Fornite has a Game Pass formula that a lot of games have implemented to their games where: You buy GP with in game currency > GP gives you that ammount of currency if you finish it back then next season you can buy it pretty much for free. It's like a buy it again system. As for Destiny 2 you have to buy a GP EVERY season.

Cons:

-FREE TO PLAY. I mean, this is a GOOD thing. It really is. But, as for the collabs go. Well. Every cosmetics They all now have paywalls. This is now a new thing. It wasn't like this before. And it is a huge let down for me personally. But I understand that in order to go F2P, they had to generate income somehow.
-LATENCY, some modes may be dependent of this. For example: any with Tails or player grabbing involved is highly ping dependent. And in times the grabbing mechanic can be tedious and annoying to go against if someone has better or VERY bad connection against you because they may grab you from VERY far away basically griefing you from a key victory.

And well. I think that does it. I had a lot of fun writing this. If I think of anything else after, I'll just add an edit to the bottom. Anyways.
Cya :)"
1212,Really good thanks
1213,i bought this back in like 2020 i think and i still love it sm
1214,"This game died quicker than my pet hamster.






I don't even know when i played this game last. I still miss my hamster tho"
1215,"I do be falling down.
I like that the only money grabs in this game are for cosmetic items so it's not a pay to win game even though it did go free to play."
1216,"funnt falling gentleman

1251,"An amazing party elimination-style game to play with friends or to play solo. It sucks that Fall Guys is now only available to purchase on EGS (Epic Games Store) for PC users. Whether you own it here, or plan on getting it FOR FREE (!!) on EGS, there's no doubt that you'll have a blast! :)"
1252,yes but some time it may go to black screen
1253,balls
1254,yah
1255,"Good Game, although they should either improve their servers or remove the gamemodes that involve the grabbing mechanics. Quite annoying when I'm 1 or 2 body lengths away and they somehow grab me AKA Remove Tail Tag."

1289,its fun if you dont fall. would recommend
1290,"Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the game in general. If I could give this a ''yes, but also no'' review I would.

I feel bad for saying this, but I don't enjoy Fall Guys anymore since it became free. The skins that are easily available now are incredibly basic and not nearly as fun as what you could get before. Now it's just hats and shoes, no full outfits anymore unless you want to pay.

The fact that you could customize your little bean in crazy and fun costumes was a big part of what was fun, in my opinion. I would play to have more coins to be able to get more costumes later. Now, no matter how much I'll play, I still won't be able to get cool costumes. Completely killed it for me.

I still log in once in a while to look at the shop but I don't really play anymore, I don't feel like it's worth it. Even with the events, I feel like the rewards aren't good enough to ''make me play''.

I'm glad that the game became available to many more by becoming free, but in my opinion it also become much less fun for the rest who had already bought it. I'm not paying for the skins, and I don't think I'll be playing that much more saddly. Had fun while it lasted!

If you don't mind what I've just explained, then by all means, get the game! You'll have a good time for sure. It's just not the same for me anymore."
1291,it fun
1292,The ultimate game to turn your brain off and enjoy after a day at work / school. Also a blast to play with a group of friends.

1309,"If you actually want to get a game where you can get good and then win a lot of games this is not a game for you. Since about 70% of everything that happens is random there is no fucking way to consistently play this. Well, if you are some wierdo pacifist that is always happy this may be for you, but otherwise not."

1311,"What a fun, friendly and - depending on your skill level - potentially frustrating game.

So full of energy and love.

...Until it went free-to-play and became a micro-transaction hell-hole. It truly feels as though the developers have no love for this game anymore and that the money is all that matters; you can feel the lack of passion the game has compared to before and, for that, I just can't continue to recommend this game."

1313, hi
1314,"Super fun party game, hopefully people dont take it too seriously like what happened to fortnite"
1315,"This game is kinda cancer, in my opinion. I find it unrewarding and frustrating, and the game puts emphasis on skins but its all built around inducing FOMO and making you either grind or pay money for skins in a limited window of time. I cannot express enough how much I detest the way the devs treat the players. Removed, won't be playing again."

As far as the game goes, it's great, I have no complaints it's a great party game and especially fun with friends. I do agree with the people who say that the Epic Games takeover was overall a downgrade though. I paid $20 on launch only to get a couple of skins later on down the line and as well most in game items now being locked behind paid currency. However as someone who doesn't really care about skins I really enjoy the game play, it's simple and fun."

1450,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1451,"cool

1452,I have been Playing Fall guys since the true season 1 and I actually used to enjoy it now that Epic Games have gone and made it free but the skins way to overpriced it isnt the same as it was before. Even worse epic got rid of our crowns a currency all of us OG players were saving up to get the best skins and made it into kudos a currency which does nothing but sits around on the top of your screen now. EPIC MAKE IT THE WAY IT USED TO BE AGAIN.

1502,"ive been playing since season one. overall, i believe the game to be fun and extremely enjoyable. i love playing with friends and raging over the stupidest of things while playing. although i recommend the game, i cant have the same love i had for fall guys once Epic bought it. 

back before Epic, you actually found fall guys to be extremely fun and would grind for the skins in the shop or to save up for something you truly wanted. now, since Epic, everything seems like a cash grab. i cant have cute skins or even EMOTES now without shelling out money, which i absolutely REFUSE to do, no matter how cute the skin is. kudos were currency within the game and you would actually get so much by enjoying and playing the game. its what made fall guys FUN. as much as i love playing fall guys, its become so mundane and boring now that Epic has stepped in. 

if there was an option to use in-game currency, like kudos/crowns, or real money to buy a skin; i wouldn't be so upset. but, for now, fall guys is losing its fun for me."

1579,"Raz na kilka lat na rynku gier komputerowych pojawia się tytuł, który niespodziewanie staje się olbrzymim przebojem. Produkcję taką wyróżnia zazwyczaj prosta, lecz uniwersalna grafika, obietnica wspólnej zabawy przez internet oraz posiadanie czytelnych zasad. Minecraft, League of Legends oraz Fortnite to idealne przykłady takich gier. Błyskawicznie podbiły one branżę cyfrowej rozrywki i zdobyły rzesze wiernych fanów, trafiając do dziesiątek milionów odbiorców na całym świecie. Wszystko wskazuje na to, że niedawno wydany Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout ma olbrzymią szansę na powtórzenie sukcesu wcześniej wymienionych tytułów.

Produkcja ta, inspirowana wyraźnie japońskimi teleturniejami, oparta jest o bardzo proste reguły. Rozgrywkę rozpoczynamy wspólnie z ponad pięćdziesiątką innych graczy. Do finału dotrwa jednak jedynie garstka najlepszych i najwytrwalszych. Większość odpadnie we wcześniejszych etapach w szeregu wymagających wyzwań. W grze poza gałką lub przyciskami odpowiadającymi za kierunek poruszania się naszej postaci używamy jedynie przycisku służącego do skoku albo chwytania naszych rywali. To wszystko. Nie ma tutaj żadnych broni lub umiejętności. Liczą się tylko nasz spryt, zręczność i koordynacja.Twórcy Fall Guys przygotowali dla graczy kilkanaście różnych, niesamowicie interesujących etapów, które mają za zadanie wyłonić najlepszych zawodników. Przeważnie stanowią one skomplikowane tory przeszkód, wypełnione masą ciekawych pułapek. Do następnej fazy zabawy przechodzi zawsze określona liczba osób, które jako pierwsze przekroczą linię mety lub nie zostaną wyeliminowane podczas rozgrywki. Wśród konkurencji znajdziemy też potyczki drużynowe, w których rywalizujemy w ramach losowo stworzonych zespołów. Różnorodność zadań jest naprawdę spora, a każde z nich będzie wymagać od nas trochę innych umiejętności. Etap inspirowany grą Memory sprawdzi naszą pamięć, a rozgrywka polegająca na wykradaniu jajek przeciwnej drużynie spryt i zdolność współpracy z innymi.Do finałowej rundy przechodzi jedynie kilku najlepszych zawodników. Na końcu czeka na nich jeden z czterech obecnie dostępnych wariantów ostatecznej potyczki. Osobiście, w momencie pisania tego tekstu, mogę pochwalić się już kilkunastoma wygranymi. W mojej opinii zdecydowanie najtrudniejsze są etapy, podczas których rywalizujemy w losowych zespołach. Wystarczy, że w drużynie mamy kilku gorszych zawodników, by nasza przygoda zakończyła się przedwcześnie. Do sukcesu w innych konkurencjach wystarczy odpowiednia koncentracja i unikanie największych tłumów. Inni gracze mogą bowiem blokować oraz łapać naszą postać, co może skutecznie przeszkodzić nam w decydującym momencie.
To, co w mojej opinii najbardziej wyróżnia i przyciąga do grania w Fall Guys to bardzo sympatyczna rozgrywka. Nie ma tu zbyt wiele miejsca na złośliwości lub negatywne emocje, jak w innych grach z gatunku battle royale. Mimo że gra oparta jest o wzajemną rywalizację, to rzadko kiedy naszym bezpośrednim rywalem jest drugi gracz. Głównym celem jest dotarcie do mety przed innymi, a nie celowe psucie zabawy innym. Trochę inaczej sytuacja wygląda w konkurencjach drużynowych, jednak i w nich trudno doszukiwać się większej złośliwości ze strony zawodników. Dodatkowo rozgrywkę uprzyjemnia fakt, że nawet w przypadku szybkiej porażki zostaniemy nagrodzeni pewną ilością punktów i waluty dostępnej w grze.

Służy ona na szczęście jedynie do odblokowywania kolejnych strojów naszej postaci. Są to więc elementy czysto kosmetyczne, niemające jakiegokolwiek wpływu na grę. Mimo to stanowią przyjemny jej aspekt. Miło jest na początku etapu zobaczyć kilkunastu różnie ubranych zawodników. Tym bardziej, że część strojów możemy odblokować jedynie za korony, które dostajemy za wygrane zawody. Powoduje to, że już na starcie możemy zobaczyć, kto jest najbardziej doświadczonym graczem. W aspekcie tym istnieje też spory potencjał do współpracy z innymi markami. Dostępny był już do kupienia strój inspirowany m.in. grą Hotline Miami, a kolejne dodawane są regularnie przez twórców.W pierwszych dniach, jakie minęły od premiery Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout w grę tę zagrało kilka milionów ludzi. Jednocześnie na serwerach potrafi bawić się ponad sto tysięcy użytkowników. Tylko od twórców zależy w tym momencie to, czy uda im się podtrzymać olbrzymie zainteresowanie odbiorców i systematycznie uzupełniać swój produkt o nową zawartość. Muszą oni również dbać o jakość serwerów i połączenia. Niespodziewany sukces spowodował, że nie zawsze działały one idealnie i zdarzały się problemy w ich funkcjonowaniu. Obecnie jednak sytuacja wygląda już o wiele lepiej. Tytuł ten w pełni mnie oczarował i stanowi dla mnie największe pozytywne zaskoczenie tego roku. Pozostaje mi wierzyć, że nie stanie się on chwilową modą, a zostanie z nami na dłuższy czas.

1604,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

1644,"Since I am an old player in the starting lineup, let me share my thoughts.
As the comments say, Fall Guys is no longer the original Fall Guys. I'll admit, it's a good game, and at the same time, I'd say it's a bad game. Epic made it free, while in-game skins became mostly purchased. Goods that can be purchased with in-game currency are now purchased with money, and in-game rewards become worthless. The crown has also become a prop for leveling up, instead of the original commemorative item.
The tasks are also designed in a mess, just to increase the player's game time as much as possible. It doesn't matter if the event levels are unbalanced, after all, the event rewards are not very attractive (at least I think so). I also didn't want to waste the season pass for season 1 and play to level 100, and to be honest, it felt like going to jail.
Fall Guys bought me a lot of fun with my friends. After the game is free, although there are more players, the mechanics and content are no longer suitable for this type of game. I will not take the initiative to play Fall Guys in the future. If you are just looking for rewards to play, I advise you to give up."

1666,"1300 Hours and 1900 crowns later, I finally have my review of the game, and my own personal advice.

[h1]Treat it as a party game and nothing more, and it'll be a blast.[/h1]

Although I have a lot to say about this game, I'll have it split into two parts.

[b]Firstly, the positives.[/b]

If you want a game to be enjoyed amongst friends for a quick laugh, a win or two, or just something to expand your palette in games, Fall Guys is definitely the game for you.

The game at this current point in time (Season 1 - Free for All) has more than enough content to give new players something to enjoy, or not enjoy. [i]cough cough[/i] Tail Tag...
Every stage brings something new and fresh to the table. Rounds where you simply race to the end, or ones where you collect enough objects to qualify, or ones where you simply have to survive long enough to reach the next round.
The game also looks great design wise. 
Although the overall graphics aren't stunning, the characters look adorable and hilarious at the same time. Want to play as a cute pink wolf? You got it! How about Godzilla himself? They have that too.
Fall Guys offers so many options to customize yourself with the top and/or bottom half of a costume. Additionally, you can change the colours, patterns, and your Fall Guy's faceplate.

[b]Now, the negatives.[/b]

Remember those cosmetics I was just talking about? I was speaking from the perspective of somebody who has played since the game launched, when the game costed $20, but gave you the ability to earn every unlockable cosmetic without spending a cent on premium currency (I am proof of that.).
Since the game went Free to Play, every costume INCLUDING PREVIOUS BATTLE PASS COSMETICS cost money thanks to the game's new premium currency, Show Bucks. 

It is understandable that Mediatonic needs money to sustain the F2P design, but the prices for most of the skins, especially the older ones are egregious. Forcing new players to spend $15 for a skin that was free, or $5 for a fictional pair of shoes, and tricking them into thinking they are saving big bucks when in reality they’re just paying slightly less for overpriced cosmetics. You can thank Epic Games for that.


Take this from someone who sweats in every game he plays; this game is NOT meant for competitive play in the slightest. Nearly everything in this game is made to be random and chaotic. The round selection, the position your bean will spawn it, hell, sometimes the physics between two players can be random based on your ping and how merciful the server's feeling.

Also, rounds like Tail Tag, Volleyfall, and Blast Ball exist. Yeah… not catering to any veteran players there.

The most competitive-friendly part about this game is the crown ranking system, and even that can be a slog. You'll have to spend hundreds-probably thousands of hours of your life to reach a disappointing colour or pattern before you reach the good stuff. (Gold Wolf, Gold Knight, Golden Banner, etc.)
And that's assuming you win consistently...

There will be days where even if you have thousands of crowns, you'll be on a losing streak, and it can be really demotivating. And unfortunately, that's just how the game is designed... to keep you addicted and feel like your journey is never truly over.

So please, for your own sake, treat this game like the chaotic mess it is, take breaks when you can, and play with your friends as often as you can to get the full experience of this broken, crazy game.

1696,"The equivalent of a marble race. Who wins has less to do with player skill and more to do with how 50 players bounce off each other in a random fashion. Some parts of the course need skill but no player skill can often overcome the melee at the beginning of rounds. Many forms of character customisation are hidden behind paywalls and the rewards of premium currency are stingy.

Most of my time with the game was spent waiting for it to load, waiting to connect to games, quitting out because servers wouldn't fill up with the required number of players."

1700,"The Free to Play update has substantially increased the player base thus making finding matches very easy (more notable in less populated regions) which is a huge plus. The new rounds/maps are also enjoyable too. However the rework of the shop, kudos system and crowns is disappointing, especially for those who have been playing for months prior to the update. The vast majority of costumes, emotes, patterns i.e. that you would normally be able to purchase with kudos and crowns (which were obtained for free by playing the game) are now primarily obtained by the new premium in game currency called showbucks which costs real money. Some would say the new pricing model for these cosmetics is questionable at best. Additionally, after completing the battle pass, you no longer earn kudos as they can only be obtained through challenges at this point, which in my opinion should be changed since as of now the rate of attaining kudos is quite slow and minimal. Aside from the current state of the cosmetic shop, I still highly recommend Fall Guys as it is quite a fun single/multiplayer platformer!"

1795,"Fall Guys is a fun, easy, family-friendly MMO royale-type game. Would I recommend it? Yes, but the biggest thing that ticks me off about it is that I didn't get the game for free like most of the people playing now. Just a few months ago, the game cost a full twenty bucks, and I purchased it at that price. I bought the game a month or two before it was announced that Fall Guys was becoming free to play, and even though I received some passes, it wasn't twenty dollar's worth. Now the game is filled with players who either payed money for the nice items or just pretty much wear the free, basic stuff. Fall Guys isn't pay to play, as you can only buy clothes, but if you won't put money into this game, your choices of attire are pretty lame. However, this game is still fun, even if it is filled with noobs. All events and levels are available without purchases. So, yes, I do recommend it (for new players, but Epic Games did a bad job here)."
1796,"Love the game, and its great
I just wanted to mention that I've had multiple problems with how easy it is to exit a game while in a loading menu. I have a habit of fidgeting, and its really hard to control, so I might press a button and be out of the game
I dont want them to remove this easyness to leave as I know its very loved, but I do wish there was an option to have it be in the start menu for tic-prone people like me :)"
1797,"This game is FRUSTRATING! It is almost impossible to win ONE episode! I don't know how or why this managed to get positive reviews! It could be because of the hilarious nature of the game (it's not funny in my eyes) or because they can't tell the difference between a good game and a rage game! Either way, I do not recommend this game because it's more reliant on luck than skill! In other words, it's simply blind luck, my worst nightmare, as a video game!"

1901,"Fun game, but developers apparently were too lazy to add shadows in some maps. Makes the player completely unable to get a feel for depth, let alone decise any reference to the avatars surroundings. To compensate, the player needs to permanently spin and wiggle his camera perspective around, which however is only applicaple in a very restricted set of scenarios: The developers allso seemingly didnt care to conduct any research on robust camera positioning algorithms. When the avatar is in close proximity to  a wall (or virtually anything else larger than it) the camera tends to clip into the walls and other objects, leaving the player utterly confused about its avatars position. 
Examples of lacking shadows and therefore no feel for depth are a severe problem for game modes such as the volleyball game mode, or the map with a lot of trampolines. 
Camera clipping happens a lot in almost any map that contains convex walls or large object at the same height of the avatar or above."
1902,"do you recommend this game? yes and no. the good thing about this game is the fun skins new maps and colabs. but the bad things are glitches like one time i was loading in to a map and i flung all the way up to HEIGHT LIMIT which caused a elimination and you can rage VERY easily and a game where you can guarantee a hacker so there is so many issues with the game and also i do not like the show bucks because it gets rid of you're crowns now so might as well delete the crown rank option this is MY honest OPINION so you can go off of of my review or don't also you have to have epic games to purchase 
 this game witch is NOT COOL please keep the new maps and keep the old way. all love <3 Thank you."

The epic buyout is quite annoying but you can still get it on steam if you buy the steam key somewhere, but you still need to use an epic account which sucks."

I told her to go to hell and started the next show with my boys. Some people don't understand, some people can't handle the pain and suffering that I have poured into this game. I understand. I continue to chase those crowns and continue to test my skills against the ultimate challenge and the ultimate knockout. I continue to make fun of 12 year olds who think they're ready for this emotional challenge. I continue to live alone in my mothers basement. I am a conqueror. Hear me fall."

1981,The game is fun and everything but it can sometimes be very bad. The physics could be very bad and could be very annoying. With custom matches I don't know why 10 rounds every time its really garbage. I don't know if that's suppose to happen or not. Overall it is still a good game and i would recommend it. I would give it a 6.5/10.

I don't know from when but now the game has this ""show buck"" currency that is required to purchase those skins. Simply, the skins are locked behind a paywall that uses real money, not to mention they're overpriced. Sure, you can get those show bucks for free but you have to invest so much time in the game that it becomes ridiculous. As an old player returning to the game, I'm disappointed in you devs, really."

2023,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2086,"I have played this game for well over a year now and had quite enjoyed it. I like games where I can shine over large groups of people as the quickest. It reminds me of when I used to play Mario Party as a child. Unfortunately the microtransactions they added to this game after Epic took over and made it Free to play feels outright predatory. They want people to spend 7+ dollars on a single skin with no way to grind to earn them outside of the few showbucks you can get from the one free battlepass we're permitted as those who bought the game which can't even be spent on anything if you want to be able to use those to afford the next seasons battle pass. They also make it really easy to accidentally buy these items by not even having a confirm purchase option.

Shady business practices to gain extra money from what is mostly children just seems despicable to me. Most free to play games have ways to grind to get the same things as those who just buy things, but not this game which is really doing everything in it's power to get people to give them more money. I don't like the lack of respect that shows to their playerbase that they're trying to squeeze them out of money to sell them some worthless pixels that will never have value since there's no trading system or crafting system or other ways to obtain items that might at least cause those pixels to feel valuable. 

There's not even a skill based element to getting new outfits anymore. Back when crowns were a currency to buy a skin there used to be a bit of a brag factor that you can win enough games to be able to easily afford a 10 crown outfit meaning you must be decent enough at the game to be wearing that outfit. Now when you see someone wearing a flashy outfit you know it just means they threw a lot of money at the game as it doesn't have to do with skill anymore.

Also once you finish the battle pass, you no longer get any rewards for playing and can only get things like kudo's from doing daily challenges which tend to be unfun and tedious to complete, and are only going to be getting about 30 kudo's for the effort when the average garbage-tier kudo's costume costs at least 1500 kudos meaning you'd have to be grinding everyday for about a month for a single ugly costume (and nearly all costumes that can be obtained through kudo's are quite underwhelming and ugly). The game actively discourages any real grinding by removing any reward if you grind more.

I still enjoy playing the game itself, but man I can't help but feel icky every time I see what new garbage Epic Games wants to add to squeeze a bit more money out of people."

2192,I hate you Epic Games.
2193,shirt fall guy skin is so epic
2194,"i would say this game is mediocre,at the start it's great you dont know the maps and overall it's a good expirence.But later in the game in my opion is extremly dry... you already know all maps like the back of your hand and for a player like me who has 2574 trophies,it's very boring i only come to fall guys after a huge update has dropped,check the new maps win 25-50 games and go back to other games like GTA or ARK or even the ISLE.So yes in my eyes this game is mediocre,and if this helped you i'm happy that it did help you,thats it."

2212,"I'm glad I was able to purchase this game on Steam before they took it off the market. It's pretty fun getting the achievements. I know a lot of people consider this to be a kids game, but the game itself can be a little addicting. As an adult, I do like this game. It's more of a relaxing type of game. Sure, there's moments where it makes you upset because you lose, but it's nothing serious. I don't understand the YouTubers who rage a lot over this game. I feel like they overreact."
2213,fall guy
2214,It is really good game to play with friends for a fun time! It's a shame the game went from the Steam store to EGS but atleast the game still works in my library!

2286,this game is about little people brutally competing in a death game. SCARING DEADLY BRUTAL BLOOD
2287,"Jonatan Aron Leandoer Håstad (born 18 July 1996), popularly known as Yung Lean, is a Swedish recording artist and the face of the Sad Boys.

Lean started out his success from the two songs “Oreomilkshake” and “Ginseng Strip 2002” from the Lavender EP. Both were highly viewed on YouTube and highly categorized as “meme rap” but actually being considered “cloud rap”. In 2013, Lean released the mixtape Unknown Death 2002. Around this time, he also put out other singles and collabs with Bladee, Thaiboy Digital, PradaMane, DJ Smokey, Denzel Curry, BONES, and Xavier Wulf. Later that year, he released his most popular single, “Kyoto”, which many thought would be featured on his debut album, Unknown Memory. As of 2021, it has racked up over 50 million views on YouTube. Lean then dropped his first debut album titled Unknown Memory, in which Lean replaced his sound with a more serious tone.

Lean also has some side projects: he releases music as Jonatan Leandoer96 (formerly Jonatan Leandoer127), a side project which showcases a more personal side, and as Metal Storm. He is also member of Punk band Död Mark, consisting of Lean himself and fellow Sad Boys member Gud."
2288,ewwww epic sold out
2289,Peaceful game!
2290,The second I saw it downloading Epic Games is the second I stopped playing it
2291,"This is a horrible game after it went free. Firstly winning doesn't matter anymore. Crowns don't do much even though it's extremely hard to earn now. You get what you get, there isn't a special store or things worth crowns now which is bad. 
secondly i love the multiplayer features, but it's already hard to win crowns so why make it worse by making multiplayer lobbies which are more fun to do, get you a quarter of a crown. It always feels so useless when i win because as i stated crowns are worthless now. The items i get with them are things i don't like or want. The only drive i have now to win is my own competitiveness that isn't even rewarded.
Thirdly, since it went free at least gift us 40 dollars worth of things (can't remember how much i paid for this game) or unique legacy things.
Another thing I'm struggling with is that we used to always get Kudos for every round we play like exp. Now thats taken away so it's harder to earn, and harder to buy things that's already supposed to be ""free"" currency.

Overall can be summed up as this.
Multiplayer = fun
winning/crowns = useless = not fun
new challenges = good/fun
kudos not being given as often anymore = dumb = not fun 
The not fun aspects really kill this game for me. FIX YOUR GAME
"
2292,"This game is kind of fun until it suddenly and unapologetically eliminates you for some bullshit reason. One time I was eliminated on the see-saw game mode because it was tilted for the entire game and I couldn't pass. This game feels very luck based at times and dying always feels like the games fault. I've had more fun on fucking Roblox obbies. And now since Epic took it over everything costs money.

I really want to say something good about this game but there isn't many good things to say.

2342,so many server issues and bugs... from the moment that the game goes free problems has start to appear and the only think in game that i saw to change is the shop. the game has major bugs when you play it from the steam. also i have so many connection with the server problems. if they fix them i will change my opinion. cause i rly enjoy the idea of that game.. but until now the bugs are rly annoying
2343,Epic games moment
2344,"I really loved this game, but epic games ruined it for me. I'm not the kind of person to care about microtransactions in games as long as it doesn't effect the enjoyment of the actual game but it does here. I bought this game for 20 dollars and didn't have to pay anymore money if I wanted cosmetics because all the store items could be bought with earned in-game currency and it was easy too. and for a game where all you do is run and jump being able to customize your character is important. Its a very simple game that's just become another lame @s cash grab. I'm not interested anymore and I'd rather spend my time playing something else now. Would have never bought it if this was the outcome. Ruined game!"

2366,This game really makes you fall for guys
2367,"This game is absolute trash, there are many many MANY! reasons why this game is  garbage. 1, This game is really glitchy, I always lose be cause of this and many others. 2, Why does it have to take a long time to start the next game, like if you beat a round and have to wait for next one it takes 1 Minute and 30 Seconds, that's long time if you ask me. 3, The mini games in Fall Guys are fun to play, some are.. Fall Guys should put something that you don't need to do the mini you hate the most, a lot of people will appreciate this especially me. There are more things I want to say but really should not worst my time like this and also this game may die soon like last time. That all I have to say I hope you good day and I hope Fall Guys fix this."

2370,"I am a 44 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

I have played a few matches where I had to use my critical thinking and the math I learned in math class. I didn't let my mind slip up and carried my team to a dub. This game helped my relationship with family and friends, my father visited after 12 years after I told him about Fall Guys. I think I would be dead in a sewer if I never found this game. Thank you Fall Guys for repairing my life."

2471,"A collection of exciting minigames and a smattering of every colour under the rainbow makes Fall Guys a consistent delight, even if it can also be a frustrating one at times. A few quality of life annoyances aside, it sets itself apart from both the party and battle royale games that inspired it in its own ludicrously fun way. I may only have a handful of crowns to my name so far and can’t wait to get hold of more, but most importantly I’m looking forward to the excitement, yells, and laughs I’ll have on my way to them. Joining the frosty, war-torn Verdansk and the wild, looming cliffs of King’s Canyon is an ocean of pink slime that stretches as far as the eye can see. I know where I’d rather be. Overall, 10/10 great game!"
2472,Fun!
2473,"fall guys is kinda ruined by epic games, prices are way too high for skins, but still pretty fun"

2482,"After playing this game for God knows how much time (approx. 1100 crowns), I do not recommend it at all. The main reason for this is the grabbing mechanics. I got so good at timing my grabs, that finals like Jump Showdown and Roll Off were an instant win. This becomes boring and feels wrong/scummy after a while. I would rather time out Jump Showdown than get an easy win by grabbing. You might say: Don't grief then! Well.. not grabbing would result in most likely an instant loss, as everybody in this game became a sweaty try-hard grabber. This game is not worth playing until they remove the grabbing mechanics from certain rounds."

2498,"You should get this game, it´s good and it´s free.
Good graphics, and loads of customization you can unlock as you level up, the platformer gameplay is also very good.
If you are into 3d platformers you are going to like this, alone it gets boring quickly but with friends it´s pretty nice and it has achievements for completionists.
There are just two aspects wich fail in this game, the variety of maps is pretty small so we get to repeat the maps A LOT.
Also why don´t we have a way to make a private server? we do but the minimum is 10 people, yeah, like everyone has 10 gamer friends ready to play at the same time, why can´t I just play with my brother for example one map to see who gets to the end first for example? 
We should be able to play just two people on private servers."

2524,"I became very skeptical when Epic bought Mediatonic because of what happened to Rocket League and much of the problems with Rocket League exists with Fall Guys also post Epic acquisition. While the game itself was fun and had a unique game show approach to the battle royale genre, now it's gone free to play and now will be riddled with microtransactions.

Between Fall Guys and Rocket League, it should be a cautionary tale to not trust Epic with any studios they acquire because they'll delist it from Steam or whatever platforms it's available on and make it where you're forced to use their subpar service and turn it into a free to play game with overpriced skins."

Got the battle pass to compensate for buy (wow amazing!!!!!!)

After each game there is tons of items etc and THE SKIP OPTION only skips NOTHING!! DAMN IDIOTS like let me play I don't care about what I get now, I'll brows my item later

Also pop-up for voice is driving me crazy. The option to never show again doesn't work... It still pop-ups ever single time!!!!"

2629,Fast-paced obstacle course platformer that doesn't take itself too seriously. Try different battle modes with friends and see who can race to the finish first. The quirky physics makes the game all the more endearing.

2634,"In Newtonian physics, free fall is any motion of a body where gravity is the only force acting upon it. In the context of general relativity, where gravitation is reduced to a space-time curvature, a body in free fall has no force acting on it.

An object in the technical sense of the term ""free fall"" may not necessarily be falling down in the usual sense of the term. An object moving upwards might not normally be considered to be falling, but if it is subject to only the force of gravity, it is said to be in free fall. The Moon is thus in free fall around the Earth, though its orbital speed keeps it in very far orbit from the Earth's surface."

It's just a shame Epic Games had to barge in and make crowns worthless now, changing them into Kudos when the ""Free For All"" update came out, and even the Kudos are useless cause any of the COOL costumes cost REAL MONEY in the form of microtransactions aka ""Show Bucks."" We used to be able to get these cool costumes just from playing the game and getting crowns, but not anymore...

Oh well, at least they aren't forcing Mediatronic to do what they tell them as far as I can see,! So yeah, it's still VERY fun to play solo OR with friends!"

However, the game has since been removed from steam (can only download it on epic now with epic account) the micro transactions have become greedy and insane! Like, I understand having mico transactions for people who got the game for free, but people like me who PAID FULL PRICE for this game... there should be a discount or reward or something. Honestly, it isn't fair. Why the heck should I had to spend so much on this if it was only going to be free to play with no return or reward of any kind??? Epic did the same thing to me with Rocket League, and I'm getting tired of it. Makes me not trust companies/Developers like this...."

2778,"The gameplay is fun and that has not changed, however I have to review this negativly as people like me that bought the game have been ripped-off in a pretty huge way.

Since the game started all skins could be unlocked absolutely free, they were part of the game you bought and part of the progression, now though those same skins If you haden't unlocked them yet have been retroactivly changed to be behind a paywall, this is taking content you paid for and locking it behind another purchase which is completely un-acceptable and should be illegal.

The way it should have been done is everyone that paid for the game would be able to unlock all costumes that were in it up until it went free to play freely, all the costumes added after the epic buyout should have been the only paid ones.

Again I cannot stress the point you now have to pay money for something that was previously part of the game you already paid money for, that is disgusting."

2846,"While it's not available on Steam any more, Fall Guys is a great game to scratch a ""gaming"" itch; the rounds last anywhere from 3-15min, depending on how well you do, so you can adjust how long you spend playing pretty well.  

While the cosmetic options are a bit sad for Free-To-Play players, there is absolutely no play-to-win mechanic present, which is pretty vital to a games longevity.  Additionally, weekly mix-ups of new additional game formats keep it pretty fresh!"
2847,مافزت فيها الا كم قيمين لاتلعبونها صعبه
2848,"fun game, but please remove team games from duo/squad unless its ONLY your squad playing thank you.

also fuck epic games"
2849,"Fantastic game, great to play with friends. But don't just take my word for it, read these trusted reviews from the boys themselves:

""It's fun to fall with the guys"" - Balt

""If I'm gunna fall I do it with the guys"" - Nate

3 out of 5 thumbs up, would lose to a 6 y/o at a kids game again."

I understand the cost of going free to play, but it just sucks.  Very glad I played a long time ago and already have a bunch of cool skins that people are now having to pay real money for."

2887,"Ive been playing this game since early closed Beta access. The amazing support this game received  is top notch. The studio really cared about the players feedback. Having said that, Im really glad Epic purchased this game, it follows the trend of Fornite with great collaborations and seasons with good cosmetics. Also probably Mediatonic will have more resources to expand more this awesome game. Havent encountered any Cons."

2910,"After watching the trailers of this game I was excited to try it out. So I made the decision to buy this and I am very glad I did. I loved every little aspects of this game, graphics, soundtracks and characters and user interface. It has great progression system to earn rewards. 
My little siblings really loved to play this game, they had fun while trying to get past obstacles. Until they changed so much it got tough for them to beat it. Overall it;s good game to look at and try it out with friends. 
I played this game to have fun and not the competitiveness. I do play it sometimes here and there just not as much before."
2911,very fun competitive platformer

2916,"Even if given the chance, don't buy this game. It used to be open and you could play on Steam. Now it's blocked behind third party logins and real ID verification. Screw you, Epic Games. I'm not sending you a copy of my ID just to play a videogame for children."
2917,"Game literally does not work anymore on steam, upon launch it only gives errors saying to play on Epic and steam doesn't give a f about it's player-base or users and won't issue refunds for things THAT LITERALLY DON'T WORK. F this game and f steam."

2940, uh its tight dog
2941,"This used to be a decent game; before Epic Games removed it off of steam, made it free, and had micro-transactions riddled throughout the entire game. Ever since they made it free, the game is now riddled with cheaters and isn't nearly as fun as it used to be. Wouldn't recommend unless you wanna play on Epic Games launcher and deal with cheaters."
2942,"I play this game with my partner all the time. Sometimes we have fun, but it's pretty much impossible to get through more than a show or two without my partner's game disconnecting or randomly crashing (they have the switch version). It's a lot less fun when my partner loses out on rewards that they earned just because the game decides to fall apart in the final round. Also, the switch and my computer are both on wi-fi and are right next to each other, so they should not be losing their connection constantly when I almost never lose mine.

tl;dr, this game has always been buggy, and even with many rounds of patches and feature updates, it stays buggy."
2943,Definitely better than WoW or Destiny 2.
2944,never play this

3222,"My hundredth review got to do something special so I'll bash a game that is popular because I hate when society dictates what is and isn't cool. THIS GAME IS SHIT IT'S A BIG PILE OF EPICS GAME'S WORST OF THE WORST. BEAN PEOPLE VERY UNORIGINAL WE HAD THAT IN 2020 WITH GAMES LIKE FALL GUYS AND AMONG US. wait..........................................................
THIS GAME DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY MEMES IN IT WHY IS IT NOT KEEPING UP WITH THE MODERN TIMES. WHY IS IT NOT GETTING INVOLVED IN POLITICS COME ON GUYS I NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT. What's any dumb reason to hate on the game? Ah I got it. THIS GAMES FORCES YOU TO PAY REAL LIFE MONEY TO BUY THE COSTUMES AND DOESN'T GIVE THEM TO ME FOR FREE. I MEAN FOR FUCKS SAKE I PAYED 20$ FO-. Wait what do you mean this game is free now. Wait hold up I didn't get compensated for the 20$ I just wasted wait. Okay this was a joke at first but I actually mad now oh well at least this only happened with fall guys an actually good game rather than the trash pile that is poppy playtime.
Over the top reaction. Check.
Funny review. Well I think it is so good enough
Making fun of another popular game. Check
Talk about random crap that has nothing to do with the game. Check
I'd say that's a perfect 100th review to make.
Why do I care about that."

First thing is the server issue, can't remember how many times the message ""You have been disconnected from the server!"" pops up, I have WiFi direct connect so no problem in running other games most of the time. And when I start playing this game two years ago, players can obtain rare skins by playing regularly, and later they cost like 1500-2000 kudos, but now you have to spend 5000 for one.

3307,"it really sucks to change this review to negative after enjoying this game for so many hours before Epic Games got its disgusting, grubby hands all over it. people who bought the game before it became free get... one season of the battle pass. a battle pass that doesn't give you anything else after completing it.

kudos for playing games? gone. oh, you got to the final round and just narrowly lost hex-a-gone at the very end? you get absolutely nothing. once you finish the battle pass, that's it! earning kudos is impossibly slow, which hardly even matters since all of the actual skins are only buyable with the fall guys version of v-bucks. time to spend $20 to look like a pineapple!

3314,"Tbh as fun as the game is the free to play update really screwed up a lot of the good parts that were in the legacy version. I hate to say it but I knew Epic Games would screw this game up somehow.

The free currencies Crowns and Kudos, have completely been re-arranged. 
Crowns (a rare currency only obtainable by winning a show) are no longer even a currency and have been converted to Kudos at a decent conversion rate, but that isn't really a good thing to be honest. Because Kudos are now entirely worthless. You can't buy anything of value in the shop now, the most you'll get are singular clothing items, like gloves or shoes or hats. Gone are the days of being able to play and get full costumes after a few shows.

And this is without mentioning that Kudos are no longer an obtainable currency within normal gameplay. Being restricted to 200 Kudos at a time through some levels of the season pass. So not only are you grinding more for worthless currency, but the prices are still the same as if nothing has changed. 2200 kudos for a single ball cap for example, ridiculous.

If you want full costumes of any value, you need to fork up usually 10 dollars worth of ""Showbucks"" at a time. Scam level pricing for a lot of costumes that have been previously free to obtain."

3489,"Core gameplay is a blast. Monetization/cosmetics model has gone absolutely to crap since it became F2P. Used to be there were 2 currencies you used to buy skins - one earned only by winning games and one you earned as you played or could buy. The best skins were only bought with the ""win games"" currency, and plenty of other skins could be purchased with the earnable/purchased currency.

Now, there are 2 currencies for buying skins - one purchased with money and one earned only extremely sporadically by winning games (but not regularly as before). The amount of skins and other cosmetics a player can earn ingame has decreased significantly. The core gameplay is still fun, but every time I visit the store it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and with the only currency earned by winning games being the season pass progression track levels, the little ""bar filling"" rush after a game is also considerably lower than before.

Also, the game loads slower and the main menu is buggy/crashes. I'm not sure what happened to the game after Epic bought it, but it definitely hasn't gotten better."

3499,"Bought Fall Guys when it was a Steam title and it was fun while it lasted. Now they want me to register on Epic and install the Epic launcher. I don't have a problem with developers expanding to other platforms, but forcing existing paying customers to switch platforms is a scummy practice. Not only would I not recommend this game, but I would also caution against all other games from Mediatonic."
3500,"As this game free to play, the grind is too time consuming, everything is tagged with a price and the fun is almost gone.

It was good while it lasted but a game going free to play is no good let alone getting removed from steam just so it can be accessible on another platform.

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun to play but its better played with friends and yeah forget about getting the seasonal rewards and stuff cause if you are not planning to buy it with money good luck with grinding your time away."

You have to buy Skins with real money, and there's no real competition to win this game anymore. I was so happy to buy things for crowns, because it was such a good motivation to win and give it the best so you can buy cool skins and emotes by grinding the game. Now, you just play and if you win, you just earn 112 XP and maybe some Kudos. you unlock things by doing the pass, but u can't get much if you're just playin without buying the pass or buyin some show-Bucks.

So, i'm recommending the game, but since it's F2P, i don't really see the fun anymore :/"

3550,"Out of all the BR (Battle Royale) style games, I always gave this one a chance back when it came out in 2020. While pretty much every other BR style game was an FPS, Fall Guys was a platformer with an emphasis on movement and obstacle avoiding. It was like a large scale multiplayer version of Wipe-Out, and very enjoyable with some friends. It was all great, and though i did eventually get bored of it, I still looked back at this game as one of the few notably fun BR games to me. Jumping to 2022, things are now very different, with the game having gone free to play. Monetized to absolute hell, no hope in unlocking anything interesting or worth while without having to drop sometimes abhorrent amounts of money. Also, as others have mentioned, if you had Crowns before Epic Games bought out the game, they have now been transferred into the free to play currency, basically meaning if you had a lot saved up, like I did, all that shit is gone. I can understand the business side of redesigning the progression system to be like this, but the model before was fine in my opinion. If you wanted the cool skin for that week, you had to grind but could still obtain it. Now, it's pretty much impossible to get even that stuff without dropping down some cash. Absolutely embarrassing."

3579,I like how this game is a fun multiplayer mini game sort of thing. I wish there was a feature where I could invite people who are playing on epic games into a party while I am playing on steam. I would still recommend this game to my friends because I can download it on epic and steam.

3597,"Not again...
First they convinced and bribed the Metro and Hitman devs to keep their new releases completely exclusive to their store so people would have to use their crappy store.
Then they purchased rocket league, promised to keep it on steam, broke it later by making it free and removing it, refusing to give people back their money or any kind of refund.

And now they've done the same with Fall guys.
When will we stop falling for these dumb lies that they use to their leverage to steal every last penny from us?"
3598,"I like this game very much because is really good relaxing..

(witch is a intentional thing)"

3641,Fall Guys is a super cool and competitive game where you race against up to 60 other players. The goal is to play different mini-games and try to get to the finish or just survive the round. I would highly recommend this bean-racing game to people with competitive spirit and find fun in racing.
3642,"fun to play with friends and if you like battle royales

3643,Fun with friends and on your own! Glad it's gotten popular
3644,ITS THE BEST G.A.M.E!!!
3645,Do not play this game it is really bad. Can not even play without having to link an epic account. I do not have an epic account so I can not play this game. These guys are a bunch of sell outs and it is so sad to see what has happened to this game.
3646,W game like Fortnite but more kid friendly! Im 15 btw
3647,good game. 10/9.6735.
3648,"First of all, since you can't download Fall Guys on Steam anymore this review is mainly for people who are coming back to Fall Guys to the free for all update for the first time. Also this is my first review I've ever written, so I hope it's good and I'm not making it too long (it did end up being a little long). First things first, Fall Guys has overall declined. When I first checked out the update, it was pretty good. Since I had bought Fall Guys, I got a few costumes and the season pass. But it was only after playing the update I realized that Fall Guys has sadly fallen into the cash grad pit hole of money only matters. First of all, the season pass changed a lot. There are a lot more levels, making it hard to grind, and a pay to win side of it. You got the free part of the battle pass, with colors, patterns, faces, etc. What's sad is that all the free ""costumes"" are basically just accessories, and not actual costumes. If you want all the cool stuff, you have to buy the season pass, which costs a new currency called Show Bucks, and Show Bucks cost real money. If you were a player before the Free for all update, all your crowns go down the drain, and get converted into Kudos, which you can barely spend anything on, because almost everything in the shop, and all the cool stuff in the shop costs show bucks. Game play is mainly the same, but overall the game sucks a little now. Sad to see fall guys become a cash grab game."
3649,"What great thing to say? Fall Guys is incredibly fun, especially when you have a small group to play with, but also in solo mode. 10/10 Game 

The only bad thing: Due to the fact that Epic Games bought the game, the game was removed from Steam for sale at Epic Games' request and unfortunately you need an Epic Games account to play the game."

3701,fun game to play when ur bored
3702,"Epic Games had to ruin everything. Removed the game from Steam, made it free and added microtransactions. Players that bought the game received awful rewards for buying it after it got free to play, and all the crowns we earned were turned into Kudos, a currency that is now obsolete because Epic created their own currency, the Show Bucks. Now most of the items use this new coin that players can only get by spending money, making the game less fun to play. In the past Players could get most skins if they were skilled enough for free, but now 80% of the good skins need to be paid with an exaggerated price, these skins are way to expensive for what they are worth especially considering they were obtainable with the old currency of the game that was free and could be earned by just playing it. It is so ironic that players that pre-ordered the game received a Gordon Freeman skin, a character made by Valve the creator of Steam, for the game now leaving Steam and join Rocket League on one of the worst Gaming Companies possible. I really feel betrayed with the decisions of the game devs because I always supported the game even in awful situations like the cheating problem, now to see everything *fall* apart, very sad to know that money can change anyone and make the worst mistakes ever. Last but not least I don't understand how people could accept this situation, why should these type of decisions should be accepted nowadays, if something like this happened in 2012 people would riot for a change, but nowadays it is something normal that people are used to, sadly. This may be the biggest reason why I prefer old games, no lazy unfinished products at day 1, no microtransactions, just a simple good game with good unlockables FOR FREE. Gaming companies are greedy and will want more, and in the future things will be way worse. We really shouldn't accept these actions, but sadly I guess we're too late. I miss the old days when everything was simple."

3779,"They basically stole the money of everyone who bought it on Steam. All progress they made beforehand was erased to a useless currency and they expect you to buy the new currency to make up for it. Not to mention that those coins used to be able to be bought as well and now they're worthless. So now they've stolen money from both the people who bought the game and paid their micro-transactions with it. 
 I would ask for the same amount of that currency that I paid for this game to make up for this betrayal but I know that amount of currency wont amount to much anyways. 
Don't support business practices like this."

3824,Its super cute and so much fun! I enjoy all the bright colors and all the competition. There's tons of free stuff to win and all you really have to do is play. There's pay stuff but its never anything you NEED and the free stuff isn't less awesome. I think they've done a great job devising a system where you can pay money when you want but still enjoy if you don't want.
3825,"This game has sucked my soul of out my body, it made me watch a full xqc stream. It also gave me osteoporosis and the paralysis demons are more fun than this shitty bean game. Winning this game is more free than Epic games buying a game studio that dies afterwards."

3834,"Fall guys is a good game. I like the platforming mini games with the combination of the battle royale but god. The new season is ruining it for me. Because along with the fun platforming, you also had fun dressing up your fall guy in fun little outfits you bought from the store or earned in events! And it was nice working up to buy a legendary item in the shop or the featured items! But now there is no working up to getting fun rewards in the shop and it's bugging me. It feels like there is nothing to work up for cus the only way to buy any of the good items in the shop is to drop a fortune on showbucks. LIKE! FUCK SHOWBUCKS! I would be fine with it if atleast there was an exchange system that was something like 5000 kudos equal 100 showbucks BUT YOU CAN ONLY GET IT FROM SEASON GOALS AND REAL LIFE MONEY! I'm so happy fall guys is free to play now and it's more accessible to everyone but by golly. I would still like to atleast get kudos at the end of shows so I can go buy a little treat in the fall guys shop. There is no challenge to it anymore and it feels like you don't earn anything from playing anymore. 

NOT TO MENTION ALL THE NEW BUGS! But yeah. I'm uninstalling this game until it puts out a show i want to play with my friends. I'm not gonna be playing this as much anymore :/"

As the bible states:
 ""Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil."" 1 John 3:8 ESV

FG has never been this fun before, with free for all launch and cross-platform, my friends can join and play together without paying single $. FG with friends are addictive. Plus matchmaking time is significantly reduced.
Epic has rewarded previous owners with one season pass, and the best part is you could use reward show bucks from season pass to unlock next one, so it's still basically free

4117,"Steps To Change Car Tyre :
Since the invention of cars, the most common problem that a driver faces in his lifetime is the failure of a tyre while driving. The service industry has been in vogue to help those unfortunate victims of such problems. However, many a time you can get stuck in the middle of the road and far away from any car repair shop. In this case, you have to do this tyre change job yourself. Moreover, as an Indian car owner, you should be mentally prepared to come across such situations as our roads are filled with those naughty humps and horrendous holes. This sounds somewhat daunting but in fact, it is one of the easiest tasks to do without taking anybody’s help. If you are the one who have been the unfortunate sufferer in the past, or you are a car owner and don’t know how to overcome such a situation, then you can follow these simple steps for changing tyre:

1. Make sure you have found a safe and flat spot on the road/highway, so as to prevent your car from rolling. Switch off the engine and put the handbrake on.

2. If it’s dark, flash on emergency hazard lights so that you’re clearly visible to the oncoming traffic. Place a solid stone, concrete in front and back of the tyres for more safety.

3. Now, up your sleeves, as your man-nish side is about to be revealed, courtesy car tyre replacement. Pull out the spare wheel, jack and wheel wrench from the boot. These tyre replacement tools are often located underneath a removable section of the trunk.

4. Before you jack up the car, use the lug wrench or wheel wrench to remove the wheel nuts. Now place the jack under the front of the rear wheels, you will find a mark where the jack is intended to be placed.

5. Crank up the jack to lift the car to appropriate level off the ground.

6. Carefully remove the wheel and the flat tyre.

7. Place the fresh wheel on that place and tighten the wheel nuts. Do not tighten them hard until the jack is removed.

8. Now slowly lower the jack and tighten the wheel nuts completely. Make a double check before packing your tools.

Now as you have replaced your tyre with the new one, you are good to move. But your task of car tyre change is still incomplete. It is highly recommended to stop by the next petrol pump and check if the tyre you just installed is properly inflated or not. If you’re still uncertain about the tyre installation, move into the nearby car repair shop to clear your doubts."

4130,"This game was good in 2020. The game died obviously but started to slowly revive itself in June. I play this game again and it's my current favorite game. I liked the old Fall Guys better, the new maps just don't give off the same feeling but this will do. Negative review because Epic Games removed it from Steam, Just why? Why are you SO desperate for people to use your crappy launcher? It's not even good. Why is Epic Games so jealous of Valve? Because Valve is better than you guys, Well it is true, Valve IS better than Epic Games but still, That doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to BUY Fall Guys, and even Mediatonic I think. JUST so you could remove it from Steam? Scummy move Epic Games.

Also WTF?! ""Show Bucks""? SERIOUSLY?! I can't help to notice but that buying Show-Bucks is the same price and quantity as Fortnite. Kudos are now just useless! Sure you can still buy stuff with it but they're not even good."

4175,"Man, Fall Guys really fell off from when it started in 2019. It was AMAZING back then, so much fun, and wins felt like they actually meant something.
Now it's just bland and kinda rubbish. There is clear evidence of the usage of bots in lobbies to prop up the rapidly falling player count (as shown by 'players' attempting to hit 'waypoints' on some maps and double-backing to reach them when it made no sense to do so) to the point where I went in COLD after not playing for 2-3 years and won 2 games back-to-back. Those wins felt so boring and unrewarding because it didn't feel like I was playing against real people, and honestly, the game is too ludicrously easy.
I wish I could go back to the early days of Fall Guys, where every win was hard-fought, where it MEANT something to get that victory, where it felt gratifying and satisfying, as opposed to gaining arbitrary points to fill up a needlessly expensive battle pass and easily being able to win 10 times a day. The easier it is to win, the less satisfying it is.
This game makes me sad. Mechanically it's solid, the music is entertaining, and visually it's definitely enough to keep my focus during the game, but the soul of the game just isn't there anymore. Probably because the human players all vanished.

Also fuck Epic."

4201,"Screw an actual review for this epic exclusive (at least it's free now) imma post my alternate universe incest theory



	Thank you for coming to my ted talk.  Today we will be talking about incest, but first let’s discuss parallel universes.  Parallel universes, otherwise known as alternate universes, are universes similar to our universe.  In some universes something different happens and we will figure out how these differences makes Incest between universes ok.
	What is incest?  In case you live under a rock or are too young to understand the concept, incest refers to the romanticized and often sexualized relationships between family members.  Kissing the girl who lives next door is not incest because she is not related to you while kissing your sister in the mouth is absolutely disgusting and incestuous.  Some cases classify incest as not all that wrong, see also Elanor Roosevelt.  As a final word about incest, incest is bad.
	How does incest relate to alternate universes?  Think of yourself as person A.  In alternate universes you have person B and person C.  If you kiss B or C you are a degenerate as person B has the same mother as you and C has the same father as you.  Notice that B and C don’t have the same parents as each other and therefore are not related so it is ok for B and C to engage in sexual actions like hand holding without any problem.  
	What about you?  Well, if B has a C, then there is a person D just for you.  This is the Diamond Incest Theory.  Person D has the same father as B and the same mother as C just as you, Person A, have the mother of B and father of C.  And just as B and C can hold hands and proceed to kiss each other on the street no problem, you and D can also engage in such acts.  The Diamond Incest Theory states that there will always be an alternate version of you and your alternate versions to the point where the only relation you have are those between the alternate universes but you don’t share the same genes, the relationship being a diamond to show the separations between point A and D.
	Today we learned a lot.  We learned about incest.  We learned about alternate universes.  And we learned about the new Diamond Incest Theory.  Thank you for coming to my ted talk.

4205,"So first off. I want to love this game. I had a lot of fun with this at launch.

Now Epic has acquired it it injects the Epic Launcher into the game which is painful. The main menu has become much more predatory I feel like I am opening a gacha game on my phone.

Trying to join a group with friends is really painful as well. It seems like it updated with new level designs which are cute, but not enough to make up for all the bad changes.

It is quite a shame."

4229,i love the idea of the game! but the execution isn't it. the game overall is super fun. its lovely to race and battle yourself to the top. however theres just too many people getting into one big pile dragging u down with them and its so incredibly infuriating. if ur starting in the first row u have easy access to the finish line but any row behind that and everyone just stumbles over each other. and i'm not a big fan of that because it means luck is important and not only skills. because now u also have to hope you get a good row to start in to be equal

4308,"I sure would recommend this game to other players. It's a fun little game with a cutsie art style, and it's basically like experiencing the dark pits of hell! (I think.) 

It's super easy to play: You run around, avoid obstacles, and grab people and throw them into the abyss! You don't have to win until the last round, you just have to not be one of the worst, and that's what makes this game fun, is that when you know you aren't doing well, you've got the power to drag someone down with you. All fun and games, and it never gets boring.

I highly recommend this if you're into arcade type games"

4448,"I enjoyed this game when it came out, but after a temporary hiatus I finally was in the mood to play again, only to find out I now require an Epic Games account in order to play. This normally wouldn't concern me if it were optional, but upon rejecting it the game proceeded to vomit an awful error at me, and return to the start menu, implying that it's now mandatory.

This was not the case when I bought the game.

I proceeded to uninstall immediately. I'm not making an account on Epic Games to play a game that I bought and own here, and its deceitful to implement that requirement after customers have bought the game.

Many of us wish to stay away from Epic for a host of reasons, including their business practices which result in exclusionary practices in PC gaming. Their goal is, and always has been, to market PC games as a platform-based economy, which is the exact reason many of us avoid the console industry in the first place.

If you value an open market for PC gaming, give this one a skip, bud."
4449,"Now that I have been able to get Fall Guys to run on my Linux system, it easily earns a thumbs up.

the water screams sublime.
His feet shift, teeter-totter
deep breaths, stand back, it’s time.

Toes untouch the overpass
soon he’s water-bound.
Eyes locked shut but peek to see
the view from halfway down.

A little wind, a summer sun
a river rich and regal.
A flood of fond endorphins
brings a calm that knows no equal.

You’re flying now, you see things
much more clear than from the ground.
It's all okay, or it would be
were you not now halfway down.

Thrash to break from gravity
what now could slow the drop?
All I’d give for toes to touch
the safety back at top.

But this is it, the deed is done
silence drowns the sound.
Before I leaped I should've seen
the view from halfway down.

I really should’ve thought about
the view from halfway down.
I wish I could've known about
the view from halfway down—"

I would not. 

It's free, so go ahead and give it a try, but it is the same game it was 3 years ago. They made all the good cosmetics real money costs, not the crowns it used to be for actually, you know, doing the point of the game. The mini games are okay at best, most of my hours came from time killing when quarantines started. This is a very simple concept with immensely average to below average execution. They happened to release this when the iron was hot for something mindless in quarantines, and I'm sure it'll perform ""fine"" for the foreseeable future, but I think it'll taper fast as people realize nothing gets added, nothing has been added, and everything ""good"" is behind a paywall. I cannot recommend it for more than a couple hours, and that's a lame recommendation for a multiplayer title that now I guess is AAA being under the Epic umbrella, so I won't do it."

4911,"I like beans, especially in things like soup and with steaks. This game has beans, therefore I like this game. I will now write an essay regarding the history of beans.
From its origins as a wild vine in Central and South America to the thousands of varieties grown around the world today, beans have evolved to be one of the world's most important and versatile crops. The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) originated as a wild vine in Central and South America.
For thousands of years, beans have been a staple food which was first domesticated more than 7,000 years ago in southern Mexico and Peru. In Mexico, the Indians developed black beans, white beans, and other color patterns and colors.Beans were also found in the tombs of the kings of the ancient Egypt where they were left as the food for the departed and their souls in the afterlife. The first cultivated beans appeared 4,000 years ago in the Aegean, Iberia, and transalpine Europe and they were large-seeded broad beans.Beans were an important source of protein throughout Old and New World history, and still are today. Beans are one of the longest-cultivated plants in history."

4936,"I've been embroiled with Epic Support and Fall Guys Support for roughly 3 weeks, and have lost nearly all of my earned/purchased in-game assets due to their ill preparation for cross-platform play.

1. When the game released on Switch, I attempted to link my Steam and Switch accounts to my Epic profile to enable cross-platform play. I repeatedly got error messages here: my Steam was already linked with another Epic account despite never taking this step and not having other emails/accounts that it could be used with - Yet when I attempted to sign into Epic using my Steam log-in information, I was prompted to create a new account. It was a Catch-22 where both log ins seemed to simultaneously not exist and be in use at the same time. I emailed Epic Support.

2.  I was prompted to upgrade my ""nameless"" account. This didn't work, as I still got the error message that my email was in use. So I still couldn't link my accounts via logging in through either Epic or Steam. Epic Support left me on read for 7+ days, despite me emailing back and asking questions about the unsolved issue, so I started a new ticket.

3. Through experimenting, I found that I needed to create burner emails in order to make new Epic profiles for Steam and Switch. This let me sign in, unlink my accounts, put in a request to delete the burner profiles, then sign into my actual Epic account and link it all together. Everything seemed to be linked.

4. Now Fall Guys won't load on any platform. At all. I emailed both Epic and Steam support, and am told to verify my Steam files in order to fix the Error Code 200_19002. I follow these instructions and the game will now actually load on my PC.

5. Plot twist: Despite being told that by linking and signing into Steam first, this would become my ""primary profile,"" that wasn't the case. The first time that I loaded up Fall Guys (after linking everything) showed me a completely blank profile without any of my assets: no kudos, cosmetic items, crown progression, achievements, etc. Epic Support told me to now email Fall Guys Support.

6. Fall Guys support tells me that they can move cosmetic items *only* to my new primary account and that the process can only be done once. I balk at this and ask for clarification: I do not want to move accounts, especially since there shouldn't *be* any other accounts, I simply want access to my Steam account. I ask questions to ensure that I would retain all of my assets and progression. When Fall Guys confirm that I would regain full access to my Steam profile, I give permission to make Steam my primary profile.

7. Welp, only my cosmetic items appear. Fall Guys Support now says that I can't access my progress or currency because they exist in an entirely different Epic profile. When I'm told this Epic ID, it is not one that I have ever accessed or even knew existed. Fall Guys confirms that it isn't associated with any of the emails or accounts that we had been dealing with over the past 11 days. When I question why all this is happening, I'm referred back to Epic Support and told to return once I have an answer from them.

8. I email Epic Support multiple times to get information on where this new ID came from, what log in credentials are associated with it, and how I can access it. I'm left on read for over a week. Finally I'm told that they sent out a new password link to the associated email. I hunt through my old defunct addresses and find one that I literally have not used in 10+ years, and reset the password for my Epic account that I've never before used.

9. Now the Epic website won't load for me. I can sign in, but trying to access my profile gives me an infinite loading screen. This doesn't happen on my actual Epic profile, and it doesn't seem to be an issue with my Internet or device. Support never gives me a response about this problem and instead sends and resends copy-pasted instructions on how to link my Steam account. Without Epic making any progress, Fall Guys support tries to close my ticket multiple times.


So that's where we are now, 22 days later. I've played Fall Guys extensively in the past, lost 110k kudos, lost my crown progress, lost my achievements, and am no closer to getting any of it back.

[Edit]: Solved! After Epic stopped answering my emails and Fall Guys closed my ticket twice (despite me emailing them back reminders that they told me to speak with Epic and then report back to solve the issue, and that the problem was still occurring), I found a roundabout answer. If I ""signed in"" to my Epic account via my Steam log in info, I was able to unlink my accounts without ever actually loading my profile page. This allowed me to link my Steam and Switch accounts with the new/old/unknown account and get my assets back. I am now apparently using the mystery Epic account, despite never being able to get it to load, but at least I have all of my kudos and achievements.  

This awful experience with Support has honestly killed any desire that I had left to play this game. It's hugely disappointing that something I enjoyed could be so thoroughly ruined by poor preparation and complete disregard for customer investment. I don't see myself supporting these companies in the future."

4966,"Back when I had purchased the game when it was first released it was a lot of fun. It catered towards the audience that wanted a free-for-all game to play with friends. It was repetitive sure, but still really enjoyable to play with friends. With this update to free-to-play I have never been so disappointed. The game is extremely buggy, almost impossible to load into the actual game without getting stuck on a black screen for 10 minutes, and overall an unfortunate downgrade of product. Crowns no longer matter, which is a huge thing in my opinion. What used to be a form of currency and reward for winning is no longer applicable. They transformed crowns into the currency ""Kudos"", which when you look into the new items store, is barely used at all, and the items Kudos are used for, are items that are unappealing and not nearly as exciting as the items you purchase with real money. What used to be a game that catered to the enjoyment of their audience has deteriorated into the real ""Pay to Play"" mentality. What a let down."

5023,"They made the game f2p on the Epic Games Store. I paid I think 30 dollars for it on steam. What they did is that they gutted the premium currency (crowns) which you could get for free and replaced them with ""Showbucks"" Now every somewhat decent item costs like 800 showbucks which is like 5 dollars. And they changed the shop UI and it looks like Fortnite but even worse. And the crowns you had from before were converted into Kudos, (the regular points) not showbucks. And their ""compensation"" was some dumb free items that i'll never use and look hideous."

5033,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Ever since they put Fall Guys for free, the game has blown up again with brand new players making it a lot better and more fun. I can definitely say that it is way more funner with friends and if your too bad then that friend/s can help you to them crowns (that aren't even a thing now but you still 'win' them). I recommend to play Fall Guys, and definitely don't get carried by Mr Americano-Mehico sweat, tryhard, 1st place in everything, sick at rdr2 guy. :)"

5137,EPIC GAMES? WHAT A F**** BACKSTAB DEV
5138,"They (those who run it) don't care about the game. Things like ""Tail Grab"" and so many more issues that just go on and they do nothing about it. Worst of all, you use to be able to buy things with ""crowns"" (a currency you get for getting first at the end in a ~60 player game, now they made it so you just have to spend real money. 

Also, if you think you can use a controller with it, you can't. They made those on PC who use controllers run at 92% the speed of those who are not on PC using a controller.

Look up things like ""Tail Grab"" and you will see the community has been begging for them to fix it, they won't. They have no desire to make the game good, simply a desire to make money now that they took the best part of the game out (crowns). 

Its not fun, its laggy, it doesn't work with controllers, game modes have been broken for 2 years with no fix. DO NOT PUT YOUR TIME INTO THIS GAME! FIND A DIFFERENT GAME! IF YOU TRY THIS GAME YOU WILL SLOWLY LEARN TO HATE IT AS THE ISSUES PILE UP AND UP!"

Some of the levels can be challenging but I love all the colorful stages and happy music. Plus, with all the skins and colors coming out all the time, it makes it worthwhile to revisit over and over.  I have it on both PC and Switch!"

5189,"I'm not someone who's a big Fall Guys player, but it feels like they went overboard with the changes. It feels like too much all at once.

This game went from an amusement park where you pay an entry fee to ride everything with a few small optional side purchases to a sleazy carnival where grifters try to take your money. The pricing isn't fair, and your enjoyment of the game is now limited entirely to just playing as-is. Thanks EPIC.

Half the game is the gameplay, and half is item/skin collecting, and anyone who doesn't want to pay the exorbitant price is cut off from half the game. Before, gameplay would reward you with currency used to purchase the cosmetics. Now, there's a divide between them, where you have to pay real money for cosmetics, and the gameplay earns you basically nothing. 

That split between both halves of what Fall Guys is, is the thing that will hurt it most. Playing more to earn the cosmetics you wanted was one of the reasons to play the game. The game now lacks a sense of achievement, something to earn, and the ability to get 99% of everything in it for free. 

I hope Mediatonic will realize that the core pillar of the game's gameplay loop is broken and could potentially negatively impact the game's retention rate. Meaning that they could lose all of the new players they gained from the shift to crossplay if they don't do something."
5190,very good
5191,fun very fun game
5192,was good when they didnt involve team games. they have lost me again after they decided to bring the team games back so good luck passing 2nd round when you are playing with a bunch of headless chickens

The hammers' handles, the spinning sticks on so many levels, and the only way to actually WIN, is to pray to RNGesus that the garbage physics, what obstacles spawn, where YOU spawn, and what level the game chooses are all on your side."

5272,"Epic game store got rid of the crown currency (which you got for winning/doing very well) and replaced it with in-game purchases. Essentially getting rid of half of the items unless you want to shill over a party game with baby mechanics. But they also made the game free, so idk, win-lose.

Still would recommend. Party games are pretty much all trash, but this one has some fun moments. You're shaped like a marshmallow and you have the movement of one. It's a party game, you go in for a couple of rounds for a laugh with friends, which it achieves well. You also don't have to deal with garbage RNG mechanics from games like Pummel Party and Mario Party. There's no collecting stars or tokens, last marshmallow shaped dude with a funny costume standing wins.

7/10 if you're playing with friends for like 30 minutes, 3/10 if you expect a good game"

5368,"I have been playing since I first started and I noticed that since the game has kept changing through the years, it has gotten better! TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT!"
5369,falld ovver
5370,I mean sure it's a fun party game with a lot of potential but there is a lot of unnecessary bs like forcing you to connect to epic games and also just remove the game from steam just like rocket league and the UI is just this weird combination of Fortnite and mobile games and it is very frustrating to navigate and there is a ton of downtime when you qualify you need to spectate other players which can actually be pretty fun but then you have to watch the players that didn't make it fall out which gets old very quickly and then it has to pick a new map and then you gotta wait for it to load and then they have the mario kart level display except the camera just goes all over the place and you just wanna play so if they just make the load times faster and remove all the stupid maps and fix the UI they have a pretty solid game because battle royale games aren't anything new but they were pretty much all shooters until fall guys came out so if you have a friend that you won't have to come first place every round to qualify it's a really fun game

5375,"You can't just remove progress and items, plus force people to create an Epic account just because you are greedy. I simply don't understand how ""gamers"" are ok with all of this, and similar situations. It feels like they cut the balls off of at least 90% of people who play games, and all they do is say ""Yes daddy"" when a greedy corpo slams them. 

Screw you Mediationic, but most importantly screw you Epic. If not for the mindless generation of kids, you wouldn't be able to get away with this."

5475,its fun
5476,"TLDR: Game changed monetization system, i hate epic games and epic launcher and i got spat on because i paid for the game.

bought the game in 2020

thought game was fun and cool especially with the way the item shop worked

mediatonic is bought out by epic games

more content arrives

2022 comes around

all free ways to get cosmetics are removed

this is exactly why i refuse to support epic games as a company, changing perfectly good business models for no apparent reason. they are always wanting money and people to use epic launcher but i say nay. yeah sure the epic store has timed exclusives i'm interested in such as voidtrain and railgrade (satisfactory for a while too) but they all moved to steam eventually and if i have to wait i will wait. i use origin and uplay because i have to and riotclient is just a client but the epic client is just more kibble i don't need on my PC, hell i'd rather use the microsoft store for my games than epic launcher. no matter how many free games you give away epic i'm not joining you'r platform and will never play and regret purchasing fall guys especially after the compensation i get is just a few skins, a battle pass and a name plate for paying £24 and being spat at because epic wants money...
mediatonic should've stayed close with devolver because they know how to make good titles as opposed to the massive soulless machine that is epic games

Fuck you epic and RIP mediatonic"

5648,"I remember when I bought this game in 2021. A key part of that memory involves the fact that, at that time, I was actually able to, you know, play the game. (For a few hours. I think I snagged it during a sale, tried it out for a bit, and then planned on playing it more substantially later.)

Now. in 2022, I attempt to start the game up. I discover that there are now about 10 layers of Epic Games garbage retrofitted to the game; and so in addition to taking forever to launch, it never gets past the very first ""Loading"" screen. I literally can't even make it to the main menu. I've done all the usual troubleshooting steps, and nothing works. [b]It's just completely effing broken.[/b]

Add to that the various other controversial changes apparently done to the game in the time since the developers/publishers sold their souls to Epic Games (these changes are well-documented by others), and the only message I can reasonably say I'm getting from the people behind this game is a giant middle finger.

I'm currently attempting to get a refund, since I bought the game under a particular understanding, and the game has been completely changed in such a way that it no longer reflects the buying decision I originally made at all. (For example: when I bought it, I did so on the understanding that I would be able to, like, you know, [b]play the game[/b], or at least even get to the main menu. And while this was possible at the time I paid for the game, it's no longer possible. Not being able to play the game is one fairly significant factor that would generally tend to make me not want to spend money on a game and buy it.)

[b]If the developers/publishers are going to take away my ability to play the game I paid for, then I think it's only fair that I be allowed to take away the money that I gave them, in good faith, on the understanding that I'd be able to effing play the damn thing in the first place.[/b]

[b]UPDATE:[/b]

For anyone who runs into the same problem I did: After an inane amount of time wasted troubleshooting this stupid problem, I have concluded that the infinite loading screen is, in fact, actually just Epic Games's intuitive way of informing you that you need to link your Epic Games account to your Steam account in order for the game to load. Their game overlay system is apparently broken or fucked or whatever, and so it just doesn't bother to show up and inform you of what the hell you need to actually do. This is genius-level game design. Also, if you weren't able to figure out that ""infinite loading screen means I need to link my accounts"", then you are probably an idiot who will be yelled at by other, definitely much smarter, people for not being able to figure out such an obvious thing yourself.

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

5769,"after the f2p update the game has become rlly fun, my only problem is the new cosmetic system. It made crowns completely obsolete and they no longer have any purpose, and it is almost impossible to get kudos now. On top of all this majority of skins now cost show-bucks which are essentially v-bucks but for fall guys and serve the same purpose as v-bucks do in fortnite. This is all cosmetics luckily so for me it doesnt ruin the gameplay experience, i just feel that the previous system in place with the store was much better and gave you a reason to go for wins."

5779,"If this is too long to read, let me summarize it: Love game, but show-bucks make things cosmetic-wise really annoying to acquire. Would still recommend the game, but if you’re looking to do anything cosmetic-wise, you might have to scrape up the extra 5$ just to buy one item. Crowns are also kinda useless now, same with Kudos. Would still recommend you give it a shot though.

I still love this game and love playing it, but I still have my complaints. Personally, I really love this game, it's cute art style and good game mechanics. The major thing I hate though is, that with the Epic Games take over, they changed the crown system. You now have to acquire something called ""Show-Bucks”' which you either have to earn with the season pass, or you have to buy. (Pretty sure you have to buy the season pass too, I just got it for free because I bought the game.) Over half of the cosmetics in the item shop cost Show-Bucks as well, so Kudos aren't as useful. It's also really annoying because now, the only reason for crowns now (That I know of) is to get your crown level up. They're trying to make the currency system more like Fortnite, which is really annoying because, with Fortnite, you really can't do much cosmetic-wise by not purchasing anything. Although this isn't a major problem, it's just kinda annoying because I like making the dumbest combinations, but I can't do that now because of this Show-Bucks thing. I would still recommend the game because it's fun, but if you're looking for cosmetics, you might have to dig in the couch to get that extra 5$ to be able to buy some Show-Bucks. Half the things in the shop cost like 500-100 Show-Bucks too, so that will take 5$ for 1 thing. I'm also not a fan of the newer maps, but that's probably just because I need to get used to them.

… I don’t know why I decided to write an entire essay on this lol."

5865,"The game was great until it went F2P and they made it so you need to buy real currency for most of the Item Shop Skins and Items, as well as skins previously obtainable from using Crowns in the store.
Being able to buy the cool Item Shop skins with Crowns which you earn from winning was so much better and actually gave you a sense of reward for winning and a drive to want to play more of the game and grind it out for more wins and then crowns to spend on more Skins in the shop.
But now the game just feels like a big cash grab and a slap in the face to players who bought the game and have been left in the dust to deal with the new changes and have absolutely no say in what happens and the way the game was adapted to become F2P, so yeah honestly it's a fun free game to play with friends but I most definitely miss the old Fall Guys system."

5882,"Another game that became popular during the pandemic, not as popular as Among Us, but still fun. I had to join in on the hype when it came out so I bought it. It is an insanely fun online obstacle course competition with colorful “bean” shaped characters that you can dress up. You play with other online players who race against each other to the finish line to qualify for the next round. There can be as many as 60 players and goes down each round and there are different courses that you can play.

I am absolutely horrible at it. I think I’ve only gotten to the third match once and the other times I could barely beat the 1st match and get to the second. I didn’t play that much because while the obstacle courses were straightforward, they were HARD!! At least for me. I would fall over and over and would be disqualified. Knocking into the other players and falling over and missing a jump. I kept trying though. Even though I kept failing, I still think its a fun game. I still plan to play periodically when I am in the mood for it."

If you're looking for competitive gameplay, and a game you can play everyday during very long sessions, do not play this game.

If you're looking for a good party game to play casually with 1 to 59 friends, then you definetly will like this! it's a very fun game to play.

5917,"As far as gameplay goes, its eh. its okay if you have friends, but other than that youre not enjoying the game as much as youre avoiding people who are either too stupid to walk in a straight line or people who are fueled only by satan's thirst for blood and grab onto you with their little snot-covered grubby little nubbins and man-handle you off the nearest edge so they can advance. even then, its a game you play maybe for an hour or two TOPS before you have to exit for your own mental stability.

Also, it took me 79 hours of mostly solo play to win a single game and from what ive heard from a handful of people, thats the norm. 

I bought this game when it actually cost money, and back then cosmetics are what made it kinda rad! You earned crowns via achievements or winning or leveling up, the cosmetics shop updated every day or so and you spent the coins and crowns on neat skins. As soon as it became free to play, then the crowns got dumped and turned into coins, and they replaced crowns with a new currency you could pay real money for. and that's how you get anything in game except for like five or six really mid-tier cosmetics. those are for the coins they converted all of the crowns into being. 


but hey, its free now. so its not like its some tragic loss if you hate it."

Discord is unwelcoming - I wanted to report it there but had to verify accounts only to find out I'd have to go to a support page and log in anyway. Too many steps just to reach out and let devs know ""Hey, something about the game is broken.""

Glad I remembered submitting a review on Steam is also an option. So... hey, devs. The ""controller settings"" doesn't let me exit out when I accidentally clicked it. Pressing the escape key doesn't work, either. No button to go back to menu/settings either. Just get stuck at the ""connect wireless controller"" screen. Reaching out to you about something this shouldn't be that hard."

5995,"Game ruined by Epic Games acquisition. The core gameplay loop of grinding kudos and winning crowns through matches, all to buy cool and rare cosmetics was removed. Crowns are now useless & converted to kudos, and kudos are simply useless due to not being able to purchase anything decent. What little there is to purchase with kudos is complete random garbage on a daily & weekly shop with a cooldown period, yet the shop reserves more than 50% of the item spots on microtransactions. 

Steam DLCs with costumes were removed & each costume is now an individual  microtransaction that is twice as expensive as the entire DLC pack on steam itself was."

5998,"is a fun time. i remember when it first came out, it felt repetitive by the time we got to the end of the season. Then the next season didnt really add enough maps to make it feel totally refreshed. stopped playing it after a while but now that it's been a couple years, my friends and I are getting some really quality games in because everything feels fresh and there's been multiple balance updates.

The implementation of the squad-specific qualification where your team gets points based on individual performance is also really fun

this game might feel a bit boring after a while but im glad to have it on the side to play every now and then. im all for having little periods of time where this game can be grinded for a bit"

I haven't touched this game in maybe 6 months, after game went f2p i log on and suddenly my crowns are converted to kudos and all the skins for kudos are bad, and the cool ones you have to pay real money for an in-game currency to obtain. But let's talk a little more about a new direction that mediatonic took.
[b]Season Pass[/b]
In the old Fall Guys, the Season Pass got you everything, and it was great. Leveling up didn’t take too long and the amount of costumes and such you could get was very nice. However, now in order to get the ‘good’ stuff, you now have to pay for it. On top of this, getting Fame is much slower, and losing Round 1 actually nets you more Fame than actually winning, which is such a basic design flaw that I’m shocked got through. Not very good overall

[b]The Shop and Currency[/b]
Hoo boy, where do I begin. Crown are no longer an actual currency, and instead Show-Bucks are here to take their spot, which is not a good thing. You can only get 300 Show-Bucks for free and the rest have to get paid for with real money. Something even more insulting is how costumes that were bought with Crowns as a sign of skill are now paid for with Show-Bucks. Onto Kudos, the fact that you can only get 200 a day is absurd, and you don’t get any by playing game! The shop is a complete mess and needs a big fix-up.

tldr: Mediatonic are greedy, lazy douchebags. Their goal was to make the legacy players get completely fed up and stop playing, as they would be least likely to spend actual money. MT doesn't give a shit if legacy players quit, they have all new players to farm info from and use predatory tactics against."

6253,"What in the world have you done to this game
- Loading takes ages and blocks all other applications (e.g. Discord)
- The Loading Screen after loading the Launcher Loading Screen takes forever to pass
- There's a ton of unnecessary overpriced microtransactions
- The party menu sucks. It's no longer the usual shift-tab from Steam, but Epic's special invention Shift + F3"

6256,"Another s*** battleground game with terrible
controls, terrible game modes, and obvious fortnite inspired cosmetic crap.

I’ll admit, races? Fun! Some stages are abysmal (slime climb, hidden path) but the races, are what I came to do.

However...

Controls? terrible. How does super mario 64, a game, that’s over 20 years old, still have the most fluid control for a 3-D character? This s*** plays like Bubsy 3-D.

short hop, long jump, dive, your character will randomly seize out on the ground. Roll about like he’s on fire, then recover. No amount of mashing buttons help.

Your jumps randomly do not happen. Obstacles, sometimes boop you, other times send you into the atmosphere. The physics are complete random.

Team games are s***. The terrible controls
become painfully apparent. Grab? Hardly works. You grab a fallguy with a tail,
nothing. Grab an egg? No you didn’t.

Also, for the love of god, why can you get into a team game with an odd number of players. Got eliminated on a 4 v 5 soccer game. Lovely.

Grabbing and collision should be toned down or removed for certain maps. Trolling or down right idiot players get you eliminated, and just sky rockets frustration.

Game is trash. This is nothing more than youtuber fodder, more ad revenue. More IT’S YA BOI, RAID SHADOW LEGENDS.
Expect to see this whored out like Mario Maker because lulz."
6257,"Honestly, this game is NOT made for those who take shit seriously in multiplayer games......

and that's a good thing!    Fall guys will teach you how to just have fun even if you get eliminated on the first minigame and get sent back to the menu"
6258,It's a fun chill game.  Not like other BR's which is good and bad.  I don't like waiting for people to finish but it is still a fun way to hang out with friends

6356,funny noobs
6357,"Now that the game is free to play, and owned by epic, the crown system and Kudos have become practically useless. The main way to get outfits is not by playing the game, but by using your credit card. The same skins that were completely free and that you earned by playing, take forever to even get CLOSE to unlocking without spending money. And the whole season pass system is just taking a page from Fortnite, trying to get you to spend money. would not recommend at all. A game does not need to be free, have a season pass, and be full of micro-transactions to be good. My final note is this. Epic, please make it like it was before. Remove the micro-transactions, or remove the new currency, and have kudos mean something again."
6358,very good

There are plenty of objectives to the game, whether you are looking to get stylish with a costume, or to become the very best and win as many crowns as possible. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a fun party game to play with friends. However, it is still a great game to play solo! If you are looking for someone to play with, the discord server has a really great community with plenty of people looking to play as well."

6395,"Fall guys was amazing way back in the beginning back when i first got the game. Recently decided to get back into it after hearing about an update. Gameplay wise: Still a good game, not that it matters reading this review, Epic games bought out the devs and ripped it off of steam. Cosmetics will be microtransactions from this point forward. Crowns mean nothing other than an XP boost. I do honestly suggest you play the game a bit because it is still fun with friends, but you're not gonna see the kind of crowd you did way back in the opening days of this games existance.
If you did buy the game on steam and have that gordon freeman skin, rub it in epic's face by using that. Thats one major Valve rep they'll never be able to scrub out of the game."

6405,Good
6406,"I am not a 45 yo father, probably not one of the oldest people playing this game. I am not a single father to my yet non existant Son, who is not 14 now. My maybe soon to be son got this game for Christmas from his yet non existant uncle, so we didn't install it on his computer and he didn't start playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game, sikes. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he doesn't exist yet. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my imaginary wife had died from non existance. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories, that i imagined. 

If you see a comment like this on other games, dont give the reviwer anything. Its just copy paste mafia for steam points.

6418,"Really fun battle royale game. More fun with friends but can still be fun if you're solo. Most of the rounds are great or fine, there's only a couple that are really bad (looking at you Tail Tag). 

I played about 80 hours in Season 1 & 2, played a little during 3 and 4 but then quit. The game was still fun but kind of boring when it first came out because of the lack of game modes and so many good items being locked behind crowns.

However I've gotten back into it thanks to the Free For All Update. There's way more rounds, you can play in squads with your friends to earn crown shards, and the game being free means it's easier to get more of your friends to try it."

6604,"I did it! I have ascended to the realm of people that own a game on Steam that is no longer available for purchase! A pointless flex, but you're here reading a review for a game no longer available on this platform so who's insane now!?

The Story:

You play as a jelly bean that fell into a nuclear reactor and compete against other jelly beans in lighthearted events for the entertainment of your corporate overlords. That's not canon so don't quote me, but seeing as this is a multiplayer party game there isn't much of a story to take part in. So I made up my own. Each round your take part in is referred to as an ""episode"" so it is obviously designed around the idea of a competitive TV show. 

The Gameplay:

This is one of those games designed to be amusing and not at all to be taken seriously. Similar to games like Human:Fall Flat and Gang Beasts. The physics are designed to be fairly uncontrollable and unpredictable while your avatar is thrown into mini-games designed to intentionally throw a curve ball at those wonky physics creating fun, unexpected and often rage inducing scenarios. 

The mini-games vary and they're adding new ones with each season, but the goal often revolves around taking part in some kind of race, endurance, memory or team related sport. It's chosen randomly each round, and you'll likely not like every event but I appreciate that they try to be innovative and create new game modes. You can compete solo, in duos or in squads of four players. Each mode has a starting count of 60 players and the losers are eliminated until only one player/team remains. 

Some Pros:
- Lighthearted ""battle royale"" party game. 
- Friendly for all ages.
- Is free-to-play on Epic.
- Is cross platform.

Some Cons:
- No longer on Steam.
- Can lead to controller smashing for you competitive types.
- Micro transactions (optional). Skins, season passes, etc.
- Can get old fast for some.

Conclusion: 

Fall Guys is an adorable game. If you're in the mood for something casual with your friends then this is high up on the recommendations list. Unfortunately to play it on PC now you'll have to hop over to Epic (blegh, blasphemy) but that is a small price to pay if you've been looking for something crossplay to jam with some friends who may not have a PC. Still. Don't let Epic ruin your chance of finding something you might really enjoy. 

10/10. Will fall again :D"

6692,"It's a fun game to hop onto with a buddy just absolutely blasted perchance. But now that they've ""updated"" their store, they've completely destroyed the old reward system perchance. 

Perchance... there was a time when the 30-odd crowns I painstakingly earned could purchase skins, but no longer. 
Perchance... there 'twas a moment in history where my kudos could obtain cosmetics better than drab gray ""common"" items they peddle in a minuscule part of the item shop, nevermore. 
Perchance... this game feels more like an Epic game as the months go by, late season updates, lack of creativity with the game modes (bring back sweet thieves). 
Perchance... this game is too big for it's own britches now and I wouldn't recommend it until it's just made free like I know they're trying to do. 

Too bad I already paid for this rotten mayonnaise of a game, perchance..."

6762,"Epic games that's all you need to know,"
6763,I much preferred the game when it had the free battle pass system and you didn't have to pay a fortune just to get a few cosmetics. I liked the game a lot more when it took time and felt rewarding when you finally have enough kudos or crowns to get the cosmetic you want instead of just paying some money out of your wallet. And back then you had the choice if you wanted to spend some money to get the DLC skins. In (my opinion) they should have just kept the game costing like 20 dollars and then you could get all the cosmetics free.

I didn't like EPIC before and they are not making any effort of changing my mind. It saddens me to say that I cannot recommend Fall guys as it is now because I actually like the game when I am playing it with friends even tho most of the other players take the fun away by constantly grabbing me and causing me to fall out.

So if you wanna play, play but do everyone a favor and do not pay so EPIC won't get profit out of such actions."

6819,"I wish I could get my hours back.

A whole development team made one of the most simple games in concept and failed so terribly that it's kind of funny.

1. The game is very buggy, such as the placement/qualification system, random teleporting shapes that can knock you off the map, the mantling system only working half of the time, and more.
2. Inputs regularly do not register (tested on multiple different input devices + experienced by other people I know).
3. Made the game free to play and gave the original paid players almost nothing in return.
4. They recently removed almost all opportunity for purchasing items without buying a paid currency.
5. Winning a match feels unsatisfactory, as you don't get enough rewards to justify the effort.
6. Cheaters run rampant. This game has had a cheater problem since the start and they have made minimal progress on fixing it.
7. The netcode is sub-par at best. Every player interaction is janky and laggy regardless of your performance/ping, and it has been this way since the start.
8. The maps are very unbalanced. There are maps that will leave only a couple of people qualifying and maps where almost everyone qualifies, and they are inconsistently placed at different stages of the match which ruins the flow of the game.

The only reason I play this game anymore is because of an occasional event that unlocks rewards in another game I play."

7014,"Pretty simple game, but it's unique and fun. Different take on a ""battle royale,"" but it ends up being a good time with a cute art style. Easy for new players to pick up, and although not very competitive, I'd say there's a little bit to learn and perfect"
7015,"I love this game, but I really hate Epic's anti-consumerism. Let people have choices, man, especially if the game first launched on Steam. It would be one thing if Fall Guys released as an EGS exclusive, but it did not, so the game should be on both stores rather than one since Epic now owns Mediatonic.

Furthermore, most people who do find themselves playing this on Epic probably will not pay money for cosmetics or skins, especially since it is a free-to-play game. Epic Games has resorted to use free stuff to entice people to use their store, which is fine, but the problem is that if everything paid isn't as appealing or isn't as affordable as what's on Steam or GOG, then no one will spend money on Epic, and their lawsuit with Apple seems to have proven this theory correct.

Epic, just give people a damn choice."

7043,"Epic'in satın alışı ve ardından son gelen güncellemeyle oyun epey keyifsiz hale geldi. Verilen paranın boşa gitmiş olması ve oyun içi mağazanın çoğunlukla ücretli hale gelmesi ve ücretsiz kısmın da (kudos kullanılan kısım) ciddi derecede yetersiz olması bir yana, oynarken %99 aynı haritaların karşıma çıkmasından bıktım usandım.

Normalde oyunda bir sürü harita ve oyun modu varken yeni gelen güncellemeyle beraber sadece belirli harita ve oyun modları ile yeni eklenen haritalar tekrar tekrar rutin bir şekilde karşımıza çıkıyor ve tüm oyun keyfini kaçırıyor.

Para konusunu boşverdim, sorun değil; ama en azından eski haritalar da oyuna sokulursa çok güzel olacak."

7066,"First and foremost, this only being free on Epic Games Store (you can still buy it for Steam if you get a key and redeem it), is a big downer. The only reason you should get this on Steam is if you want to make sure it's on your Steam profile forever.

Most of this game is just frustration and unfair Wipeout style games. There are some fun gamemodes/playlists, but they're mostly time-limited and not always available. The cosmetics are mostly locked behind the premium currency now that the game is F2P for all other platforms. This is would be fine if there weren't achievements tied to getting a full set of top-tier cosmetics.

The game also doesn't let you leave games after you've lost unless you want to lose your rewards. In team games you can only leave after the wall section where it shows who was eliminated. In solos you can't leave until that same wall section. In team games, if your entire team leaves, you still can't leave until the same point as if you'd lost the team game normally. If your team leaves in team games you are guaranteed to lose in any score related game mode (which is most, if not all) as well because the game won't balance your score for not having any teammates.

If any of the above paragraphs were solved this would probably become a recommendation, but all of these problems together make this not really worth playing."

7077,"Listen... This game is a key, a key to the truth.. it unlocked a darker truth within me.. all due to its overwhelmingly complex design, this game isn't some creation purely for the sake of entertainment instead it serves as a mirror showing the truth within me my desire to plummet to my death, my desire to play, my desire to be the KING at first these truths seemed to be self evident, however through my second dive into this masterpiece these mere awakenings i had previously experienced felt like a facade compared to the truth of what was to come once i learn of the ""pushing"" mechanic at first it was just merely a way to get ahead but it soon became my only desire i didnt want to win anymore i wanted blood i wanted to kill i wanted to see there ovular bodies splatter beneath my feet an unfathomable bloodlust was created and has started to invade its way into the real world my real world ive wanted to hurt those around me to get ahead...

7228,"Epic bought the game. I think it's needless to say why this is bad.

Also, I hate the people on this game, gosh, a crowd of brainless kids pushing you to your dead or just being an obstacle because of how bad they are at playing the game. Needless to say, I hate the kind of game in which your life can depend on some other people's thinking and decision making capacity because most of the time it really seem like they don't have a brain at all, not to talk about the people that purposely make you die on non PvP maps, I hate those guy with all my being. 

Even if you are a skilled player, people can still get you caught up in the crowd constantly, jostled about by forces not under your control and flung all over the place. The whole thing plays like a game of competitive Goat Simulator with more pastel colors, but just as impossible to control. The courses are full of unconsistent and uncontrollable obstacles, which send players flying off in any direction. It is entirely possible for the crowd to carry you into an obstacle, which then sends you flying off the map through no fault of your own. This makes me want to snap my keyboard in half.

In few words, Fall Guys is an entire game based on the premise of people with small brain capacity being in your way, if that's of your liking, get the game, I mean it's free on Epic, but if you are a sane and reasonable person please stay away from this thing.

7258,I like the concept its been better than ever this past week but when it first came out it was booming and then became dead and about a month i am hoping that does not happen again because they are starting to do more collabs so if you get this game now that it is free just dont expect it to be incredible it is pretty simple.

7341,"I love playing Fall Guys everyday. The game has a solo, duo, and 4 player squad mode in which players must complete objectives to qualify for each round. This objectives can include race to the end, survive fall platforms or avoiding being knocked off, or scoring points through hopes or getting balls into the net. At the end of each game you get different rewards, which allows you to customize your character the way you want to. Overall, the game is fun to play a couple hours a day for completing your dailies and weeklies and I would highly recommend anyone to pick this up and add to your steam library whenever you can."

7434,"Once Epic Games Bought This Game to put it on Epic Games Store, everything has become repetitive and there is no sense of new maps and originality. Literally why cant epic games just keep their hands off of a game to make the development of the game actually good. Yes, it made it more popular again, but now they are going to kill this game just like among us and rocket league. way to go epic!"
7435,remember 🐒🐒🐒
7436,"I bought like the only paid version of the game and was rewarded with the game being delisted from steam and made free elsewhere. Now I'm forced to link an Epic account, the cosmetics I got were also given to F2P legacy players, and all I have to show for it is a battle pass I didn't want and doesn't even give me anything exclusive anyway. It's a fun game, I just wish they had more respect for players who paid for it"

7452,Great game with friends Solos kinda meh
7453,Epic Games has removed the crown system (which rewarded players for playing the game) and implemented a shitty fortnite-esque item shop with hilariously overpriced garbage. Also the game is terribly optimized and has tons of bugs.

7459,"It wasn't great when you had to pay for the game. I already felt like FTP nonsense garbage when they introduced seasons and you had to unlock tons and tons of stuff. 

Having played it now that it's FTP.. holy balls do I miss the previous game. This game is GROSS with microtransactions now. It's an ugly confusing mess of currencies you can't keep track of.

As a game the central conceit is perfectly fine. The controls are solid enough though there are invisible bumps that still frustrating. The menu system is bulbous but hideous. It's awful to use in part because it has to service all the bloody microtransacting rewards you have to get so it's of course worse now that the game actually IS Free-to-play. Don't buy this game. Don't download this game. Stop rewarding awful games like this."

7481,Very fun!
7482,"It's really fun, I can easily spend hours on it. It's even more fun when you have more friends that play too. The only thing that I don't like is the new update and some of the changes that they made to the store like how most of the items or skins that you want now require Show Bucks and it's hard to get in game (unless you pay actual money for more) and your previous currency before the update is turned into Kudos (coins) but you can't really buy good stuff with your Kudos, but I'll still live, I guess. But overall, I really enjoy the game."

7537,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is one of my favourite multiplayer games. Each of it's mini-games are unique, fun, and utterly hilarious. Even after playing many, many rounds it's still fresh and exciting. In addition, Fall Guys' in-game currencies can be earned easily from playing, rather than paying.
Fall Guys has gone free-to-play on all systems, meaning the number of new players loading up into matches and experiencing this wild party game is bigger than ever"

7555,"i hope whoever had the great idea to create the bean game called ""FALL ON COCKS (GUYS)"" actually kills themselves and tells their family that it was because of me since i've been sending several death messages to their home and all of them containing: kys you bastard you made me break my keyboard.
then their family decides to sue me even though they have no evidence since i implemented an explosive that explodes when it detects that the creator is dead so that all the letters explode and no one has any evidence of me planning his death. you ask: how do you know the person who created fall guys is a male. because most males create games such as FORTCOCKS and FALL ON COCKS and THEY HAVE COCKS! do you love the fact that most people who create the most tension in the world are males? that is why i am hiring my beloved hit(men) to kill everyone in humanity except one ryan reynolds and jennifer lawrence. even though jennifer lawrence is too old they can have babies. why am i killing everyone manually and not just bombing them with the infinite supply of bombs i have? because bombing countries make them inhabitable because of the radiation. ryan reynolds and jennifer lawrence are singlehandedly going to repopulate the universe with ryan reynolds handsomeness and intelligence and jennifer lawrence cause shes the first woman i thought of. peace out!"

I also think it's disgusting the game is now free after many people like myself have paid for it, being given a season pass that I didn't want is so cheap. I'd rather have a refund.

RIP Fall Guys you were a great game until Epic put the nail in your coffin. Profiteering fat cats up to their usual tricks.."

The other 75% is luck. Play this long enough and you'll see what I mean. The in game physics make no sense, nor does the spawn placement.

7604,"I must admit that this game was enjoyable, but since it became a free-to-play Mediatonic title, the Fall Guys developers seem to have become completely enamoured with the cash. As a result, I don't believe they are concerned with the quality of their work or the fact that there are bugs in the game that have been present for more than a year. This makes me feel awful. They need to start paying attention to the players if they want to keep their game alive, even though I'm not a developer and have no idea what goes on over there."

While the minigames are fun, at the same time they are infuriating. There are certain games that are excellent such as treetop tumble, but there are frustrating games too, like seesaws. The promotion (called the crown clash event) with Fortnite and Rocket League is ridiculous, to get free rewards you must play 100 rounds of fall guys.

Overall, an OK game that I probably wont play much of.

I think the games are built like that that you cant win this because i was winning the entire time but he turned his cheats on and i lost. At the game with the buttons i only lost because i was flying but i didnt mean to and i wasnt enabled the entire game. Thats how i lost my 200 Winstreak and now i wanna kms and wanna jump off a bridge and ill never touch the game again. Worst 40 Euros off my life. So now i just played one more game and i got retarded player and now i wasnt able to win in any way. I was body blocked the entire time and i had to wait until i could go. Now my Friends are playing without me and i have to spectate. I would never play this game with Friends because always i have to spectate.

7753,"I did like this game a lot...and then they made it free. I liked that you could optionally pay for things but still earn cool cosmetics for free. It was one of the only big multiplayer games that did that. And now you HAVE to use showbucks in order to get anything good which you can't earn and have to pay for. The only way to get free ones is to go through all of the earned things from the season, and even then you only get 300. The minimum I've seen is 700-800. And we're talking minimum $8 for an outfit. Everything else is cheap and poor quality. They converted all crowns to kudos, which is essentially useless now. They only switch out the free store once a week. It's scummy and cheap, and I can't even play the game because their servers can't handle people so even if I wanted to earn those few free showbucks, I can't. Epic Games is a money hungry cash grab and rips the fun out of any game they take over."
7754,"I bought this game awhile ago so that i could play it when i finally had my PC, and no i have it. Just as epic buys it and it gets removed from steam.

7795,"A really fun and goofy multiplayer game. It is a Battle Royale style game but approached in a very different way. There's no looting, no dropping onto the map, etc. As soon as the game starts, you're competing and as soon as you get eliminated you can start again. In my opinion, that always beats the idea of looting for 15 minutes just to get eliminated in a couple seconds. This being said, if you're looking for a competitive BR, this (obviously) isn't the place. The skill cap is pretty low, but that's what makes this game fun; anyone can win/have a good time."

7810,"how to make meth : Illicitly manufactured meth is usually made by combining ephedrine or pseudoephedrine with other chemicals that are often poisonous or highly flammable. The mixture is then added to a solvent such as gasoline and heated to crystallize. Because illicit methamphetamine production is not regulated or supervised, and there is no quality control process, any number of cutting agents could conceivably be added to the process to dilute the drug.

The heating process is particularly dangerous, as there is significant risk of fire and explosion. The waste materials left behind are also highly unstable and combustible. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 1 pound of meth produces up to 6 pounds of toxic waste.

There are many detrimental health effects associated with operating a meth lab. Inhaling fumes during methamphetamine production can cause significant lung damage and other respiratory issues, while handling the various corrosive or poisonous chemicals can damage the skin and eyes."

7880,"I paid for this game when it was out. I guess Epic offered them a sweet cash deal that Mediatonic couldnt resist
and sold themselves out, made the game F2P, and Epic stealing away Developers from Steam.

This review is only negative due to the fact the game was fine here on Steam but now forces people
to open an Epic account which is what Epic wanted to do which is fish hook Steam players over to Epic
and hopefully they might buy other games in their store.

Now i do have an Epic account before the move but for the gamers here on Steam, and the annoyance 
that we have to put up with. Instead of the game just opening up and we play, we have to be sure we have
an account by Epic. 

I dont know why Steam would allow it but maybe Gabenewell doesnt know about it yet.

Steam if you get this, Epic stealin yuh games bruh! You gonna take that?"
7881,"Cashgrab with no added value to it.  Who wants paid battle pass with the same skins for everyone when we had random skins that we could grind for.

7891,"Well all I get is error codes every time I try to run this now since it was kidnapped by Epic because i refuse to use their Launcher I guess dunno...seriously eff Epic. Toxic arrogant petty minded company leaders,  I am so angry about this, unbelievable shady Corpo double dealing. Requesting a refund, its too late they won't give one but its my way of protesting."
7892,yes man i like it 8----D
7893,Nice game
7894,"While the core gameplay is still as fun as it was back in 2020 when Fall Guys released, I can't bring myself to recommend it after what Epic has turned it into in regards to earning cosmetics, which is the whole other half of the game, as well as the technical issues they caused when introducing the new ""cross-save"" system.

Everything used to be reasonable to earn and you couldn't even buy the high end currency, you had to earn it (challenges giving shards helped make that better as well) and even Kudos had some worth as they could still get you pretty much any items other than the Legendary and some Epic cosmetics in the store.

Now, nearly all items cost a new ""premium"" currency, Kudos has next to no value as you can only use them on common items which they offer only a hand-full of at a time, Crowns have basically zero value as you can't even spend them and they are just another battle pass, and items that you already own have been reduced in value (quite literally) to the point where a ton of legendary items are now just labeled ""special"" and don't count towards legendary item achievements anymore.

Also, the season passes cost 2,800 show-bucks and only give back 1,800 upon reaching level 100 so they don't even earn you enough back so you can afford the next season's pass like many other free-to-play games do as a reward to completing it. The free season pass only gives 300 show-bucks for level 100 by the way.

To top it all off, myself as well as thousands of other legacy players who have been playing since well before this new shift into free-to-play and actually spent money on this game had all of our account data deleted due to Epic's absolutely abhorrent new save system that doesn't even bother asking which account you want to set as your primary before wiping all of your old data to replace it with a brand-new save so have fun waiting for customer support if you didn't know to log in after the update on whatever version you want your progress from because they couldn't put in a simple ""Do you want this to overwrite your old data?"" upon logging in.

Even if you do get your data properly situated, there is no real cross-save as they claim to have. The only thing it does is sync your achievements and it even messes that up. No items, currency, or progress of any kind syncs across platforms so don't bother playing on two different versions because if you earn something on one, the other won't get it.

Also they de-listed this Steam as well as the original PlayStation versions, the latter soon to lose the ability to be played at all so good luck getting every trophy before that happens.

For players like us who've spent money on this game and played it while it was actually good, it's really hard to see what it's become immediately after selling out to Epic and taking up the F2P model. While they did give legacy players a few small items and the first new season pass for free, it feels even more like a slap to the face as all of those items should be easily obtainable by all players by simply playing the game. I know the game probably wasn't doing very well financially but I honestly would have rather seen the game's legacy go out in a heartwarming fizzle than to watch it slowly suffer the painful death it seems to be on the road to. Shutting the game down and moving on to other titles or maybe adding the option for offline play/P2P multiplayer and then shutting down the dedicated servers and leaving players to their own devices would have been a better fate than this.



TL;DR - Epic has sullied the reputation of this game and potentially the developers along with it. I hope Mediatonic got quite the check from this deal. I would say to not buy this, but they won't even let you anymore."

There's about 5 different variants of the few games they have (mostly obstacle courses and races) and they're very dull and barely stand out from each other. The physics are also a pain, considering the tight spaces you sometimes have to squeeze through, or the jumps you have to make."
8096,cuz of epic games
8097,"Played this game on and off since December of 2020. It was a great innovation seen within the gaming industry. A fun party game to enjoy with friends with an active dev team aspiring towards a road map of constant new updates. A game without in game currencies for microtransactions, decent prices for bundles ($5) and a way to progress to unlock everything excluding the 5 dollar bundles. It was no perfect game, but the in game progression was perfect in my eyes in comparison to other games in the industry. Now comes along Epic Games to steal the life out of this game and dying community so they can cash out on little kiddies using their mother's credit card. They COMPLETELY implemented the currency system used in Fortnite and to some extent removed the ability to get those items for free without  having to pay money or for returning players, grinding the hell out of the BP, which will in return only give you 1500 ""show bucks"". A halo bundle that comes with 3 low quality skins will cost you roughly $20. You can buy the Halo MCC for $16 dollars with the steam sale in comparison. You already know some kids and whales are going to buy the hell out of this, and most likely nothing will change. Without a viable way to earn in game items for free through progression as well as lowering the prices of these items, I see this game will lose the majority of it's player base; and what will be left are the young children and boot lickers Epic holds so dear."

8176,"had some fun in the first week of this game. it quickly died out for me and my buddies. should have not bought it to begin with. now this bs with epic games and the massive R A P E of the player base is enough to strongly suggest you avoid this game. epic games should be banned from this world. the other game companies should sue the dogcrap out of them and shut their greedy asses down. REFUND THIS TRASH!

Fu/ck steam and epic games. neither support their customers."

8190,"Used to find this fun, might still find this fun. But this new update has destroyed the game. It's 40 dollars for like 2 skins now, I can't even open the game, all my progress is lost and general progression is a lot worse now. I've never had a problem with Epic Games, mostly cause I'm an Unreal Engine user, but seriously, this is beyond stupid. Thanks a lot Epic"

8274,very niiiiiiiice
8275,"First Epic Games ruins Rocket League and then they ruin Fall Guys. When Epic Games first purchased Rocket League they claimed nothing would be changing. That turned out to be a lie, Not only did they destroy the trading market but they also dropped mac and linux support for the game with no refunds for players on those respective platforms. Epic Games killed Rocket League. They even made it so you can no longer see how many players are in a given playlist, only ""good"" or ""great"". I feel they did this because they are embarrassed that nobody plays that game anymore so they don't want anyone to know how many people are actually playing it anymore. Epic Games is anti consumer. It's disgusting to see Epic Games pay developers to take their games off Steam but with it happening to Fall Guys most recently, I don't think they plan on stopping anytime soon. In Fall Guys you used to be able to get cool cosmetics such as Scout from TF2 and Cuphead by just playing the game. Epic Games changed this, now you can only get these cosmetic items by spending real life money in the game. Mediatonic allowing Epic Games to do this to their game shows they lack integrity and I cannot respect them. Tim Sweeney, you are never gonna beat Valve. These anti consumer practices are only gonna hurt you in the long run. There is gonna be a point in the future when people move on from Fortnite and PC gamers do not forgive or forget as easily as you may wanna believe. Thanks for ruining Fall Guys"

But I know you have the stat because you track it for the achievements... idk. It's a game. Play it."

The new Halo costumes are impossible to get without paying money or grinding much more than what I had to before.

8395,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

8468,sad
8469,"Okay Epic, let's do some maths...

The average battle pass tier takes around 600 fame points.

With these laggy ass Epic servers, you can barely qualify 2 rounds each time you play, which makes it around 60 fame points per game played.

To get a tier you need 10*60 fame points, and you need 100 tiers in total.

That makes 1000 games to get to max tier... 1000 games!!! Are you out of your mind?

I barely hit 1000 matches on my favourite most played games. I won't force myself through a 1000 games of Fall Guys just to get my money back from purchasing this game back when it was paid!

We have to work ourselves through over 1000 games of laggy servers before the season ends just to get what we paid for in the first place. 

Another great example of Epic's stupid business decisions right here. Thank you for forcing me to play your laggy game for over 1000 matches just to complete the pass that you forced me to have for my money. Really appreciated..."
8470,anyone can play
8471,"Well done Epic you've gone ahead and ruined Fall Guys!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely disgusting that you're charging real world money for skins that were previously FREEEEE and not only that you're charging money for the Halo skins which is above all evil!!!! It would be understandable if they charged money for the new skins but it's filthy that once free skins cost money. It used to be eat, sleep, qualify, repeat but now there's not even any point in doing that as you can't even spend any of the crowns you earn on swaggy skins, instead they just add up towards poo golden skins when im sure people would much rather be running around as Master Chief...BUT NO YOU'VE GOTTA PAY £12 TO BE A COOL FALL GUY!!! This game is in the gutter now just like every other game that goes free to play, so thank you Epic Games... thank you for truly ruining a great game by getting your grabby little fingers all over Fall guys. I genuinely hope you see how much of a disgusting parasite you are and what you've done to the once great Fall Guys. DON'T BUY THIS ONCE GREAT GAME, OH WAIT YOU CANT BECAUSE THEY REMOVED IT FROM STEAM AND HAVE RUINEDDDDD IT!!!! New rounds are good though."

if youre starting from the Free to play era theres nothing wrong with the game, just kind of shitty to the people that bought it at some point to find out your purchase was p-much worthless :)

8751,I'd say it's a lot of fun playing this game with your friends (play&chat at the same time) but it's a little bit disappointing after it became free to play. The kudos which was extremely easy to get now becomes hard to get. And lots of new bugs appear after the update. And the outfits become more like Pay-To-Win stuff. The most annoying thing is that they took Crowns off as a currency. Crowns now are only a way to show your Fall Guys skill and you can't get anything with purchasing by crowns because you literally can't. Anyway the game is fun to play but the Free-To-Play update is upsetting ofc.

8833,"Fall Guys is a casual game that can be played by all who enjoy platform games. With practice it can be mastered!
I have been enjoying each new season of this game upon release. Certainly the gameplay gets repetitive after a while, but it's worth coming back for the new content! I have laughed endlessly seeing beans fall in the most stupid ways. The skins available are creative and can be purchased with in-game currency, although one can use irl cash to acquire them.
That said, the fact the publisher has closed its relationship with Steam is a bit shady to me, as it forces folks to turn to a different platform. I still recommend the game regardless for the fun of it though."

But seriously they removed the old system of getting cosmetics thru crowns and kudos both earned by playing and winning the game shows. A quick scroll thru the ingame store, straight copy of fornite btw with its FOMO shop rotations, nearly all items require ""show bucks"" the new game currency they tacked on and the ones that don't are glasses and flip flops. For the price of the original game it gets you a whopping 2 skins. Thats fucked up. Either pony up and buy the battlepass or be an old legacy player(gives you a free bp) if you still want to unlock anything worthwhile without having to fork more cash. Such a drastic departure from the original even with the f2p change. smh
Also LET ME HOST CUSTOM GAMES WITHOUT THE REQUIRED 10 PLAYERS. I JUST WANT TO MESS ROUND WITH SOME BUDDIES.

8905,"Fall Guys was fun when it first came out but the devs showed very little care and consideration for it, letting it stagnate rather than adding interesting content and fixing the bugs (primarily related to lag and desync). Two years later they have now pulled it from Steam and made it F2P. I understand the F2P approach for a dying game but the devs really dropped the ball here and rather than attempt to claw back their playerbase with good content they are hoping F2P just magically revives the game. If you're reading this consider installing it on Epic don't bother, it's fun for a while but gets old fast. The lag and desync is infuriating in the final rounds of games too."

I am constantly disconnected from the game despite great Wifi, scoreboards are consistently incorrect, and the game is constantly bugging such as not letting you leave the game or having a multitude of many errors. I still will play this game and hopefully I will love it again in the future. I have hope for it but its tiny and stupid things like this that would so easily be patched that tick me off because I know how little effort it would take to fix"

9005,game was so bad they had to remove it on steam and make it free in the epic game store. when this game came out it went hard for about 2 weeks then died faster then my will to play this game. it was not worth the $20 back then. and its not worth it now even though its free.
9006,I fell to this scam deal but I never regret that I got scammed to it. The devs really compensated the likes of me buying a paid game that went f2p business by giving for free the first bp and some worthy rewards. You can easily play it on Epic Games nowadays but it's only fun if u can ignore the Epic thing that is going on to it.
9007,baby game

9010,"Paid full price for the game, bought it on steam when it came out, wanted to try after free update to see what changed...

But it won't let me play. Because I downloaded the game on Steam -which is the platform I paid full price for the game- and apparently I cannot link it to my Epic games account through 
 downloading here.

I've never wished to rafund a game so bad."

9015,"This game was a tricky one at first. I came in thinking this was gonna be a easy fun kid's game. I was wrong. This game has tested me in so many ways physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I had put in so much work dominating in Solo Shows just to get shit on in the final rounds. After 200+ attempts, I finally got my 1st win. Once this game became free to play, it became so much more fun. Now all I do is dominate and shit on all the dog-shit newbies along with obliterating seasoned veterans in the final rounds now. I became a god at this game and it has changed my life. For better or worse has yet to be determined."
9016,yes

The annoying thing is that we don't get anything extra for purchasing the game, so it's $20 down the drain. Along with the fact that your Steam account progress is deleted entirely, I feel like they were asking to be hated for this."

I wish you new players the best of luck trying this game and trust me, it will be fun and lasting. Honerable mention is that you can also party up with friends and compete with them. Have fun!"

9103,"The free to play version is still fun but the economics of the game have turned from complimentary and rewarding to cynical.  A game that used to feel really playful and consistently rewarding now feels grindy and mathematical, paid and free cosmetics used to be good value for money now feel really stingy, and it can't not color the experience of the game as a whole."
9104,if you like darker more intense games maybe dont play this. if you like neon bean people flopping around on candy colored levels i 100% recommend. everything about this game is a little silly from the way you move to the costumes. still manage to rage alot tho

9175,p;;k
9176,"UPDATE SUMMARY :
They turned the game into a cashgrab by making currencies you get from playing useless.

General Details : 
They have a paid season pass now which is fine but even progressing through it seems impossible because of the reduced fame you get now from winning/losing rounds. But dont worry you can skip through tiers by paying not even with kudos but with show-bucks( game's in-game currency acquired only with real money). The shop is a total cashgrab now. If you only have kudos you can only buy like 5 bad quality cosmetics which by they way refresh every 5 days or so. So the possibility of getting a skin you like is almost down to zero.On the other hand the shop is filled with skins you can buy ...yeah you guessed it with show-bucks.The only currencies you can get from just playing or even winning are worthless and old players like myself lost their crowns and got kudos...useless.

Conclusion :
But the gameplay is free whats your problem man? The biggest problem is that winning does nothing now. The game doesnt reward play time at all . Just spend money and you get what you want. Its a shame honestly ."

9338,"While I love the gameplay loop and playing with friends is great. The F2P model is dreadful for legacy players. Crowns being converted to Karma is kind of an insult. While it would of been fine for the last payment model. Once this went F2P, the game locks all the great cosmetics now behind the RMC. So all the crowns that got converted into Karma will get you basic cosmetics.

The servers and stability has been off since it has gone F2P. Team modes have been consistent of spawning within' each other and being on the wrong side of teams. I don't know if this is intentional, but it really needs to be fixed.

Overall, I have to give this a 'Eh' review. I really wish their was a mixed review for Steam since that would be my final verdict. But I am going to have to trend towards a Negative Review for this game as it currently stands."

9359,"My boyfriend, of almost 18 months, and I have a pretty good relationship all things considered. I have a well-paying job and he currently is self employed and doesn't make much but we are hoping he will be making a lot soon. He moved in with me while starting his own business to cut costs. Before this I had maybe been to his place a handful of times, and it was always disgusting there, but he would blame it on his roommate and I would have no reason not to believe him.

However since he moved in with me he will walk around naked 95% of the time. This doesn't really bother me but at random points throughout the day, usually 3 or 4 times he will just stop whatever he's doing a jerk off on the spot. For example earlier today he jerked off on the coach and just came all over it and left it there. When I asked him to clean it up he was like ""in a minute"" in a tone like I was his mom.

He does this all the time. Cums and just leaves it. I found a pile of old cum in the spare bathroom last week I don't know why he's doing this I've asked him to stop but he doesn't seem to be stopping what can I do?"

It might be an issue with Steam rather than the game itself, but it is quite frustrating. I had the hope that I could solve a few of the issues by logging out and logging back in, but I can't log out because the game won't close."

Each different assault course/mini-game tests the patience of each player, but any anger caused feels a sort of ""funny"" sort of anger. 
(Watching your little character helplessly fall off a pink bouncing platform due to being pushed by someone you imagine to be: a 7 year old kid that is probably sat on a beanbag in his bedroom and screaming ""HAHA I GOT SOMEONE"").

Usually not a big fan of Epic Games buying rights to games to host on their own platform, but Fall Guys (since June 2022 changes) is a demonstration on how to do this the RIGHT way, and fall guys has changed for the better. (A big part of this being because it is now free).

Look forward to the map editor/builder update that is coming!

9618,"game was great until F2P update. im fine with most of the changes (skill based matchmaking, console players etc), love the new levels, but the introduction of show bucks makes the game feel pointless now. Before, you win and got crowns, which could be used to get the cool costumes in the shop. Now, wins are only useful in large numbers, for the crown rank that you unlock every couple dozen of crowns. all the costumes cost show bucks, and i'm a third of the way through the battle pass with like half a costume's worth of them.

severing the link between actually playing at the game and getting costumes makes playing the game feel pointless. i would be fine if wins gave you even a tiny amount of show bucks (like 10-20 when costumes are 800), but they don't. i have hundreds of hours in this game, and im sure a large percentage of them were playing specifically because i wanted enough wins to buy a costume. this incentive is gone, crowns are barely useful, kudos still have little to no worth (which makes converting crowns to kudos instead of show bucks frustrating), and every skin costs like 800+ show bucks. its just extremely frustrating that such a fun game has become so unrewarding."

9646,"This game is fun again, I think they need stop repetition of maps. it gets super annyion over time like for example i play 8 hours and all i saw was just repetition of map. Plus they need get sloth skin bottom and upper part and face etc. brown colors.  This game only hype last around new event. They need bring more content such like rank system after u lvl up up to max. and more skin to buy from kudos. its not a lot u can buy from kudos sadge. People so toxic when they start out of bat grab you moment match start get super annyion. Would be cool choose how much amount player can join in custom lobbies. Which can be super helpful for Streamers they can limit their lobbies player to join. Some streamers got more than 60 players watching them want to join. They need fix some bugs and connection disconnect even if you got the best fiber internet. There always someone after hours start crash. I got so much idea for this game. But devs need just listen keep the hype going. To not make this game plan B. If someone want break from warzone or apex or any shooter gamer that someone want break from."

9661,I think Fall guys is the coolest game ever! What isn't great about a game that you can jump in! And i think that it is great that it is also the first ever game invented and it's still popular! I think that everyone should play it because it is super fun and I think that it could be everyones favorite game ever it is the best by the way and I think that it is cool by the way and you should go plahy it! It costs nothing and if you dont like Fall Guys then you are dumb! Fall Gusy is super duper fun and no one can say anything to change my mind. So everyone play Fall guys okay? It may be the best game ever and it is the best game ever play it now right now
9662,the only thing that is slightly dissapointing is that it is not its own game anymore and it is run by epic games tho another thing is that i did not get my legacy pack even though i bought the game in 2020

9749,"Another game getting thrown head first into the dirt thanks to Epic's Fortnite kid profits. First Rocket League and its trading economy becomes horrible due to Epic buying the developers and now Fall Guys is getting the same treatment; all fuelled by their jealousy towards Valve.

Fall Guys, just like Rocket League, is getting removed from Steam. Essentially getting 'bought off' of the Steam Store.

Tim Sweeney really needs to get over his Gabe Newell envy. It's just screwing over the customers and their freedom of choice, it's not making things better via bribing or out-right buying developers just so you can forcefully remove games from Steam or prevent them from ever releasing there in the first place - or for a limited time like the recent Final Fantasy 7 Remake bribe money they gave to Square Enix to delay release on Steam for half a year.

Keep your 'console war' type mentality as far away from PC gaming as possible, Epic. You're a bunch of sellouts who mostly abandoned PC gaming back when Gears of War became popular. Now you come running back after companies like Valve, old Blizzard and various Indie studios revived the PC gaming market.

Epic Games are making Electronic Arts look like a better gaming company by the minute..."

9764,"At launch the map selection was poorer than expected, limit quality of life for teams and outfit selection left something to be desired.

With the multitude of updates behind it and now the F2P model introduced, Fall Guys is 100% worth your time either solo or with a group. More maps, more costumes, more game modes. The core idea was always great, it just needed the extra time to build around that."

Then there was a rocket that took me to space and then I was pregnant with Jar Jar Binks. it was a wonderful trip and there was nothing wrong about it. Honestly would recommend going to space and doing that. Then I went home and I played this. I left my family to go pro and then my pc caught fire and I couldn't play. Almost 2 years later I am writing this recommendation to show how amazing this has changed my life. I love you Fall Guys and I would play this game for hours if my pc didn't catch fire. My family is with me now, thankfully I didn't pay child support. I have to go now, my wife is mad I'm on steam again after 2 years sober. Goodbye :') <3"

9864,"Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds may have popularised the last player standing format, but Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout has truly unlocked its potential by painting it hot pink and putting it in a hot dog costume. Mediatonic’s family-friendly formula is a colourful, bouncy breath of fresh air that takes a different, less explosive approach to battle royales without losing any of the tension. Instead of C4, it’s Vitamin C you’ll be steering clear of as you’re bombarded with monstrously overgrown oranges in just one of its two dozen game show-like events. The vast majority of these minigames hit the mark, offering fun and frustration in equal amounts. Couple them with a vibrant aesthetic and a brain-tunneling soundtrack and Fall Guys manages to make you want to punch the air when you’re winning and scream at your screen when you’re losing, but you’ll be laughing either way.

The concept of Fall Guys will be familiar to those that have seen game shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle. Guide your very own customized jelly bean avatar through up to five rounds of inflatable carnage and you’ll have a shot at taking home the crown. Each match is framed as an episode and lasts around 15 minutes at most, which further drives home that TV show feel. The controls are simple with running, jumping, diving, and grabbing as your only tools to navigate obstacle courses, avoid enemies, or cling on for dear life in more survival-centered events that threaten to plunge you into the slimy depths. If you do happen to get eliminated then you have the option to watch those remaining battle it out for the title while the musical equivalent of glycerin is poured into your ears. A game show is only as good as its games though, and this is where Fall Guys’ current pool of 24 largely triumphs. The obstacle course-style races are where I’ve found the most enjoyment, especially as it gets down to the wire as beans bounce off one another and desperately lunge for the finish line trying to make the cut.
I’ve been particularly enjoying the havoc of Hit Parade and the precarious spinning platforms of The Whirlygig, which often descend into chaos as twenty too many characters try to fit through a small gaps or all jump for the same narrow platform. There’s always more than one path to take, some offering a high risk-reward option, which is welcome as it never feels like you’re completely out of a race despite being near the back of the pack. In Door Dash you hurtle towards the bottom of a track attempting to dive through doors, some of which will blast open, whereas others will stay firmly shut. There’s a simple pleasure found in walking through an opening as the opponent next to you slams face first into a brick wall. But games that rely on silly physics can often take as much as they give, as seen in See Saw, which varies from the other races in that it can become incredibly frustrating almost instantly. The whole course consists of multiple enormous seesaws, funnily enough, and largely relies on your fellow competitors understanding how these playground apparatus made for toddlers work. It’s baffling how very few of them appear to, as you’ll find yourself sliding off their hopelessly titled platforms again and again due to, you know, basic physics. Then there’s Slime Climb, which is notably more difficult than most and served as my nemesis for many of my early hours playing Fall Guys. It’s a real sorter of the wheat from the chaff as slime slowly rises and you battle the clock, your opponents, and a mountain of obstacles. While most events usually cull Fall Guys’ initial pool of 60 players by about a quarter to half each time, it wasn’t uncommon for only a handful of players to be left after this event. But there is nuance to master here, and I soon found myself able to succeed where I once so often failed, now able to consistently conquer the climb and no longer audibly groaning when it appears in the rotation.

That said, there are no offline modes in Fall Guys currently, so that mastery only came out of a lot of online losses. There’s no practice area to get to grips with the two dozen events, but more crucially there isn’t any scope for local co-op. It feels a bit of a miss to not have the option to play split-screen or against the AI in your own private matches. Most of the fun I’ve had with Fall Guys has been when playing with friends, whether that be cheering them on once I’ve already been eliminated or laughing at them as they get hurled into the abyss thanks to a 20-foot long banana. What’s a party game without a healthy dose of schadenfreude, after all? Another small but similar disappointment is the limit of a maximum of four players to a party, which is the only way to ensure you’ll enter the same tournament together. I can only think how fun it would be to have a lobby largely populated with people you know battle it out for the crown. With this in mind, the option to create your own custom matches and playlists would be the feature right at the top of my wishlist for the future. Another reason for this being so desirable is that while most events are highly enjoyable, some Fall Guys rounds, well, fall flat. These include Perfect Match, an all too simple memory game that results in very few eliminations and – most criminally of all – is just a bit boring when compared with the mayhem found elsewhere. Any of the rounds that include the ‘tail tag’ mechanic can become an exasperating affair. At their core, they require you to chase opponents around an arena and grab their tails from them. This can often become an exercise in futility, however, as the grab mechanic often doesn’t latch on to them unless you’re very close, and getting very close is a challenge due to the fact that you are moving at the same speed as the tail’s current owner. It’s disappointing that this mechanic is recycled in three separate games, especially when one of those is among the three ‘finals’ events meant to be the climactic end to a match. It can really take the wind out of my sails to see Royal Fumble as the crowning event after fighting hard to get there. Then there’s team events. When partied up with friends these can be the highlight of an episode as you work together to achieve your goals – quite literally, in some cases, as you can play bitesize games of soccer. Conversely, they can be the most infuriating part of Fall Guys if your team members are not pulling their weight. I understand that this is a risk with playing any online team game, but it feels at odds with Fall Guys’ free-for-all nature at times when you’re left helpless as a teammate scores another own goal. Thankfully any frustrations are soon forgotten if you manage to get that all important crown at the end. Whether that be quite literally grabbing it at the summit of the frantic race finale Fall Mountain or being the last left standing on the disintegrating geometry of the surprisingly strategic Hex-a-Gone. There’s a distinct sense of accomplishment and pure joy that the best battle royale games give you when grabbing a victory, and that feeling is the clearest sign yet that Mediatonic has got it right with Fall Guys."
9865,fun game
9866,"Fun game, but be honest...Mediatonic dropped the ball with this game repeatedly.  I get the anger at Epic for buying it and making it an exclusive, but if that didn't happen, this game would likely be dead and gone.  It isn't the best situation, but at least you can still play it."
9867,the game is fucking dogshit
9868,"- Paid for it 20€
- After a year turns Free 2 Play
- I lost thecrowns that I saved to buy my favorite skins when they show up on the shop
- All skins now are bought with real money like Fortnite and you can't even buy them with the crowns
- Crowns are turned in to a progression bar to get sh*tty golden skins and other sh*tty stuff. That doesn't gives any incentive to put some effort on winning.
- Paid game owners recieved a sh*tty skin pack
- Paid game owners recieved the battlepass worth 10€ for free

With those changes to save a dead game do they really expect paid game owners to be happy happy with it? Like common not even giving us the value of the game or turning our crowns in to the new real money coin?
This feels like the game developers taking a piss and sh*t in our mouths.
Only the new free 2 play kids on Epic Games are happy with it since it is like Fortnite now

9900,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well."

9911,"I'm convinced winning is a myth. I have finally came to the conclusion that its a skill issue and these 7 year olds are simply just cracked. Enter at your own will because after one game off jam packed fun it makes u want to rip your skull out and hysterically scream.
 I have watched infant after infant grab that crown in front of me and today is the day i finally give up. They won and i can only hope that the same fate doesn't fall onto you as well. Good luck."

9940,"They screwed legacy players. Now that the game is free to play, they've introduced a new currency system. Now I don't really have a problem with a live service game doing this, they gotta pay the devs. But to take the old crown currency from the early supporters of the game and convert them to the free currency was a little annoying tbh, but I get it. But to have item shop skins that were previously purchasable through the old crown currency now locked behind a premium currency is wack. If you were going to do this, why not have it be locked strictly to new developed skins? i don't get it, and it makes me not want to support this game. Sad."

Thats why the game playerbase plummeted. It gets old after weeks let alone months. Enjoy the temporary boost now because in 3 months from now you'll b at rock bottom again.

9964,"The gameplay loop and the levels are still super fun to play, even if the change of season introduced a myriad of bugs.
Now, not only did this become an Epic exclusive, but the now Free To Play model implemented in the game is. currently, complete garbage. If you want to play for the fun of playing, then by all means, go for it. But if you want to progress the battle pass and/or have any sense of progression, then prepared to get rear tickled. 

All Crowns have been coverted to Kudos, which are now basically worthless since all the (once regular) decent cosmetics are locked behind Show Bucks, and not a small amount at that. There's a hard cap on how much Kudos you can get daily, since you only earn them completing daily missions, and the amount of Fame you get with shows has been nerfed to oblivion; it is more Fame-efficient to lose shows so you can get into another game faster than to win. How could Epic/Mediatonic screw the very much functional and rewarding Fame system from the previous seasons is beyond me.

Epic will be the downfall of this game. Fuck Epic Games."

9984,Game became shit.
9985,"This game used to be a favorite. Maxed every season fame pass. However, Epic has ruined it with its Free to Play model. 
There is no longer any sense of progression. Most cosmetics are now gained through micro transactions. There is no incentive to win anymore as crowns are practically worthless. If you only care to log on and have some laughs with your friends, then sure, you can still do that. 
Win or lose, doesn't matter. Crowns are worthless. Kudos are worthless. Your wallet is everything. 
RIP Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout."

Still playing after the free to play, Ep*c exclusive update, though my brief experience with it has me telling you not to give them any money.
Why?
[list][*]Fortnot business model, with free and premium season pass [*]only common cosmetics can be bought with kuddos, all else is premium currency. But not all commons? Saw one listed with premium currency. [*] [strike]Hunt game mode in squad games. Had two horrendous experiences. Just randomly eliminated when no squad qualified, and still having other rounds when on the only team that did qualify[/strike] Apparently a bug that exists that doesn't update the teams qualified except your own, thus remaining at 0 or 1 [/list]

It's still a fun game, but it's being harder to see why it is fun."

I hope taking the epic games store money was worth it better hope with the f2p model that you keep your anti cheat good and bots under control more importantly lets see how quickly the pricing of ""special skins"" goes up but hey that's alright you gave all those who paid full price for your game 15$ worth of content for ""free"" how about a refund for people who bought it recently that sounds like a better bargain to me after all epic can foot that bill."

10182,"good game, now free on the epic store.
for those who don't know, epic games is trying to compete with Steam because Steam is taking an absurd 30% cut from the developers revenue, while Epic Games is only taking 12%.
Epic Games even said they will put Fortnite on Steam if Steam will lower the cut they are taking.

Games should be supportive of Epic Games' initiative, more revenue for developers means more and better games, while more revenue for Valve means absolutely nothing."
10183,"[H1]So what's it about?[/H1]
Think Squid Game but colourful and happy. Or think Takeshi's Castle. You're a fall guy and your mission is to finish first through different kind of obstacles course.

[H1]The good[/H1]
It's colourful, the level design is great and the music is cool.

There are a lot of unlockables although all of them are just cosmetic: the fall guy you start with had the same speed and abilities as the one at level 50.

It's friendly multiplayer - no toxic community! Even when you lose (which will happen a lot) it's still a fun experience.

Since the update you can now cross play with other players on other systems.

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
Since the update the game has become more like a mobile game: F2P with cosmetics that are more expensive than the previous DLCs :-(. 

The progress system (well just to get more cosmetics) is now behind a pay wall. If you want that new cool costume be prepared to pay. 

The season pass is grindy and it's not rewarding to complete. 

You now need to have a separate login for Epic Games even though you purchased the game on Steam.

[H1]Summary[/H1]
Fall guys is a cute and simple game that is great to be played with friends. If you don't care about progress, season passes or expensive cosmetics then go for it (although you can now only get it on Epic Games as the Steam version only exists for those who purchased the game). However if you get annoyed about different F2P tactics in tempting to get you to spend more money on one outfit than what the original game cost just look for something else.

As a buyer of the game I feel I have not been treated well: I got a season pass which is grindy and some ugly cosmetics. Other than that I'm just considered a F2P player and will fall in the same category as anyone else. But I guess in the end it's just business with little emotions involved: F2P might be more financially successful so the existing player base doesn't matter anymore. With this in mind I can't recommend the game."
10184,It is fun but when I loose I want to smash my keyboard.
10185,its free now :(
10186,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Down hill boys down hill.

10205,"Kinda lost everything I had before it going free, but I already contacted support. Everything aside the game is pretty fun 9.5/10"
10206,"I've been playing since the first season and after less than a week of is being free to play I can safely say this will be my last season... it's become very clear, very quickly that this game now intends to nickel and dime us out of every penny they possibly can. Skins that would have no doubt been released for Kudos (earned by playing) in previous seasons are now being sold for between 800-1200 show bucks each. With the smallest amount of Showbucks available to purchase being 1000 for £6.49
There are also MANY fresh bugs that have appeared since it became free to play which if other EPIC backed games are anything to go by will not be patched out unless they effect EPIC's bottom line."

10228,First off I don't have a hundred hours I left it on once I more likely have like 30. This game gets worse as they update it the team games are completely based on who you match with a third of the games are horrendous to play and are no fun. In between games it takes like 2 minutes to swap rounds and more time then the game itself takes. They've improved this I'm pretty sure but there are hackers who just win without anything you can do about it. Also just download epicgames and get it there for free instead of wasting like 20 bucks on this game like me. But its fun doing it with Buds.
10229,funny game and nice graphic
10230,Doesn't work anymore
10231,Was a good game until epic games decided to fuck it up hard.
10232,"The game is great, but since it is no longer sold on Steam (thanks to Epic trying to become the worst company in the history of gaming), there is no point in typing this, right?

Well, I don't care.
There is also no point in waving your middle finger around, and yet you still do it.
Because you're freaking angry, and you want to show off your disrespect.

That's what this is.

I don't blame Media Tonic (entirely).
The game dropped off harder than my drunk uncle, but it is unique and genuinely fun.
It deserves to stay alive.
Selling it off to keep the lights on does make sense.
It just sucks that they decided to go with Epic, which is the single most anti-consumer company in the entire industry.
I assume they didn't have much of a choice though, so no hard feelings there.
It's just very unfortunate.

...and then came freaking Epic and decided to be anything but epic by removing the game from Steam.
Every platform is allowed to have Fall Guys on it, except Steam. Because Epic hates Steam.

I'm sorry, but what year is this? This is 90's playground behavior.
If your service is so great, why do you have to resort to sabotage?
Shouldn't you be focusing on improving your own service instead?
It took Epic YEARS to add a freaking shopping cart.
That's how little they care about your experience on EGS.
They think you're stupid, and that all you care about is games.
That's why they give you free stuff and try to coerce you into buying their ""exclusives"".

Yes, we do care about games.
That's why we want them on as many platforms as possible.
So more people get to actually play them.

In my opinion, you have to be a freaking sociopath to pull the crap Epic likes to pull.
They're the Cringe Lords of the gaming industry with their embarrassing publicity stunts.
""LiTeRaLlY nInEtEeN-eIgHTyFoUr!""

Get the frick outta here, dude.
You're cringe, nobody likes you, there is no reason for you to be here.
All you have is billions of dollars that you took from children.
You're no Steam, you never will be on the same level as Steam, and more importantly: You are not one of us.

Screw you.

PS: I'm giving this one a positive review regardless. The game itself is good, and there is no reason to influence people's purchase decision anymore, as the game is obviously no longer available. I also don't want Steam to come after me for basing my recommendation on outside factors. If you want to play Fall Guys, consider doing it on a platform that isn't EGS (though all in-game purchases will still help fund the oppressive Epic Empire, so be aware of that)."

10245,"Once again, Epic Games sticks their greedy fingers into anything they can get their hands on. Their recent overhaul monetizes the hell out of the game, and they've screwed over long time players.

1. You're no longer able to get rare skins through playing the game alone, you now have to pay. The free currency (that was already a decent grind to get) can only be used to buy common stuff now.

2. Previously, crowns were typically used to purchase rare skins. They were only obtained through high placement, or very slowly through leveling. Now that crowns have been removed, there is far less incentive to actually grind and get good at the game.

3. Skins that used to be event exclusive are now being sold in the shop, which is unfair for anyone who had them.

4. Old legendary color skins are now common/rare, which is also unfair for those who had them.

It's been a good run, but I'm through with this game. There's literally nothing to play for anymore. I cant even finish the last achievement on my steam list without forking out cash, even though I ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME.

I hated Epic Games with a passion before this, and somehow they continue to find ways to remind me to keep hating them."
10246,"f2p update actually made this good, i can play with literally anyone now and the game is actually more fun than i remembered. very pog"
10247,"This game is fun but with many minor annoyances. It is a fun party game that is surprisingly difficult to win despite being so simple. The season pass does what any season pass is supposed to do and encourages you to keep playing and doing well. It is not a new mechanic by any means, but the amount of rewards you get for how good you do feels very balanced, and encourages you to do good. Unfortunately, many of the minigames are frustrating and boring, and it is not randomized well, and you will do the same one often. Also the load times are awful, it takes so long to find and load into a game, and if you lose quickly you have to wait forever just to try again. Overall it is a fun game, but you will end up waiting just as much as you are having fun."

I have yet to figure out how to play with only 2 people an no one else, but it does have a 'squad show' that allows you to be in groups of 1-4 with a total of 60 people in the show. Certain shows are more challenging than others and they are not all races. Some have you stay within a certain zone for a percentage of time, others have you pop bubbles and at least one of the shows challenges are to avoid getting kicked out by rhinos. Sometimes it seems like certain shows get repeated a bit too often which is a bit frustrating if you want more variety or simply don''t care for that particular one. Unfortunately this game has froze up on more than one occasion (for me and my friend). Overall this game is fun and family friendly but it can be repetitive and is definitely not a game for those with motion sickness."

10377,"Another game getting thrown head first into the dirt thanks to Epic's Fortnite kid profits. First Rocket League and its trading economy becomes horrible due to Epic buying the developers and now Fall Guys is getting the same treatment; all fuelled by their jealousy towards Valve.

Fall Guys, just like Rocket League, is getting removed from Steam. Essentially getting 'bought off' of the Steam Store.

Tim Sweeney really needs to get over his Gabe Newell envy. It's just screwing over the customers and their freedom of choice, it's not making things better via bribing or out-right buying developers just so you can forcefully remove games from Steam or prevent them from ever releasing there in the first place - or for a limited time like the recent Final Fantasy 7 Remake bribe money they gave to Square Enix to delay release on Steam for half a year.

Keep your 'console war' type mentality as far away from PC gaming as possible, Epic. You're a bunch of sellouts who mostly abandoned PC gaming back when Gears of War became popular. Now you come running back after companies like Valve, old Blizzard and various Indie studios revived the PC gaming market.

Epic Games are making Electronic Arts look like a better gaming company by the minute..."

10462,Stressful but good
10463,"Im not sure why people are complaining about epic making the game free, honestly with this new update they made the game way more enjoyable then it was before. The new gamemodes are awesome and i think what they give us for paying for the game is fair for the 20 dollars that this game originally was. The only downside of all of this is that there are a lot more micro-transactions since the game became free. They also added a new currency that can only be obtained by purchasing it kind of like v-bucks in fortnite. But with that all out of the way, if you haven’t got the game on steam, now is your chance to grab it for free! 8/10 game"

10520,"For some reason, this game suddenly reminded me of Human Fall Flat. Both games are also casual games, but one is extremely boring and the other is very game. Fall Guys is an interesting game. In terms of gameplay, it can be said that you chase after me. Best of all, the game is cross-platform so I can play with console players."

"
10525,Epic.
10526,Fun game
10527,"There is a lot of bugs right now, i cant recomend this game. All this problems should have been fixed before the free release, i cant belive a big company like Epic Games cant have servers that can handle the new players. Plus they are taking too much time to fix the problems/bugs that make the game unplayable, every day a new error/bug appears. For that reason i would recomend trying the game in a few days/months, because right know its broken.

Edit: (27/07/2022) Its still bugged. Sometimes we are playing and we get a disconected message, other times we just get send to the menu. There is still many bugs. Plus in case you care about skins, they costs now 10€/20€, its just too much for a skin. 

There many other reasons and problems with the game but i will make a better review later with them."

10536,.
10537,good
10538,"What a shame. The game used to be fun but now it's just another micro-transaction scheme (battle pass, special costume, etc). The stages for the new season is just a reuse of old obstacles. No creativity. Then there is another whole problem of Epic being, well, not so epic. I tolerate having to make Epic account but entirely removing the game from Steam and adding micro-transaction? Good bye!"
10539,"A complete gut punch to all those that purchased the game.

I enjoyed Fall Guys for what it was but I regret what it is going to become."

10566,"FUN

10567,so creamy
10568,"Look, it's not rocket science. I had one too many heart attacks in Darkest Dungeon and needed something a little less stressful to play. This did the trick nicely.

Pre-F2P, I wholeheartedly recommended this game. I didn't mind purchasing it because the in game economy felt fair, items were unlocked at a generous rate, earning currency wasn't too much of a grind, and the prices in the store were reasonable for most items.

Post-F2P, there are some problems. The currency has been severely nerfed. Crowns are now worthless aside from gaining Crown Tier prizes, Kudos used to be given out generously, but are now given out at a much slower rate. Of course, you can purchase premium currency, but the exchange rate is pretty bad.

Despite some disappoints with the recent changes, I recommend Fall Guys. At the end of the day, the game is still fun. And now that it's F2P I can play with my kids across Xbox, Switch, and Steam. I can't complain too much.

(Not that it matters, nobody will see this review now unless they've already purchased the game, lol)

10716,"[b][i]I HATE YOU, EPIC GAMES. MAY YOU ROT IN HELL.[/i][/b]
Fall Guys used to be my only solace during the first wave of the COVID pandemic, when I lost my grandmother. It was a tough time and all those hours I had spent with three of my best gaming buddies [i]@Schrödinger's Cat[/i], [i]@M0rty[/i] and [i]@Error 404[/i]. Those were some of the most genuine, fun and rewarding hours of my life that saved me from sinking into depression.

Over the last year, since Epic brought out Mediatonic, they have stripped the life out of the game and then ""legally"" stole the game from Steam to their abominable platform with:
[olist]
    [*]zero capabilities of social interaction
    [*]in-game microtransactions with real money (f2p my foot) for the beloved cosmetics
    [*]rarity downgrade for the existing legendaries and still somehow having the head-turner trophy
    [*]crowns being non-spendable, kudos being spendable on common items only
    [*]fame decrease per show making the season pass an absolute chore
[/olist]

There is [b]ZERO[/b] incentive to play this game any more.

Epic, you guys irreversibly ruined something many gamers like me loved very dearly with an abject lack of accountability.
You would forever be responsible for the downfall of this game and may no good thing ever come your way, Tim Sweeney."

10781,"Bought this game when it was popular, coming back to it after going Free to play. Not only is the game still mediocre, it also refuses to give me the legacy pack for it even though I paid for it. Epic is such a garbage company."

10788,"Cute game about beans racing through an obstacle course. death run style.

Not recommending as Epic has tainted this game beyond what it was.
Screw Epic for making the devs go back on their promise of keeping this game for sale on Steam.
Would not recommend even getting it from the EGS, the fall is that bad."
10789,fuckers cant have shit with epic
10790,amazing game! the gameplay is so amazing and is very entertaining. I qouls highly recomend this game for other people to play1

10794,"All the crowns I collected prior to free-to-play are now worthless. They converted into purple coins that only seem to purchase common items from the shop. Now you have to pay each season to unlock the rank rewards. It's a big middle finger to everyone who paid for the game initially and contributed to the game's success and popularity. Now this review probably doesn't even matter since the game is removed from steam, but I needed a place to vent. 

10/10 will uninstall after this review."

10796,"ahahahaah i own this on steam ahahahaah i find that really funny.
wonder how much someone would pay for my steam acc bc i have fall guys on here lol"
10797,"i'm happy that it become free, i've already played around 100hrs on fall guys but still never managed to win a crown 😢 but nonetheless i love it.

and the player count seems to be getting less overtime. overall it seems to be a good thing

i wonder why people get angry just cause it  became free, i think every online multiplayer game should have a free play mode just to introduce it to others and most of the famous multiplayer games are free anyway.

and in case of fall guys, it just became unavailable to buy but you can still play-through steam"

10836,"I didn't know that I had made an Epic Games Account, nor that I linked it to my Steam account. I actively avoided their greedy, anti-consumer hands this far. Even when they bought up and delayed games I had wanted to play for years I patiently waited as to not support their practices with my money.

When I launched Fall Guys today it automatically installed Epic Games software on my computer without my permission, I was then supplied with an account created by Epic Games without being asked or even given the option to decline or choose username.

It seems it's not enough to divide the PC userbase years after Valve had more or less single-handedly saved the PC gaming industry, to buy out devs and publishers and force consumers to use your storefront. Now Epic has gone so far as to make these publishers remove their games from pre-existing markets years after their release. If you bought the game on Steam, you can't play it on Steam. You have to use their services now.

This is disgusting, and a new level of anti-consumer. If only TotalBiscuit was still with us, perhaps we wouldn't have let things go this far. But as long as Epic keeps making money doing things like this, they will only get worse..."

10845,"Another game, another sellout.

Fall Guys : Ultimate Knockout used to be an extremely fun game to play with friends on weekends.
The fact that most cosmetics could be bought with an in-game currency that was awarded to you for completing specific quests was really entertaining and kept the game as f2p as possible. You could however spend money on the game if you wanted some extra goodies.

And then there's Epic Games. The dudes that made Fortnite. Just like they did with Rocket League, they bought this game (and the developer studio) and pulled it off of Steam. Booting the game now, you can immediately notice that alot of microtransactions were added (e.g. skins and bundles sold for money, new useless currency that most of the cosmetics are sold for) along with changes to some mechanics of the game. First of all, they made it so that you cannot buy the season pass unless you complete it. Not only is this frustrating but it's also a tactic to get the most gameplay time off of a person.

Just like Rocket League, this game will probably die within 2 months because of all the useless economy changes made. Epic always had a jealousy for VALVe. And always will. They're trying to become VALVe and replace Steam with their own game shop. The thing is that bribing will only lead to your downfall. I really hope this game dies so that Epic can realize how much of a monster they really are and possibly lose money."
10846,I bought DLC for this game and when it went free to play all of my items got deleted. The items I paid for are just gone???

I got all of my previous achievements, data and unlocks withing due time. It is now synced between all platforms. Thank you for the support. Game is good atm but already falling off in player count a little bit I think.

ORIGINAL REVIEW ON RELEASE: Paid for game full of cheaters. Still played and unlocked some stuff. Moved to Epic to maximise profit. My progress is lost in limbo and I did get nothing for buying and supporting the game in its early stages. I hope this game is gonna suffer from that decision. Cheers"

11049,tumble
11050,play this game its the best
11051,"Story:
None

Gameplay:
Very basic but fun. The last level is where everyone races for the crown is a annoying, however. You can play near perfect in the last level but never get the crown or it can be luck base if it's the maze.

Sound:
It's really fun. Cute music although the menu music can be loud and annoying. Sometimes the music doesn't play due to a glitch.

Overall:
Epic bought it and now it's horrible. They forced you login to Epic accounts and use them,removed it from the Steam store, and force you to pay for any desirable skin with real money and it's very expensive. The seasons are no longer free anymore, you have to pay for a season pass. You use real money to buy fake Fall Guys currency called Show-Bucks *cringe*. Half of the fun with this game was earning random items, and now that that was taken away, this game has lost its value. I'm sure less people will care about playing this game now. The Fall Guys I bought no longer exists anymore."

11090,"Timmeh Tencent is a garbage man who does garbage things because all he cares about is money and fame. The only thing Gabe Newell is famous for is not being able to count to three and we love the lovable oaf for stuff like that. Meanwhile this other dude decides to use an outdated word for ""cool"" as his namesake and in the end when his empire crumbles that's all he's going to be remembered for. I know this won't appear in searches, but I'm doing this anyway to make the message clear.

Steam is okay with games being on other platforms. Timmy is not, so he leeches off of games that he had no part in making in order to make them exclusive.

In short, Epic is the Tesla of video games, which ironically, Elon Musk is the Edison of Tesla. And I received the product for free because I apparently ""paid"" for ""legacy content I'm never going to use because I now need another account to play the game.

Garbage game, garbage corporation. Anyone who decides to side with Epic is making a deal with the devil. Even Square Enix, and I hope they eventually wake up to that."

11172,this game.... was fun.... now it is not because epic games took the title and i have no refund. I payed 20 pounds for this game and now it is free. Please give players refunds. Removed from steam store essentially screwing over customers just so u can get your sweet cash. Was 8/10 and now is 2/10 in my opinion.

"
11204,"Before this free for all update. i would have happily recommended fall guys. I loved it. i loved playing it despite my frustrations with players grabbing me. but that's part of the game. what's no longer part of the game is my drive to play like i used to. with Epic games having sunk their greedy claws into this wonderful game it's turned into quite spectacle. items that used to cost crowns from hard earned victories now cost show bucks which are unsurprisingly at not so reasonable prices per item. and to compound those matters. you can't even earn kudos anymore through regular play! only through what seems to be the season pass and whatever. Im glad i hung onto the crowns i had when they decided to convert them to kudos. but it's pretty clear the use for kudos is now about as helpful as a rhino charging into you on stomping grounds.

That aside. it's still the same fall guys gameplay. just with more aggressive monetization. but not immoral levels of it. just... a level of it that saddens a longtime player used to how things once were."

I have never played something so satisfying and adorable like Fall Guys.

The way you move the BEAN...
The way you kill other BEANS...
The way you eat BEAN...

It is truly amazing. I'm so addicted to Fall Guys that my wife wrote a divorce paper to me cause I'm hugging my sexy fall guys body pillow more then her. I don't regret it and I will never regret it. 

My bean of Fall Guys is so sexy that it turned me on countless times. I love Fall Guys.

11252,"Well... that was fun while it lasted!

They should change their names to Epic Greed, the new system they've implemented is staggering and will ultimately kill the game. Epic has removed the competitive edge by making crowns (winning!!) essentially worthless. They won't even throw you a few shekels of their new premium currency for your victories so even if you are crazy enough to grind for wins there's no point.

11258,"I just have no words to describe how bad the development of this game has been. Its a shitshow, first it was ravaged by hackers then it took 8 months to update a season and get new content and now that it became free2play its even worse, the currency for which you got skins got converted to a the currency form common items ( which are like colors and stuff mostly pretty boring stuff)  and everything else is paid for like 10 euros a skin? Theres nothing to gain in this game other than skins and now you have to pay for? Plus they added a paid season progression on top of it? Yesterday the matchmaking system was not working and today i got and error that doesnt give me even the meager rewards the game now gives you. The rewarding currency even in 1st place is so low that i wasnt even bothered that i missed it i was bothered because it doesnt even work. Fall guys deserves 0 money and all the bad reviews they could get, its like a reverse no mans sky were they seek every effort to make the game worse each passing day. I guess you could still have fun with no rewards if u like the Castle of Takeshi kind of concept but even that requires that the game will work properly again any day now with an update that fixes it, since its free now its okay to get it i guess just dont expect to get anyhting out of it."

fall guys isnt bad for a game, had my good time. not complaining about that. but im not eating the shit that makes me sick and makes gaming as a whole sick.

epic, want to be a proper competitor to steam?  deliver quality instead of brute forcing your way in with money.   hint, thats probably even gonna be cheaper long term. 

on a last note. im not the zealot type of person and i usually stay away from anything crusade. but ive just had enough here. this one time im a little too annoyed."

Epic Killed the game. You used to get everything through grinding, don't get me wrong i was never a massive fall guys player, but i enjoyed the game, and i liked that i could earn things without spending money on microtransations, but now epic ripped that away.

I wish I never bought this game in the first place, the fact that you can turn a product that I used to like into this garbage is disgusting. I hope I can get a refund, I used to trust you Devolver.

11505,"EDIT #2: CHEATERS ARE BACK. Hex-a-gone final is horrifically broken, usually with someone just floating above while you try your best. Fix your game, Epic. This is pathetic.

EDIT: 8 days after F2P launch, Epic still can't keep the game servers up. Played a few matches this morning, now matchmaking is completely down. Unplayable, unreliable trash.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Game was all right after they fixed cheating. Didn't have enough final rounds.

Went F2P today and Epic exclusive (the Epic store is so underdeveloped I can't give a bad review there and must do so here, because is no review functionality on Epic, lol).

Good news: Cool new levels, and multiple new final rounds with the F2P launch.

Bad news: On F2P launch day the game has been unplayable and/or unreliable for the last 8 hours. I had to resort to playing on Australia servers to get a game, but I would lose 1v1 matches due to lag. A popular streamer I just checked in with was playing on Korea servers to get a game.

Horrible news (if you care about cosmetics): Even after their incompetent F2P launch issues are finally resolved, the new F2P model includes selling for real money exclusive original launch cosmetics. Well, used to be exclusive. If you open your wallet you can have whatever you want. Don't care much about cosmetics myself, thankfully."

11511,"Glad I finished the season pass last season so I can at least leave with good memories.

You can earn 300 show bucks per season from the free battle pass, with the final 100 requiring maxing it out. It costs 1200 show bucks to purchase the battle pass. It would take a non-playing player 4 seasons of not buying anything to purchase the battle pass once if they consistently finished the battle pass. The entire battle pass used to be free. Crowns are now gone in any meaningful way, with the unlocks for earning crowns remaining, and now anything which would have required crowns to purchase requires the premium currency. 

But hey, now it's free! No more $20 price tag! Glad they're moving it to a store with no user reviews section aside from a number!"

11517,So they make the game free after you f.kin pay for it and lock the skins behind a paywall whilst turning the crown currency into lower tier kudos? Change the once unique soundtrack to some generic low quality version?  There are a million different ways NOT to go about this like total f.kin d.icks but here you are you greedy bunch of apes.

11539,uj
11540,"It's free now and popular. Ok, now that I have stated the good stuff, here's the bad.

 Old players that had crowns (currency via winning) were turned into kudos (typical round by round currency). All the good stuff in the past you could buy with crowns buy winning are only purchasable through new currency. This new currency is only gathered via the battle pass or irl money. 

Everything that isn't buy able with this new currency is commons and rares for a price way higher than before being with Epic. The material players can get (kudos) are capped and you only get so much now, alongside prices being higher in the shop. 

TDLR: If you are playing this game & new, play it with friends and only spend money if you want to look cool. Don't expect to look like sonic or godzilla without spending cash or lots of hours. If you an old player, congrats you got cucked by Epic. On the bright side hopefully you got some cosmetics before this update and just use those."

11548,"Its fun but it has some major issues I'd like to see addressed. Mainly with the pacing. There's so much downtime between rounds where you're doing absolutely nothing. After you qualify from a round, you have to wait for everyone else to finish, go through a 20 second cutscene that shows you who failed, wait for the game to select a new round, sit in a 30 second loading screen that explains what the minigame is about, look at a 15 second camera shot of the course (that doesn't work properly in most of the minigames by the way), and finally a 3 2 1 countdown before you're able to play again. It makes the game drag on and on and on because you're doing absolutely nothing. Please Mediatonic do something about this. The game is fantastic otherwise, just fix the pacing issue."

Now, after they have my money, they made it free to play and replaced crowns with a currency you can't earn. That's right, there are now costumes that are impossible to get without paying real money. Plus they added a paid battle pass. Fall Guys was great before this update, but now it's a cash grab. Fuck Fall Guys, fuck Mediatonic, and fuck Epic games."
11586,Sooooooooooooooooooo FUN!
11587,"New update is pretty terrible.  No longer can you get costumes by winning, you have to pay for a new currency to get any decent ones.  I guess there is no point in winning anymore?  I might as well not even play the game."

11607,"""I paid so you can be free"" 
John 8:36"
11608,"We paid for two copies of this game a long time ago, and when we heard it was going free-to-play, we were expecting that money would not go to waste. We were pleasantly surprised to see costumes and free season-pass access for season 1.

Then at the very end of the rewards part, there was a message telling us that all of our crowns would be turned into a woefully inadequate number of kudos, because they changed the entire monetization system.
It presents itself as such:
Showbucks are for costumes, emotes and generally the cool stuff. You get some as you rank up in the free part of the battlepass-like season progress rank.
Kudos are for colors, patterns, items, and generally the boring stuff.

On average, costume prices seem rather high for how many you get, and the fact that the crowns were just removed is a little baffling. Especially with the mediocre offering in kudos given that the kudos buy garbage.
A fair trade would have been crowns for showbucks, in a 20-50 showbucks per crown ratio.
Instead they ripped us off by monetizing the crap out of this game and going free-to-play, and my girlfriend cannot stand the changes made. 

I'll be very clear: I paid for this game. No change to this game will get me to pay ANY more. Personally, I won't be touching this game again. My girlfriend may be a different story, and she'll give the game a chance, but she refuses to pay another cent. If she gets gated from content or the game dies, she doesn't feel bad for ditching it. Compensate us fairly for the crowns, severely drop your store prices (before any idiot uses their mom's credit card), fix the wait times (a byproduct of a good game), and encourage people to return rather than finding ways to exploit them for money.

Clearly the exclusivity deal with Epic was all about the money, and not at all about the quality or longevity of this game.
At least if the game got better, it would have covered up the obvious desperation for cash.
What annoys me most about this is that this game was her favorite. Being someone who plays games casually, that is a very difficult spot to win. While she used to love the game, she's not even sure if she still likes it anymore. What went wrong?"
11609," At the request of the publisher, Fall Guys is no longer available for sale on Steam."

11614,.
11615,"Thank Epic for not only doing Rocket League wrong, but now Fall Guys. This new update is such a downgrade from the previous update. The new shop is gross to look at, not only because the costumes cost real currency, but because the overall game looks bland. The skins that were given for free if you previously bought the game were wack af. I'm not even going to mention the crowns being converted into coins. "
11616,"Well, it's a fun game, but I definitely do not want to support the devs that would make such decisions. I hope you guys get bankrupt soon (although unlikely) lol."

11622,"Once again, Epic Games sticks their greedy fingers into anything they can get their hands on. Their recent overhaul monetizes the hell out of the game, and they've screwed over long time players.

1. You're no longer able to get rare skins through playing the game alone, you now have to pay. The free currency (that was already a decent grind to get) can only be used to buy common stuff now.

2. Previously, crowns were typically used to purchase rare skins. They were only obtained through high placement, or very slowly through leveling. Now that crowns have been removed, there is far less incentive to actually grind and get good at the game.

3. Skins that used to be event exclusive are now being sold in the shop, which is unfair for anyone who had them.

4. Old legendary colour skins are now common/rare, which is also unfair for those who had them.

It's been a good run, but I'm through with this game. There's literally nothing to play for anymore. I cant even finish the last achievement on my steam list without forking out cash, even though I ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME.

I hated Epic Games with a passion before this, and somehow they continue to find ways to remind me to keep hating them."

About three months ago the kids convinced me to buy them Fall Guys so they can play finally. We all got back into the game and I bought them some kudos and costumes to get started. 

Now all our crowns got converted and the shop items are mostly sold for real cash and also the season pass seems to be paid. I had a quick look and a costume on sale in the new Epic store costs about 6 real Euro.

So we got scammed again. I wouldn't recommend anyone to play this. I'm fine paying some money to keep the servers going but now it looks like a full mobile cash grab.

First Rocket League and now this, it's amazing"
11677,GIRLLL YESSS!!!!!!!
11678,THIS GAME IS AWESOME PLAY IT NOW!!! STOP JUST SITTING THERE INSTALL THE DAMN GAME
11679,Fall guys has a relatively interesting gimmick with a 'Takeshi castle' style battle royale. It can be pretty fun to play from time to time. That said thats all it has going for it. The gameplay is overly simplistic and repetitive. New seasons add short bursts of fun but those also can be experienced in a couple of hours. After about 1 or 2 hours of gameplay you will have seen everything the game has to offer. This relatively unimpressive gameplay combined with the fact they are leaving steam to go on the epic game store just sours me and makes me not recommend it. Even as a free to play game there are many games that are worth your time more.
11680,Thank you epic games
11681,Funny bean men waddle about and fall over funnily. Would recommend.

11683,"I cannot believe that a monstrosity like this game could have even been ever created. I hate this game with a living passion, and you also remove it from steam?????? How am i supposed to play with my friends???? Fuck you Mediatonic."
11684,go fuck yourself and your epic store dick sucking
11685,EpicGames [*]
11686,"EGS has added nothing to this game. Another developer has been bought off to force you to use EOS and to inject EGS malware onto your machine. This aggressive business model means any new game you consider could be bought off to Epic and you will lose access to that game unless you are willing to put up with Epic's shitty business. 

Thoroughly disappointed."
11687,yes good game bro
11688,vsgsdfgg
11689,EFFIN SHAMEFUL WHAT THEY HAVE DONE!
11690,Very good game
11691,Very fun and well made.
11692,"I am not okay with fall guys selling out to Epic Games like rocket league. Ever since the free-to-play update, I can't even join a match. I somehow have ""connection problems"" when my Internet is fine. I try to set my matchmaking region to South Asia (closest to my country) and I still can't join any match. WARNING: Epic Games rant incoming

Epic Games is a cheap storefront that can't even compete with Steam in terms of customization, community interaction, game choice, stability, and any reasonable criteria you could think of. So what do they do? Do they at least offer the same things steam has and/or think of some things that will make them stand out in the industry (e.g. Steam's Workshop Mods)? NO. They cheese their way closer (as if they'll ever top Steam) by outright buying the games and making them unavailable here. I understand that it's their business choice but that shouldn't exempt them from criticism. Suppose exclusivity is Epic Games' action plan in competing with Steam. In that case, they will stay perceived as a bland, thieving, boring, and dishonorable game distribution service that will always be overshadowed."

This sort of behaviour from developers and studios cannot be supported."
11713,Fall guys is goated play it
11714,Prob one of my favorite games even tho it can make me rage sometimes... But its always fun to play with friends. Now with it being on switch my friends can play this with me. If u like hard games then this is a must buy its worth the money. (:

11717,I buy this game and you make free 🤬
11718,"lop,;'."
11719,so good and fun
11720,Another game which went to kiss epics ass :(
11721,"I bought this game a year or so ago, but didn't start playing it often until a few months ago. Before it was made free, I would have recommended this game to anyone, however, since the update on June 21st, AKA making the game free, I cannot say I would recommend this game anymore, especially to old players looking to switch to new platforms, or simply re-buying or revisiting the game. The new achievement and currency system is a copy of Fortnite, so if you like that, go for it I guess. But for the players looking to get away from the battle pass you have to pay for as a new player, the new update of fall guys takes that away from you. Now, the creators are simply trying to get money from people, luring them in by making the game free and then convincing them to buy the Fall Guys equivalent of V-Bucks. I now wish I hadn't bought this game, as I don't see myself playing it anymore with the new changes that I attempted to stay away from when leaving the fortnite battle royal game. 

However, if you love fortnite and if you are ok with buying a battle pass every season to get any fun cosmetics, this game is for you. Luckily, now that the game is free, you can test it out yourself before buying the battle pass, but be aware of its addicting nature. This game will NOT stay free for long, as if you keep playing, youll eventually spend your money on something."

11739,server issues
11740,"no. just no.
it was a good game while it lasted but epic games ruined it.
There anti cheat solved the first hacker wave but they haven't updated it. I got hackers in my first few matches since it became free.
It's also quite scummy how I paid like thirty quid for this game and I only get 1 season pass for free
Also using crowns as a currency for skins was to show off skill, now they have a new currency that is just awful and you have to pay for it.
This is the consequence of free to play and it isnt fair on those players who paid for this game back in 2020.

EpicGames & Mediatonic: Fix your game or it will be a huge failure. The players will go from all ages to just little kids and hackers."

11815,"Making a secondary account (and launcher if a new player) mandatory AFTER release should go against some kind of law. People don't like EGS for a reason, so forcing it on them almost two years after launch is sad. Messed up Rocket League like this, and now Fall Guys too. People like the freedom most PC games offer them for a reason, this just ends up anti-consumer and benefits no one. Shame."

- Goes free to play

Fell in love with the goofy and funny art style and funny looking character models. Even to this day, I never got a crown win which is disappointing. I wish the best for the devs and people who play this game."
11983,"Can't play the game anymore without creating an Epic account.
Which was never required when I bought and played this game."

Did have a bit of a hassle launching it due to ""missing files"" and Epic Online services but I resolved it in the end."

12002,its is very enjoyable
12003,"It was an honor and a privilege to play Fall Guys on Steam. Today,this game takes an uncertain path on Epic Games and I doubt is the right one. I have so many eternal regrets."
12004,good game
12005,yes
12006,worst game i ever played
12007,Falling beans. 10/10
12008,"This game is great for anyone who wants to play because its clean and enjoyable. Its the best racing game ever made and has great physics and cosmetics. It runs well only takes about 30 seconds to get in a round also Mediatonic is constantly updating.  It also has the player as a Bean and everyone loves Beans

Highly recommend this game to all steamer's, but go buy it on epic games."
12009,A great time with friends.

12011,Fun
12012,"Another game getting thrown head first into the dirt thanks to Epic's Fortnite kid profits. First Rocket League and its trading economy becomes horrible due to Epic buying the developers and now Fall Guys is getting the same treatment; all fuelled by their jealousy towards Valve.

Fall Guys, just like Rocket League, is getting removed from Steam. Essentially getting 'bought off' of the Steam Store.

Tim Sweeney really needs to get over his Gabe Newell envy. It's just screwing over the customers and their freedom of choice, it's not making things better via bribing or out-right buying developers just so you can forcefully remove games from Steam or prevent them from ever releasing there in the first place - or for a limited time like the recent Final Fantasy 7 Remake bribe money they gave to Square Enix to delay release on Steam for half a year.

Keep your 'console war' type mentality as far away from PC gaming as possible, Epic. You're a bunch of sellouts who mostly abandoned PC gaming back when Gears of War became popular. Now you come running back after companies like Valve, old Blizzard and various Indie studios revived the PC gaming market.

Epic Games are making Electronic Arts look like a better gaming company by the minute..."

12028,"Very fun, casual game!"
12029,its an okayish game
12030,great game
12031,"Yeah game's great. Got a third party steam key as a gift because good sale and it's going away tomorrow, as of the time of writing, but yeah the game's great. If you own it you get a founders pack when it goes free to play, and I think that's a pretty good reward for getting the game early. Imagine Takeshi's Castle, but with dubious little creatures (beans) getting up to mischief. What, you didn't grow up with Takeshi's Castle? Well that's quite sad, but it was a good show. Contestants would go through a set of games, consisting of obstacles, until there was one winner left. I guess another example would be Squid Game, where they also have to play some games until there is only one winner left. Only with Squid Game they only get depression and don't feel good for winning the prize earnings. This game has it's own prize earnings consisting of 'Crowns' that you obtain through the seasonal passes, or by winning the final game of a match. If you did watch Takeshi's Castle and enjoyed it, I think you'll enjoy this game very much, especially since it's going free. Although with it going free, you won't be able to buy it on Steam anymore, but all the others platforms will have it, so it isn't the end of the world, just sad."

12068,"At first glance, this game doesn't seem like much. Only a mere party stumbler, with maybe a few comical gags here and there. But after playing it, I can honestly say that this game is special. It's music, visual effects, and other design elements all do an amazing job of giving it the unique feel of a goofy yet still kind of epic and still prestigious game show. Overall, 9/10, super fun, would recommend over other clones,"

12073,"no. pvp games cannot possibly be recommended by me.  I hate every pvp game I've ever played, unless it's co-op. Some things that are horrendously annoying:

You've lost. you are now forced to watch a certain amount of the game until the esc then space keys work to get you back to the main menu.  No restart button, no jump back into another match button, only sadness and slowness.

Any game with ""Tail Tag"" deserves to rot in hell."

12076,"""Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a game built by many inspirations from lots of entertainment sources. Fall Guys allows up to 59 other online players in a fun, free-for-all party game that you can play with 3 friends. With laughable game play, endless fun, and many game modes there is so much enjoyment to have on Fall Guys. Mediatonic is very good at bringing constant updates to Fall Guys while keeping the game fresh and enjoyable."" 7/10🔥"

I've played it with my friend for some time now and still haven't won a single match, beside the huge crowd control in this game you need a loot of skill despite the few controls. It's impossible to win which makes it more perfect. If you want to have some fun with your friends while huffing and puffing while trying to win I strongly recommend this game."

12126,"I think the game has a lot to offer but it is not the same as before epic games bought it up. I used to play this game when it cost to play it and I found it fun due to the variety of mini-games and the rewards (crowns and Kudos) you earned which could be spent in the item shop to get emotes and other cosmetics. Then after Epic Games bought it up, they added a new currency (Show-Bucks) which are very hard to get without spending money, although Kudos is still in the game crowns have been completely removed as a currency and Kudos allows you to buy very little from the item shop. Basically, Epic Games has added a fall guys alternative to V-Bucks which has made the game much more based around spending money than playing the game to develop."

I would not even have a problem with Epic Games if they did not pay a ship load of kwan to some game companies to make their games exclusive on Epic stores, but since that's the case, I personally don't support that. Many are there who do and it's their choice, but I'm only voicing my own opinion, whether it matters or not, that does not concern me and should not concern anyone. 

This game is fun to play, no doubt, I'm genuinely happy for those who wished to play this game and will now be able to without paying a dime. I like to play this game when I don't feel like doing too much especially when I get home after work. 

If I've offender any Epic sympathiser, I apologise. I understand that there are many who do wish to buy games and Epic does their weekly free games thingy which is genuinely a good thing, heck, even their sales are great, but making a game store exclusive is in my opinion, unjust. Especially when it comes to a franchise, all the older entries will be here (Steam) but the newer ones of the same franchise won't be... that's just sad. 

The game overall is an 8/10, happy gaming folks!"
12222,love it
12223,good game only poor people get it on epic for free
12224,This game keeps crashing for no reason at all
12225,"HAWT HAWT FUN FUN
"
12226,"Being one of the oldest players of this game, I really hope this game can get more new blood after going free. [spoiler] to make qualifying easier [/spoiler]  

This game needs tweaks for frequent players, like adding more variety to the levels. Now that it has 6, 7 in the near future, seasons of levels, why reuse levels that often in consecutive matches? I often encounter very similar stages during the entire afternoon and get very sick of it. 

Also, my friends and I would love this game even more if the developer can add an experimental feature to let us ban some levels. I know this may make matchmaking more difficult, but it can be added as an option to freely turn on and off."

12254,"Tumbling gentleman, is the most rage inducing experience i have ever witnessed. The game itself infuriates me, as a sigma male standing at whopping five foot four ; with the knowledge that these ridiculing whipper-snappers are six foot tall, i have no other emotion to embrace other than pure fury. These squishy, bouncy, 6 foot tall demons are contrasted with vibrant colours and hues of rainbows, i believe this colour palette of pain was intended to ease the eyes, however this only fed the flames of my anger ; it did not assist in any way that the music is almost as painful to listen to as the colours are to look at, it was like listening to a choir from hell.

sincerely, an infuriated gamer."

And after all my research i have concluded that there are only a few minor flaws in this beloved game. These are the skins they are absolutely terrible they are not nearly revealing enough for me. And lastly there are no black people or ltbq beans to play as, and personally i dont believe this company should be supported when clearly they dont support my beliefs. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

12320," I love this game. It's fun and challenging. The only problem is that we HAVE to play online. It takes a looong time to find some players. So I just want an option to play offline with bots. I don't want to wait for hours just to lose and wait another few hours. Other than that, the game is great."

The Game is sold to Epic and there its a Free game... they just try to cash in the Steam Players...
Even better is that you now require to get a Epic Account and link it with your Steam account to play the Game... Well, great. So even when you dont want or need Epic you have to get an Epic Account to play a Game on Steam? 
For me, i cant even give the game back cause i buyed it some weeks ago retail and cant refund it. Great!

So if you want to play the game, want to waste 20 Euro for nothing, and still want to get an epic account your welcome. 
Somehow i dont even know if thats against the law..."

12347,"The game is really fun and addictive and they add new costumes constantly.

Unfortunately I spend more time trying to find a game and getting errors because of that than actually playing (today in one hour i could play just 3 rounds). Until they dont fix this or do something with the servers I wouldnt recommend it."

12386,The game is still fun but I'm a Linux User and EAC is a pain to deal with not to mention unstable. I wasn't there when I bought the game and the game worked fine - this is something they did to the game after they got my money and that's not on.

When I was a lad of three-foot-three
Certain questions occurred to me
So I asked me father quite seriously
To tell me the story 'bout the bird and bee
He stammered and he stuttered pathetically
And this is what he said to me

He said, ""The woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch
It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round
I went and ask a good friend of mine
Known to the world as Albert Einstein
He said ""Son, from the beginning of time and creativity
There existed the force of relativity
Pi r square and a minus ten means a routine only when
The solar system in one light year
Make the Hayden planetarium disappear
So if Mt Everest doesn't move
I am positive that it will prove

That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round
I grabbed a boat and went abroad
In Baden Baden asked Sigmund Freud
He said ""Son, from your sad face remove the grouch
Put the body down up on the couch
I can see from your frustration a neurotic sublimation
Hey love and hate is psychosomatic
Your Rorsach shows that you're a peri pathetic
It all started with a broken sibling
In the words of the famous Rudyard Kipling
That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

Well I traveled far and I traveled wide
And I don't even have me self a bride
All the great men upon this earth
Have confused me since my birth
I've been over land and been over sea
Trying to find answer 'bout the bird and bee
But now that I am ninety three
I don't give a darn you see

If the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch.

 Your welcome."

And if that wasn't enough of a slap in the face, its essentially being removed from steam and going f2p on Epic only, with a cosmetic pack being the only bonus  for paying 20 bucks for it. Absolutely sold out to Epic and do not care for the consumers. Hope they fall like all the players in their matches do."

I'd say that Fall Guys is definitely a great game to check out if you're looking for something goofy and colorful to occupy your time. A warning to anyone new who wants to give it a try; it might take you a *long* time before you're finally able to win a round. And that's ok! Just keep giving it your all and you'll get there eventually. The physics can be a bit unforgiving at times though, as a second warning. A great game to play with friends too!"

12509,"Any game that leaves Steam clearly doesn't know what they are doing and unfortunately is an automatic dislike from me. First Rocket league, now Fall Guys. What next?"
12510,i really enjoy this game but it is a little hard and very hard to win
12511,pretty good
12512,pog
12513,The name predicted its future because it fell off.
12514,COOL
12515,very good goofy ahh bean men
12516,I think when it becomes free to play it will be much better for all players. I have played it since it came out and they care abiut the community and keep updating it
12517,"I can confirm that this is indeed something you SHOULD NOT BUY! The game becomes free to play on epic games and will be removed from steam. If you already own the game you wont lose the copy. 

Other than that. Fall guys is a great party game if you are looking to play with friends."
12518,I love it
12519,"Fall guys is a great game where you can play with your friends and have lots of fun navigating the obstacles!
You should download it."
12520,"Gives me , mad headaches cause, I never get to win 😭"

12527,"Epic bought the game, and so now my Steam copy of this game is being held hostage and forcing me to use Epic's crap to play the damn game I already bought. I wanted to try the game again after the last few seasons only to find Epic trying to force itself down my throat."
12528,"funny beans, funny crossovers, funny fun, please try the game at least once, you won't regret it!"

12533,"this game ios fucking awful i died to a faggot ass bitch who grabbed me and io died and i cried for multiple hours because that was going to be my first ever win and i have 100 hours on this game i really love this game but ive broken multiple monitors, mice and mousepads over this game i hate this but i love it dont start this never ending addiction of special needs among us"
12534,I just lost to a 6 year old
12535,You have not lived until you killed someone in fall guys.
12536,"This game is fucking garbage the only reason I played this is for the achievements, Every part of this is trash. This is the least entertaining game, I actually had to struggle to stay awake playing this it is boring as fuck."
12537,molto bello per bimbi bestemmiatori seriali come paciuk

12539,"This is a fun, silly game that I enjoy immensely.  I'm not good at it, but it's still fun and upbeat.  xD"
12540,really fun game even more with friends cant understand why it died soo quickly i totallly recomend to look for this game when its free
12541,good yes
12542,good
12543,"bad game, also paid like 10 bucks for it and now they making it free, what do i get? a shitty battlepass and a ""legacy pack"". what a scam. also so many hackers"
12544,"Look, I really like like this game, but with the new update they are going to release, I am not sure about that anymore. One of the most fun part in Fall guys was the fact that you got all skins just by playing. It was so rewarding to buy a whole lot of skins. You could get a skin after playing a few round. Now they are going to force us to pay money for those skins. I think it really is a shame that they have to squeze every last dollar out of the players. This beatiful game was one of the last games, where you didn't have to pay to look good. In my opinion the game should stay at a price of 20 Dollars, and not be free to play. I am quite sure, that most of the players would enjoy the game more if it was a one time purchase. This game is becoming another example of the the modern day game industry. The developers of the game (Epic Games too) just develop the games to make money. It limits the fun that the players will have so much.
Furthermore, I think the players should just keep all the skins they have already buyed by playing the game! I just don't see that point, that Epic Games deletes all the skins in the inventory of every player. They just want us to buy more of their skins, but now for real money instead of the ingame currency. But I will say, that I surely won't do that, and I hope that none of the other players will.
Instead of rewarding the players that played since launch, that payed for the original game, they just demotivate them to further support and play the game. I think that in the long term, the game will just lose in popularity. As much as I like the game, in my opinion, that sadly will be the truth"

12590,good game 7/10 might recommend 🥶👌
12591,i liked it
12592,This game is fun and easy for everyone to enjoy. It's not too competitive but can still be pretty challenging to win a game. It has multiple different levels to play which will make the game more fun and less likely to get boring. It also has a duo and squad mode so you can play with friends. It is also cross platform and cross progression so you can play on any platform and still enjoy the game. It's a fun and cute game.
12593,"Stupid fun game. Once you get the courses figured out, sit back, have a brewski or what not and enjoy the cut hijinks"
12594,"fun to play, not toxic, easy to play, hard to master, challenging, well designed"
12595,gud geme
12596,"I don't care if this game is dead, I still think that it is fun regardless of what other people think. 5/10"
12597,BEANS...
12598,"If you like Takeshi's Castle, 3D platformers, battle royales, wonky physics and grinding for cosmetics, this game is for you! It's really fun but can be also very frustrating. The courses look easy but most of them require you to memorize the hard spots and good muscle memory. And the controls, physics, maps and other players ensure high randomness so sometimes you lose even when you were perfect and sometimes you win even when you didn't put in any effort."

12604,"My previous review of the game was positive or, should I say, positivesque. Nothing particularly wrong, it was and still is a fun quirky little game to play. But there's one skeleton in a closet of this tiny little game - Epic Games Services and their technical state.
For more than three weeks I'm in an ethernal pain known as solving up issue caused by Epic Online Services. I can't play the game I've been actively playing for year or so. I can't play the game as I can't even get into the main menu thanks to Epic Games Account Error. From what I've seen it doesn't want to work for more people and it's somehow tied to Steam version of the game. That being said it's noticable how they're trying to get people out of Steam to play it on their truly hideous, awful and clusterfeck platform. From what I can say doin' this kind of stuff is borderline illegal as you can't even use the product you bought with no reason whatsoever."
12605,Someone called me a hitler ni**er pancake
12606,"This game plotting on me bruv kept getting stuck on annoying things like in the middle of spped boost, always getting knocked out even tho i'm not jumping off of high places, when i'm diving it don't move me,"

I think I have broken 4 mice and 10 keyborads becuase of this game. i bought it thinking It would be fun and relaxing but turns out this game is more competitive than VALORANT FORTNITE AND COD COMBINED.

12685,"Imagine this: it's a Friday night and a caring mother, me, wants to take her kids somewhere special after their soccer practice.  I started the evening expecting only the most exquisite experience at my local Chili's diner.  What I got was a horrible dinner session that me and my children will remember for the rest of our lives.  It started normally, though proceeded in a completely different direction.  The Chili's staff and crew members greeted us immediately and sat us down at a nice booth in the middle of the restaurant.  I talked to my kids about practice for a while before the staff was ""so kind"" to bombard me with a series of questions including, ""What drink do you want?"" and ""Are you ready to order yet?"".  This situation really brought down the dining experience for me personally.  But that's not all.  When the food FINALLY arrived, it was only WARM!  I feel offended that the staff thought this low of not only me, but my beautiful sweet peas.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not writing this 1 star Yelp review to bring down the entire company, I'm only writing this for the betterment of the Chili's restaurant and staff in the future.  I fully believe if they try their hardest, this company can soar to new heights.  Yet, for now, I don't think I'll come back anytime soon.

-Princess Karen <3

This situation really reflects how I feel about this game as a whole."

fuck you fall guys
oh you like falling?
i hope that your game falls off of steam
and i hope that your company falls off the earth
i don't give 2 shits about a season pass

what's even worse is that these cucks are putting the game on epic games because they know the game is dead but they know epic is just gonna give them a fat check for the promotion"

12726,"Sold out to Epic Games and now mandates an Epic Account, will soon be free to play on Epic Games.  You can't even reach the main menu without an account.  Keeping in line with Epic's terrible practices, the game is soon going to be removed from steam just like Rocket League and Anno 1800 was.  Don't encourage this sort of developer behavior or it will keep happening.  Don't follow it to Epic or waste your money now."

Seperatly: Why can't I disable the Epic games overlay? How many overlays do you think i want? /s Would be soooooo much fun if every games launcher decided there was no way to turn it off, great precedent you are setting /s . When i bought this game the overlay wasn't mandatory and now it is, that's probably illegal in the EU, because you changed how to access this game after the purchase, and made it more difficult for me to enjoy a game I already paid for.

Get it while its free or on sale if you want to try it. Its probably way more fun with friends but its pretty fun while solo. Easy to learn as well. Only ""complaint"" would be the physics but I think thats intentional and tbh it kinda adds to the charm. Would recommend definitely worth playing. I think its free now anyways so just try it. 10/10"

12793,"DO NOT BUY FALL GUYS. At the end of the current in-game ""season,"" the game will be delisted from Steam's store, so you can only get it on EGS. It's going free-to-play, replacing the current progression system with the same ""one free line, one paid-season-pass line (also all the cool stuff you want is on the paid line)"" crap that Fortnite poisoned this medium with. It's still all cosmetics as far as I know, so at least there's that.

I'm not requesting a refund, because I don't think that's a valid form of protest in this case. I definitely got my money's worth of enjoyment from Fall Guys. Demanding a refund for this game isn't going to stop them from making it bad by slapping a predatory monetization scheme on it, and refunding even three-quarters of its existing players would still amount to pocket change for a company as big as Epic. If you dislike the direction this game is taking (which you should) and want to make a statement against what companies like Epic are doing to the game industry, remember that as a consumer, [i][b]knowledge is power.[/b][/i] Tell your friends how they ruined this fun, silly Wipeout battle-royale game. Explain how season passes can be (and usually are) used to create a gameplay loop that psychologically manipulates players into unhealthy spending habits. Get them thinking about how much games are worth to them, mentally [i]and[/i] monetarily, so they can weigh the costs against the benefits. Tell them to tell [i]their[/i] friends, too.

What a damn shame. This game was really fun to play."

12842,"Initially, the game was also free on epic games for a while but I still bought it on steam to show some support and love to the developer team. Not to mention, I dislike the tactics that epic games was having but understandable. However, Mediatonic are getting worse and worse. First, need a epic launcher and account to launch a game that I bought on steam is already questionable and now free on all platform but removed in steam is a shame and disgusting. My advice would be to stay away from Mediatonic if you don't like the feeling of being back stab. Otherwise, your choice."

12886,"everyone's throwing a fit that fall guys is becoming f2p and being moved to the epic games store

guys, you paid $20 for like two years of access to this game. epic is even compensating you with exclusive items and access to the first ""battle pass"" or whatever they called it. look at what epic acquiring rocket league did, it went free to play and nobody had a problem. the game was booming with players compared with the old two minute queue times. this exact thing is happening with fall guys. a knock-off called stumble guys is doing better right now. they're free to play, have a ""battle pass"", and even got accused of having a crypto-miner in the game. y'all don't like epic because they're a ""monopoly"", they run the exact same business. y'all were dick-riding epic games when they gave out large and interesting titles for free. but now that they're not feeding you with good free games, y'all are bashing epic. i owned this game originally on PS4 and bought it on steam in-case it turns out that keys for this game skyrocket (i also wanted to get some steam achievements). epic knows what they're doing, just calm down. all this game has on steam is achievements (which will probably also be migrated to epic games with their new achievement system rolling out), you can always manually add fall guys to steam to run it under proton (for the linux gamers). also, you shouldn't be throwing fits over having to use an epic games login. it's just a simple account. if you're still throwing a fit over fall guys going f2p, just remember all the hours you put into the game and all the fun moments you've had prior to the announcement. if you don't have any, you didn't truly play this game.

please note that i'm not saying epic is a perfect company, they do have some flaws. like the fact that they don't have their own ""workshop."" i also hate their affiliate/support-a-creator program. it's only useful if you play fortnite, they don't give any docs related to integrating it into games and they refuse to put it into any games other than fortnite and rocket league (i'm hoping they put it into fall guys tho).

tl;dr: i see this as a great opportunity for fall guys to revive. if you still cry about fall guys going f2p, you never actually enjoyed the game and don't understand the place fall guys is in right now. and people who despise epic games need to get a life and realize that everything they're using involves some type of ""huge and unfair"" monopoly. get the game if you want to collect it or if you still think epic games is a ""stupid monopoly"", i cannot change your mind. just keep in mind that it's going f2p on June 21st."

12915,"Nowhere was it stated when I bought this game that I would eventually need an Epic Games Store account to play it.

This product no longer works as intended due to fundamental changes made by the developer. While they claim you can still launch the game through Steam, this is a false claim as you are now directed through the Epic Games Store. This, as well as other changes, affects the way this game functions on Linux.

Although, by US law, I am legally entitled to a refund regardless of play time, the Steam Refund process is no recourse, as the requests are clearly not being reviewed by an actual human. Mediatonic maintains that no one at their support team is capable of contacting Steam Support in order to make an exception, and have my refund issued, but this is a blatant lie.

If a completely obscure individual named Steve from Rocket League Support was able to contact Steam Support and assist me in receiving a refund for their game that I had bought four years prior, and do so in just two short emails, there is no plausible explanation as to why Mediatonic cannot do the same; the idea that Steam support would be any less accessible to Mediatonic than they are to Psyonix is an excuse that falls flat on its face when you consider that, not only are you selling on the very same storefront, but you are now owned by the very same company."

12927,I love falling AND I love guys! sucked when it first came out but now there's good content. I hope making it free to play brings in more of my boys to play. 3/5.
12928,"Okay, so I'm glad I revisited this game, because in the earlier days of it I did think that they had a shortage of game modes. But a few seasons later, this game has definitely levelled up!

A quick rundown of the game for those unfamiliar or debating whether to pick it up, Fall Guys involves taking on a lobby of roughly 60 players in a competitive, almost game-show-like ""show"", compromising of a series of randomised race/survival/points rounds. There are now a range of really fun gamemodes that are all easy to understand for new players, but can get quite ruthless as the lobby shrinks down. And the roster of gamemodes only expands each season!

Customisation in the game is phenomenal. There are some AMAZING outfits that can be unlocked, a fact that was true even at the beginning of this game's time but has only become more true as the devs have worked with many license holders to create so much customisation! The store system is very reminiscent of other Epic Games' titles like Fortnite and Rocket League, whereby the store regularly rotates content. I know that might annoy some people, but all new outfits are always made available for a few days at least. 

There is also a battlepass - however as I am typing this that pass is COMPLETELY FREE (this may be subject to change, more on that in a sec!). The length of time you get to finish this pass is pretty generous (I easily finished the recent one by doing dailies here and there), and the cosmetics are usually pretty good quality! Plus it should give you sufficient currency to buy some of the store cosmetics as you please!

Currency is also earn by playing, and playing better obviously rewards more XP, Kudos, and (if you WIN) Crowns! There is certainly no ""pay-to-win"" and most of the better cosmetics are primarily unlockable using the unpurchaseable crown currency. So ultimately, you shouldn't need to pay money to bling yourself out!

Now, some of this MAY change given that the game is becoming FREE TO PLAY! Epic Games owns Fall Guys, and I believe it is scheduled to be free over on EG as of the 21st of June. But while we obviously dont know how this will affect currency gain and store layout, the game is still at its roots really fun, and should have a reasonable playerbase to make it last. I would recommend, at the very least, picking it up when it becomes free. If you want to pick it up now to take advantage of the DLCs and legacy pack, I would also recommend it.

(P.S. Prime Gaming has also featured skins each month and sometimes currency too, so if you have that, take advantage!)"
12929,"This game is garbage. The mechanics suck and half the game are completely luck based. Not to mention the lack of updates and lack of effort. This is a bad game that blew up regardless of how good it actually is, the paid content such as the battle pass etc. is a scam and is not worth it and the game as a whole is not a fun experience, please DO NOT buy this game its horrible."
12930,"I am fuming right now. I have already punched a hole in 3 MONITORS waiting for this games servers to come online. Like, is this a joke? 20 great british pounds for this? This is really doing my head in. I am filled with rage that I can't even play? And when I do play, I get FALL BALL 24/7! I have played 50 hours so far and the fact I can't play any longer is filling me with RAGE! I punched my mother in the face when she told me to eat lunch and get off the game, that's how much I love this game. And the fact we can't even play? Like seriously, this is ridiculous.

13005,"This Game is Perfection

Mediatonic have mixed party games with a somewhat BR taste. With its easy to learn mechanics and very few controls you can enjoy this game anywhere and I literally mean ANYWHERE, ""Fall Guys"" is going to be FREE on Xbox, Playstation and Switch on June 23rd on the ""Epic Games Launcher"". Whereas if you bought the game already no need to worry because you will recieve the first ""Season Pass"" which is basically the Battle Pass but extended with additional awards. The ""Battle Pass"" will still be free after the update but as I said before the ""Season Pass"" is a more awarding system like ""Fortnite"" and ""Apex Legends"", Warzone"" etc. 


Is it still worth the price?
No

If it goes on sale is it?
Yes, depending on if you are going to want to have the season pass or are going to get it anyways regardless. ""Fall Guys"" has already been on sale recently but we just need to hope they have another because of its FTP Release to all players alike"

13075,"Being removed from Steam by Epic Games.

Not Poggers. 

Edit: Epic's new F2P Fall Guys isn't worth playing.

Went to check out the new Halo event: its a big screw you to fans in terms of its monetization. Now there's way more push to spend $$$ on MTX. I liked Fall Guys, but with the new cash shop I wouldn't recommend Fall Guys even for free. 

Also, they removed the old premium currency from the game, making it worthless."

13180,"It's pretty fun, although that fun has been slightly soured by Epic's acquisition of Mediatonic and the fact that the game will be removed from the Steam store. While EAC support has been (technically) enabled for linux (including SteamOS), that support requires workarounds that are unlikely to be solved now that said acquisition and said store removal. If you ever want to play Fall Guys on linux, you [i]have[/i] to own the game on Steam, because EGS doesn't support Linux or the Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime.  
If that doesn't worry you and you don't mind downloading another launcher, then by all means, wait for it to go free-to-play on EGS. That said, I would like to encourage you to not buy any in-game items, as to not support Epic's toxic practices in the gaming industry. If Epic wants people to use their platform, they should make it desirable, rather than buying out studios and paying for exclusives."

Now to the review:

I can't really imagine myself playing this game for hours, sure it's fun, but it's just not my type of game (just like Sh*tnite oh sorry Fortnite). Maybe if I were a little kid I would enjoy / play it more. I can't and also don't really want to write anything else about this game. Explore it yourself or read a more detailed review!"

Make sure to sign up for the ""Pre-Register"" Search it up if you dont know what it is. Follow the steps and you are ready to get started on Season 1!

Basically in this game you will spend 80% of your time in the menu for either :

-getting your XP

That is bullsh**t. If anything we should be getting all season passes for free, as was the model before going free to play. The game will not be dead after it goes F2P but now i wish it would die so the publisher gets f**cked over like they are doing to their player base."

13309,"Contrary to what others may say, Fall Guys is a great game to play alone, or with friends. The Epic Integration is only helping the game progress further through a larger player-base, more events and more fun. The integration with accounts also allows for progress saving and more connections with other games, so idk what these other people are rambling about (it also literally takes a few minutes to set up an Epic account)"

13357,"Told my friends ages ago this HAD to go F2P or else it'd be dead. It has been ""dead"" for a long time, but I don't see what's the fuzz about this moving to the EGS other than Steam Input not working right off the bat for new players, which is a shame (which 99% of the reviewers know nothing about, btw).

Becoming F2P happened to a lot of games including Warframe, Team Fortress 2, H1Z1 (another dead battle royale lol), Call of Duty: Warzone, Rocket League... didn't make them worse, if anything made them better... if you feel that you didn't get the value for your money, that means you didn't like the game anyways and thus didn't play it, so why would you even care [b]now[/b]? lol should've refunded it or gave it a dislike earlier bucko

But THIS GAME? I had to edit this review because they literally killed the game and threw everyone who bought under the bus. This is not a matter of ""it goes free because some deal"", they [b]DESTROYED[/b] regular progression, all of your crowns are now turned into worthless Kudos since all the cool skins are now paid with Show-Bucks, basically [b]with money[/b].
They balanced having to win with the crown shards which were a good call in my opinion but killing their entire system... yeah, good luck keeping this game afloat, the only people left playing will pay literally 0 for your worthless battle pass. It's an attempt to cashgrab. Good call delisting this from Steam, lmao."
13358,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but at least I can give you strawberry cheese cake recipe.

ingredients:

250g digestive biscuits
100g butter, melted
1 vanilla pod
600g full fat soft cheese
100g icing sugar
284ml pot of double cream
For the topping
400g punnet of strawberries, halved
25g icing sugar

STEP 1
To make the base, butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment. Put the digestive biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly until the crumbs are completely coated. Tip them into the prepared tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr to set firmly.

STEP 2
Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, leaving the tip intact, so that the two halves are still joined. Holding onto the tip of the pod, scrape out the seeds using the back of a kitchen knife.

STEP 3
Pour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with an electric mixer until it’s just starting to thicken to soft peaks. Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and the vanilla seeds in a separate bowl, then beat for 2 mins with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken, it will get thin and then start to thicken again. Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You’re looking for it to be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it’s not thick enough, continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.

STEP 4
Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. To remove it from the tin, place the base on top of a can, then gradually pull the sides of the tin down. Slip the cake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Purée half the strawberries in a blender or food processor with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake, and pour the purée over the top.

Perfection

10/10 Game!"
13359,yes

13384,its a nice party game but i suck at this game i think you should be able to play a sandbox mode where you can take as long as you want with infinite lives on any map in any game mode with any modifiers that may exist (idk) so you can get used to everything there should also be a custom server where you can modify all the settings so people can host fall guys tournaments i havent played this in a good 2 months because its frustratingly hard to be good enough to get past the second round when your not used to playing games like this overall 4/5 8/10 84/100 842/100 im gonna stop that now

The fact it is becoming free soon is an amazing choice for the game. While it soon won't be supported on steam in the update, it will be on literally everything else. Also when I say unsupported I mean not purchase-able anymore. You will still be able to play on steam even after the update with all the content. If you haven't already, give this game a shot!"

If you're eventually going to buy a SD, might want to jump into this one soon before it goes to the lame EGS at the end of June."

13501,I think this game is worth it to buy because there are lots of different game mods to play and different skins you can collect. You can collect a hotdog skin or a knight.

I bought the game a week before the EGS announcement and that's what you do? making it free to play on consoles and in the EGS and also removing it from steam??? dude I understand the 88% split but consoles also have the 70% just as how steam is, and actually steam is better because of the 75% when a game hits 10M and 80% increase when the game reaches 50M (yeah it's not that good of a deal for small games but still... is fall guys just look how many collabs and copies they have sold)  why you only have to boycott steam instead of every platform out there? remove it from playstation and xbox then if steam is that bad of a platform...

All jokes aside, this is definitely a game worth your time and the achievements are relatively easy to get without even really trying (if you're into achievements). I've only played roughly about 26 hours and I've already earned more than half of the achievements."

tl;dr: tim sweeney say free to play, hello anti cheat, bye linux
i want a refund"
13707,"A great game for someone who wants to spend time with friends.
Pretty funny that each match can ruin your friendship.

The game draws attention from the very first minute: beautiful graphics, the reward for winning (the crown),
 which you can use to buy a new skin, and unusual communication with the players without the use of in-game chat (theatrics)
In my opinion the gameplay is a completely new for a multiplayer games(first time played something like this)

Who would have thought that the game will become free-to-play :/"

I dont like the epic launcher so I purchased the game before its unlisted but, epic games will most definitely give this game a breath of fresh air with new content and making it F2P is a good decision. The devs will also have a bigger budget as well so yall bugin if you really call it trash because a company purchased it. Also, now u can spit game to that nerdy ass girl by saying ""sup play fallguys""."

The game is also going for free (not on Steam) and even for the $8 I paid for this game it still didn't really feel worth it. The game boils down to Mario Party, but without the board game. There is decent variety to the mini-game courses, but they all play the same to me and the day that this game closes it's servers the game will become unplayable. I just don't feel the need to keep coming back to this game despite the slow drip feed of rewards for playing this game. 6/10"

13755,if you have any kind of sympathy for your personal well-being and mental health please don't get this game
13756,Okay so like a year ago it got bought by Epic Games and requires a Epic account. I'm anti Epic but o well if i want to play Epic i might as well link my epic account from when i Played fortnite. So in June there Removing the game from Steam and adding it to epic for free. Hate the idea considering I bought the game with many other people. I know we will get the season pass for free but I still don't like it. Epic did the same to Rocket League witch I also bought (I quit rocket league tho). If epic want to make a game free do It a right way. Such as give the OG players some cool abilities and access that would cost f2p players money. I'm not against F2P game I believe you should be able to have a great time playing games no matter how much money you have but it makes me mad that the people who bought the game and supported your game to make it what it is are having the door shut on them. Of course it selfish that the game is taken off Steam and going to Epic only. Same thing happened to rocket league people like me bought the game supported the game and it gets taken off Steam and goes to only epic. Then the People who Bought the game don't get much. $20 is a entire DLC and we should get something like a DLC. I know we got very early access but still. Whatever the game is decent you need good internet. Can make you rage at times. But oh well thanks for listening to my ranting review.

13761,"Unfortunately with the move to F2P they are removing this game from being obtainable on steam and you will have to get it from Epic. This also means that the hacking and cheating issues I ran into back when I played are likely to get worse, as they can just get new copies under new names and IPs whenever they want if banned. When your playing with 50 other people its really easy to find a cheater in your group, and that cheater will win, so it makes it impossible to earn crowns."

13833,kinda boring. only played once.
13834,"Hugely anti-consumer move to rip this from Steam and make it an Epic Games exclusive after having made a promise that it was going to remain on Steam.

The game already failed to maintain its player base due to devs making some questionable decisions and making a move like this is just furthering the pattern of them giving consumers the middle finger.

Do not purchase this game, actively boycott what this company publishes because their word means nothing."
13835,Epic games launcher sucks and this is a huge anti-consumer move by the devs. Since the release of this game they have only made poor decisions and finally they let greed get to them. Don't support this game.
13836,Getting delisted on Steam for Epic out of nowhere.

13851,Actually fun
13852,"A lot of people giving bad reviews just because you need an EGS account now, truth is the game is pretty fun.... and it's going F2P"

I would like to get my money back now. Paying 20 euros for a F2P game is just a rip off.
The money vultures can keep the three skins as compensation. Mainly because they aren't worth more than €5 if you look at the DLCs. Where are the remaining 15? And as if that wasn't outrageous enough, the game is disappearing from Steam. Just like back then with Rocket League. Oh yes, and the free pass is now subject to a charge! It's incredibly bold to treat your customers like that. That killed the game for me forever. Good work
Mediatonic!

DE
Am liebsten will ich jetzt mein Geld zurück bekommen. 20 Euro für ein F2P Spiel zu bezahlen ist reine abzocke.
Die drei Skins als Entschädigung können die Geldgeier behalten. Vor allem weil die nicht mehr als 5€ Wert sind, wenn man sich die DLCs anschaut. Wo bleiben die Restlichen 15? Und als wäre das nicht schon unverschämt genug verschwindet das Spiel von Steam. Genau wie damals bei Rocket League. Ach ja und der kostenlose Pass wird nun kostenpflichtig! So mit seinen Kunden umzugehen ist unfassbar dreist. Damit ist das Spiel für mich für immer gestorben. Gute Arbeit Mediatonic!"
13866,"let me tell you the story of a boy called little timmy tencent

little timmy tencent was upset that all the other children were playing with the popular kids in his class, who all owned the latest toys and gadgets

he saw them all having fun and he was angry, so he paid some of the kids to play with him for a little while

'this is great', he thought, surrounded by newfound friends, 'now everybody will love me'

it wasn't long before his newfound friends had already run off to the popular kids, playing with even newer toys, laughing and enjoying themselves, and little timmy was furious

'why did nobody have fun with me? what am i missing?' he thought, paying even more of his classmates to play with him and only him, telling them that the most popular kid in his class, who was called gabe, was mean

and despite this, they took little timmy's money, and they kept running back to his classmate gabe when they got bored

and little timmy wasn't happy at all, so he spread some nasty rumours about how his classmate gabe was using his influence to keep some of his classmates from playing with anyone else

but nobody would listen to little timmy

his classmate gabe had everything a child his age could've ever dreamed of

and little timmy had nothing

If you play the free version do not support the devs who left all their initial backers in the dust. We are being given a bundle of cosmetics none of us asked for and only a single season pass as compensation for having funded this games development over the last 2 years.

The devs did not care about us and they will not care about you - play the game if you want, just don't bother spending a dime on it."

13882,"going f2p soon so dont bother buying it. unless you want it on steam, because its also being removed from steam (though still playable if you already own it) as soon as it goes free to play. if you play it on linux like me (or steam deck) then theres no guarantees itll keep supporting linux compatibility once it goes epic games store only since egs itself doesnt even officially support linux. obviously theres ways around that to install egs games on linux but still theres no guarantee theyll keep linux support for the anticheat much longer

dont personally have anything against using a different launcher or installer or whatever but itll be real annoying if the game suddenly stops working on my pc because they decide to uncheck the one (1) box that lets eac work on linux. then itll really feel like ive wasted my money :(

if youre in the same boat and like me havent rly played the game since launch then i recommend at least opening up the game to make sure your epic account is linked so even if you have to play it on a different platform you wont lose your old progress or anything (i hope)"
13883,Awesome Game. But If you wanted to announce it free to play then why did you made a sale one month before the announcement. And in the name of legacy pack u are giving us trash 😡🤬

13893,Can't wait for june 21 guys good thing i refunded this
13894,i paid on steam and playstation and now its free AND will be an Epic exclusive?? what rhe heck fall guys? at least give us back our money. at least match making will be faster now :/
13895,"My previous review criticized the announcement of the game going into F2P, and how many of the advertised changes just altered the outlook of the game from something casual where you'd play the game, gain currency according to your skill and collect cosmetics to a prediction of something along the lines of a grind to be able to gain any cosmetics with little incentive to win. I am glad to inform this isn't the case. It's much worse.

I'll go point by point over my previous review, to see how things have changed:
[b]Update frequency:[/b]
Its literally been 2 weeks since the new Season started its true i asked for more content but I'm not asking them to die over adding new stuff. I will update this in the future.

[b]Currency:[/b] 
If only you knew how bad things really are. 
Crowns, a currency gained for winning games, are gone and are instead downgraded to be an XP system for crown ranks, a long investment cosmetic unlock. With long investment, I mean I've been playing this game since launch, top played hours on my friendlist, average skill tbh and I'm not even 10% done with it. 800 wins for a nickname is just insulting. Separating costumes by 300-500 wins is even worse.
Kudos, the free currency, have been reworked into this ""drip fed"" currency where you can only get 200 of daily, compared to before where just playing would give you ~250 average [i]per match[/i]. Kudos items have also become very scarce, very unattractive and honestly overpriced for what they actually are. Having to wait a week to get a bowler hat or a fanny pack feels like spitting on the face of your free players, taunting them by showing the cool paid items first in the shop.
Show-Bucks are the new currency in the shop, acquirable by purchasing them for eye-gouging prices or by getting them through the Fame Pass (battle pass), where free players get 300, while players who purchase it get to buy the next pass and have 550 to spare. When the cool looking costumes cost 1200. So I need to save up for 6 months or fork over 20 dollars (!!!) to be able to purchase a single costume, when previously winning a couple of times was enough to guarantee the purchase and any future one.
Dev's gotta eat I suppose 🥴

[b]Epic Store move:[/b] 
So the game is off Steam and its available for free on the Epic Games Store! That means a lot of players have joined in from there!... No, really the best influx of players are consoles, which I see a lot more than people playing from PC. So the move hasn't really done anything for Epic other than make them lose a potential playerbase and more money-I mean customers to support their barebones store. If anything I saw more people purchasing the game on Steam before the switch so that's probably where most of the revenue came from.

[b]And some extras...:[/b] 
What did they do to this game? In the 2 weeks I've played since the new update I've experienced more bugs and game breaking issues than in my previous 2 years of playing this. Rounds where the game freezes for you, where spawns are in the wrong locations, where you're thrown into uneven versus games, games where it just boots you out to the splash screen because ""a critical error occured"" while everything was working fine... I understand porting to consoles is a big ordeal but that's why you have a porting studio helping you with development, so you can focus on the content and fixing while they focus on getting the game working on other platforms.

So why am I focusing SO much on cosmetics being paywalled? Because that's actually half the game. The first part being the funny bean game where you jump and fall and that's fun, that's mostly intact, it SHOULD be, nothing was drastically changed on that side. The reward system that comes from performing well in the games however is busted, to the point that losing on the first round over and over nets you more experience than actually playing the game to the finals. There's no incentive to win, which WAS the points of the cosmetics, if anything completing your Daily/Weekly challenges now are of most importance, which most of the time involve just playing the game more than trying to improve on your abilities, to be able to actually have a decent chance of completing your Season pass or levelling up your crown rank. Free to pick weird and fun looking mix and match beans are no more, plain colored beans with normal boring accessories are the norm now, and I couldn't be more sad about it."

I bought this game on 25th dec 2020 and till today i haven't even won single game.

I hope they offer refunds soon for those who bought from Steam, since i bought from Humble I know I do not qualify. I'm fine with that as long as most Steam users can I refuse to have anything to do with epic. I deleted my epic account awhile ago. Epic is an awful launcher who forces exclusivity on PC like consoles do. That should stay on consoles and not PC. Epic games sucks. fuck you epic."

[hr][/hr]
Fall Guys is a fun, kid-friendly platformer battle royale, which might just be the first of its kind! However, this game is delisted from all major PC storefronts, and the developers are adding ""premium"" paid currency and fame passes and making it impossibly difficult to earn non-premium currencies (fame & kudos). Even then, the new cosmetics you can unlock with kudos are not even worth playing to earn them. Until these horrible additions are dealt with, I will not be playing. Shame on you, Mediatonic.

14019,Epic Fail Games BS now
14020,Spent $20 bucks on a game thats getting delisted off steam and becoming f2p. 10/10 would get scammed again.
14021,F what every 1 says; i liek this game (tho better with frends); hyped with the new update making it not just accessible for basically all platforms but also cross platform; what i dont get is y tf u gotta go unepic games's mid ass launcher and disable the steam thing. Im still giving it a thumbs up but this one decision really just makes me glad i didnt buy the costume bundle
14022,Don't buy. Game is being delisted from Steam soon and is getting made F2P on Epic Games Store.
14023,"So Epic steals another game to turn into another ""FREE"" Fortnite alternative. First it was one of my favorite games Rocket League now this. Good thing I give less of a damn about this game but I WILL be getting a refund. Fuck you Epic & Mediatonic."
14024,"This game was fun at first. However once season 6 drops and you're forced to get an egs account, this game will no longer be playable to me. eg can go suck a bag of rotten eggs."
14025,fuck epic
14026,Epic strikes again.
14027,Another one bites the dust. Please do not support anti-consumer practices such as those being used by Epic Games and Tim Sweeney.
14028,"Epic Games would you please tell to us which will be the next studio/game you will destroy? so we can avoid it.
Everything you touch turns into a pile of shit."

14037,sick
14038,"Wow first you need an Epic Games account and now they make it free on every platform but Steam...
I want a refund and not that stupid cosmetics pack."

14063,"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."

Don't get me wrong - it is a fun game with friends or just to chill. Problem is that its popularity was based on the fact that COVID was there and it was August, so most people had free time. After 2020, the population of the game has shrinked by almost 80% (124000 players down to just 6600 as of May 2022), and it is shrinking. The game is slowly dying, so unless you got it for free or on a huge discount, don't buy it."

14310,"The game will be removed from Steam on June 21st and will be released as a free to play game on Epic Games, Playstation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

It's meh...they changed up the matchmaking and it's just not that enjoyable anymore for me.

At least the fall guys themselves are cute, so there's that I guess.  

[u]Original Review:[/u]
Contrary to the people whose sole purpose in life is to reply to every Fall Guys tweet with ""dead game,"" I can tell you it is definitely not a dead game. Personally, I can get into a game within a minute at most, though I know it will depend on region. The game probably isn't for you if you get frustrated easily and/or rage a bunch. It can have issues with lag and body-blocking (bean-blocking), along with skewed distribution of stages (seeing the same rounds way more than others). It's important to note that as of Season 6 the game requires linking with Epic Games, which isn't ideal, but not surprising since Mediatonic has been acquired by Epic Games.

I like playing the game, and I think it's fun to play with others as well. The beans (fall guys) are really adorable too. The supposed Fall Guys lore is quite silly, believe or not, a fall guy is apparently around six feet tall (⊙_⊙;)

Woo woo woo woooo!"

14334,"Played the game when it first came out, it was fine. Try to play it recently and it's filled with bugs and errors. I couldn't progress through one game before it froze on me, and that's if I could even make it to the menu screen before getting an error. Fix this. Literally an unplayable game. It's not my connection because if it was, how am I posting this review immediately after I attempted to play the game? Right. Fix it cuz I'm gone and uninstalling."
14335,I have learned so much from this game and it's an important part of party / casual battle royale game history. I am very glad that I never have to play it again

14392,"I need everyone I know to get this game, so we can have a massive game party!"
14393,good game
14394,"The game was fun. Emphasis on was. The game needed to keep getting content to keep being engaging. At first, it was working as updates were well paced for the season rewards and new content balance, with midseasons being awesome small content boosts. You will most likely get bored of playing after a while, but it's pretty enjoyable for when it isn't boring. 

However, the engagement isn't the main reason why I can't recommend the game, it's mediatonic itself. They focus too much on memeing around on social media and riding on the fame they unexpectedly got (and deserved at the time) for this game. They used to care about the community but now all they do is go on twitter, make basic memes or tweets, make ""new"" playlists, and challenges which are impossible to complete in fair timeframes. There is a lot of basic fixes to prevent exploits, a lot of issues with network, etc etc. The list goes on. The solution to levels messing up or some levels not being as enjoyable is essentially removing them from the game for months. This wouldn't be nearly as bad if it didn't take over half a year to update and add new content to the game. The new season can only be fun for so long, especially with how little in comparison is really getting added. 

I really liked this game but for these reasons, I just can't recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for a few 10 or 20 hours of fun. It's the kind of the game that really wants you to play it for hours, but it just doesn't work. 

That being said, the game is still pretty fun when it is fun and working and has a lot of potential. If only they were able to release updates more frequently and squash bugs and listen to their community more."
14395,"its good

14396,if you wanna lose your money buy this game

14432,Ok
14433,"Wanted to try this game for some time. Turns out Epic Games bought it a while ago and I had to sign up for an account. Well, alright. It's not the first time you need a Third-party access.
Played nearly 50 minutes and next time message appeared that I'm missing some kind of game files. At first I thought I'm gonna fix it, but soon I realised it's not a one 1 minute fix or so. Judging by the internet, many people experiencing it and this can sometimes happen. Which means eventually it's, probably, gonna happen AGAIN. This was a dealbreaker for me. 
Matchmaking was too long anyway so whatever... meh."
14434,such a shitty game
14435,"All I will say is when you get ""Missing file error"" It can be easy to fix but.............. When the easy fixes don't work good luck talking with a real person via email of the company as I feel it is ALL bot replies as they repeat the same troubleshooting via the page and nothing works.... I have spent days trying to rectify this issue!"

Cool game with friends or alone. It's fun, a little frustrating at times, but that's kind of the difference. :) The season battle passes are included in the purchase price, which I think is great. There are many different outfits for the character and new ones are released regularly. The developers are also constantly releasing new game modes or new maps, fun to play even after a long time too. Would recommend to anyone who likes jump and run games. Very good game! 
I would buy it again! :)"

14535,fun
14536,"decided to reinstall cause im bored, havent played in about a year, when i launch the game, it says files are missing, shouldnt it install ALL the files when INSTALLING? whatever, check integrety of game files, play the game, and i have to sign into a epic account despite me buying this game like a year ago, on steam, with a steam account, and playing it with said steam account for 3 hours. I have an epic account, but i dont see why i have to sign in, instead of it being optional, it forces you to sign in, again, WHY? People who bought this on steam shouldnt have to sign in to an epic account just to play the game THEY BOUGHT ON STEAM AND NOT EPIC. UPDATE: they have now removed this off the steam store to be put on epic, thanks, you fuckers"
14537,ITS VERY FUN
14538,"This game has such awful flow. Even if you want to get back into another game after losing, you have to wait and wait and wait. It's so bad.

The little characters play horribly, the minigames are insane in a bad way, and it's just overall not fun.

I was hoping that some of these issues, at least being able to get back into games quicker, would be fixed by now since launch. It's gotten worse. Nice job!"

14542,"Very fun game... until you finish the season, the daily challenges, and visit the store every 24 hours to see what's new. But I guess that's what keeps you coming back to play the game. Overall with friends is more fun, or do as I tend to play this game, which is to listen to music, a podcast, or even watching streams, so that the queue, and loading screens don't get boring."
14543,e
14544,"It's an okay game to play from time to time if you want a different take on the BR genre. Some game modes are more fun than others (team oriented, chasing tails/penguins, certains races without being eliminated if you fall).
At the end of the day, I would recommend it if you want a 2nd or 3rd game to complement your ""main focus game"". I'd give it a 7.5/10"

At this point just gonna refund it."

but this game is just super fun to play with 60 people online...... the only cons i have are that sometimes people stand in the way lol     and perhaps they could throw in something like a car minigame level but besides that it already fulfills a lot of the party-multiplayer expectations"

14670,"Super fun game, my cursor in game doesn't show up anymore. But its still super fun would recommend!"
14671,"I'd recommend this game, with caution. It's a fun, bright, highly-competitive game, but one slight mistake can cost you not only the lead, but the entire game. If you don't do well where a single ill-timed jump means you get eliminated from the next round, if someone bumping into you and costing you victory makes you snap a controller in half, this isn't a game for you. If you love cute characters, intense competition, and shoving people into a cloudy abyss, this is the game for you."

14738,"I like the game, its the best game I have played, but recently - to be correct, about 4 ago - actually on the day I bought the game I knew something was wrong. The game started to rape me with the hardest levels, but I'm only beginner. In these past 2 days, I have played only one good level, but the other ones really fucked me. I 
like the game, but the experience is such a bitch. Please give me easy levels, no anti-420 levels."
14739,Great parcore  game!

14780,"A legitimately fun competitive game that honestly benefits from taking breaks inbetween sessions of play, not everyday play. Originally played on PS4 at launch, then jumped back in recently on PC, and I'm having tons of fun with it. Admittedly the Epic Games connectivity is annoying, but it's overall not a huge dealbreaker or deal in general. Also with crossplay with PS4, this is most certainly not a dead game like other reviews say. some moments in the day take a few seconds longer than others but you will pretty much always get a full lobby. Definitely worth it on sale and honestly not a bad deal at full price either."

14785,"Didn't innovate enough fast enough. Took forever to actually add new content. By the time new content was added, content wasn't even good, and game got extremely repetitive and stale. Fun for the first couple of hours I guess."
14786,"its a really fun game, tho i really really F***ing hate the collision with other players, that will have you cussing and screaming lol"
14787,its nice
14788,pogchamp :)
14789,"Pros: Harder than you imagine. Short games mean little time commitment. Great system of progressing through item collecting. Good variety of levels there are to play in.

Cons: Getting disconnected from the server.  That may just be my internet speed but its the biggest con of the game. Also, waiting for the correct number of players to be found per round feels like half your time in the game is spent waiting to play. The waiting stinks because you lose your pace. Squad races mean you have to hope that your team mates are set on winning like you. Some play squads just to let their team down.

Give it 6 out a 10 for MMO.
Give it 9 for for fun... when you get to play."

14799,it is fun and free
14800,This is just mindless fun at its highest form. Shut your brain down and relax. 8.5/10
14801,"This game is fun at first, until you realize how unbalanced it is in terms of difficulty. Most matches are a jumbled mess of difficulty, mostly hard. Some times you might get a good one where you get knocked over a few times and a close call, maybe one or two falls. Races are supposed to last one to two minutes, but this last one was like ten because every single person was being knocked off by obstacles. It seems as if they are making the game harder and harder as time goes on and that is just something I hate in games, also the reason why I stopped playing SnowRunner. The game keeps trying to push you to purchase in game currency, every time I log in it wont shut up about it."

14822,"[h1] Fall Guys is plentiful, fun, and super cute! [/h1]
It would be even better if the custom mode could be unlimited. If you only have 5 friends, you can only choose from 3 game modes, which is really sad.
In addition, some players will get the first place by cheating in the game, which ruins the game experience, and most of them are [b] Chinese [/b]."

14825,ok so i was play game but then i fell and i feel sad becauzse it slow me down and slime pull back pls help i contact game support to tell them i keep lose game and they say its part of game why it part of game? why lose part of game? plz make me win part of game i want win i not want slime pull me back :(
14826,"Silly game... it's appeal ends very shortly, few hours in and you have seen everything. Most wins are due to sheer luck, but some level of skill is obviously required. Some maps can be really fun whereas others a chore to play. There is not enough content to keep me playing or even interested. Gameplay is very shallow and repetitive. I mean, if you consider skins content then it has a lot. I think this game is cool for a quick laugh with friends but not much else, and for the price i think it can be better spent elsewhere, i know i would have if i knew better."

You can not play the game without an account (fine) but when it offered to make an account linked to Steam and I said yes, it then said my ""Real ID validation failed"" and I need to log into the account and do Real ID verification. I've never created an account before. Also, why is ID verification needed to play a last name standing game? Perhaps it's some legality because the game has in purchase options? I wouldn't know because even if there is a Real ID verification process, I logged into the site and it was nowhere to be found. At this point I had wasted over 15 minutes and decided from the YouTube videos I had seen from the game it wasn't good enough to justify this dumpster fire account system. If you're looking for an easy way to get a headache, purchase this game."

Although this game has been released for almost two years, it's still a fun game for all players to try out.
The only downside of this game is the requirement of linking with epic game account. Why do I need to link with epic game account while I actually purchased the game in steam??
Hope the developers remove the requirement and add more game modes in the future."
14963,"1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and HOT

1 tablespoon cooking oil, (olive oil or coconut oil are fine)
1 1/8 cup superfine sugar, (caster sugar or white granulated sugar)*
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup all purpose (or plain) flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking oil spray. Line with parchment paper (or baking paper); set aside.
Combine hot melted butter, oil and sugar together in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk well for about a minute. Add the eggs and vanilla; beat until lighter in colour (another minute).
Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until JUST combined (do NOT over beat as doing so well affect the texture of your brownies).

Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly. (OPTIONAL: Top with chocolate chunks or chocolate chips.)
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the centre of the brownies in the pan no longer jiggles and is just set to the touch (the brownies will keep baking in the hot pan out of the oven). If testing with a toothpick, the toothpick should come out dirty for fudge-textured brownies.
Remove and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing into 16 brownies."

14967,"After playing the game for 80+ hours (as of the time of writing), I felt like giving my thoughts on the game would be great for other people looking to purchase this game.
The game is fun, very fun in fact. I know that some complain about the game being too competitive, but once you play enough, you can be good enough to conquer even some of the most seasoned veterans.
Playing with friends is a blast, discussing the game and encouraging each other makes for some fun times.
The game is very vibrant and the graphics fit the art style very well.
If you do not like how Epic Games Accounts were brought into the game, and made mandatory for players to play, then it is not worth it for you to purchase this title. Personally, this functionality never bothered me, and I enjoyed having my own name, but to each their own opinion, and in mine, I would say the chances of the account linking being removed is very unlikely.
I can say with certainty that this is one of my favorite games of all time, and if you enjoy multiplayer, battle royale, and platforming games, then this game is definitely for you. I can not give my thanks to the developers enough for making, what is in my opinion, a fantastic video game."

14970,"I wonder how much they got paid to force an EGS account on users....

Uninstalled."
14971,ok
14972,"Haven't played this game since the launch hype, thought I'd come back for a laugh. But if you're going to add another layer of DRM by making me login to my Epic Games account on a Steam purchased game, you can stick your game up your ass. Getting overly tired of double layered DRM on Steam games."
14973,muy buen juego
14974,It requires epic games account even you bought on steam
14975,Nice game

14994,best game ever
14995,"First of all, I would like to say: Euck Gpic Fames, only reason this game is getting negative review.
I hate when devs do this, I can only accept it when actual devs are a part of that platform, like eg. EA and Battlefield or Uplay and whatever souless copypasta game is Ubisoft currently working on.

Other than that game is what you expect it to be, bunch of dumb, platforming fun with decent amount of luck invovled, dont takie it seriously and you will probably have fun, Also I wouldnt say its worth its full price, content gets repetitive pretty fast.
Only 2 things I wish devs would change, outisde of EGS, is to have less down time. I dont want to watch funny men fall, I want to play funny men fall and theres a lot of filler between gameplay parts.
Also grab range seems to be somewhat random, maybe its minigame dependent, maybe its server problem, in any case sometimes I can grab someone from meters away and sometimes it feels like I cant even reach my jellymans nuts."

15032,fun
15033,I am a lowly newb at this game but my honest opinion is that i deeply enjoyed playing and wish i had bought it sooner. I was bored with every other game i own but this game produced many dopamine. Simple controls yet satisfying to play. 10/10 will fall again.
15034,"banned  for playing on my mac through parallels, support refuses to do anything (mediatonic not steam)"

15060,very fun but can get a bot boring after 3hr
15061,"It was fun for a bit, then I lost interest, couldn't return it so I'm stuck with it, but if someday I want to play again is there.

Edit: last time I play was a year ago. I think the game is still relevant(?) but not for me."
15062,the game is fun when it works. Everytime I open the game I get an error. Either error 14 which I've attempted to fix many times but this is usually followed by another error for missing files. I have tried many fixes and I can't seem to solve this issue. One time I was able to play and I enjoyed it but the fact that you cant play this game 90% of the time because of errors with epic games. waste of money
15063," I see no problem with epic account, dont know why people complaint about it. Prop for anti cheat make the game less cheater"
15064,Epic Games Please do not destroy other games

15071,"Long delays in everything litterally, to find a single game it may takes up to 10 minutes and this if you found a game, many times you won't find a game for longer than 10min which is frustrating with this game, i love it but i can't play it !"

15080,"The free to play update basically ruined everything special about Fall Guys, you can't just play and get really cool cosmetics for free. They got rid of crowns as the currency for a paid currency. Battle passes are no longer free, featured skins are no longer free, it's basically just your ordinary free to play system now. I used to really enjoy playing this game but this just ruined it for me. 

Thanks Epic Games for ruining another great game, EA isn't looking so bad at the moment."
15081,Sigma rule 69420 :- REFUND THIS SHIT

15089,Good :D
15090,good
15091,The fall guys fell off (get it cause they're fall guys and they're supposed to fall even though they don't fall that often. Well actually they do but like you don't really focus on that you focus on the fun you have at first until it gets boring which will prob take you 5 mins cause the games get boring and repetitive because the fall guys fell off get lmao LMAO LMFAO THE FALL GUYS FELL OFF I'M A COMEDIAN THIS IS SO FUNNY GUYS YOU HAVE TO AGREE!!)
15092,I fell
15093,cool
15094,Took me more than an hour to find a game on aus/nz server areas. reckon its dead asf haha.

15096,epic game
15097,good
15098,"I really enjoyed this game when it came out, but at this point the population is pretty low and filled with people who are pretty damn good at Fall Guys. I have ~25 wins and I'm part of the problem, and I still can't win any more. Expect long queues or failed queues if you're not playing at US peak times.

Also it has predatory microtransactions."
15099,The game is dead don't buy it. It wasn't fun when it came out and it hasn't gotten any better.
15100,FALLING
15101,POG
15102,"you spend more time on matchmaking and loading screens than actually playing the game. The game itself is cute, but nothing special and not fast paced enough because of the loading screens. For every hour you put into this game you will get maybe 25-35 minutes of actual gameplay. The rest of your time will be spent looking and loading screens."
15103,"This is a very fun game, with a free season pass (so you dont have to spend real money to get great cosmetics, just a lot of grinding), but sometimes I can get a little frustrated by things out of my control, like an unfun mode being chosen. Overall this game is pretty fun and easy to play, but winning does take skill."

15108,"Perfect Pancakes recipe

Ingredients:

1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
3 ½ teaspoons baking powder
¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 ¼ cups milk
1 egg
3 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:

Step 1
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.

Step 2
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot."
15109,It is a game.
15110,"Game freezes when I try to leave a lobby between rounds. Genuinely unacceptable that this game, despite being out for two years, has a bug like this. Have had to force close multiple times in less than an hour."
15111,"I played this game 69 hours, and i enjoyed it a lot. I also raged a lot, and broke 2 mouses. But it was completely worth it. My friend doesn't have a win yet after 30 hours of playing this game. And that is verry funny because he is too noob HAHAHAHAHA"
15112,this game is doddy butt spent like 10 minutes playing iot
15113,"Before I bought Fall guys, I tried Stumble guys. Ya know, cos twas free. 
Then I saw this game went on sale. Played it!
Now, I can say this with confidence, STUMBLE GUYS BETTER.

Why? Because of the following reasons 
1. Queue times is too long
2. MADE ME LOG INTO AN EPIC GAMES ACCOUNT, WHY?
3. Wtf is that rhino???

Verdict: R E F U N D"

15382,"A fun game with friends even after the hype has died down. Costumes are cute and gameplay is simple yet fun. Game modes can get a little repetitive at times due to most of it being just a ""racing to the end"" type. Additionally, the need for an epic games account is kinda weird if I have this on steam. Still recommended if you play casually and just want to have fun with 3 more friends.

Additional notes: I mean pretty good base game. They seem to put out content that isn't too game breaking/changing. However, for me atleast, I feel like the game lost its hype. It seemed to be more fun when it first came out compared to now. Only buy it if you have friends looking to play a new game together. 
P.S only reason I put eargasm as the audio was because of this beautiful song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys4rkcMbtjY (dont worry its not a rick roll)"
15388,"Addicting !! Cute characters and cool graphics. It has a long loading time though, but it is fun to play! I have encountered some cheaters, and I cannot report some - it says error reporting player, but I rarely see cheaters now. There are new exciting levels added which is nice. Overall, enjoyable and adorable game to play - solo or with friends :D"

He then proceeded to run at me full sprint at least 64 miles per hour with the most rusted, robust, bickered wrench of time and all beings."
15506,"Fun party game!
"
15507,Epic games store account required
15508,Game changed and is now forcing users that had already purchased the game to create Epic Accounts. Anytime a company forces users to give up privacy to a 3rd party after the fact is simply baiting and switching. I play this game on Steam so I don't have to deal with Epic.

15545,very fun but hard
15546,Fuck Epic Games
15547,very fun game but sometimes I fail first or second round it's still fun :)
15548,I sure love trying to get back into the game after a long time and finding out that I require an epic game store account to be able to play...
15549,go
15550,"This game is trash...it is made with Unity. Unity is trash. Unreal is by far better.
In addition:

- so many games but just a few are selected in the rounds (main show)
- duo, trio or squad are unplayable because every round the same games are selected (multiplayer shows)
- the beans are not equally formed
- after one day of playing im bored
- there are too many bugs
- too few updates

+ i destroyed my table and my controller

-> All in all, very shitty game.
    Go play Crab Game again instead. It is way more relaxing and fun..."
15551,"Sangat menyenangkan sekali, aku bermain bersama temanku dan aku tidak pernah mendapatkan crown. Sungguh menyedihkan sekali karena tidak  dapat crown. Tetapi aku tetap senang dengan game ini karena tidak tau hahaha lucu sekali everybody."
15552,dogwater
15553,"pretty fun for casual players. 
but matchmaking kinda took a long time during less-busy hours"
15554,I launched the game after roughly 1 year not playing and surprise surprise sneaky Epic Online Services got installed on my computer.
15555,"A lot and a lot of technical issues, it is overwhelming"

15565,"Besides having to make an Epic Account and launch the Epic Store to be able to play the game they're are not many negative reasons i can think of to play the game. The Epic Store is used for Crossplay on different platforms so its understandable. The game is very fun you might get a little frustrated with team matches or because at times you feel your losses are based on luck and not skill. But the game is very fun, gives off a friendly and happy atmosphere. I honestly wish i played this more its almost therapeutic if you prefer peaceful fun loving games."
15566,flick my bean.
15567,"Great game, even when you lose, you never feel like it's a huge setback. Perfect for a short session since most games are only 10-15 minutes long and fairly easy to learn. Dumb costumes as far as the eye can see. Sometimes can be frustrating when you are lumped into a team game and your team is a bunch of brain-dead morons (but what team game isn't frustrating?) Highly recommend."

15594,NICE
15595,hi
15596,Used to be a great game but completely selling out to epic and discarding old usernames/data so that players are forced to make an epic account is such a shitty move. Really used to enjoy this and I'm glad for the updates but having to sign your data and your soul over to epic (and tencent) is really hard to reconcile.
15597, This can be a really fun game to stream!! I like it a lot.
15598,"[strike]This game has been desecrated for corporate greed under the guise of appealing to a wider audience. There is no incentive to play or win the game anymore, unless you plan on spending money. 

Instead of receiving crowns as a way to purchase cosmetics in the shop, you don't get any of the new premium currency, or even kudos, just XP, which doesn't even matter anymore because unless you plan on buying a season pass every time, the XP will do nothing.

There is currently no way to get cosmetics without spending money, as opposed to the previous model which, while slow, still allowed you to get cosmetics from the shop without paying.

The new payment model for the premium currency is also predatory, as most of the costumes cost 1200 Showbucks, which the lowest purchasable amount of Showbucks is 1000 at $7.99.

This means to even get one cosmetic set you need to pay at least $15.[strike/]

They added sonic back is aight again"

15603,Amazing game
15604,"Fall guys is simply fun, though for limited periods at a time. The mechanically simple yet challanging games are fun to play, it has a overall positive vibe, yet bores a bit when played too much in one go. It's music can be best described as if one blended dextro energy and red bull and converted the blend to music, which I really love but does send some of my friends into a cardiac arrest."
15605,Competitive and fun. thumbs up

Looking for players.......

Played 3 matches in a 55 minute block, I feel waiting 20 minutes per match is way to much for a positive review. 
Getting to connect at all would be positive yet that's damn near impossible. 
I really want to play this game but it never connects to a match to play. 
Will affortunalty just delete it. Will not invest in this company ever again unless I get my money back

15656,Fun while it lasted! Lobbies tend to take a while to fill up which takes away from the fun. Other than that fun game 8/10.
15657,Adorable yet funky game<33 luvv!
15658,worsed game ever. sucked booty cheeks since it came out rate 2 skin shavings out of 10 pickled eggs. very bad
15659,Awesome game! Exhilarating if you are up for a challenge! Enjoy yourselves!
15660,"I now have to use two game launchers to play this lackluster game. It has amazing potential, but I am basically still playing the same maps from launch. I have owned this game for years and it has recieved no significant updates. it is still basically the same thing all this time later. if it was a single time purchase with no microtransactions i would understand, but this is a live service game with seasons and basically no significant new content besides promotions and cosmetics. I just don't see this as worth your time and money unless you REALLY love this particular kind of look and gameplay.

It has very little depth and a lot of monetization. I would say there are much better games for all age groups than this.  I log in every few months and try all the new modes, but it turns out it is just the same maps i've already played over and over. Stop making business deals and make more content for the game. It is crazy to charge an upfront fee, a battle pass, and micro transactions for this game."
15661,This game is really fun and is really underrated.

DONT BUY"
15671,Fall Guys is one of the best games I have on my pc and would recommend this game to anyone.
15672,this game is utter rubbish
15673,"its realy hard but you get better at it
"
15674,"Fall Guys is pretty much a 3D platformer Takeshi's Castle where you're tying to win a battle royale with gameshow style events either solo or with a squad/friends. 

The most fun comes from playing with people you know and crossplay makes it easy to play with friends. I've played this game with so many different groups of people and it's always a really fun time, can't give a better endorsement than that. At this point the game has been out for a while so there is plenty of content and modes to keep things fresh, i have gotten plenty of playtime from this game and i'll be hopping back on every now and then for something chill to play in groups."
15675,"yes

15676,"i recommend buying it on discount, its not worth 20€"

15694,"Fall guys ultimate knockout, where do i begin.  such an interesting game that may seem simple at first but hard to master.  Although you might find yourself making it past the first 2 rounds or even 3, but try making it to the final or even winning on a consistent basis.  You will probably find that it is much harder to win than on your other multiplayer ""battle royale"" if you will like fortnite or pubg.  On this not it may seem like I would have a negative attitude towards the game but it is quite the opposite.  It makes it an extra challenge and that feeling when you finally do get a win, oh boy is it amazing, like an orgasm from an absolute ten at the frat party you banged last weekend, I know you get so much poon!  Anyways I digress.  I would give this game a 90/100 for the fact that is so easy to get into and have a great time with the fun loving graphics and sounds you really can't go wrong with fall guys.  The only reason I would take away points as after awhile you may find yourself playing the same maps quite a few times.  Thanks."
15695,I bought this on Steam. I obviously have a Steam account. I played it and had a little fun. I was annoyed I could not play how I wanted and had to always be online. Now I can't even play unless I make an Epic Games account. I chose to uninstall. I would never recommend this game to anyone.
15696,was dead and bad for a while but they now started adding alot more updates and the game has less bugs and is now really good and fun

I hope that this game becomes popular again."

15762,"Loaded up the game since its been a while...
Please sign into steam, ok.
Load up fall guys.
Please sign into Epic... ok??
Epic, please sign into one of the following... ok nintendo account.
Please create an Epic account... ef you!
I'm uninstalling.

Just let me play without this garbage."
15763,"[b]/!\ Beware, you now need an Epic Games account to play the game.
I'm very displeased with this sudden change that I find to be fraudulent. When I buy a game, I check what I will require to give and what I will receive... it's not so the rules can completely change in my back! Because of this I can't play anymore the game I paid for without making an account I absolutely refuse to be forced to create in these conditions.[/b]

In any case, this game can be fun but also really frustrating.
It's hard to get good/practice/experiment because you get pushed around a lot (maybe a solo/private lobby mode would help with that? => Ah actually from other reviews it seems they have added that, nice).
In party modes, you often are with people that will leave in the middle of a match. So you will be left alone while still being expected to mark points like you are a full team, dooming you to fail.
It was fun at first when discovering the maps but then it feels really repetitive because it seems like you are always playing the exact same thing. They change modes from times to times but if you're playing in the same week then you will mostly play through the same 3 maps and that quickly gets really annoying.

My view of this game wasn't very positive because of these frustrations but I was willing to play it more and give it another chance when I would have more time. But now I can't anymore because they made account changes while I was away. So I guess I'll just have to go with this short review."
15764,"FUCKING NOOB WHY I NEED TO connect a fucking retard selling my personal information
to play a game on steam, fucking stupid, fucking refund"
15765,Fun and entertaining game.
15766,"played it a while back and i enjoyed it. Just tried to log back in and its trying to get me to make an epics game account? I paid for it i logged into stream i don't want a million bloody accounts for a million different games espicaly when i have already logged into steam. don't know why they are just trying to get my log in information and details now all of a sudden. i don't wanna be a part of that. just let me play the game.
tldr: i'm not making an epics game account for this because its an  unnessesary request. not playing it anymore"

15768,Can be stressful
15769,"Haven't played in a while, so I thought why nut?
Now I have to sign in with my Epic account? Can't remember my password, so I can't play this game no more.

15842,Fun game that kills time easily
15843,"Fix the winning animation. Everytime me or someone else wins it glitches and does a t-pose. I don't wanna see among us fall guy character t pose on me. Also if u spam celebrations/emotes u can glitch a lot. Also chickens run to fast its pure luck if u get one to get close to you. Also there is no race only mode like there used to be, dont make me play modes I dont want to play game modes u force upon me."
15844,good
15845,fall guy
15846,Good except I can't sex the other bean.
15847,"I've played this game since the beginning, with periods on and off, so I am not the best player around. However I do notice that the newer maps feel more like bullshit to me than the older maps with more RNG based climbups, there is even a map without checkpoints in between. I've enjoyed this game a lot, but in the state it is in right now I would not recommend buying it, since in the normal mode, which you probably will be playing with some friends, all the newer maps have a heavier weighting than the older maps and the learning curve to get to any finals will either be fully RNG or very difficult."

15882,"The game is very unique and fun. It is supported well with added content every few months. Even better is that the game has cross-play with PS, and will be coming to the Xbox and Switch. Support was very fast to help me with an achievement issue. Overall the game is a fun time and can be enjoyed with friends."
15883,decent but kinda mid tho
15884,"garbage mechanics, even winning a couple times doesn't amount to the pure rage that is team games. wish i knew it was only worth maybe 5$"

logged into steam to play as usual and now met by an Epic Games sign in barrier that I cannot get past.
tried my steam password which isnt recognised then clicked forgotten password and entrerd my email as requested, that also not recognised so lost a game"
15891,good
15892,"Everytime i play this, i violently pee and often don't make it to the bathroom. This game has sacrificed many underwears"
15893,بيرفكت
15894,i like the cool level designs  in the game
15895,"super fun game, especially if you have a friend to play with. Very competitive in a friendly, easy going manner. Child friendly, fun for the whole family. Play enough, and you'll be able to wear fun outfits without having to spend any extra money. I truly enjoy this game, and I can not suggest it enough."
15896,"Although the game is supported with updates, the update process is very slow. For this reason, while everyone is tired of the arrival of the same maps, the arrival of 3-4 different maps in the new season also leaves the season's vitality dim. The controls are clunky and still the sync problems have not been solved. Although it's fun to race with friends, there's a game structure that get boring, so it's a game that you should play every once in a while"
15897,Game now requires Epic's spyware to be installed.

15914,"Requires EPIC GAMES account for people that have already played the game before. This should be against steam policy for developers to modify base login procedure to a competitor. Exceptions would only be if accounts were needed to the developer itself, like World of Tanks."
15915,Good fun until tomp creates the Gentlemans club and decides to turn it into a racist and non inclusive experience for everybody.

15961,"I've given up on this game before because my old laptop doesn't let me play peacefully. It's lacked and crashed so many times. But last week I bought a new laptop and decide to try this game again, and it was like my dream finally comes true!! It's more fun than ever before when the game is smooth. The only thing I don't like is that it's quite impossible to find the room in the middle of the night like 2-5am because people are sleeping, which is understandable since it's online game. Anyway, it would be weird if I don't recommend it. LET'S ENJOY THE GAME AND GET YOURSELF SOME CROWN(S)"

Even without winning or reaching the end of rounds I still personally like the game, yes some people can be toxic but that's another fun part of the game."

Perfect multiplayer game for the casual gamer who doesn't want to bother with crazy learning curves or toxic communities; Fall Guys is the most simple fun I've had in a long time. Some people complain about you having to sign to Epic games, but you only have to do that once and it's only a matter of a few clicks, so I don't see what the fuss is about."

You don't feel bad if you're bad at the game.

Now has predatory microtransactions, tonnes of bots due to F2P and forces you to have EpicGames. 
Lowkey want my money back.

This is a light-hearted game that can be fun and frustrating. Don't take it too seriously and it's a decent time killer, take it seriously and your in for looking like a raging chimp at a bubbly colorful game. 

This game is technically a mini-game battle royale, with elimination rounds. So there can only be one winner. 

It's $20 for a good time, go for it if it looks like you'd like it."

But when I tried to play the game itself; The game wouldn't start and when I tried to launch it, it kept giving me error codes. I kept trying and trying to launch it until I had to refund it. Very disappointing, I wish I could recommend it, or give it a better review, but I simply can't.

Online lobby loading times are super minimal, and experienced very few bugs. If you find yourself falling without teleportation to starting point, it's easy to leave the match and rejoin another. 

Casual and fun platforming competitions. The Guys' ""woohoo hoos"" are pleasant."

16142,"When I first picked up Fall Guys, I wanted to love it. The design of the characters was cute, the design of the game world was similarly charming, the music and sound effects were bombastic and enjoyable. The gameplay itself was challenging but in a way as to reward people who practiced and got better. At the end of the day, Fall Guys never fully hooked me. It was mediocre fun with a lobby full of friends, and that is pretty much the best thing I can say about the game. I always felt that I was never really in control of my character, which really sucks when the game is based around jumping puzzles and tight platforming. This could certainly be a product of my own inexperience, but nonetheless reflects poorly on the game. The whole thing, a few hours in, feels like a cheap cash grab that really should have been a F2P game more than anything else. The fact that the developers sold out to EGS is really the final nail in the coffin.

I guess the glizzy skin makes up for all of that though, at least that's what my friends say."

I started noticing that I had no games to play by myself, so I looked and looked and looked. Nothing to be found. However, I had just gotten a gift card for my birthday or something. It was $20 so I had to look for something not too expensive. I came across Fall Guys, and it was $10, and it was a hard decision sense it would be half of my money. I chose to buy it. I never did and never will regret that."

16166,this game just tried to install the epic game launcher on my pc.
16167,"My best friend bought me this game and I love it so much. I've played over 100 hours on this game now so thought I'd leave a positive review. It's super fun to play and the different rounds are really exciting and can be changed-up every so often with new rounds. I have become a bit obsessed with trying to collect the different colours, patterns, face palettes and the different outfits which you can mix and match if you don't have the full set! I think the fact the game is so customisable is one of the best things about it. I also really like the art style because it's super cute and can be addictive, but not too much so I can safely play it during my University time without taking me away too much from my work. It's the perfect balance for me - and it's even better played with friends, but I also like solo play. 


***EDIT: Since the Season 7/Season '1' update Fall Guys became 'free for all', the game has become a bit rubbish. I used to really enjoy playing this with my friend but we've both had enough. The creators have added lots of lovely costumes and designs into the game, except they only reward people who pay real money for items that once were obtainable simply by playing the game and earning in-game currency. However, the quests now give you so little that it is unrewarding and hence, less fun. I was once a collector of the different skins and costumes but now this has become almost impossible unless I am rich. I also feel that there should have been some warning to the original player base that crowns would be turned into kudos, which are basically now a useless currency in game that can only get you mediocre headgear and footwear. The maps are still fun, but I don't play it anymore because I feel like the creators have ruined it for me. "

16198,"Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

16281,the game installs spyware on your PC. dont install it.
16282,I like it.
16283,"Fall guys falls short when trying to make friends online. Over zealous censorship from epic games makes it impossible to talk to other players, or engage and make friends. Not surprised that the game is kind of dead because of it. Long queues loom over this free to play when big brother, and tencent(china) is watching."

16341,"I've had this game for about a year now, started playing when Season 3 came out and loved the game so much, it was addicting to play for months. I quit the game back in Oct of 2021 with over 300 hours on the game in total, a 6 month break pretty much. Now, I'm starting to enjoy the game again since my friend reminded me about it. All I can say is that this game is too much fun to play, even with friends! I recommend playing this if you like battle royale-ish type game.

also, beaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaans"
16342,"Game may not be as popular as it used to be, but man is it fun to play time to time. Recommend Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, you'll have a blast playing it"

16344,drop dudes
16345,"This game used to be the game, along with Among us. But the bad mechanics and other stuff... I just can't give it a good review.

Some of it is cool. Some maps are perfectly seasonal - they are in the spirit, but work the same as the un-seasonal maps. 

But the mechanics are the biggest issue. I can't move without bouncing off of something. I just want to play the game, not run on soapy ice.

Overall:
It's a cool concept, but the mechanics implemented could use a little tweaking.

Fix? Maybe another game mode with minimal bounce. 

P.S please change the epic games sign in, I can't sign in for months now."
16346,"Battlepasses are way too long for content you can finish in 2 weeks just by doing the daily challenges. 
In the end, there's no much to do once you finish a BP.

Cool game and skins though, but like I said, you may not have a chance to get more (crossover) skins with crowns after finishing a BP, unless you sweat the game 24/7 to get a full set (10 crowns).

PS: my whole review got deleted because I switched from thumbs up to thumbs down. Another reason to keep it down this time."
16347,good if u can find a game lol
16348,"Among us sucks compared to this, never should have replaced this game"
16349,"Popular or not, a multiplayer platformer with constant updates and events is exactly what I need in gaming culture right now. 😊

July 12th, 2022. Epic has taken over, both predictions of their 'plans with funding' have come true; Old levels are refreshed and fun again whilst new levels and mechanics are beyond what we've ever seen before, butttt they also monetized the shizniz outta everything. Welcome to Epic Game's Fall Guys, everybody!...

July 31st: I EXTREMELY dislike how long Epic Games' Fall Guys takes to boot up. And omg, the amount of crap you need to click through after you finish a match... ugh even the new store is a buggy mess.

August 3rd: The long boot-up times are making me not want to boot it up for brief amounts of time, and the over-saturated store makes me no longer check when I regrettably boot it up."

16354,"I only played this game during its first season, right before Among Us became the juggernaut it is now.

Back then, I really enjoyed it, but I thought it was weak on content, and the team-based rounds bogged the matches down. By now, I probably have a lot of catching up to do."

It takes way long to exit and enter a new round, overall not a fun experience, even with friends."

Every seasons battle pass is free so you are constantly unlocking stuff while playing. It’s one of the best party games I have ever played, all it lacks is a way to play it offline with people IRL similar to how you would play smash bros.

As it stands definitely worth a purchase when on sale."

16462,"This was a fine enough game when I played it around season 2/3, but now they snuck an Epic Games requirement into the latest season (at the time of writing, that's season 6). I can't recommend it solely because of that, which is kind of a shame. I want to like the game tbh but this is not how you make a solid game that doesn't fuck fans over. Please, let this at least be a lesson to other game developers that this isn't okay."

How to get good At Fall Guys
First Method,
Get In Front Of Eveyone,If You Did It Right Eazy Win
But You Get Pushed By A Kid,So yea...

Get Cheetos (I don't recommend doing :)
Third Method
Give Me Steam Points (I recommend doing +most safe)

16524,"Love it

16525,"Game changes from not needing any 3rd party account to needing EPIC games, the devs will happily change the requirements to play the game you already payed for to get some extra cash at the expense of its customers. Would not recommend."

16532,yay
16533,Its super fun and i hope they keep adding new things to the game i  definitely recommend this game
16534,nope
16535,When I got this game I didn't need to boot up Epic Games. But apparently that's changed. They forced to link my Epic games account to my Steam account. I'm really sick of game companies doing this. There's a reason why I didn't get the second South Park game. I don't need 2 services running to play one game. Especially when it wasn't necassary when I bought the game :I

16553,Very fun  game allows you to play with others online without talking to them or really knowing who they are.  Fun obstacle courses that last only a minute or so and if you make it in time you go to the next level until there is one sole winner. Cute costumes to pick from and buy with your points in the game and daily challenges. Some boards are definitely easier than others but they appear randomly so you never know in which order you will play them. It's a great game for the whole family.
16554,"Lovely Battle Royale ~_~

16570,good game
16571,"This was a cute and fun game until it was packed with people hacking through the game and really just destroying the fun. I didn't play it to expect to master it and win win win... just wanted to play with family and friends and have a good time. Not enough is done to stop people that ruin it for everyone else just trying to have a good time. - It was so bad that it ruined my desire to want to try it again. For everyone else, good luck and I hope that it's improved and that you get to enjoy."
16572,"This game is always mistaken as dead, its really not. You can get into a game in less than a minute and have a ton of fun, and if you're playing a LTM mode you can get them in a few seconds. This is one of those games that most people think are dead but still have a decently thriving community just like Titanfall 2, Overwatch, etc."

Not only do you need to make another account there, but it installs some sort of software on your computer that I haven’t managed to disable, even when Steam and the Epics Launcher aren’t being used. Kind of annoyed that the system changed."

16613,"This game is SO fun. It's got it all. Racing, survival, memory games, all while the other players are actively working to eliminate you (and you can do the same to them). The rounds are challenging and they always change to keep things fresh and interesting. I've played for about 50 hours at this time, and while I personally have a hard time getting first place (I'm pretty average in skill level in that I can beat most rounds, but I don't typically come in first) the game is fun enough that I don't mind not coming in first."

16663,"Fall Guys is a casual multiplayer party game in which up to 60 players compete in several different minigames, with players being eliminated after each round. The ""Main Show"" as the game calls it, usually consists of 5 rounds, with the final round deciding the winner, who takes the crown. Besides the Main Show, there are usually a couple different side shows every couple of months, which have special rules (like minigames from the same type, be it races, team games, whatever), and the game also gets big season updates at least a couple of times throughout the year, which are usually themed and add new minigames.

I must say, however, that I haven't really played the game since Season 2, before the Epic buyout, but even back then, I found the game really fun, if frustrating at times. I recently got back to it because of one of the special events, and after getting 100% completion, I feel it was time to give my review. The game is still enjoyable, and there's lots of customization options available, though in order to get them, you must earn either of the game's currencies: Crowns, which are earned for winning games, and Kudos, which are earned for playing (and can be bought). While it's great to have such levels of customization (plus several DLC packs adding new costumes), I must say the focus on the game's ""economy"" (which isn't really an economy, as you can't trade with other players) feels ridiculous, with several cool items being time limited, with no real clue as to when they'll come back, if they come back. This is a great disappointment, as you might miss out on a cool costume just for not playing the game during a specific event, or because you didn't have enough crowns. All in all, its customization aspect has a big FOMO aspect to it.

Then, there's also the subject of the Epic buyout. As I write this review, I'm uncertain as to whether I should give it the thumbs up or thumbs down. The game itself, leaving the ""economy"" aside is pretty fun (if, again, frustrating at times), but ever since the acquisition, Epic has been integrating it more and more into their system. While the added crossplay capabilities are a positive, having to use yet another account when I bought the game on Steam is annoying (though I did have an Epic account from before they even started the EGS), and it's especially annoying when the game won't work because of a problem with the EOS servers (like when a new Fortnite update comes out).

Anyway, getting back on track, graphically speaking, the game looks colourful, the visual style really emphasizes the sillyness of the games, and the voices of the beans, which mostly talk in ""woos"" add to the fun. The soundtrack is also very good.

Well, this is one of those times in which I wish Steam would let us use a ""no thumbs"" score, as there's certain things that make me not want to give a thumbs up to this game, but at the end of the day, and for as long as it remains on Steam, I guess I can recommend it.

EDIT (May 16th, 2022):

Changed my review to a thumbs down because, as I'd suspected ever since the acquisition was announced, the game is going F2P and EGS exclusive next month. While I don't really have an issue with paid games going F2P, I do have an issue with Epic's approach to ""competition"", which in this case means ""buy the developer of a popular game and remove it from the store where it originally gained popularity"". It's a real middle finger from the hypocrite known as Tim Sweeney."

16673,Good game
16674,"I will always despise Epic.

All they do is buy out great games and ruin them by filling them with micro-transactions. Previously, all the skins could be earned for free if you were good enough as you were rewarded with points to purchase items. Now, all of the decent good looking skins can only be purchased by buying (with real money) 'Show-Bucks'. 

Players who bought the game before it went free were ""rewarded"" with terrible skins, a nickname and a nameplate. At-least they were decent enough to give us a free season of Season Pass.

As always, thank you Epic for ruining another game!"
16675,♥♥♥♥
16676,It was fun for a bit. Overcoming the sweats or winning by pure luck. The controls aren't super tight which added to the silly fun of it all. The reason why I can't recommend the game to new players is you might as well play this on Epic Game Store now they make you sign into that account. Saves you opening up another launcher.

The problem is that most of us bought the game when you don't need to make an Epic account, then out of nowhere, we are all locked out of the game if we do not create or use one, and it's not enough with an account here on steam when buying this game.
the dev should not had done a pull rug rocket league. this business practices is unfair and not okay to use on steam account users. just flaged-reported this game to steam."

16761,good game but dead
16762,good
16763,This game is heckin fun! :D
16764,"It's a party and kind of Battle Royale game in which 60 players compete in mini-games/elimination rounds against each other until 1 man is left standing. All players are awarded in-game currency based on their performances. The currency is then used to buy cosmetic items for one's character from the in-game store, which rotates its store deals daily. The vibe of this game is goofy, yet the gameplay can become surprisingly frustrating as the little character you control moves can be ""very"" clumsily.

The game is a fun time killer, but I don't think it would hold a gamer's interest for the long term. This multi-player game, unfortunately, does not support voice or text chat, which is a MAJOR LET DOWN for any multi-player game. Without it even with the friends, you made during the game it feels like playing with bots sometimes. The game makes you use taunts but I don't think anyone cares about them at all. So I'd recommend this game before but playing again feels like it's behind his ""Battle Royale/Party age"" it's like using arrows and swords during the 21st Century...But I respect other people's opinions as well. Until next time see you soon."
16765,i want to chew them
16766,i cant play the game. when the game opens its says. I need to verify it on the store WTF!
16767,"not worth the full price get it on a sale

16778,since epic took over the game is  stable and i  can  get an online game
16779,"igen
"
16780,"One of the most creative battle royales out there, and I highly recommend it! My only complaint is a few of the rounds feel too luck-based, such as Tip Toe and Lost Temple. These rounds shouldn't be removed, but rather need heavy adjustments."
16781,keren karna bisa dapet diamonds epep gratis fix tapi di game ini ga ada pintu
16782,My laptop runs this game on 16 fps and is nice.
16783,the pills stopped working
16784,"bad game
funny tho"
16785,very nice very good
16786,"at first hell nah, but now since its crossplay its hella comp. Playing squads with the homies on console and pc in squads makes the game funny and fun. Despite how terrible your team sells you"
16787,This game is really fun. You can change your avatar and you win a round .You can get coins and spend them on your avatar and there are updates .How to play you join a game and you try to win and if you win you get coins. You can invite people and  friend them. And you can be in the same server and you can play together. And thats how I play.
16788,amazin but ded asf
16789,dont buy
16790,good game
16791,Decent game for a decent price
16792,
16793,Very adequate!

16795,Insanely funny !!!
16796,fall men
16797,"fun, time passer"

16814,cute
16815,"I guess I won't touch this game anymore, thx epic"
16816,ok okm ok
16817,good
16818,I'm loading screen stuck! any tips to fix?
16819,Comes with inordinate amounts of Epic bloat with long queue times and no ultrawide support. Toss in requiring an Epic account to play and you have a perfect recipe for something I'll never touch again.
16820,yay
16821,"issues running on windows 7 windows 10 no problem
"
16822,cute
16823,nice game
16824,i though it was fall guy not falling player base thank you obama
16825,"hi
"
16826,"Super frustrating to play, but it's even MORE fun to play. Absolute mayhem in cute costumes, I wish this game blew up more. The newer seasons have added so many cool features that make the game more dynamic too. 100/10!

Also. I don't know why people are frustrated with needing an Epic games account, it feels like such a nothing problem considering how good the game is??"

"
16830,"bean, nice"
16831,"I keep dying
"
16832,"Ah yes, fall guys. I remember the first day I ended up getting this game. I had quite an enjoyable time on this game. Later on, I played with my good friend, Sam Howard. We played fall guys not too long together that I remember, but it was quite enjoyable of a time. I later on also got my friends, Zack and Xavier, to get the game and they played with me. I got quite a few wins, as well as them, but it was one of the most pleasant times I've had playing videos  games in quite some time. I enjoyed playing this game with them and would recommend other people to get this game as well."
16833,i love this game so much just wish it had console variants
16834,"Platformer/Wipeout BR?! Yes, please!!"
16835,pretty hype. kinda get boring
16836,fun
16837,"its goods
"
16838,love it
16839,"Too late 2 years to buy this game but it's really fun 
"
16840,good soup
16841,"I personally love the game.  It's a fun change from all the mmo's and other random games I play.  Usually you can play a game in under 5 mins with different rounds maybe to 10 mins.  Everything is bright and colorful.  And even when you get annoyed with someone knocking you off a platform you still end up laughing/smiling at something in the game.  

Why I don't recommend the game.  6 months ago I would be telling people to buy it even when it's not on sale.  But now with epic trying to make everything cross platform I always seem to have lag no matter what server I use or what my settings are.  (PC - steam user)  As I've had the lag issue with multiple internet connections it kind of really sucks."
16842,"I enjoyed playing this game now and then, but the decision to force all existing players to create an Epic Games account is a no-go for me and is a really shady thing to do. Glad I bought this game during a sale, but still wish I could get my money back since. Uninstalled and moving on."
16843,"Bought this game before they had that stupid thing with Epic game account, you cant force players to make an account on something that you add later and i didnt agree to it cause was way after I bought it, so no i dont recommend this at all and wish could get my money back right now"
16844,very fun
16845,gud
16846,Very good
16847,This game now requires an Epic Store account. I refuse to create an additional account and have requested a refund.
16848,This is a really fun game! I bought it on sale when it was $8. It is exactly like what I thought it was going to be! There are multiple modes to play. Currently my favorite is Sweet Thieves.
16849,Crapic games account required.. Another game lost to the garbage pile with Crapic's Chinese overlord's (Tencent.) cameras all over it... What a shame.

16861,some hackers but it's good
16862,It fun to play with friends
16863,Fun

16886,Good game.
16887,"Error 14 : EPIC FAIL !!!
Game does NOT Work"
16888,i liked playing this game every now and again but after taking a year off of this game i came back to it and it was broken for me. could not click buttons on main menu so i checked the game files and steam said it was okay to play so when i opened it again fall guys said i was missing files but the game was updated and good!??! i just wanted to play games every now and again but its a pain to get this game going. i am sad that i cant play this game no more after 56 hours. so i uninstalled and didnt feel like waiting for 7.6 GB to download again so this is where i say goodbye fall guys. bye bye
16889,WHERE IS MY CURSOR WTF GIVE IT BACK!!
16890,it will do
16891,"good if you like this crap bad if you dont
"
16892,this game is very stupid but that's the point
16893,itsa good game but the files and stuff are strange
16894,very fun if you play with friends
16895,
16896,"SO GOOD
"
16897,"this made my wife divorce me, she took custody of the kids, i cant go outside because ive been in here for too long, ive lost my job as a biotechnologist, and now i dont know what 7x7 is."
16898,"Game was fine enough with regular content updates. I quite enjoyed it at some points.

The integration with the Epic Games Launcher is a nuissance and forcing me to sign in to a game I had already been signed into and played on is on prior experience is awful and I want my money back.

boo"
16899,fun
16900,Just good fun for all ages
16901,pretty fun
16902,"I haven't played this since it came out. I just installed this again to play for a bit and I'm locked out of the game unless I create or sign in with an Epic account. I didn't buy this game on Epic, why am I required to use a different launcher now? 
If I wanted to play this on Epic, I'd have bought this on Epic. 
This game isn't worth the asking price, it was fun just for a very short while, hence I haven't touched this game since it came out. It's definitely not worth the asking price and a completely different launcher on top of that."
16903,YESS OMGGGGGGGG
16904,"It's pretty fun, i'm sure they will add more to the game in the future."
16905,good game i play it too much
16906,"So my girlfriend traveled to study abroad in europe , i felt sad and lonely without her the first weeks , then my friend gifted me two copies of this game , one for me and one for my girlfriend , i started playing this game everyday with her , it made me feel like she was here with me and relive the good old days as we used to play together i really want to thank him so much , this game is a big "" worth a buy "" ! , i love it and i recommend it so much ! It's a simple and enjoyable game , it's really fun ! , battlepass is free + gives you kudos/crowns to buy cosmetics from the store , kudos/crowns can be earned from matches as well , the game is really fair and fun to play , no cheaters ( at least i didn't encounter one at all ) , community is very friendly , save some bucks and buy it guys it's totally worth it !"
16907,a good game not buggy at all alittle over priced but good game in all
16908,fun
16909,fun
16910,nice game
16911,"In fall guys you play as Mr. Bean. Now there's a twist: There are good Mr. Beans and bad ones. The ones that grab constantly are bad one, they need to be exterminated. So that's why you need to call Jim Carrey to give you a bazooka and you could get to work. All in All stop grabbing you dumb sucker."
16912,alot of fun
16913,this game blows cock
16914,so hot it made me cream so hard
16915,"It worked until now. Missing files required. Reinstalled, epic online crap reinstalled, still not working, game files veryfied too.. Nothing changed. Fix that, until that its a huge no.

Update:

Its working now, and I love this game!"
16916,"A cute, frequently updated game which is quite unique and it's super fun to play a lot of Total Wipeout ^^"
16917,"After a measly 92 hours into this game I think I can say I like it. If you are looking for an epic single player adventure go try Elden Ring I heard it was pretty good. However if you're looking for a game that you can play every once in a while as a distraction this may be for you. This game offers it's unique take on the battle royale genre being not a shooter, but a 3d platformer in the same vein as an old n64 game. Another plus is the game offers constant updates. Let's just hope they add crossplay soon it would be cool to play with my console buds."
16918,"Was fun the first 2-3 days, then the game slowly died out"
16919,fun and addictive with friends
16920,Retarded af. was playing it year ago and now they want my personal data such as pohoto of debit card to play again. lol. i am not idiot. thiefs.
16921,FUN
16922,"the better bean game. Amogus is for kids, Fall Guys is for GIGACHADS"
16923,ye
16924,good game fun but hard to get crowns got to be cracked at fall guys my guy
16925,gud
16926,"It's fun
It's fantastic
It's colorful
It's short"
16927,"Bought the game
Waited in a queue for a match for 20 minutes
Couldn't find a match
Closed the game
Refunded it

I was even queued for every gamemode available, I knew it was bad but I didn't know it was that bad."
16928,"hehha
"
16929,JUST RUUUUNNNNN !!!!
16930,this made me sneez after falling into the huge void
16931,итпавап
16932,"Fall guys is a fun game you can play with your freinds or alone if you have no friends.

I personally liked in this game that it has simple mechanics and isn't that complicated, and the game is still challenging. And all the raging and fun moments i had with my friends, and that happened alot in those 2 hours i played with them.
Another good thing is, that everything is free in this game. Well you can still buy those tokens, but it's not worth it because you can just farm them, and you can just buy clothets so. I personally don't hope that Fall Guys won't get free because of Epic Games, because i bought this game, and i am not the only one.

My negative point is that this game can get equal very fast. The game developers should've leaft all maps inside for more difference.

My whole opinion is that this game is fun sometimes, and i like the fact that everything is free.

Thank you for reading my whole review, it's my second review so it won't be that good either. Maybe i'll start making Youtube videos soon, but i still don't have a cut program.

Goodbye"
16933,"Great and Amazing & Fun game 

Its good for chill time."
16934,hacve to use epic fall guys IS DEAD because of epic

16938,I LIK IT
16939,"Made me sign up for Epic Games randomly one day and then link it to my Steam account. WHY??

16940,Still a pretty fun casual game.
16941,so gooooooooood get it while on sale. does require epic account tho but who cares (: epic does give free games so might as well create an account everyone wins.

16973,Good Game :)
16974,e
16975,dead but fun
16976,"This game may be dead, but it is still very fun. This game is very under rated and deserves more players. They Devs fixed most of the problems with Fall Guys when it was very popular"
16977,fun with friends
16978,"Really great game overall has a couple bugs here and there but they aren't important, personally for me it's not a game that i play everyday but  I play it once a while and it's pretty cool :D"
16979,"Bummer, you now need an epic account.i haven't played it since i was required to have an Epic account. Game is fun, but I refuse to be forced to make another account i purchased.

16990,good game
16991,nice
16992,Addicting and light hearted!
16993,this is where you can get crossovers with franchises that aren't relevant enough for fortnite
16994,all of a sudden you need a epic account to play. why?
16995,"Not that bad but it's not up to the hype
I think this game is popular for streamers because it doesn't require much focus and they can have room to chat"
16996,Its a very beautiful and very hard but its funny and season items are free to collect!! :)))
16997,Stressful.
16998,bean
16999,dicxki
17000,reject humanity become bean
17001,"The problem is not that you need an Epic account to play the game. The problem is that most of us bought the game when you don't need to make an Epic account, then out of nowhere, we are all locked out of the game if we do not create one. This should be a crime punishable by law and Epic should be ashamed of themselves."
17002,Awesome Game I recommand if anyone wants to play then go for it. As it's awesome guys
17003,"the problem i am facing is of the signature driver enforcment


"
17004,yes

17009,"i hat it 
"
17010,Fun game when it works.  I either have to repeatedly attempt to start it after it launches (failed to login) or re-validate the local files when the anti-cheat gets stuck.
17011,"Was fun, now requires an epic account no matter what.
Simply cannot recommend playing anything tied to Epic or EGS."
17012,I don't even own this game lol
17013,hi
17014,"TOO HARD
"
17015,Now requires epic account would not recommend!
17016,good game BUT OH GOD THE NEW SHOP SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN all the bad items you can get without money BUT NOW ANY GOOD STUFF IS LOCKED BEHIND A PAYWALL FUCK THE NEW SHOP SYSTEM
17017,great fun game when you need to destress.

17020,Pika
17021,"nice
"
17022,absolute garbage
17023,"Good game
"
17024,Another game bought by Epic forcing people that bought the game to create an epic account or else they can't play anymore.  I don't know how it isn't illegal...something hidden in the ToS maybe. Either way scummy behavior from a scummy company. Don't buy this game.
17025,Forces you to use an epic games account
17026,FUN.
17027,Bought this game a while ago and it was fun for a long time but now that it has Epic Only accounts i refuse to play this game.
17028,"This is a MMO, 3D platformer, party game in which 60 players compete in mini-games/elimination rounds against each other until 1 man (or 1 team) is left standing. All players are awarded with in-game currency based on their performances. The currency are then used to buy cosmetic items for one's character or name tag from the in-game store, which rotates its merchandise daily. The appearance & vibe of this game is very light-hearted & goofy, but yet the gameplay can become surprisingly frustrating as the little character you control moves as clumsily as a toddler. 

The game is a fun time killer, but I don't think it would hold a gamer's interest for long term, unless that person has a tendency to be a collector, aka: a loot hoarder. This multi-player game, unfortunately, does not support voice or text chat, which is a MAJOR LET-DOWN for any multi-player game. Without friends to group up with & a 3rd party app such as Discord to provide voice chat, your communications with the other 59 random players are limited to the in-game taunt animations, which people tend to ignore. 

If you have friends who already own this game, the purchase will definitely be worth it if you guys play regularly with a 3rd party voice chat app to cheer or heckle each other. Otherwise, the replayability of this game will be dependent on how much of a loot hoarder you are.

Serious Fall Guys, Y U NO have chat support?!?!?! 

UPDATE: Voice chat among group members have just been added. It still would be nice to have voice chat among team members, not just group members, and text chat among everyone else in the game."

Until they tried to force me to have an Epic account in order to play it. While I purchased it on steam.

17059,fun game
17060,Fun and relaxing. Simple rules and easy to start
17061,very fun to play especially with friends
17062,"Might just be a complete waste of money. Disconnects every time, so unless you're one of the lucky few who avoid that issue, you may be putting a lot of time troubleshooting rather than playing. And they seem more focused on introducing more stuff for you to buy in the store than fixing the bugs or making the experience better for existing customers. I would not recommend this or anything else made by them to anyone ever again."
17063,if i start this game i have EAlauncher i whait 2-4 minuts and they crush plz help
17064,"this game is awesdome
"
17065,Bought out by epic and now force their garbage upon you once you fire up the game
17066,"You have kids coming over to your house. They want to try out some game you have. This is it!

Someone not into gaming but wants to try one for short time fun. This is it!

You do not have time to play a long story driven RPG today and want something that ends in minutes while enjoying some multiplayer fun elements. This is it!"
17067,"its good id give it 3 stars 
"
17068,"it's cute, fun and simple!"
17069,"I also spent for this game and I have to connect to the Epic Games account. I do not have this game in the Epig Games store itself, but we have to create an account. I still can not play. I will remove Epic Games account in another month to see what I can do"

17083,"Immediately upon launch, and not optional or with consent, seamlessly installed Epic Games ""Online Services"". I had to remove that server through add/remove programs. Steam references needing an Epic Games account, which I have and have no problem linking. But installing their software without any warning or confirmation was very instrusive."

17086,"This game checks these boxes:

It's entirely multiplayer. 
It has great party functionality. 
It's rewarding to win and it isn't often frustrating to lose. 
Each match is short, so just jumping in for a game or two is totally okay.
It runs on a wide variety of devices."

It is unacceptable that i am not allowed to play a game, that i already bought and played, anymore.
Just to force EPIC games on players."

17176,"So what is my personal take on Fall Guys as of today? Let me just start by saying that I still absolutely love Fall Guys and the experience is still as enjoyable as it has been. Though there are some things I want to discuss based on how the game has become today.

Let me start with the positives
------------------------------------
* The new games in Season 1 FFA are absolutely amazing and extremely creative! Even the added aesthetic of a cheering audience in the background is such genius!
* I do like that there is an even bigger Battle Pass with now 100 Tiers to get. It really expands what all you can get during the season.
* While getting things like Fame & Kudos aren't really a thing for just playing games, I do like that the addition of more challenges rewards even more Fame, Kudos and Crown Ranks makes it so you do feel more rewarded.
* Fall Guys is now available on Xbox and Switch which is something that has been much anticipated for a while and I am definitely happy for those who can now experience Fall Guys for free as well!
* Since I originally bought the game on Steam, I do appreciate that I got a cool legacy pack with some pretty cool items along with the first Season Pass for free!

Now with the negatives
----------------------------
* I'll start by saying that most if not all of these won't really be attacking Fall Guys or Mediatonic as I'm more looking towards Epic Games with these negatives.
* I'm not really fond of the whole idea of (Show-bucks). Especially since you need to pay for them and use them to pay for Battle Passes. That is the downside of Fall Guys being FFA since there are even more micro-transactions.
* I don't really like that Battle Passes will no longer be free since I know the original idea of FG was for all Battle Passes to be free indefinitely. But of course that was before Epic started working on the game.
* The new store is not really the best also. Yeah there are still skins, colors, nicknames, and plates you can buy with Kudos. But the new skins just seem to be simple Head and Feet cosmetics. Want to get bigger skins? Got to pay with Show-bucks. That downright sucks since I used to enjoy being able to pay for skins with Kudos or even crowns!
* And why get rid of crowns as well? Sure I get that in some capacity they still sort of exist. But now it's just a crown rank. Crowns are no longer a currency in game. 


So that is my take on Fall Guys. Overall, the game is still a lot of fun and I do at least still enjoy the experience I get by playing all the unique games offered overall. It just definitely seems that Epic has become a little bit of an over-controller by making the game feel somewhat like Fortnite. Especially with the currencies and store items. I do not in anyway blame Mediatonic for those changes. I'm sure that the only reason why they wanted to work with Epic is so that players could get custom usernames again. Which is nice since it felt weird being known as ""Fall Guys 3927"" or something like that. And even having a more unique generated name like Super Bouncy Bean something like that felt better but not the same. But once Epic knew they could have even more power, they really reshaped the in game currencies and store into something they're more comfortable with. I'm sure Mediatonic was a little skeptical when seeing if they wanted this change but I suppose Epic went with it anyway. But I shouldn't allow in game currencies or stores to ruin my overall experience with the game. After all the main purpose of Fall Guys is to just play the games and earn rewards. Which is why I still recommend this game. It is still a fun game and I am definitely excited to see what the future of Fall Guys holds!"
17177,eeeeeeeeeeeeeh its good but you will get mad probably alot probably not would reccomend it though if you have 50 computers

17206,"Игра нереальный смех, если не знаете, что купить и во что поиграть, купите эту игру"
17207,this game is so good and worth it the updates are delayed thats it
17208,Fun Game even though it lacks popularity at the moment
17209, no
17210,not fun
17211,"Overall score 6 out of 10.
Its definitely great to pick this up with friends for a couple games. Recommend at least trying it for some laughs.

(Gripes) Game can be frustrating, 
A.) Too many people in the starting matches (and final match sometimes)
B.) Controls are incredibly unreliable (still), grabbing sometimes works and sometimes does not. People on console for some reason have an optimized connection and will occasionally run faster for no reason. (Confirmed by playing on console to verify)
C.) Too many team based games, the reason why people quit when this game first came out is because  games like fallball go on wayyyyy to long and playing a teamgame takes control out of the players hands.
D.) Games where you have to grab (anything) are absolutely the worst due to previously mentioned control inconsistency. Sometimes you grab and it processes, other times you grab something and it doesn't register. 
E.) Loading, just to get back to main menu when you finish a match literally takes over a minute. Why is this a feature? Just do a match recap in a popup window from the home screen or something? You're taking players out of the experience when they want to get back into your game. Weird design choice.

All that being said, this is a unique experience and hopefully they can improve the frustrating annoyances because there is alot going on for this game. Its in an incredibly niche spot despite being a battle royale.

Try it yourself and see what you think."
17212,This game is fun.
17213,good
17214,"not epic

also gets old very fast

should really be a free game considering everything about its monetization"

17217,levels are too hard . i never passed the fourth round. the button bashers level is the worst. everything  else is great

17224,the best game ever
17225,.
17226,The worst part of fall guys is that you need an account for it.
17227,the game is so fun that i might reconsider commiting oxygen reach lungs
17228,"Great game to play with friends! Lots of downtime in the early rounds, but really gets you excited in the final rounds! Still trying to get the first crown...:/"
17229,Very fun game to play. :)

17234,play it
17235,its very fun with friends
17236,This is a big poggers game :) im cracked at this and fortnite i have 69000 wins. Get on my level noobs
17237,The only battle royale game I had genuine fun with.
17238,"I don't understand the hate that this game is receiving, it is pretty funny actually...."
17239,YES
17240,"A multiplayer competitive party game of races, obstacle courses, and other minigames to crown one winner from a the 60 beans that enter. Very cute. Very fun. Really nice to see the Battle Royale model applied to something besides FPS games."
17241,Yes.
17242,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout may be adorable, silly, and simple to learn, but that doesn't mean it's a low-stakes game. Despite the party game vibe, it's still a battle royale. For most of the match I'm content to goof around, take reckless chances, and stop to celebrate with emotes before crossing the finish line. Getting ragdolled or shoved out of contention usually just makes me laugh. But as the end of the final round approaches I'm suddenly taking things seriously as hell. I may be a bean wearing a frilly pink tutu, but I want to win.

The concept of Fall Guys will be familiar to those that have seen game shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle. Guide your very own customized jelly bean avatar through up to five rounds of inflatable carnage and you’ll have a shot at taking home the crown. Each match is framed as an episode and lasts around 15 minutes at most, which further drives home that TV show feel. The controls are simple with running, jumping, diving, and grabbing as your only tools to navigate obstacle courses, avoid enemies, or cling on for dear life in more survival-centered events that threaten to plunge you into the slimy depths. If you do happen to get eliminated then you have the option to watch those remaining battle it out for the title while the musical equivalent of glycerin is poured into your ears."
17243,"fun game sadly it died in 2021, but that just means there's less sweats and less people playing which makes it easier!"
17244,gud
17245,"Everything epic games store touch will be broken, including this game. It is so hard to invite friend to play together now"
17246,"trash experience played first time no mouse arrow interface, epic games shit login system background processes 69 hours matchmaking gave me random username by just clicking on signup on epic games, no options to change profile name, epic games login do not provide login with google so i was not able to login with my original epic account, i didn't expected these types of casualties in development after so much years of this game came, what devs doing of all the money just refunded"
17247,bosenin
17248,"Bought by Epic, since then servers are unplayable. 6/10 games I lose connection to server. Forced to link to Epic games account. When this game was solo and just came out apart from crown win issues everything was top notch now its just a cesspool."
17249,bean game = good execpt for among us
17250,"This game is amazing its so fun, colorful, and the skins are fun to collect! The minigames are nice too. The only thing I don't particularly like is all the team games as they are sometimes unfair. The only team game I like is jinxed and tail tag. Overall I really love this game! I highly recommend it to others."
17251,"Can't play the game without making an Epic Games account.
If that isn't an issue for you, maybe you'll like it. The novelty of the game is relatively short lived, so unless for some reason it REALLY appeals to you, wait for a sale.

I'd say its more fun with friends, but so is watching paint dry, that's not really anything special about this game."
17252,Should have split screen

Saw this game first time in TimTheTatMan stream and he was raging so hard!!

17312,This game is really fun and challenging
17313,"Overall a fun game and highly recommend. Great to play with friends too!
"
17314,"Runs Flawless. Get into games within seconds. Need an Epic account to sign in, that's ok to me i'm not a little B****, besides Epic give free games weekly so it is no loss to have an account with them."
17315,"This game is amazing for having solo fun or group fun!. It engages with any kind of audience, even non gamers. I keep going back to it for some good fun time no matter how long I've played it."

17323,"Although as of 2022, you can clearly see lesser players playing and longer waiting time to start a round, its still crazy fun for me and I can play it solo anytime without getting bored. It's pretty much a race-to-win game and the ultimate win is the first person to get the crown in the last round (4th or 5th match for one game). It's crazy fun and I don't regret buying it! 

Though I do recommend you wait for sales then you buy it. I got mine at 50% off during the Summer Sale and zero regrets ever since. 

It's just chaotic fun HAHA"

10/10 if you wanna yeet ya dog."
17349,"Started playing early on and the game was infested with hackers. Came back later to find that the game was unplayably buggy, requiring an hour of bugfixing just to get it to start on a fresh install. Even when it is working, all your good runs can get sacrificed to three-team modes where the only viable strategy is just to gang up on the team that's losing or a physics bug clipping you through the floor. It could be good, but in its current state, full price isn't worth your money at all."

17530,"Dwarves were a short race, as their name implied, standing from 4'3""–4'9"" (1.3–1.45 meters) on average,with gold dwarves a bit shorter.[10] What dwarves lacked in height they made up for in bulk; they were, on average, about as heavy as humans. A dwarf could weigh anywhere from about 160–220 lbs (73–100 kg). Dwarven males were a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts. Like humans, dwarves had a wide variety of skin, eye, and hair colors, typically pale among shield dwarves and deeply tanned or brown amongst gold dwarves. Hazel eyes were common throughout the race, with blue eyes more common amongst shield dwarves and brown or green eyes found amongst the gold dwarves.

Male dwarves were often bald and grew thick facial hair, which was sometimes used to display social status. Unusually for humanoids, both sexes naturally grew ample facial hair, though the majority of shield dwarf females shaved their beards off. This hair was often dark in hue, though among shield dwarves blond or red hair was just as common. Gold dwarves took the care of facial hair to an extreme, carefully oiling and grooming it, with some adding perfume and ornamentations."

17556,"If you want a party game, this is it! The game improved so much, more maps, almost no bugs and just overall better."
17557,"With the new Free-for-All update, the game has become super stale.

Unlike most Battle Royales, every level plays the exact same, so it can get repetitive really quick. The appeal for me, and I would assume most people, was the ability to get every single cosmetic (except 6 bundle skins) for free, just by playing. The idea of cosmetics that were locked behind wins was a really cool idea, but now, you need to pay for every skin and the battle pass. I think most people would rather pay $20 for the game and every skin, instead of $20 for a single skin that used to be free. 

Would not recommend wasting your Hard Drive space..."

17617,Need to link an Epic account to play. Total bull****! Steam should be refunding anyone who wants one regardless of playtime.

17661,An absolutely ridiculous game that is sure to make you laugh
17662,bad
17663,"Fun game but lost my entire progress when I moved from PS to PC, still worth it and nice to play with friends, laughing guaranteed"
17664,its realy good
17665,"Considering that I played it for so long, I stopped having fun and just wanted to get the crowns (getting very upset whenever someone grabbed me). It just got way too repetitive with little to no variation. I more or less stopped playing in Season 3.

At the time, I would give it a light recommend and assert that I will probably never come back to this though. 

Now that it's F2P, I came back to try it out and the devs definitely upped their game since I last played. More unique minigames that have different mechanics to them. While I am very upset that my crown currency is now just normal kudos (just normal coins), there is the equivalent of V Bucks which I'm not happy about it but completely understand why it's there. While it's still more of the same, I think this is a nice casual (or tryhard if you want them crowns) time with friends. 7.0/10"

I have many years of gaming under my belt, and I'm not a child, yet I find many of these new levels suuper challenging. Definitely worth the money. The inclusive ""battlepass-esque"" feature is nice too. You pay once and get a whole game forever. The costumes and unlockables are very cute too."
17736,"Now that we bought the game since many months / years, they force us to use an epic game account even on steam and there is nothing we can ddo against it (not even ask for a refund). 

I wouldn't have bought this game if I knew I had to install this chinese spyware.

17819,"Very enjoyable game if you are looking for a 15min distraction. A large variety of Levels already exist with even more being added every season. In addition there is also special events that are somewhat ""sponsored"" like the Junglebook that provide you an additional carrot to play within a season.

The controlls using a Xbox Controller is easy to learn and are very responsive - good job in that!

While reaching max level in a season is fairly easy to unlock everything, this game has a very bad rotation system to purchase skins you might have missed. But thats the only major issue I do feel could be easly taken care off by the developers.

Ingame Shop does exist, but is not necessary or disturbing at all.

TL;DR: If you enjoyed the TV Show ""Takeshi's Castle"" - this is your game!"
17820,"Best Game, Play it! You Won't Regret It :)"
17821,"Disclaimer: I only played for a few hours, and fairly early into the games lifespan.

This game is a bit of a mixed bag, and your enjoyment will largely come down to what you want out of a game like this. The core concept of the game is solid, but the execution feels off somehow. The few games I played made me feel as though I should be having tons of fun, but it felt like playing a Mario Party mini-game without the rest of the game to back it up. After the first few matches it began to feel very repetitive. I can completely understand why some people might enjoy this, but to me it felt like a good concept that got the core skeleton working but stopped before it could add any meat to the bones. 

Perhaps I will return to this game in the future, if more depth is added to the overall experience, but for the time being it felt too small in scope to be worth the money."

I recommend getting wins with the squad stuff, which will be a lot easier, unless you play with randoms and get really unlucky. 

Some of the server side stuff didn't really do well with the change of ownership to epic games, but it's still manageable and runs pretty well most of the times. Fall Guys is and will be a great game for years to come, even if the hype of it died down since launch."

18005,"Fall Guys is addictively chaotic multiplayer mayhem.

There is no empathy in Fall Guys, no safety net for the less fortunate.  In the end only one can take the crown. The rest of us must be content to be drop-kicked to the back of the queue.

There are no mercy in this neoliberal dystopia. No hope for the downtrodden. 

In the end, in this universe, we're all Fall Guys."
18006,"Alright forget what I said a week ago or something, this game is GREAT! It allows you to take out your frustrations on other people without actually doing it to them themselves, but rather their bean avatars. And I love the challenge, it makes sure you have some form of skill and it is exquisite."
18007,"funny haha game. play it, we need more bean people.
"
18008,"To call this a game is a disservice to the bean like characters who throw themselves at obstacles like lemmings hurling themselves off a cliff. There are so many items I could spend the rest of my life playing and would never collect them all. This game is best enjoyed with friends who can share in your unadulterated rage when then bean physics betray you and deny your qualification EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE DEFINITELY ACCROSS THE LINE. Anyway, great game, pigeon suit for the win."

He bought the game on his own account, I have to verify his age (as he was honest with that), but I can only verify via credit-card, wich I don't own... so he can't play now. 

And all the anti-cheating stuff is painfull like hell... and then, after you did all right, you can't play due to missing validation. Stupid stuff going on!

I miss the good old times, where you bought a game and just put in the DVD to install and then to play it.

Epic Games, you should get this thing right! We won't buy any more games from this company..."

18163,"Having played this game at launch, I was entirely against coming back to this game. There were so many issues with the game when it debuted, like not having custom games, no 'crown shard' system, no dedicated squad/party modes, having a pretty irritating map pool and having servers that were as sturdy as a jenga tower on a shaky washing machine during an earthquake.

Having just gotten back into it through a friend and having completed this seasons battlepass, I can say that this is one of the best turnarounds I've ever seen from a game. Every issue I had at launch has been fixed, and I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game again with my friends. It's the perfect game for coming home and just booting up for a bunch of mayhem and chaos lol."

After I realised I do not hear anything I contacted the support and they told me the game is only playing sound through the ""default device"". So I waited and hoped it will be fixed one day. Today I started the game to play a round and to check if I have sound now.
Guess what I could not even start the game without linking it to an EPIC account. So I cant play the game anymore because I neither want to create a new EPIC account nor link it to any EPIC account..

I paid for a steam only game.. asked the support to quote the part of the contract that other services may be involved in the future. The support didnt quote anything and told me they cant help. So basically this game is a scam if you dont have an EPIC account nor agree to linking.."

18205,"Fall Guys is fun and family friendly.  The music is awesome and the art is colorful and cute.  Currently it is an online multiplayer only game so there is that to consider, but if you have a few friends you can play custom shows with just friends.  The game features a lot of short fun mini-games that have varying degrees of skill required to do well in them, that you play as a bunch of strange little jelly beans with arms and legs.

I'd say the game is easy to play but hard to master, with its minimal controls but learning curve of memorizing the layout and rules of the levels, and the skill checks on the harder rounds and finales.  For some users it could take several games to ever get a win (or even qualify the first few rounds) and for others it could happen in just a game or two.

Fall Guys currently features cross-play AND now also features cross-party, so you can squad up and play with your friends on any platform the game is on,  There are constant content updates and seasonal updates with unique shows, rounds, costumes and more to keep you playing in small bursts daily or weekly.

I would definitely recommend this game to people who like platformers, party games, and more casual multiplayer titles.  10/10 Love this silly Bean game."

18276,"My step brother got me this for my birthday one year. Now I had already known what it was about and had wanted to play it so bad. I think I joined in on Season 3? XD but definitely worth all the hype! Playing by yourself is fine, but when you're playing with friends and chatting over Discord, that's when it's really fun :)"
18277,"Good family fun, cute graphics, clever costume designs and ability to earn kudos and crowns simply by playing."
18278,Runnin' Jelly Beans
18279,"Fun game, not too involved, multiple options, good game to hop on and play if you have limited time."
18280,Mandated Epic Games account a year after I bought the game.
18281,Great for team play with friends
18282,funny little beans bouncing around; this game was made for asian american female twitch streamers with massive tits
18283,In order to play you now need to link your Steam account and Epic account. This is unacceptable from a privacy perspective.

18296,"Dev has been bought by EPIC Games and now forces you to have an account with them to play.

Bought on Steam, aleady played it 60+ hours on Steam and now i am suddenly not allowed to play it anymore unless i link an EPIC Games account.

It is unacceptable that i am not allowed to play a game, that i already bought and played, anymore. 
Just to force EPIC games on players."
18297,"this was probably my favourite game that came out in 2020 :)
it's just chaotic as hell i love it :D"
18298,"Fall Guys is simply a good time. Even if you lose, it's stil fun to play and incredibly addictive as well. You will spend hours upon hours aiming your way to win a crown and when you do, it will all be worth it. It is a very well constructed game that is sure to leave you wanting more."

18325,"This game is like your Nintendo Switch. You will pick it up for a week or two and be completely addicted, and then forget about it for another few months. Game had a ton of potential upon release, however, the developers took too long to update and it ended its short reign at the top of everyone's playlist. You will have some fun with this game regardless of what demographic you fit into."

18333,I really enjoy this game. Fun to play with friends online or with other people who play the game.
18334,Fall Guys is a good game... is what I would've said if the game wouldn't add all the new maps to the normal roster where newbies can stumble into them when they're tryna get a basic feel of the game.
18335,Still fun

18345,"Developer has zero motivation to improve this game. 

Same levels forever and ever and ever. Lack of actual vision when it comes to crafting a fun experience. 

Rotating modes that are given ZERO consideration other than, ""fuck it, dont change anything from normal mode, slap a ""duos"" or ""trios"" on it, and call it a day. Like don't waste our time if you can't do the basic amount of actual balance and development. ITS FRICKIN UNITY AND COLORED BLOCKS. You have a near infinite amount of inspiration for levels and modes and over a year later were still left with the same basic shit and a dwindling playerbase. 

There is literally nothing new or refreshing about booting up the game a year later despite having mountains of money from the sales of the game and epics purchase. A complete and udder waste of potential. 

This is a game that feels like not a single developer on the team cares about the game. Every single opportunity to include an attention to detail or quality of life features are missed because I guess there isn't a concern for retaining players. And in that case, enjoy your dead game."

- New Maps
- Improvements to old maps"

18411,"Just not that much to do. It's the same thing over and over-- you win a round here and there, then wait way too long to match into a new game, rinse, repeat. If there was a tournament mode where you kept going even if you lost, then scores were tallied at the end, this game would be excellent. Otherwise, it's only good for a few rounds at a time."

18500,"Very monotone+dull, some of the later levels are somewhat fun but generally you keep playing the same uninteresting levels, which seem almost AI-generated, over and over again. It's like they want you to encounter the same maps just so you play more waiting for a new one. Controls could be fun but often just feel unresponsive instead of chaotic/limiting. In general the game makes me feel like my soul is about to be sold as one of the products in the store section, alongside Ninja and Among Us. 
If you want a good party game just get Ultimate Chicken Horse, which is basically the opposite of this mess."

My nephew gets really sad when he tries to play, he says it's too hard. I am 47 years old and I find it very difficult too. If the grapple option were taken away, it would still be difficult, but playable. With the grapple option it's impossible to get satisfaction from playing.."

18525,"I pre-ordered Fall Guys, and had an incredibly fun time in S1 running around as one of my favourite characters, the infamous Gordon Freeman.  As I cycle through games in order to maintain my evergrowing backlog, after I completed the achievements I put Fall Guys to one side hoping to come back to it at a later date. 

Fast forward a year from the last time I played it, I am now greeted with the need to use an Epic Account, agree to their EULA and linking their client to my Steam client. This is a concrete ""No"" from me, and I am appalled to see these practices implemented. I can only echo what I've seen from many other reviews here - using an Epic Account should be optional, not mandatory. I am a private user that cares about my data and where it is used, stored or goes.

18547,"yes

18548,game=good
18549,This game enrages me with a passion i have never felt before. If i could meet the developer and he was in any situation small or big does not matter i would stand there as he asks for my help. i would let him ask and ask for help as i just ignore him and he would be in hopefully agonizing pain. i wish the worst for the developer of this game and hopes this game shuts down. it is so stupid the concept of this game and i am so mad i have ever played it as i have never won. remove that one stupid final game near the end where you have to race to the end but i can never make it. i have came so close to beating this game and could never do it I will sit here round after round but can never get my little jellybean to the end. i hate this game so much with a burning heart yet i can never stop. i have more than 24 hours on this game and i have understanding i may have a problem but this game makes me furious. if you want an actual rip off of this game i can win go to lolbeans on the web it is so laggy and broken down but i can win for once. thank you for your time.

18552,This game is one of the best games I have ever played it is lag-free and never has an end to the fun
18553,"boring to play alone i wouldn't play solo at all, since it can get very repetitive. if you have a couple of friends and don't know what else to play or you are tired of your usual games. give this a try"
18554,Forcing me to open and EPIC (Sh1t) Games account to play a game I paid good money for.... Devs like this should be banned from ever making games again. Real VILE business practice.
18555,was good when it first started
18556,"i love
"
18557,its really good survival game and racing game i just never could find out how too climb or hang on too people
18558,"I was today's years old when I found out I can't play this game anymore because I would need to link my Epic account to Steam...

A friend bought this game for me when it came out (on Steam) and I always tought it was a nice one for in between where I would just plug in my controller and play a few rounds while talking to friends... Welp, guess not anymore.

Not recommended if you don't wanna link your Epic account.


EDIT FOR NEWS: Fall Guys will become free to play on June 21st. You can get special cosmetics if you have the game and launch it before it goes free.

It will however also go fully Epic exclusive and will be delisted on Steam. Everybody who owns it here on steam will still be able to play it (with a linked Epic account) but it won't be possible to buy the game on Steam after this.

18559,Fall guys is the best game ever!!!!
18560,"bro i dont even own this game
"
18561,"Fall Guys gets the same treatment as Rocket League by being taken off Steam and put as an Epic Games Store exclusive and adding V-bucks (sorry I meant show bucks) to the game

Rest In Peace"

18563,it wont let me sign in because lost files. idk how to fix it
18564,It's fun and easy to get into. There's a high replay ability and the option to either play with friends or by yourself. Would recommend.
18565,very cool
18566,Now requires an epic games launcher. Don't buy this game on Steam.

18583,"Add Bots to this game, 1 hour of back to back matchmaking loading, but cant find a match in any modes."
18584,"Yeah , the game's great (only initially). Quite gives the Takeshi's Castle vibes , and rightly so. The game was fun to play when started it , but it becomes quite boring afterwards. Would request the devs to keep adding more and more levels to it."
18585,"Yeah this game was good until they let epic take over, shit doesn't work. Fuck off."

Is definitely holding me over extremely well until the Switch version comes out. Don't mind the Epic Games account thing as I never use said account for anything else besides this and Rocket League. The gameplay is awesome, the button binding allows me to perfect my movement, the stages are unique and there's plenty so things will never go stale, there's just so much inside this game that listing out everything I love about it would take a while. If you have the money and the computer to run it, definitely buy it! You will not regret it!"

18663,"I used to have a great time playing this game with friends, but making it mandatory to install the Epic Games Launcher in order to play is an absolute dealbreaker for me. This policy sucks and shouldn't be supported - it's a real pitty as the game itself is fairly fun."

18666,Thanks Epic Games ruined everything.

There's nothing in the program and features section on control panel"

18803,"I wanted to return for a quick round just to learn, that I now not only need an Epic account, but also am required to link my Steam account to an Epic account. I'm trying for a late refund."
18804,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a multiplayer party game where you compete against 59 other people and try to beat sets of minigames only to be thrown into a finale and win it all. 

You can jump, dive or grab other people to mess with them or ensure your survival.

Minigames range from races, team games, survival rounds, scoring points to qualify.

The game works in seasons, each season the game gets a new theme, new maps and costumes/cosmetics. As you play you earn money that can be spend on cosmetics or emotes in the shop and you also earn experience which fills up your season pass which rewards you with something each level all the way to 50.

Months after release, the game recieved Squads ( que up with 3/2 or just one other friend and compete against teams of others), events where you have to complete tasks to get sets of points for special cosmetics ( like Ratcher and Clank costumes ) and special game modes that where you play the same map over and over until you reach the finale and try to win.

The big issue I personally have with the game is the content loop and while I understand that demanding updates frequently is not realistic, the way this game does it just isnt for me anymore. The experience for me was like this:

1. New season comes out. Play it as much as possible because its gone in 14 days. ( new levels always have a timer and then they get added into all the gamemodes, they are not gone forever but you cant specifically que them just like you would at the start of a season, why is that the case I dont know, it doesnt make sense at all since seasons last months )

2. Get burned out because you played too much. ( might aswell no life first few days if the new season only game mode is leaving soon )

3. Take a break because you are not having fun.

4. Come back near the end of a season, grind again to finish the season pass for cosmetics, quit again because the grind makes you dislike the game.

5. Repeat step 1

During season 4 I told myself that I dont really like this loop im kinda stuck in but I figured since it has been a bit early to judge the game Ill just keep playing and hopefully the game gets better in the future.

I wish I knew why are the developers alergic to reworking past minigames to make them more random instead of ""if I always go like this I never get hit"" bs. Its a bad way to describe it so lets just say if your strategy works once it will always work but it really shouldnt.

I also dont get why the season pass is only up to level 50. Once you reach it, there is nothing else to get, no extra levels that reward other ingame currencies, nothing. 

And finally the shop size stays the same despite adding tons and tons of new cosmetics every season, lets keep the shop nice and small to force players to check every day just incase there is something they want. Its stupid, the size should have been increased months ago.

And here we are over a year later and the game still does the same things over and over again and I cant lie to myself anymore and pretend that things will get better in the future. They cleary wont and its a damn shame."

18806,"Vry nice game

18807,"Very enjoyable, fun colors, and the best part!, you earn your in game currency! So you don't need to spend money just time."
18808,"This game is basically Takeshi's Castle: The Videogame. If you don't know what Takeshi's Castle is, look it up."
18809,"Bait and switch.

I started playing this game with friends last year when we wanted to mix something more casual into our routine, and it was fairly enjoyable.  Recently however the developer sabotaged the game by requiring an Epic Games account to play.  I buy game on Steam partly because I want nothing to do with Epic and their anti-consumer business practices.  This falls right in line with that kind of behavior."

18815,"The recent update to make it free to play is a big **** you to anyone who purchased it. yes its a publisher move over the developer move. As a bonus for spending money on this game you get more useless currency as they ruined the store with more pay real money options, and the ingame currency is garbage. 

The more you play this game the more boring it gets. 
I feel like I am playing a lesser mario game without the turtle shell or banana peel. The game needs more then just a grab. 

Also invest in an auto leave feature. I am here to play the game not watch somebody else play it.  There are times where its over.,..but some stupid animation has to play before I can leave and get credit. I always report the winner. since I am trying to leave the game but reporting the winner is the only option this game gives. stupid setup."

Not now.

18832,Super fun and lighthearted!
18833,fucking hate this shit game.
18834,Bean-tastic mini games and obstacle courses! Love this game.
18835,"I've been playing Fall Guys on the PC for a couple months now and I find that it runs better than on my PS4. It's been really enjoyable to play and it a way it's relaxing. I'm still hoping for cross-play at some point. Where I can play with my couple of friends on any platform. Other than that, I've been enjoying myself. There are some levels that make me extra frustrated but once I'm passed those it isn't so bad. I also really love the customization."

18840,"As another user has said 'Daonoijin':
Due to recent policy changes which involve the incorporation of linking an Epic account, It pains me to no longer be able to recommend this game anymore.

When I bought the game, an account for Epic was not needed. The recent changes mean I can now no longer play Fall Guys and I will not accept an Epic account being linked to my Steam account.

I refuse to link my Steam account with Epic due to it being nothing more than a privacy invasion and a massive data-grab of Steam users.

When I purchase a game I do so taking the risk whether it is bad or not, that I accept, but to bring in account linking and passing information to another separate service AFTER my purchase, thereby changing my aggreement, that's just plain wrong.

---------------------------
When will steam step up and not allow this?"
18841,"Fall guys is a wonderful game for hanging out and messing around with your friends! Although it can get tricky, I will always enjoy playing :]

P.s. Devs, if your reading this, can I please have the blue and yellow non-public fries skin? I would really appreciate it!"
18842,"It was such a waste buying this, since it's only fun for a few hours. 

UPDATE: Now it's free and actually has some variety in it's game modes. Definetly fun playing it with Friends but only for a little while. REMOVE TEAM MODES STILL... I DON'T KNOW WHO THOUGHT THESE ARE FUN"

18867,This game is so fun!
18868,"Bought the game for my brother after steam share wasn't allowing him to play. When he opened his game, he had negative 3k kudos, which according to support was because I had DLC, DLC he never accessed because the game never worked for him under share nor did he have access to once he owned the game himself. They never did anything to remedy the situation. Regret spending the extra money on this game."

18875,Such a fun game to play with our without friends but definitely more fun with friends!!!
18876,Game forces an epic account to play it.
18877,very nice
18878,The requirement if an epic account has left me unable to play the game and I miss the beans.
18879,"Epic Games have now required an Epic Games account for playing this game. I can't play it any longer because I have no intention of supporting scummy business practices which Epic is fond of, as well as platform exclusivity being a very consumer unfriendly thing.

I had so much fun with this game, ever since it blew up and subsequently died on Twitch before making a great resurgence. Gonna be sad to see it go down the same path as Rocket League.

Ill miss you, Fall Guys."
18880,"Gotta be honest, I had a ton of fun playing this game during lockdown this year. I'd play it between online classes with my friends and we'd have a blast. 

Now I no longer recommend it and I will unfortunately be uninstalling the game because the game is unplayable without an Epic Games account.

If you don't mind your Steam account being linked to an Epic Games account and allowing Epic Games to get their hands on all your personal data, go for it(!) It's a really fun game with some friends. But I will not touch this game because I do not want to be forced to create an Epic Games account and link it to Steam.

This game is most likely going to get Rocket-Leagued and end up on the Epic Games store as a free exclusive (it already has a ton of in-game monetisation) so honestly if you're interested in the game just wait for a decent sale or wait for it to be free.

I'm really disappointed, this sucks"

18895,"Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds may have popularised the last player standing format, but Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout has truly unlocked its potential by painting it hot pink and putting it in a hot dog costume. Mediatonic’s family-friendly formula is a colourful, bouncy breath of fresh air that takes a different, less explosive approach to battle royales without losing any of the tension. Instead of C4, it’s Vitamin C you’ll be steering clear of as you’re bombarded with monstrously overgrown oranges in just one of its two dozen game show-like events. The vast majority of these minigames hit the mark, offering fun and frustration in equal amounts. Couple them with a vibrant aesthetic and a brain-tunneling soundtrack and Fall Guys manages to make you want to punch the air when you’re winning and scream at your screen when you’re losing, but you’ll be laughing either way.
The concept of Fall Guys will be familiar to those that have seen game shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle. Guide your very own customized jelly bean avatar through up to five rounds of inflatable carnage and you’ll have a shot at taking home the crown. Each match is framed as an episode and lasts around 15 minutes at most, which further drives home that TV show feel. The controls are simple with running, jumping, diving, and grabbing as your only tools to navigate obstacle courses, avoid enemies, or cling on for dear life in more survival-centered events that threaten to plunge you into the slimy depths. If you do happen to get eliminated then you have the option to watch those remaining battle it out for the title while the musical equivalent of glycerin is poured into your ears.

A game show is only as good as its games though, and this is where Fall Guys’ current pool of 24 largely triumphs. The obstacle course-style races are where I’ve found the most enjoyment, especially as it gets down to the wire as beans bounce off one another and desperately lunge for the finish line trying to make the cut.

I’ve been particularly enjoying the havoc of Hit Parade and the precarious spinning platforms of The Whirlygig, which often descend into chaos as twenty too many characters try to fit through a small gaps or all jump for the same narrow platform. There’s always more than one path to take, some offering a high risk-reward option, which is welcome as it never feels like you’re completely out of a race despite being near the back of the pack. In Door Dash you hurtle towards the bottom of a track attempting to dive through doors, some of which will blast open, whereas others will stay firmly shut. There’s a simple pleasure found in walking through an opening as the opponent next to you slams face first into a brick wall."

18899,"Great game to relax to. BEST with a group but I have yet to in 150 hours. Still enjoy streaming and playing to wind down.

After all, watching other falls soothes even the savage beast.

I got this game through steam, and this was not a requirement at any point in the past. I have no desire to sign up for an account with those clowns, so I guess this is the end of playing this game for me. Unfortunately it's too late for me to refund it, but hopefully the info is useful to whoever reads this review later on."

退坑原因大概主要是因为年纪大了血压承受不住哈哈，老倒霉体质加上我的老年笔记本本也逐渐承受不住越来越大的游戏体量，空闲时间玩几把要么莫名被闸要么卡顿掉线要么团队笨笨队友，要么自己手滑失足，血压飙升哈哈。很遗憾像我这种又菜又爱浪的玩家已经不适合它现在的游戏环境了。
不过如果有小伙伴一起玩，糖豆人现在的可玩性还是很高的。游戏内容和技巧越来越多，模式逐渐丰富，一些经典地图也百玩不腻。
虽然糖豆人在玩家角度看来确实存在过一些很离谱的运营问题，但不得不说这是一个现象级的好游戏。希望它能有更长久的生命力。退坑留爪，再见，祝好！"

19012,"Learned about their account platform change: you are now required to have an Epic Games account.

This is a game on Steam. That used to not require this before.

I'm sick of Epic Games striking deals with game developers that also impact their contract with Steam or otherwise impact the behaviour of their game on Steam. What sick company tries to get developers on their platform if they worsen their products on other platforms? And what companies would accept such an offer?

Cannot recommend anyone to be treated like that. Thus, I cannot recommend this game to anyone."

19060,"This game is adorably fun. 

It's a battle royale game that still has a solid tree of unlockables and entertainment. The rounds are challenging, unique and random so you never know what you'll get in each show. 

I play more on my ps5 these days but there is still some issues with hackers that need to be addressed. Other than that the game is a lot of fun with friends, I wish you could party up with more than just a few people but still provides a lot of fun regardless. 

Some of the cosmetics are a bit too pricy, it's good that you can unlock some of the items through just playing the game, such as the 2B outfit or some of the older exclusives. I don't play this game nearly enough to sink money into it but can definitely see why people do for the cosmetic upgrades!

All in all a fun game to play every once and a while with a few friends."

19095,"REMOVE LOST TEMPLE!
This is a perfectly fine game. EXCEPT FOR LOST TEMPLE. It is so upsetting when you make it to the final and you get a game of Lost Temple. You might as well just exit the game when Lost Temple is the final. Lost Temple represents a mini-game that requires zero skill and 100% luck. If I wanted to gamble I would buy a lottery ticket, not boot up this game and hope to get Lost Temple. 
REMOVE LOST TEMPLE!"
19096,noice but bad

19207,"Game is good, requiring the use of an epic games account has stopped me from playing it any more. I bought and use a PC in order to make gaming an easy all in one experience, beginning epic games into the picture with the shady stuff they do does not feel right to me."
19208,"I actually loved this game and have had it since release. Unfortunately the Fall Guys team felt it was necessary to permanently ban my account for ""software that affects the game...""

This was just a wrong and false accusation on their part. I have never once cheated nor did i plan to. If I were cheating, I think i'd have WAY more crowns under my belt lol.

I wasn't too mad at first, as I thought the support team would unban my account once realizing the mistake. It has been over a week and I have put 3 support requests in, tried reaching out on the Fall Guys discord, and even went to FallGuys social media pages. I have gotten ZERO help and no replies from FallGuys support, even though they state replies should happen within 72 hours.

Although I love the game, it's hard to recommend a game to others when there's a chance they'll ban you and pocket the money you spent on it. I have found others online with the same problem as me, but hopefully it's not too common."

19217,"Ranked up to Gold Knight recently... 2269 hours to get there 

Game is made by people that code poorly, don't understand mathematics properly, don't understand fair or proper game design properly, wasted the potential of the concept, use FOMO tactics, have bad servers, sold out to R I O T, and most painfully, DO NOT LISTEN, CARE ABOUT OR RESPECT COMMUNITY  FEEDBACK. 

I played a lot because i'm addicted to the concept, the execution however... is garbage tier"

19231,great game
19232,"cute fun time killer,many free items over time,good for an hour or two a day,very good soundtrack,overall great game.

only negative would be that the price is slightly too high for base game for someone who just wants to try it out,but if you grow to like or love the game,its definitelly worth it.oh yeah,n also tryhards every couple maps that grab you n push you off the map.happens once every couple hours maybe.gets my day ruined a bit.

call me a casual i guess.

else,planning to play it for hundreds of hours hopefully ! good luck to fall guys n their developers n i wish all players to have fun ! especially that first victory more than anything !

good luck to yall !"

I bought the game recently and I was never asked to use their luncher. 

It's a fun goofy game. Controls are not the most convenient but I can roll with it just find.

it reminds me of club penguin sled races."
19248,bread
19249,"Requiring Epic services to be installed to play now is bs, taking away the ability to play by adding required third party software and accounts from a game I could play for over 100 hours before.

You have to link your steam account to your epic games account."

The only saving grace of this game is when running smoothly it can be enjoyable, but these experiences are rare, and hard to come by.

Edit: They're removing it from Steam and making it an EGS exlusive lol"

19363,"I used to play the game with a few friends yknow have fun joke around yadda yadda. It makes me very furious and sad that the games optimisation is absolute fckn dogshit. Its sad to say because the game was mostly fine ( a few errors here and there usually due to poor internet) but at the state its in it is literally unplayable. the game would not open, when it openned it had file errors somehow (it said missing files which is impossible ı literally downloaded the full 9 GB's) so ı closed and openned again. Yknow hope its a one time thing. Guess what? It wasnt. This time it wasnt the missing files thing but instead it now got stuck on a loading screen for at least 10 minutes. And no ı dont have bad internet so thats not it. I really want to give a good review but the way the game is rn ı cant bring myself to saying a good thing about it. Do ı recommend it? If you have the money, to get this game, do yourself a good thing, and don get it there are much better games (that dont have awful optimisation)."

19370,"They patched the game.
Requires 3rd-Party Account: Epic Games Account.
You are locked out of the game if you don't make one.

This change was made after people bought the game. When I bought the game, there was no such requirement.
I don't agree with this practice. Suddenly demanding new accounts or software to play a game you already bought. 
That's a no from me."
19371,"well this game is a great game for sure. sometime i rage but i recommend this game. you'll not play it each day but a good casual game for when youre bored

19475,"If you want to get into this game, I recommend looking into some of these features within the game before making your judgement. This post will be a cumulative list of the worst of Fall Guys, and will go on for a while, so be warned.

Going into this list, I want you to keep two key facts in mind. Number one, take into consideration this quote, in its absolution, no edits, no paraphrasing, from the March 2nd, 2021 official Mediatonic release about their acquisition by Epic Games:

[quote=Mediatonic]""Joining forces with Epic will accelerate our plans to improve the game and bring Fall Guys to as many players as possible, while continuing to support the community.""[/quote]

Second, consider the fact that most, if not all, of the clips I will be sharing were delivered [b]on level release[/b]. Some of these features date back to the game's early months. I want you to consider this: an error in the game that lasts a couple of weeks is a bug, a hitch in the experience. If that issue persists into month durations, that's no longer a bug. That's the experience the developers want you to be having while playing this game.

These are the types of experiences that the developers have left unchecked for several months, and thus, want you to be experiencing by buying this game.

(Big thanks to YT channel Top Fall Guys Highlights for compiling these. All of the clips below are within the game as of Season 6 and to this day can still be replicated. Some of these have been [strike]bugs[/strike] features in the game for more than a year+)

[h1] List of Features to Expect in Your Gameplay [/h1]

There are clear takeaways I'm obviously noting from the quote from before. Improving the game, and supporting the community. Allowing players to experience the true, undeterred Fall Guys experience that Mediatonic wants you to experience when you play the game. 

I ask you, though. Surely if these were to be considered bugs and glitches, then Mediatonic would absolutely take time to remedy these issues, and if these were issues to begin with, then keeping them within the game for several months and counting means that the community is [i]wrong[/i], and these are indeed the improvements promised to us with the newly acquired resources necessary to bring the game to its best potential.

All of the links I provided aren't just occasional [strike]bugs[/strike] features that have blipped in and out throughout Fall Guys' lifespan. These have and have always appeared consistently and throughout the game's whole entire lifespan, and have never once been taken out of the game. At best, these can be considered controversial additions to gameplay, and at worst, these are haphazard displays of lack of support and a disconnect from the community to sustain the game properly. 

I absolutely adore this game, and have grudged through its tenure in my library balancing the good and the bad. I've been through its original fad status, the lack of updates and disappointing Season 2, the savior of Squads mode reincarnating the game, the custom playlist cycles, and have been a day 1 player in each and every new season. After hundreds of hours, I can definitely mark my feelings down in this review. This is a good game with a horrible company, not malicious or evil, but absurdly lazy to the point that the most dedicated players aren't here just cause they're good - it's that these above experiences are so integrated into daily gameplay that at this point we just don't care anymore."
19476,Forcing to log into Epic Games account after the latest update even tho I have owned and played this game through Steam for well over a year.
19477,"as great, then epic fucked it up, now removing it"
19478,Jelly bean battle royale... enough said.
19479,"My negative review is unrelated to the epic games thingy, it's mildly annoying and I wish it was optionnal, but ultimatly I don't care and Fall Guy isn't the first or last game to require third party authentification, at least it's not a single player game.
No, my problem with fall gay is the lackluster level design and annoying character physic. 
Level Design  : 1) Some levels are purely random, 2) some are just not well suited to large crowd of playable character that can bump into each other, 3) some are team based chalenge but the game is supposed to mostly be free for all, meaning these put you are the mercy of your unchosen teamates skills, 4) finaly, couple of levels require way too finicky and precise mouvement considering the physic engine.
No need to elaborate about the annoying character physic, it's pretty much self explanatory. And I couldn't find a way too easily pratice level, and it's just unimmaginable for me to have a racing or scroring base game that one can't practice in solo before or in between multyplayer sessions.
Now, Fall Guy isn't too bad  of a game, it can be fun but you either have to take it lightly that  goofing around with friends is your only goal or competively and accept to getting used to the weird physic."

Don't recommend. Bad underhanded and not to mention a pathetic attempt to increase Epic Games user numbers by allowing someone to open and load the game from Steam and THEN demand that you make an account for Epic Games knowing for well that the player can't get a refund on the game beforehand. Shame on you Epic Games and Steam. You should feel disgusted at yourselves."

Also, there should be an option to choose which levels you want to play, either an option where all players can vote for a level, or an option to select from a specific type of level you want to play e.g. classic, jungle theme, space theme etc."

19541,"Although this game is very enjoyable, and I would have happily recommended it in the past,  I cannot recommend this game in its current state, now that an Epic Games account is now required to play.  I don't know if this is something that can be reversed, but it will have to be reversed if I'm going to continue playing Fall Guys :("

19552,"I've played over 400 hours as well on the Playstation and picked this up on a sale now that cross progression is supported. It is a great party game to play with your friends in a group. There are squad modes almost all of the time so that you can play and win as a team. This game does have its fair share of bugs and there are many griefers out there, but this doesn't detract from my overall enjoyment playing the game. 

Cross progression does work and pretty flawlessly. Some don't like needing to log into Epic now, but honestly what non-indie game do you not need to these days?"

19580,Fun game easy to pick up with simple controls. That being said learning the mechanics and different strats and perfecting them is rewarding especially with the crown ranks. I will say that epic game errors are a bit of an issue and that true cross play party's need to be added but its a fun game overall.

I got this game for the only main reason to play with others, but ended up playing it by myself. I actually thought it would be very easy but actually is harder than you think. I do not get tilted easily but this game gets me going, maybe because I do not know how to play good. When it comes to how long the gameplay is, it does really depend on you but also others, the overall matches aren't very long. You would definitely could squeeze in one game before work or school. Not that I encourage people to try to and risk getting late. But you could. Otherwise, hard to admit, but through my tilt, I did enjoy it and It is worth the price too! Even though I probably would have waited for the sale if I didn't have anyone who wanted to play it with me. 

I hope you found this review somewhat helpful or enjoyable! Please also leave a rating and give me your feedback and ideas in the comments. I would love to read your thoughts, ideas or/and your own experiences of playing this game!

19672,"Are you bored? Need something mindless but fun to preoccupy your time? This is it, a simple premise, fair controls, a touch of skill, and the opportunity for some mario kart style cheese (except instead of blue shells you'll get tilted by weirdos trying to grab you).

The game is entertaining (esp when co-op w/ family & friends), queue times are minimal, plenty of unique maps and game modes, adding new ones each season, and overall a solid game.

Only downside is the Epic anti-cheat solution, sometimes has a false alarm with other software if opened between/during games."

To those parents wondering about downloading the game, as mentioned above, it is perfectly fine for all ages. In-game currency is mainly earned by experience, so it is not a pay-to-win game. I would give this game a 10/10."

19720,"Ridiculous that the game suddenly needs an Epic account.

I was about to let that slide and still continue playing, as I do have an Epic account (that I don't really use though), but I can't log in to the game with it.
The issue is that I originally used my Google account to log in to Epic games instead of making an Epic account. It still is used as my Epic account. However if I try to log in to Fall Guys using Epic account, I can't. It keeps saying that I don't have an Epic account and using Google to sign in to your Epic account in Fall Guys is not an option.

So basically my issue is that this has been made too complicated and ridiculous. I'm done with the game."

19752,"its just class
"
19753,"This game was and continues to be an extremely innovative and refreshing battle royale. I may have jumped on the train late due to not having a platform to run it for a while, but it's still a boatload of fun. The battle royale genre is oversaturated with shooters, and while they aren't inherently a bad thing, they start to get old. Fall Guys takes the genre into a completely new direction, rather than bandwagoning, and it does it very well. You compete in a variety of minigames, trying to qualify for the next round until the last. On top of the diversity of the minigames, there's also smaller variations to spice things up. And the best part is, you can actually interact with players, grabbing, shoving, bumping, affecting the environment for other players, and such are all possible, which adds on to the replay value because it doesn't just feel like a chaos mode single player game like Nintendo's battle royales, which also tried to break trends but did it poorly imo. On top of this core gameplay, there's also other modes like squads & events to further spice up gameplay, and new cosmetics and new minigames from time to time to flesh out the content. Devs also seem pretty great too.

Tl;dr Tired of shooter battle royales, or less effective non-shooter ones? Give this game a try, it's very fun, creative, and well made!"

19775,"Game was fun until Season 6 when they forced you to install Epic Games launcher on your computer to play; sign up for an Epic account to play. Epic literally bought this game so they could force their much crappier platform and shady business tactics down our throats.

There is zero positive reason for the consumer to have to install anything related to Epic on their computer to play a game through Steam. This is a blatant push for market share through the scummiest of tactics. And sadly it'll probably work."

My internet connection is good and I don't have internet problem with any other game.

Deserves a down rate because I payed money for it and I can't play."

19818,"Mediatonic явно перестали понимать потребности игроков, нужен античит? Возьмом от EpicGey, усложним жизнь читерам и игрокам, ведь вылетать у вас будет часто, очень часто, а за вылеты наград не будет и прогресии в Battle pass тоже, а зачем? Ведь хорошо играть в игру но лучше в не' вообще не играть, ведь в тот момент когда ти захочешь вернуть игру будет слишком поздно"

19821,From where are the positiv reviews coming?
19822,"this so funny
"
19823,"I really enjoyed this game, but just recently found out it requires an epic account. Due to my own personal reasons,  I am anti Epic Games and extremely disappointed I will never be able to play this game again. Epic games has stolen my money multiple times, and their customer support is awful. I had to go to my bank and request fraud against them just to get my money back from my account being hacked. I use to receive 100 emails everyday about my account being hacked, and then eventually was charged $400. It took over a month before Epic did anything and all they did is ask me to reverse the fraud charge. If this game was purchased on steam, it should not require an epic account. Shame on the devs, or whoever was in charge for this change. This game use to be 10/10, and now its 0/10"
19824,it's ok
19825,Why do I have to make an epic account to play this?

19884,"game yang asik buat dimaenin bareng-bareng, kocak dan nagih untuk permainan selama 1-2 jam. lebih dari itu keseruannya mulai ilang dan ngebosenin. Untuk yang baru main di season terbaru mungkin bisa betah main 3-5 jam karena udah banyak stage baru, tapi untuk veteran mungkin akan ngerasa mulai jenuh dan ngebosenin karena udah hafal dengan stagenya."

19898,"So..... Let's just start with I'm a console player and have been since I can remember (OG NES days) I recently bought a Gaming rig as I wanted to edit videos and play games that were available only on PC... I saw there was a sale on this and said hey why not start with this seems interesting. And let me tell ya... this game is a LOT of fun... The bright colors and craziness of it all makes this ADHD brain happy.

The music is energetic and chaotic in a very well blended way.
The levels are not dull with the mechanics implemented.
The customization is pretty cool and some of the get ups you can combine are pretty cool.
Definitely a game that will humble you in the sense that you cant ALWAYS be a God (Kinda like FPS BR's)

I don't have many friends on steam but I have enjoyed playing this solo dolo and can only imagine how much more fun it could be partied up!!!
"
19899,W
19900,This is one of the few games that have genuinely brought me true joy and i hope for everyone to get the game joy out of it.
19901,its a really fun game i highly recommend it.
19902,"The graphics are amazing. When you get in game that is when you appreciate how well ""great graphics"" and ""childish graphics"" have been mixed together. The gameplay is as if you are a child again and you are watch ""Takeshi's Castle"" while giving it some childish imagination. The audio is satisfying and the music keeps you in a good mood. There is a misunderstanding that this game is reserved for kids but any age group can enjoy this. If you think it is bad because it is dead, you will be wrong. Those mistakes have been corrected and the game is slowly coming back to life. Don't play this game if you have a tablet pc that microsoft sells. I am telling you this because back then that was my only windows computer. But if you have a laptop you are fine. You shouldn't use a trackpad for this though. Keyboard and mouse is fine but I like to use a controller. It is easy to learn but hard to master since players have gotten insanely good. It is not necessary to grind unless you want skins. As of now the story is not within the game it is in the trailers. But there is a rumor that this year in april there will be an event like fortnite and there are files to prove it. The game time is an odd question I get asked and it is online so the time can go to infinity and beyond! There definetly are bugs but they are bugs to have fun with and not glithy and frustrating. You should buy if it is on sale, but if you are a normal gamer and not like me then it is worth the prize. I am a casual so I got it when steam told me there were 2 different sales on it so I said why not? Overall 9/10."
19903,Bawasir
19904,"Cool

19905,Very good Fun game to play in your Leisure
19906,"Very unstable server....Our team almost won a crown, however, everyone in the game were disconnect from server."
19907,It is a lot of fun still quite addictive great game to play with frieds eigther by teaming up or hot chairing
19908,"I just can't explain how much I'm disappointed.
For playing this game you also MUST have an Epic Games account! How stupid it is! I bought it on Steam, so, I don't wanna create accounts somewhere else [until it's an official game/developers web-site]!
Sadly I played this game for the first time only in a year after buying, or I'd immediately refund it! This game isn't worthy of joining EG!"

19928,55555
19929,"Despite its faults, I occasionally enjoyed this game until they required an Epic login. I have an Epic login and my Epic login works on the Epic website and Epic launcher, but not in this game. No joke, the game is literally unplayable now."
19930,"This is a great video game and one of the few multiplayer only experiences I have ever enjoyed. But the forced Epic Games Account connection is terrible. I don't even mind Epic Games Store as a thing but because of how broken it is, it took me an hour just to be able to play the game (what do you mean that's not my password, why did you have me fill out a captcha if it was wrong?) After I finished finally connecting my account, I was so tired and frustrated that I didn't want to play the game, and still do not want to play it.

To the developers and team behind this game, I'm sorry, you made something wonderful, but if Epic wants to make it this hard to play a game, then I will not be playing that game."
19931,"Epic Games Service, bruh, NO.

0.0/10.0."
19932,An epic games account is required which is a huge bummer.
19933,its an epic game fustrating tho

10/10"
19938,"DO NOT BUY . Mind you its a great game if it works. but it will frustrate you consistently considering the game has a lot of serious issues. I've had to reinstall this game like 5 times in the past month and i've had to update my computer  among a number of other things . and this time I've had enough.... I've checked the files integrity. I've updated my computer and graphics drivers, I've restarted steam, I've restarted my computer. No matter what I do this time the game just won't start. I really wish I could get my money back on this. what an absolute waste. im beyond frustrated"
19939,b
19940,good but a little frustrating
19941,"alright, one of my more serious reviews.

this game has a lot of potential and i wish it would live up to that potential. the only problem in this game is the poor anticheat which at this point doesn't work. problem is that basically no one plays this anymore and people wouldn't really care. although the few players left there are still encountering hackers. do not recommend due to this fact. it will take a while to find a match nowadays (or if thats just me) please try not to give in"
19942,suprisingly difficult
19943,gud game
19944,My friend is severly addicted

19957,Complex game only for 150+IQ
19958,"Requires an Epic Games account, which is a change that has been introduced long after I've bought the game. This should not be an acceptable change on Steam. I hope that Valve will address this issue, as I'd hate it if it would happen to other games in the future."

20030,This game was honestly pure ass and a waste of money.
20031,meh
20032,"Played 37.6 hours, it's fun with friends, nice soundtrack and gameplay but it's kinda repetitive but practice makes perfect so it's not a bad thing so you can train more on the difficult rounds and understand their pattern, after finishing the pass it might get boring as it's not easy to get kudos and crowns any more which might let you miss some of the cool stuff in the shop, Epic account linking is not that bad as many popular steam games require making external accounts. 8/10"

But with the recent need to link an Epic account to even play?? No thank you.

I see no point in this development other than to invade my data privacy and I wish I could refund the game.

20054,"Well, this is the end for me. 369+ hours flushed in the toilet. All the grind and fun and frustration I had with this game.. it's done. I won't stop boycotting Epic and this will not stop me, no matter what they will try. But thNx anyway for the good game. Keep it up, w/o me tho."

20075,"Epic games is so lame, forces you to create an epic account even if you link it with other accounts you still need to make one. I do not recommend this game, cause they collect and sell your information through the epic launcher. Not necessary F off epicgames, honestly."

20080,Pay no attention to the idiots whining about the Epic account link. This new system has prevented them from cheating in games either using hack tools or co-ordinating with others to farm crowns by abusing the anonymous id system on Steam.

20103,"The Game itself is pretty fun, especially if you just want to play two or three rounds without spending too much time in one sitting.
BUT: Forcing people into an Epic Games Account all of a sudden is a total d*ck move.
I woudn't complain if you needed one from the beginning.
One of Steam's greatest benefits is to have access to a lot of games without a million accounts.
I already have a Rockstar- and an Origin-Account, which is way more than I intended.
Now another one? Nope, I don't think so!

As long as you don't mind another account, get it on sale. The game is fun, but it doesn't catch me enough to pay the full price."

20119,"I bought this game because the developers promised crossplay with consoles twice, the first time they ""delayed"" it indefinitely, after which they made an unnecessary binding to Epic Store and now they said that crossplay is impossible, they even fucked up the mobile version of the game. The only thing they did regularly was skin packs.

Another reason not to believe any promises from the developers.

I came to the conclusion that I had been deceived."
20120,"every time I open the game I get the missing files error , tried every solution yet nothing works

20172,"As much as I find the game to be fun, the developers allowed for an anti consumer move by removing the game from steam and only on Epic Games.Not to mention making the game go free to play? Yeah it gets the player base up but will easily lead to a more cash focused in game shop. This is the beginning of the game truly going downhill. I hope that's not the case as I still enjoy the game, but these actions are mega stupid."
20173,"This game is made by people who hate other people. It gives no joy, it only brings endless torture spiced by bright colors and idiotic music. Save your money and nerves, don't play this game."
20174,"Pala
Una pala es una herramienta de mano utilizada para excavar o mover materiales con cohesión relativamente pequeña. Consta, básicamente, de una lámina con una ligera curvatura y de un mango con el que se maneja. La tabla o plancha suele ser metálica y el mango remata generalmente en un asidero que puede ser recto o curvo, para poder ejercer mayor fuerza con una de las manos.1​ La pala se ha empleado desde la más remota antigüedad en labores agrícolas y de construcción.

Su evolución ha dado lugar a las máquinas excavadoras y cargadoras, muy importantes en las tareas de movimiento de tierras para remodelación y acondicionamiento de terrenos, construcción de infraestructuras urbanas, conformación de sótanos, preparación de cimentaciones de edificios, etc. En países como Perú a la pala la llaman lampa.


Características
La pala es un instrumento conformado por dos partes: una plancha de madera o metal y un mango cilíndrico.2​ El tamaño de la plancha y el grosor y largo del mango dependen del uso para el cual la herramienta está destinada.3​

El mango posee una empuñadura para facilitar el agarre. Existen tres tipos de mango según su empuñadura:

Mango anilla (tipo D)
Mango muleta (tipo T)
Mango largo (todo uniforme)
Y, según el tipo de trabajo para el que una pala está destinada, existen 3 tipos de planchas:

Con punta redonda: utilizadas para trabajos en los que haya que excavar, ya que la estructura redondeada terminando en punta hace que sea más fácil hincarla en la tierra.
Cuadradas: utilizadas para trasvasar o recoger materiales, escombros, cemento, tierra, etc.
Palote, también llamado pala plana o pala de zapa: tiene la punta cuadrada pero toda la superficie es más estrecha y plana. Utilizado principalmente en jardinería para trasplantar, recortar o perfilar el terreno.
Materiales
El material de fabricación del mango puede ser de madera u otros materiales como fibra de carbono. Las palas con mango de madera son más económicas pero menos resistentes mientras que las palas con mango de fibra son más caras pero más resistentes.

Las palas más utilizadas son las construidas de acero especial, el cual tiene una gran resistencia. No obstante, también hay modelos de aluminio y de plástico. Estas últimas son utilizadas en actividades que no permiten el uso de acero o bien donde el material a tratar dañaría el acero. Este es el caso de palas para la nieve, trabajos en alimentación, combustibles, etc.

La ventaja de las palas de aluminio permite una mayor facilidad de movimientos.

Tipos
Según la forma y material de la placa rígida del extremo y de las características del mango, las palas pueden clasificarse en varios tipos:4​

Palas para agricultura: las palas para el trabajo en la tierra cuentan con una placa con terminación redondeada y algo puntiaguda (como un filo) para favorecer la tarea de excavación. En algunos casos la parte inferior es plana para marcar surcos en la tierra y delimitar el espacio a excavar. La pieza metálica tiene un borde superior plano para ejercer fuerza hacia la parte inferior con el pie. El extremo de su mango puede ser en “T” con el objeto de empujar hacia abajo con la mano y el brazo, o también triangular. En todos los casos tanto el mango como su extremo son de madera cilíndrica.

Palas para jardinería: existen palas que se utilizan para el trabajo doméstico en el jardín. Su elemento metálico es estrecho y puntiagudo y su mango muy corto, como para ser empuñado con una sola mano. Estas palas son muy útiles para cavar pequeños huecos en la tierra en la tarea de introducir semillas o trasplantar flores, por ejemplo.


Pala de jardinería.
Palas para construcción: las palas para mover materiales de construcción tales como cemento, piedra, arena, suelen tener un mango más largo y una concavidad más pronunciada en la plancha inferior, tan ancha como para abarcar una mayor superficie. Esto facilita la tarea de cargar pequeñas cantidades de material y luego volcarlas sobre una carretilla o la caja de un camión para su transporte.

Palas para el aseo: son pequeñas palas, en general plásticas, que cuentan con el extremo cuadrado y perpendicular al mango. Sirven para recoger residuos, polvo y otros desperdicios que fueron previamente acumulados con el uso de un recogedor.

Palas para horno: se trata de palas con una plancha plana y ancha, así como un mango muy largo. Son herramientas indispensables para retirar alimentos de los grandes hornos sin correr riesgos de quemaduras. Generalmente son de madera, material que no transmite el calor.

Palas mecánicas: las palas mecánicas o cargadores representan la versión motorizada de este concepto de herramienta. Mediante el ensamble de un gran contenedor al frente de un tractor, se consigue el movimiento de grandes cantidades de material, tanto para tareas agrícolas como en la construcción.

Otros usos
Las palas de plástico forman parte de los juguetes que utilizan niñas y niños en la playa para manejar la arena. Forman parte de kits que incluyen utensilios tales como un cubo, un rastrillo o unos moldes. Las utilizan para cavar y transportar la arena, realizar riachuelos, construir castillos de arena, etc.

20175,"For reasons that I cannot state, I have been legally required to stand farther than 500ft from any playground or school. However, with the release of Fall Guys the amount of youth and vigor that players have in this game is making me happy again. I love all the types of gamer children and have always meant no harm. Thank you developers for introducing all these young, supple, and innocent gamers into my discord hehe."

HOWEVER

SINCE EPIC: Needing an EG account sucks on principle but it doesn't really bother me. Most people have one now anyway. Anti cheat system, account back up bla bla bla. So, I bought the game here. Account wouldn't link. Good job they have a support team! To sum up many attempts, log ins, emails etc:

-Hi Fall Guys, I need help with Account transfer. It hasn't worked
""Contact Epic""
-Hi Epic, I need help with Account transfer. It hasn't worked
""Contact FG""

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Forget it. I'm cutting my losses and bailing. BoB member to help improve the game, I've bought many packs, managed go get the Twitch/Amazon packs and played since Season 1.

Automated responses have a link to VIEW TICKET which requires ALL cookies to be enabled just to let you log in and see the request. You SNEAKY LITTLE *****.

Congrats Epic. You've ruined yet another game. I hope greed leads to your downfall. Look at the reviews. Over 300,000 Positive from release. You show up and it PLUMMETS to MIXED. That's quite a skill. Companies fire people who have that impact..."

Fall Guys and other games that do this kind of shenanigans can go to h***. And also, people who don't like 'STEAM fanboys' complaining about this issue - you can go lick EPIC's a** and let other people in your life do whatever they want to you."

It makes no sense for the devs to give me 10k kudos for free and then change their mind on it after I have spent it. If it is a bug then they can zero out my kudos, but to have the audacity to put my account into negative currency acting like they are some kind of bank? No matter how good the game is, that will always be the defining thing I remember about the game."

20249,"DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE COMING FROM PLAYSTATION. I MISUNDERSTOOD HOW THE ""CROSS PROGRESSION"" WORKS IN THIS GAME, NOW ALL OF MY COSMETICS AND CURRENCY ARE WIPED. FUCK YOU EPIC. 

Here is what I wrote in response to my fall guys support ticket after this has happened.   

""So, I guess I didn't read the disclaimer when linking my accounts and didn't realize that this would happen. But My Playstation account had hundreds of dollars worth of kudos and outfits purchased with kudos. over 20 crowns, and amazon prime skins that are no longer available. I need ALL of this added back to my playstation account immediately, absolutely no exceptions. I just want my playstation profile to be exactly as it was before i linked it on steam as I intend on refunding the steam version.
There is no reason why cross progression should be this hard and Un-intuitive. Absolutely unacceptable."" 

I linked my epic account to steam as the game FORCED me to, Then I went to log into my playstation account to spend any remaining currency I knew wouldn't be transferred but figured my Skins would be on either accounts, and I was wrong. My PSN profile for fall guys was switched over to the new Steam Profile on my playstation resulting in ALL of my cosmetics, Crowns, Kudos, and Limited time amazon prime skins. all gone. 

So again. FUCK. YOU. EPIC. I hope you go fucking bankrupt you absolute Piece of shit garbage company."

Fall Guys started to fall when barely any stages were added in season 2, but as the seasons have gone on, way more stages have gotten added. It's season 6 now, and I still love this game. They are also collaborations here and there. And probably if you log on right now, there will most likely be a collaboration in the item shop or the challenge tab.

20278,"Core game fun BUT devs seem to never fix bugs and consistently ignore the community and the problems with the game. mediatonic and those fall guys is now owned by epic and forces you to have an epic account. This was not a requirement before hand never did epic or mediatonic mention the up coming requirements and just left the community in the dark before throwing the new epic accounts on the player base. 

Fall guys used to be one of my favorite games but now i must give it a negative review for the reason mentioned above. DO NOT BUY"
20279,this game died over a year ago don't know why you're reading reviews just give up
20280,best game thanks and very low price thanks again

20314,funny game
20315,f
20316,GOAT game
20317,not bad
20318,"This is genuinely one of the few battle royale games I think anyone can enjoy. It's simplistic, easy to understand, super funny, and light hearted fun. Yeah it is beyond dumb you need an Epic Games account for a game that isn't even on their platform, but with crossplay and more versions of the game coming in the future, I'm sure the game will stay alive because of it. For $9.99, it's absolutely worth it."
20319,fal guys
20320,Too much hax
20321,I as well as many others can no longer play the game because of the Epic Online Service update. Ive tried any fixes i can find and there doesnt seem to be a solution. In essence Epic broke this game...

20338,Refuse to make an Epic account for the game I already owned and played
20339,Jebane RNG
20340,Nice game when you have missions to or when you ned to level up. Also fun to play with friends. Otherwise it can get boring because you have no tasks to do besides getting skins for you little fall guy. Since the update are more game modes which is pretty nice. I also like the team mode very much! You also have more chances of getting crownes.
20341,"This game is much more fun with friends, and even if some people find that the gameplay is repetitive, which it can be, the updates bring a lot of new content and maps. Besides the minor inconvenience of needing Epic Games to run it, by far the worst feature I've found is the weak physics engine. It seems far to inconsistent and I've lost many rounds because of crummy physics, like when I can't get up after being knocked over or when the pull-up mechanic didn't work. Other than that though there is not a lot to criticize. 85%."

20419,very fun to play
20420,its fun
20421,"Fall guys is definitely an enjoyable game to play with friends for a short battle royal styled area/obstacle course. You can have a squad up to four people by inviting them to your party straight from the game menu. I highly recommended it for a small group of friends looking for a fun game to play from time to time. 

I personally play with a PS4 controller, because I had difficulty maneuvering the map especially to grab others/swings. This is may or may not be true for other people."
20422,Went wrong way on map. Didnt tell me. Saved checkpoint. 9/10 would not recomend
20423,"Goofy, wacky and infuriating."
20424,"i cant load in
"
20425,"It took me 14 hours, but I finally got my first win. Depressing and humiliating, yes, but this is a fun game to kill time. While the levels m a y feel repetitive, it's not the same each time, and the people you go against make it all but more fun cause of the randomness. And to those complaining to make an Epic Games account...just do it and stop complaining. Would recommend if you are looking for a new game to play.


Update: 40 hours in, and im starting to see the facade of this game. Grab spammers, people getting in glitched spots, its annoying. At first I was having fun, but now I feel like I've hit my peak of constant finale finishes and losing each one of them. And the people who have been playing since Season 1 just know the map layout by memory, or just know tricks to get them way ahead of the pack. Every finale where this is a last man standing always ends the same. Either I get grabbed off, or I die trying to grab someone off. Overall, just not having fun."
20426,"Too bad Epic Games sucks farts, this game was fun while it lasted."
20427,pog
20428,"It is a fun little game, you can have fun when you dont have much to do"

20433,Has retroactively required me to use Epic Games. I do not recommend this company or game.
20434,"This game Isn't special, there are probably a million others like it, yet i love it as its just a simple, fun time, where you can relax and enjoy by yourself or with friends rather than being competitive like other games you might play."
20435,very gay
20436,"its very easy to win but if your a noob u will die

20445,Is fun
20446,i want a refund its boring and not fun
20447,yuh
20448,"This is not a game that is easy to win, if you always wanted to take part in Takeshi's castle and wondered how they would still lose in the end, you must try this and see for yourself. It's fun with friends, it's fun with strangers as well, some guys will try to push you,(they do literally to win) but you should rise again. The courses even if looks easy and you might pass it the first time, there is still uncertainty that you would pass it the second time. Would not play this very often, but yes when I play I will have fun."
20449,It is a fun and challenging game!!
20450,"If your looking for a cool little game to take up time this is a game for that purpose. It is fun and competitive, sometimes frustrating. Overall would recommend."
20451,"sooo much fun! i highly recommend you play with a game controller rather than keyboard / mouse, as it's so much easier to navigate that way. but it's a great value for money, and really enjoyable for people of all ages :)"
20452,ok

20457,Easy to play fun to master. It actually takes some skill to learn some of the maps which gives it some nice replay value and with all the seasons that are out now there is a ton of variety. Very active community and quick to get into matches. Must try even if ur not competitive.  Theres also a squads mode to play with friends.
20458,i like it because its a battle royale.

20481,"If you play this game be prepared to play with kids who have downsyndrum, its really painful and i now need therapy."
20482,"Due to recent policy changes which involve the incorporation of linking an Epic account, It pains me to no longer be able to recommend this game anymore.

When I bought the game, an account for Epic was not needed. The recent changes mean I can  now no longer play Fall Guys and I will not accept an Epic account being linked to my Steam account.

I refuse to link my Steam account with Epic due to it being nothing more than a privacy invasion and a massive data-grab of Steam users.

When I purchase a game I do so taking the risk whether it is bad or not, that I accept, but to bring in account linking and passing information to another separate service AFTER my purchase, thereby changing my aggreement, that's just plain wrong."
20483,No Epic
20484,FUN GAME YEAH
20485,"I'm downright terrible at this game. Normally, I'd stay far away from a game like this, not giving it a second thought as I skip it in my discovery queue. However, it's so cute and colorful that I'm willing to  overlook the fact that I'm so bad at it and watch the rounds following the one that eliminates me (usually the first one).

It makes me so happy that I can watch the subsequent rounds and choose a random jelly bean to root for. Do you have any idea how entertaining it is to wake up your neighbors at 4am by shouting things like ""you go, Slurpee! Oh yeah, make that weird looking goose choke on your dust as you breeze past it! Get it, Slurpee!""? I didn't until just now, and it's as fun as you'd imagine."

20488,cool beans race and stuff
20489,"The game is fun its a blast and it entertained me for 197.2 hours so for that I'm recommending it

Now onto the bad part they made you enter an epic account just so u can play which was not required before i clicked make a new epic account because i didn't have an epic and just wanted to play and it created a whole new account on fall guys and i lost everything with no idea how to get into my epic to unlink it because it created one without telling me the password. i tried getting my old account back and after unhelpful support teams and hours of work i finally got it back after 2 weeks which shouldn't have happened"

20550,They require you to create an Epic Game Store account and hand over all of your data (along with installing some Epic software updates). Never agreed to this when I purchased the game.
20551,ta weno
20552,"This was a fun game originally, but not you need an epic account to play.
They introduced this long after the game had released, as a big middle finger to everyone who previously bought the game."
20553,Was great until the Epic Games account requirement
20554,yes very good

20557,"You shouldn't be forced to install or sign up for another platform when you already paid for it on another. You can't even exit the 1st screen without it trying to force you to sign away all your data to epic, you literally have to alt-F4. GFY epic games"
20558,"Epic ruined the game. Missing files, battlepass, paid skins. But it's still fun to play, I guess."
20559,yes and no its easy to rage at so yea

20565,Great game but Epic Games Store ruined it. I can't run the game anymore. My son just bought it and he can't even play it. Uninstalled.

Game is great tho, but is it important if you can't play it?"
20579,good
20580,i feel like i can relate to the fall guys
20581,Good fun
20582,Its fun
20583,This game can be fun if you're with a group of people and looking to mess around. But after 10 hours the game quickly loses its charm. 4/10
20584,"Its great

20596,"Wanted to give this game another try after a while, was greeted by a requirement to create an Epic Games account. Won't launch this game ever again."
20597,It's like Squid Games and that's a good thing.
20598,"Steam game requiring an Epic Games account.

They front-loaded some EULA and privacy documents, so I opened them on my browser and meanwhile told Steam to stop running the game.  That took 25 minutes before it stopped counting apparently.

Tried to run the game for the first time, and it's taking forever to get it to accept my already established Epic Games account.  At 7:30AM.

Not a great first impression.  Will update later, but can't recommend something this shady."
20599, so good
20600,all was good until it's required to have an epic games account to start the game.
20601,"The first and the last time I spent money on a game from Mediatonic. 

First, they said editing files to get 21:9 aspect ratio working is allowed (ultrawide support being one of the main factors for me to even consider buying a game nowadays). Then after many of us already purchased the game, they of course disabled that option (after a few months) and were just too lazy to add it into the game themselves. 

And now they are forcing us with Epic Games account login. Again, months after we already purchased the game. These have to be one of the most shady and anti-consumer practises from a game developer that I've seen in a long time."
20602,gets boring without other players in a party

20615,"absolutely not. if you want to see a jellybean get slapped around a little bit and then constantly bumped around being completely unable to finish your task, then you're better off watching the easter bunny shake up a basket of eggs. 10/10 do not recommend."
20616,My opinion about fall guys is a fun game if u wanna remove stress of playing other competitive games such cs go or dota 2 or what ever i do recommend for u this game specially if its on sale !
20617,"your crap goes through the ground, glitchy expirience (if you could call it an expirience) Would not recommend especially in 2021"
20618,"Such a Great game back then, but a game if your bored and likes fortnite but not the fortnite thing oh wait"
20619,"Each season brings a new variety of games to add to the culmination of all the games from previous seasons (currently on Season 6 as of writing this). 60 player lobbies, kid-friendly because there is no voice/text chat, and great for gamers of all levels. Each game takes no more than 15-20 minutes to complete and very quick to enter a new lobby if you don't qualify in a round. You can play with up to 3 other friends in your squad and take on the games either solo, or as a team (depending on the show that you choose). Also, you can host private lobbies with up other friends, however I would only recommend that if you had around 40 people to play with you.

There can be a couple of bugs here and there, however, Mediatonic has been pretty on top of it with patches and bug fixes. No cheaters after they implemented the easy anti-cheat (but that was after Season 2 or so). 

Overall, for the $20-$25 (forgot how much it was when I bought it), it is a great platforming battle-royale and I would recommend it for all ages!"
20620,Very entertaining
20621,"Fall guys is actually a pretty good game, i just felt bad bc among us took all the populartity straight after the release"
20622,"uwuwuwu this game is for uwu girls so pretty pog....yesssirrr

20637,Best game just make sure the epic services are not broken
20638,F+ck you Epic Store
20639,this is good game but people say it's a dead game...
20640,"It's a pretty great game, but I can't recommend it in the current state.
We bought the game on Steam, and in order to play, we need to connect to an EPIC service. I don't wanna anything epic related running on my computer, so I'm uninstalling and not recommending this game. 
If you don't care about this, get the game on a sale. It's a good game."
20641,its ok
20642,Crab game better
20643,"Let me say this first this game is not bad. for the seven hours i have played it was fun.
but now epic owns fall guys :(. now the game is free to play on the epic games store, after a more then a year of being twenty dollars and is now filled micro transactions.
most important is if you want to play fall guys now you need to link your steam account to epic games. epic games is not epic :("
20644,this is the worst waste of time ive ever put myself through it caused almost irreversible damages to mine and others lifes
20645,"Probably one of the best games ever made and this is NOT ironic. i love this game with all my heart. The intensive graphics, great fanbase, and the most unique game modes. There is not a single game better besides maybe brawlhalla. -your truly, dream"
20646,im angry
20647,why am I here.

20651,"Fall Guys has been incredibly frustrating to get to work after integration with Epic Online services, as usually half of the time the game claims that I am missing files and it turns out that Epic Online Services somehow isn't working, preventing Fall Guys from being played. I don't expect to run into technical issues with this game at all, and yet I have to continuously reinstall Epic Online Services in order to even play, killing the mood."
20652,I won't play again until they remove Epic shit from it.
20653,"This games meh...It just needs better game modes, all of the game modes are pretty cancerous tbh and make you just want to quit really"
20654,Pretty good game with lots of different maps with multiple variations.

20657,Suddenly requires an Epic games account to play. No thanks.
20658,it is fun and has variety
20659,"Love the game. I played back in Season 4 a little less than a year ago and I would've given a thumbs down back then honestly.
But now all the levels have a ton of variations making the game not boring anymore.


Also I love how most people are whining because they need an epic games store account now but it personally fixes my problem that I had my save on ps4 and I can finally bring it to pc. I wish there was a way to play with friends cross platform but at least now I can play with friends on pc or ps4."
20660,ITS CRAZY
20661,"Sometimes the game can be buggy and Mediatonic takes a while to fix them, but it and will always will be amazing and funny for me"
20662,is pro
20663,unacceptable to impose epic on existing owners. Would not have bought the game if it had this at launch.
20664,Fired up the game after a few months off to discover it now requires an Epic account.  Not impressed that a game I paid for on Steam has now added this requirement as it means I will no longer play it.

20803,"This game is great fun, but the devs decided it would be fun to make every person that wants to play download a bunch of Epic Games spyware. People that payed for this game in its initial state need to agree to multiple new EULAs and join Epic, so if you don't like it you payed to play a game for a few months. This nonsense should be illegal."

20846,"You need to connect to an epic account to play, so have fun without me :)"
20847,ok
20848,i love how quick and easy is to jump in and play a few rounds between tasks. The game is a bit chaotic and the physics of the beans make it so much fun and sometimes kinda unpredictable. I always find myself coming back to this game all the time!

20855,"I would have recommended this before, but as soon as Epic got their hands on it (and Mediatonic) and forced people to have an Epic account linked to it then I absolutely cannot. This type of thing should be illegal in gaming so far as I'm concerned, just like adding DRM post-release should be. Epic is a terrible company with anti-consumer practices and Sweeney is a clockwork hypocrite. Both this game and Mediatonic should not be supported because of this.

Finally, I'll leave this quote to illustrate that Epic and Sweeney don't practice what they preach.

July 21st 2020 -- ""Ultimately, ownership of digital items should be a universal notion, independent of stores and platforms. So much of the digital world today is frustrated by powerful intermediaries whose toll booths obstruct open commerce to keep customers and their purchases locked in"" -- Tim Sweeney via Twitter on EGS integration with GoG Galaxy 2.0

And that was mere days before they got their mitts on Rocket League and did pretty much the same thing (along with removing it from the Steam storefront). Again, forcing accounts, DRM or any other anti-consumer practices on a game post-release should be illegal."
20856,"This game in my opinion, Is the best.










until you have to use epic games, but I don't mind."
20857,"Another reason why you should wait a long time in giving a review.

Devs have just sold out and now integrated the Epic games store Account sign in. 

You cannot play with an Epic Games Account....................

20900,"Fun game, not overtly sweaty, recommend."
20901,i have played for 400 hours bruh download it NOW
20902,"                        I don't know why people are making a big fuss against epic game accounts they aren't very hard to link so all the bad review about epic games should be ignored if your interested in buying this

Pros
Chaos (can also be a con)
play with up to 60 people
funny obstacles and rounds you wont want to miss
customize your bean (that's what we call amoung us people and fall guys people)
play with friends
Cons
can be impossible to win sometimes
can be laggy due to all the new content
hard to learn at first (also can be a pro because your fails can be funny)
Overall: if you like obstacle courses or chaos or even just playing with a ton of people this is the right game for you

20909,"I have had fun with this game, but recently it has been more annoyance than anything. I'm not happy about the Epic Games integration, and I have had way more technical issues since. Also, it doesn't seem like they are listening to feedback. Why are we still getting so much Door Dash and See Saw that nobody likes while the good maps that are liked stay being such a rarity? There are games that I played only once in all my time having this game, 68 hours at the time of writing. It's like they are locking the fun behind the chores of the crappy games on purpose while every week there are 22000 kudos skins waved in your face. This game is not free, but I've been getting the same feeling that I get from free-to-play games, as if being a good game was not an objective for them and they think you for a sucker, counting on your FOMO to keep playing instead of trying to bring you back with fun."

20920,"fun with friends but boring by yourself, the game has too many bots due to a small player base.
edit: with free to play no being introduced there are some new pros and cons
the pros are that there are more players and waiting time for a game is much less 
the cons are that the game works more like fortnite now as in you can no longer earn all currencies, you need to buy them in the store or in the battle pass, the legacy rewards do not make up for the $30 i paid for the game"

They should be required to give refunds to everyone they changed course on. Screw Fall Guys, screw Mediatonic, and most of all screw Epic Games. The last thing the PC gaming community needs to be dealing with is exclusivity deals that limit choice and eliminate competition. My praises go to Steam for pushing back against such toxic practices."

21029,"I bounced off this when it first came out.  While I tried to get into it, the rounds were too luck-based and repetitive, and it just seemed impossible to get a crown.  Watching things I would've liked to buy enter and leave the shop repeatedly while I got slapped down due to bad luck got old fast.

Fortunately, that's no longer the case.  The maps from the first 2 seasons are notably worse than everything that has come in the next 4, which has created a much more varied experience.  The ability to play as squads helps when you can still be carried through even if you get knocked out due to bad luck.  The game also now gives crown pieces which turn into full crowns, so you can still slowly build up a good collection of them even if you aren't winning.  Along with some very fun crossovers, I can now really recommend the game as a solid multiplayer experience with a lot of ways to play."

21069,"Fall Guys is a test of basic timing and platforming with a good dash of luck thrown in. The stingy distribution prevents hyper-competitive mindsets from forming in the majority of players. With customization options that allow people to express themselves, I highly recommend this game for those wanting a casual time-waster. The only downside I can mention is the existence of cheaters who utilize hacks to win unjustly. This is a pitiful display but one found in many games on the market. 

If you want a vibrant silly game where you're just as likely to win a crown as you are to get covered in slime then this is the game for you."

Then... it all of a sudden requires an epic account to play.

Totally offputting from a game I enjoyed very very much.

The devs I'm sure are looking for cross play, or more money, or SOMETHING that probably justifies this move to themselves.

But a MAJORITY of people I know who have this game, wont play it ever again.

Nobody likes to be forced to do things they don't want to do.

I have an epic account too. It's the principal behind this.

21177,boring
21178,"All of a sudden you need an epic games account to play this game on STEAM.

Just non sense."
21179,"Burger
"
21180,Bought this game for my daughter. No longer works without now connecting to Epic and making an account. Disgusting bait and switch. Cannot and will not recommend. Nothing annoys me more than games being sold on a digital store that require another digital store to use. Shame on Steam for allowing this also.
21181,ok
21182,"F**k EpicGayStore, i just want to play a game, not create another accout on a stupid platform"
21183,"great game, but because of the epic games linking giving this thumbs down. i bought this shit on steam not on epic games fuckers"
21184,It a good game
21185,You can't just suddenly require the use of another account a year after the game has come out. For some reason it even asks me for my birthday while I already have an active Epic account. Why do they need my birthday so I can play Fall Guys?!?
21186,Epic Store
21187,ebic bad
21188,my favorite game  on my PC curently

21193,vewy vewy epicnessness
21194,new update requires epic games launcher
21195,its competitive for people who like challenges against others
21196,"Fall Guys' simplicity and fun-for-all atmosphere is its gift and its curse. It can be played by anyone but it really doesn't offer you much at all, making it pretty boring and predictable after a while. 

Basically this is one of those games you put on during Christmas or Thanksgiving when your parents tells you to let your 8 year old nephew/niece play games but you don't want them to touch the games you really care about like The Witcher 3 or Fallout: New Vegas"
21197,Aside from having to link an Epic Games Store account to play it's actually pretty good if not better than what it was when it launched
21198,It's crazy this got big in the first place
21199,Very fun to play with friends and just chill. Not to sweaty but not overly easy. A well-balanced game that the creators are constantly updating.
21200,nu
21201,I love epic games sooooooooooooo much
21202,you fall and you are a guy so good
21203,its good
21204,nice game
21205,"After the big boom happened with fall guys its so hard to get into any match, it either takes super long or failed to find a match and it IS NOT MY CONNECTION
On top of that they force you to use an epic games account in order to even play now. Super stupid"
21206,its a fun game  and there's lots of positives about it but this forced epic game store account bullshit is so bad
21207,"Great game when people are not afk. Has a lot more potential than is realized. But still overall a great game to play. Very forgiving to casual gamers, but also rewards grinders."
21208,Fun to past time.
21209,its fun
21210,GOOD

"
21235,"Fucking garbage, you can't even report after the last round because the option to report disappears. The devs probably have liquid shit instead of brain in their head.

Don't buy."
21236,this game is awful because you keep getting stuck on other fat ass players and cant mover fuck this game
21237,Fun party game with friends
21238,"First, got to make an epic account and that takes a while for no apparent reason then they want your info. I already had an epic account, but I had to insert my personal details for some reason (IE birth, location, etc). 

Second: They need to fix the servers or optimize the game, since this has to be one of the worst laggy experiences I had in a while. Sometimes it works, sometimes it takes a full 6 seconds to do anything, and I have high speed internet."

21248,The Game was so Good And I Played After Months it improved but i miss the old trend
21249,Pretty fun and it is easy to understand.
21250,"Game has incredibly bad latency. Games such as tail tag or jinxed make it almost impossible to grab some people because on their screen they are 10 feet in front of you where on your screen they are in your hands. Impossible. Console players are, for some reason, at a latency advantage. Ridiculous. But I play it anyway."
21251,"this game FELL off


get it?"
21252,"You run around as a bean that you've dressed up in a costume of your choosing.  It's fun.  Good, simple, fast paced fun.  Reminds me of the inflatable obstacle courses you'd play in as a kid.  Fall Guys is nice quick rounds that don't require the undivided attention that other games do.  My 7-year old son loves to play it with me which is a plus."
21253,"Game is good for what it is. HOWEVER, I purchased this game through Steam a long time ago, I should not have to create an epic game account to play something I already own. More bloatware, more data they get to squeeze out of people."
21254,nice

21272,play the game
21273,i love amo ng us
21274,lmao Epic Games
21275,good when I win
21276,"Despite the naysayers, this game is not dead. It's better than it's ever been. Tons of new content and QoL updates since the Summer of Fall Guys, definitely recommend getting back into it or trying it out if you never have. Just don't take it too seriously"
21277,"A lot of bad reviews simply because of having to link an Epic account to play now. Fall Guys is still a frustratingly fun game. Basically MXC in video game form, what's not to love/hate about it? I am quite awful at the game, but I still enjoy playing it- maybe a little masochistic. You get a lot of free skins/kudos through Amazon Prime/Twitch. No pay to win content in the game, store is just for fashion.

I use mouse/keyboard for probably 95% of the games I play. That being said, I use a controller for Fall Guys. Trust me on that, it makes the game 100% easier to play.

Most games I play off steam (like MMOs) make you have a separate account to play anyhow, so it's not a big deal that I have to connect my Epic account to play. No one is forcing developers at gunpoint to deal with Epic, they choose to take the exclusive deal with Epic since Epic gives them a bigger cut of sales than Steam does."
21278,"Game good

Epic games bad"
21279,"Nope. Not playing it again until they remove this Epic Store integration.

Fuck off."
21280,"Bruh how you gonna have me log in one day and just be like ""yo you have to download Epic to play""...I bought this to AVOID epic. Quit forcing that stuff on us."

21286,Requirement for an EPIC games account is ridiculous. Great game but I'll no longer be playing.
21287,Really fun.
21288,I don't understand why people like this game. It's literally a rip-off of Squid Game.
21289,Epic account requirement is unacceptable...

21294,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
21295,bloby baby
21296,"i got pushed off a cliff and broke my mouse twice playing this dumb ass game 
this game is so broken dont play this shite"
21297,Owned the game since release. Figured I'd boot it up again and see how much it has changed. Suddenly an Epic Games account is forced one me. Will attempt to get a refund.

21307,"Was a great game for a long time, but now I need an Epic Games login to play it through Steam.  Very underhanded and stupid of the publisher/developer to force this onto users that already bought their game.

Uninstalled and won't be playing anything else by this developer for the foreseeable future."
21308,"I actually kinda hate this game

Oh sure it looks all cheerful and bubbly. The courses are bouncy and colorful. The lil blob ppl look so cute in their outfits. 

But behind all of that is tragic rat race you are doomed to fail

you push and shove and claw your way through a maze just to fall again and again

there is no escaping

once you qualify for the next round you are destined to fall and start over

if you want to truly beat this game

go ahead and kiss your family good bye

i have 

and i'm not looking back

i may hate this game but i hate loosing even more

i signed my soul away the moment installed this

21312,good beginning but past first round the group plays are totally random rng if you win
21313,"This is a great casual comfy game I having a blast playing this game for the first time.
But sadly people have been complaining about the mandatory EGS login although I have no problem about it because I have an EGS account for a very long time only to claim their weekly free to claim games offers but this is a serious concern for people who don't want to create another account on another platform that they dislike and without EGS account mean no access to play the game which sucks for them. I don't think it won't be changed anytime soon because this game studio are now owned by Epic. But I don't regret my decision to buy this game and still gonna play this game casually so please take my review with a grain of salt guys. Cheers."

Fall Guys is a very fun and competitive game as it can be taken both serious and also just be played for fun. This game can also be played alone or with a group of friends. I would guess that most players can play the game for around 20-100 hours before getting burned out. Though you can always return to Fall Guys at a later point."

Then, another update hit and now when I tried to launch, it download some weird epic games software(literal malware) and it tells me to sign up for it. Come on bro, I paid full price and it makes me sign up to give my data away and installs literal malware.

21414,"As of now requires Epic games store account to play... trough Steam. Would not take issue with this if that was the case at the time of my decision purchase the game. Buy the game trough Epic games store if you want to play it I guess, no point in buying it trough steam."

21420,fun game
21421,It's just not fun. Almost everything is based on RNG and the controls are awful. I get this is supposed to be a joke game but I paid money for this.
21422,beans fall = very good
21423,Was a decent game until they now force you to log into an epic games account to play. Awful move by the developers.

21428,"I am Wondering James, and I approve this review."
21429,This game now requires an epic games account and it will force you to install the launcher AFTER buying more than a year ago and never needing one to start. If I wanted an epic games launcher or account i would have it already. Careful epic games. This is exactly what EA did and Microsoft is threatening to do. I will not be installing or playing this game ever again.
21430,this is the best game ever but fortnite  is way much better but my mommy and sugar daddy say you guys are dog water like come on on now bratab chicken doom doo

21438,Now requires 3rd party authentication through epic game store. Not worth the annoyance
21439,It started downloading some Epic Games services without any warning. That's shitty.
21440,"Used to be a good game, then came cheaters. Was playable with that. But now Epic forces you to make an account on a game I already bought. 

Remove the Epic Account requirement and I'd recommend"
21441,Eh
21442,
21443,"I'm fine with the Epic Games buyout, what peeves me is that I have to login to Epic Games and install their launcher so that I can play a Steam game, it just doesn't make much sense. If this is changed I will gladly change my review."

21470,"Bought this game on steam for my daughter.

Now it cannot be played without connecting it to the Epic Games Store, which installs itself onto your PC when you connect it.

Gross."
21471,Forced to go through Epic Games Store now. Can't recommend now that you have to deal with all the egs software.
21472,WORST GAME DONT BUY THIS GAME :-
21473,This is a great game. This is really fun. I would highly recommend that you buy this game right now and start playing as soon as possible and you should spend all of your free time playing this wonderful game.
21474,epic game buy now :)
21475,i personally love this game 10/10 sometimes it gets boring but that goes with every game am i right
21476,"you know i really want to like this game i even pre ordered it. its cute, funny, the cosmetics are good, there are plenty of game mdoes to choose from.. but the one thing that makes me not reccomend this game is the fact that you cannot control the outcome of your game no matter what. make it to the last round? someone throws you off. pick the wrong side of the see saw? loss. someone bumps you into a spring pad? loss. it is so frustrating making it to the last round every time i play only to lose to someone who accidentally stayed on the map. at least make the last round somewhat skill based. christ."
21477,"Fun, silly and rewarding once you get better, learn the levels and start to consistently progress."
21478,"Its ok, could be better"
21479,"Loved this game to play with friends, we got together after a while and decided to play and bam, epic games pops up. So yeah, negative review."
21480,"Tried to play for first time in a while, Epic games tries to force download their garbage launcher, and now wants a forced sign-in. Nice job ruining a great game."
21481,fun but glitchy and laggy maybe just for me?
21482,i am not fan of this game. it is way too hard and i can't crank 90s and get vic roys. that is why i cannot reccomend this game.
21483,"yes i would reccomend fall guys untimate knockouyt because they added among us skin

21498,"Got boring and they stopped listening to their buyers. Grassroots esports tournaments for the game also died because Mediatonic did not listen to the community regarding fixing glitches and fixed extremely minor ones, including making a certain weekly mode unfun to finish because people stacked crowns easily (actually, this isn't actually a problem because there are other modes, the entire fact that it's a live-service and if the servers are gone, nobody can play is the issue).

Also, Mediatonic was bought by Epic Games, so don't buy [EDIT: play] this until it becomes free on the Epic Games Store.

(The only plus is that because of the Epic Games account syncing, you could just launch the game on your PS4/PS5 PSN linked to the Epic Games account and if you unlocked achievements on Steam already, you can automatically earn them instantly on PS4/PS5, so you don't have to redo the achievements on PSN. That's the only plus. Once syncing was available, it had been months since I already 100% the achievements on Steam. I launched the game on PS4 with the PSN account already linked to my Epic Games account (bought PS+ for a month since it was required to launch the game; stupid console multiplayer subscriptions), and autounlocked all the achievements that unlocked on Steam and got my first Platinum Trophy as a result. When it launches on Xbox One/Series S/X (they might skip Xbox One just to troll Xbox owners EDIT: They didn't skip Xbox One, thank God), the same thing will happen, just with Xbox Achievements. Most likely, the game will be F2P at that point when it launches on Xbox and Switch, which is why they delayed those launches. EDIT: That's exactly what happened.)

Nothing interesting has been happening though and esports for the game died after already rich and successful streamers on Twitch for Twitch Rivals were able to compete to get even more money and I didn't have a single chance to compete because I'm not a streamer even though I got the idea of the game fast, so that sucks. This was supposed to be my next esport after Sprint Vector and that chance already died out of the water.

LAST EDIT: It will now be free on EGS for Season 7. I called it. They have fucked over their OG buyers though because they are only getting a few costumes, a tag, and one premium season pass for Season 7 and then no more Premium Season Passes. I paid $40 for this for esports, couldn't compete, and got fucking ripped off.

Fuck Epic Games, I'm pirating every single game now because I got ripped off on multiple VR games having dead multiplayer, fuck this shit."

CONS
-No local multiplayer

21544,very fun i dont know why they made is die
21545,good game Recomended
21546,"All good things have to come to an end

Although the game has received a nice revamp, they now force you to use an Epic Account, agree to their EULA, handing over some extra data regarding you and/or your Steam account (via vinculation), and installing some extra software/services in order to use that account and probably fetch some extra data about you.

There literally was no need to, and reasons such as it avoiding exploits through usernames should not even be why. This addition is just as much of a nuisance as was owning a Microsoft account (to simplify it) to play games back in the days. It also forces players that do not trust the company due to legitimate reasons to hand over their data.

Using an Epic account should be optional, and not something mandatory."

21630,"This game has technical issues:

Wide screen resolutions aren't support
Higher refresh rates than 60 aren't supported. Sure you can select 144+ but every character other than yours will be a blurry mess

Team mode is terrible. If it does not fill to the full 60/60 players you can have a 3 person team and are guaranteed to lose

Most games are pure RNG and there's not much strategy/skill to the final rounds

If they improved the technical aspects this very cute game would be better but there's no excuse for a game in 2021 to not support modern hardware when even titles such as Warcraft III do"

21642,"This game requires less skill than playing solitaire.
99.99999999% of the time you lose you have absolutely no fault.
You often die because some useless idiot with the wolf skin or the gingerbread man skin bodyblocks you (with the mass of an aircraft carrier loaded with tanks) making you fall.
Sometimes you fall because your character suddenly becomes invertebrate or has a violent fit of convulsions after landing on a platform. 
It often seems that the character has skates under his feet.
Sometimes you don't qualify for the next round simply because you have had the bad luck (or the lack of skill, according to many) to be spawned in the last row. 
Sometimes you fall from collisions that seem to be made by a drunk fool at a bachelor party.

Some games are simply badly designed. You have to escape by a slime that runs like Verstappen on the Abu Dhabi circuit while you get chain-bodyblocked by those clowns of the other players while you have to dodge the worst obstacles with potato collisions.

This game is vaguely fun when played as a team without even trying to commit.

I mean, if you think you like the graphic style and the variety of character skins (there are many collaborations and 
the game gets updated) and you are intrigued by the idea of ​​playing a Takeshi Castle game that requires more luck than flipping a coin, buy it.
Otherwise, save your money."
21643,Now you need an epic games account to play. So for me i'm done with this game
21644,"beaned

21645,In the most recent update you have to link an epic games account to play. This now makes the game completely unplayable for me as I refuse to support such a shady business. You've now lost my business.
21646,"Funny
6.5/10 points
This is a very interesting game. If you have several friends playing this game with you, he will bring you more fun. However, the level content of this game is relatively repetitive, and the game developers pay more attention to the paid content rather than the new game level design, which is very bad."

21653,Really great and fun game but you can't create a party with cross platform friends. The only way to do that is to create a custom match but you need min 12 players which is really annoying
21654,sweet
21655,"A fun minigame type game I guess. I haven't really been into the latest season (6) but I definitely enjoyed all the previous seasons. The game overall gets a bit tiring/boring over time but hopefully new and enjoyable content will resolve this! Recommended.

Edit (15th July 2022):

The game has become free to play and despite purchasing the game on Steam I still think it was the best option for the makers to go with. I have gotten back into the game ever since and have been able to play with friends that didn't have the game before for free! I've been really enjoying this ""Season 1"" of Free to play and will definitely continue to play and play in future seasons with my friends :)"

21667,very fun
21668,"If you bought the game prior to the Epic Games partnership, you should not have to make an Epic account to play. This ought to be illegal."
21669,Good Enjoy Game
21670,Fall Guys is plain and simple can be a good time or bad time. Win or losing its all about being number one by yourself or with friends squading up. It can get really additive over and over again to get a bit better each time or just yelling about a bs play's. Its a battle royal performer game online with others that is pretty much it. It feels a bit like Mario Party with the mini games as well. The fun about it is the winning feels good so much clutch moments for a crown to get that cool looking skin. There also events and seasons so there is always something going on. Its fun and simple that is why I enjoy it. Give it a shot its a bit different to some battle royal games out there might not be that fun for some because this is about timing and precise jumps with little derpyness to it.
21671,its a cool game
21672,Was fun while it lasted... why do shady companies have to ruin good things? I never want to do business with Epic. That's why I am here.
21673,"Was fun. 
Fuck epic Games
Nice one, selling our info.
Well done, you're shitting on your community"
21674,it good
21675,IT'S ADORABLE
21676,"I cannot recommend anyone purchase this game, as it now requires you to link an Epic Games account in order to play. Hopefully pressure from negative reviews will cause the developers to reconsider their business partners who have a deservedly poor reputation."
21677,Epic on Steam? GTFO
21678,they do be fallin
21679,"Can't recommend as long as Epic is required, a company should never change the software requirements to play a game regardless of what happens with company acquisition."
21680,"Game is fine, but fix the server issues we've been having lately.  I can't even complete a full game without being booted.  It's beyond annoying."
21681,"Fun game, totally daft, thankfully there's no chat or it'd be so toxic
Better with friends and voice comms but good solo as well
Some achievements are almost impossible like win 5 in a row

7/10 - Would be higher but there's passive racism as all the Legendaries are white skins"
21682,this game is very fun to play with friends
21683,Te obliga a tener una cuenta de epic games y además te abre los servicios online de esa empresa ( y para colmo me lanzó error varias veces)

21688,fun with friends!!
21689,its fun
21690,its ok
21691,fun and frusterading
21692,It forces you to couple your Epic account. Basically forcing you to register to a service you don't want. So if I don't want to use Epic account it's a game I cannot play even though I payed. No refund either if you played more than 2 hours ...
21693,so shit game
21694,It's a really great party game to play with friends and hella cute
21695,"Funny Game, also good for a chatting round while playing"

21710,.
21711,"Was a funny and entertaining game until they forced you to link with EPIC account.  
Now you can't play the game anymore, like you could when the conditions were different at the time of purchase.
@STEAM:  Please refund my money, the game is no longer playable for me and the conditions to use the game were changed onesided from you. For changing a contract the agreement must come from both sides.
@EPIC: Get the F U C K out of Steam with your retarded business model you C U N T F A C E S."

21719,"I like this game quite a bit. It doesnt deserve the hate it gets. People actually put time into games like these, but they dont get the credit they deserve. Only thing that i think makes this gamea round a 4/5 review is if your on a low end pc/laptop. its almost impossible to play. Would be great if they made it easier and more playable for these kind of devices. Thanks!"
21720,ya
21721,nice game
21722,"good
"
21723,"Great, now you need an Epic Game Store account to play this. And after release, just like Rocket League.

I feel bad for Steam for having to deal with a bunch of refund requests and loss of sales due to a competitor deciding that you need to play it through their service. 

It is time to get this game removed from my library. I sincerely hope that this is the last game you guys will make. Between all the NFT's, micro transactions, exclusivity deals and bad practices in games like this my enjoyment of games is now mostly determined by the practices of the developers and publishers. It is sad really."

- Price is a bit steep imo

21781,Awesome game.
21782,this game is cool!
21783,"Was great fun until the requirement of an Epic account was implemented. Total BS to add the requirement a year after the release of the game. Nobody asked for this. There's a reason why we all bought it on steam and not on egs. Forcing everyone into your ecosystem makes you a worse company than everyone already knew you were. Honestly didn't know that was possible. 

This decision was either made out of incompetence, corporate greed for data, or most likely, a combination of the two. But hey, congratulations on adding a shopping cart to your store I guess. Shows you can click the ""add basic required features"" button just as well as my 2 year old cousin. You can expect a preschool graduation hat in the mail from me shortly.

If your idea of creating competition in the PC gaming market was to stand out as the clearly worse option, then you have succeeded. You can stop pulling crap like this to remind us of that fact now. We get it, you guys suck. No one asked for a villain here, yet you gladly volunteered.

KEEP YOUR TRASH OUT OF MY STEAM LIBRARY!"
21784,"I literally cannot launch the game anymore ever since they required the Epic Games account. I have one, I just get an error every time I try to launch it."
21785,dum game is dum
21786,"Hahaha person who pushed me fell down.

But legit this is actually pretty fun, a nice change from what most games are like, still competitive tho."
21787,"i bought it on steam, i played it on steam, why should i download a nutcracker sick job epic store?"
21788,Everything was fine until the mandatory Epic Games Login. I can't login because my Epic account is linked with my Google Account and no option is shown in the login screen.

21813,Top kek epic games account trash game
21814,Fun game
21815,"Was a cool game. I went to play it again today and it locked me out unless I had an Epic Store account. Nahhh, I ain't about that."
21816,decent game imo
21817,"I like the grathics and the way you play this game, there is also loads of features and fun moments.Once you get the hang of the game you enjoy it alot
"
21818,"epic games, nuff said."
21819,"As expected, fun for maybe 30 minutes at most. Quickly becomes evident you 'win' by remembering the layout, which is done in about an hour time for most maps. Spend enough time and you'll win most games. It's extremely boring and explains why you'll find so many players looking for 'experts' to play with - there just isn't any challenge! - Refunded."
21820,"Lags out a lot, so you lose and have to start again. It's December 2021, they've had months to sort this out. Unplayable like this."
21821,"Game is fun at first and the basics are really great but since the devs dont care about adding enough content you are stuck playing the same 10-15 maps over and over again, so it gets extremely repetitive, even though the game is predestinated for steam workshop and a map editor."
21822,very cool
21823,"great game if you have friends family over or young ones visiting great PG fun and is pretty fun to play with company when you're pickled 
PS- thanx! @symca for my first Steam game, great present."

"
21829,This is so bad....  I bought it from steam now its asking for epic games online services  downloads .. so sad....i really feel bad for this..........
21830,its fun
21831,they are forcing you to install EGS and make an Epic Games account to play now. BS
21832,"Only played this game for a little bit, and it was great fun for what it was! 

But now you MUST have an Epic Games account in order to play it, which completely ruins the experience for me. I only use Steam and do not care for Epic Games. I truly hate that you're now forced to get into an entirely different platform for the sake of this game that was originally available through Steam. Uninstalled and probably will never play again and definitely won't recommend this in the future for anyone who only uses Steam."

21850,good game if your into parkour and being compedative
21851,It's a fun game that brings out my competitive side and the creators just keeps on giving. I had thought by now it would've died out and new things wouldn't be added but I'm impressed that it's still going. I'm most excited about the nightmare before Christmas theme coming Dec 16th.

21865,"I thoroughly enjoyed the game, as you can see by my hours on this game.  However, now that the company is owned by Epic Games, you now need an Epic Games account in order to play.  Nearly downloaded the dang thing before I realized!  I strongly dislike Epic Games due to their business practices, thus, I will not support a game that currently belongs to them.  So, I suppose it's farewell to this game.  Onto the next.  Shame really - one of the few multiplayer games I actually loved (and was good at!)

So, I am giving a non-recommendation, due to having an Epic Games account being mandatory in order to play."
21866,"This game is a lot of fun, but there are some glaring issues. I greatly dislike being forced to sign-up for Epic games to continue playing a game I have already paid for. There are still some bugs (some of the game-breaking) and a system needs to come into place to prevent players just hanging around idle before the finish line, wasting everyone else's time.

That aside it's a fun party game that keeps adding new content with Seasons (We're in Season 6 now). I would recommend it but beware the issues stated above!"
21867,Lots of silly fun
21868,it fun
21869,Great game for kids and growups alike.
21870,"On its own, this one gets stale pretty quick. Pair it with your favorite podcast, or a discord with some friends though, and you're in business. Sort of like the fidget spinner of games, it keeps your hands busy while your mind unwinds. Just turn down the in-game music before it breaks you. Because it will break you."
21871,Not as good as expected
21872,"Fun game to play with friends. Is it worth 24$ CAD? Not for what it is, but if you get it on sale then yes."

"
21893,"It was fun for the first half an hour and then the glitches started coming, the game got bland. 3/10"
21894,i like it
21895,"I've played Fall Guys off and on since it was released and I'll be honest when I say that I adore this game. The only issue I can complain about is a glitch/disconnection error every time I try to play. Even with a stable internet connection, I am disconnected from 8 out of 10 games I try to play due to an error with internet connection and the ones I AM able to play, my character will teleport around the map or it will stand frozen or unmovable. This issue began around Season 4 and it's only gotten worse moving on to Season 6. It's very difficult to play this these days.

Without issue, the game is 8/10 stars. With the issues, it's about a 3/10. It's great if you can play it but just cute to look at when you can't."
21896,"It was a little fun for a bit, but there's nothing it offers to keep me interested."
21897,wtf? why all of a sudden i need to sign in epic games account to play the damn game ???XD

21904,"Can't even leave the game without linking the account to EGS first. Had to ALT+F4. By the way this game worked fine before they made linking to EGS mandatory, they say it's to enable crossplay, guess what? That's not how crossplay works, there's many actual crossplay games that let you play PC to console, let alone steam to EGS without any sort of link. Fuck off EPIC GONORRHEA STORE :)"
21905,Did I need EGS account for playing this game?? FFs hell no!!!!
21906,nothing i hate
21907,you need to link your epic games account to this game which is pretty annoying

Not cool."
21920,I like this game. And my daughter hihi
21921,fall guy
21922,"Amazing game altogether.
bit of a learning curve for those not used to platformers. 
but none the less an amazing piece of work
AND the takeover by epic games will help not hinder this game
it will allow them to publish to other platforms
like xbox 
and may bring an influx of players"

21924,Optional crossplay would have been cool. Forced Epic Games account creation in a patch after I already purchased the game? Not ok.

21927,"Fall Guys was a fun game that I used to play regularly; however, with the recent changes by Epic to require you to install Epic Launcher and log into Epic Games Account in order to play this game even though I already run it through my Steam account, I refuse to be strong armed into using Epic Games through this manner. I have uninstalled this game and won't be returning moving forward.

21940,good game
21941,Can't even play the game since the Epic Games update. Awful company.
21942,"Honestly, this game is extremely fun. People keep posting recent reviews hating on the game, not because of the gameplay but because you have to make an epic account. If you aren't a big cry baby about having to make an epic account to play with epic store users then I can guarantee you will love the game. This is a shut off your brain and hang out in your living room type of game. A 10/10 game would recommend to anyone who enjoys crab game but dislikes hearing slurs or getting earr*ped every 2 seconds by 12 year-olds. 

tl;dr: The game is fun and good. People giving bad reviews are cry babies about epic account creation who act like they have area 51 level secrets on their pc."
21943,"its just dumb fun 

"
21944,The game is fun to play I would recommend. The only downside is sometimes the servers get overloaded and you cant get the game to load
21945,it.s good one
21946,"It's like MXC, or Wipeout, or Wipeout (uk), but you get to play it!

It's a lot of really wacky good fun, and you start to understand the levels better, get your own little strategies, sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't.  Honestly don't take it too seriously and you'll have a blast, just go out there and have fun!"

21966,This game is toxic
21967,This game is very good I recommend buying
21968,buy if u wanna upgrade ur rage mode
21969,"I gotta say i was a bit sceptical on getting this game ,but i'm glad i bought it as its amazing . Now signing on to epic games isn't a problem at all as the game is still playable , you can play a game within minuites and have a full game. Love the game play of different game modes and maps. I know I haven't won any full full game but i have passed though the levels which i'm happy about. some are difficult but at the end of the day I like the challenge. I would definitely recommend this game 10/10. Last thing to point out since I have been playing I haven't come across any hackers unlike the other commends have said. 10/10 gameplay and loading times arn't that long either which is a bonus! Keep up the good work on this game."
21970,god game
21971,"Can't see the reason why I should hate this game because 'EPICZZ!' like so many others.

You can still buy it on Steam, you can still play it on Steam, they changed like what, Epic account login? Just make it, like bunch of accounts you've made on many platforms. Man up, kids.

PS: You can join /r/***epic with other whiners. It's kinda hot there with the new Final Fantasy 7 Remaster right now.

Game's fine, deal with it. Other than that, da*n this game, I suck at it!"
21972,Its awesome. You will get frustrated at first but it will get better!
21973,"It's been bugging me that hardworking developers, artists, designers, marketers, and everyone in between- all of whom are clearly passionate about their work- are being dragged through the mud for a decision that in all likelihood never fully rested upon their shoulders.

I understand that the Epic Games store and its reputation is subpar, to say the least. Everyone here knows the bad and the good about them. I'm not here to condone and/or support any of their practices.

But I am here to give my unpopular opinion that Mediatonic's poor choice to use Epic Games as a medium for creating accounts has quite honestly brought a lot of good with it. Crossplay existed before, but what will soon be possible is the ability to add people from all platforms as friends, which was supposed to be the main selling point of the move. We now have an easy way to implement usernames on PC, because when the game first came out we abused the game's structure to create names that could crash other people's PCs. Runtimes and loading times are better, and hackers are just about nonexistent at this point... all of this is just based on what I've personally noticed.

What I'm trying to say is that this is just a well-developed, silly little game to play in short bursts. If you want to support the creators, but want nothing to do with Epic, you can always make a burner account to enjoy the same old game it's always been. Please don't judge the game too hard just based on their new development alone. I think Fall Guys is good for what it is, and deserves a lot more love than that."
21974,I love thi game and i dont have anything thet i dont like
21975,ePIG games required :(
21976,haha
21977,"I do not wish to make a Fortnite Store account just to play a game I already own.

Let me get this straight, for over a year and a half you have failed to add Steam nicknames to your game, which means all PC players ran around with randomized names while all console players can have their nicknames fully on display, treating PC players like second-class citizens... and then instead of fixing that particularly glaring issue, you added a mandatory login with Epic Store account to even play the game that has always been on Steam in the first place?

Aight, bet."
21978,"epic games now needed? 

nah man, you be epic's little bitch"
21979,Bean man funny.
21980,I come back to play this game after months and find out I'm being forced to make an account on a website I don't even use/would have never used to play the game that I bought on STEAM (A WHOLE DIFFERENT WEBSITE). WTF!? Steam or someone should give people their money back because we never asked for this.
21981,its fun

22036,"Nice and fun game, great with friends and hilarious to backseat. I just didn't like playing it, it isn't too dependent on your skills and can get quite frustrating from time to time. Also I don't like how much grinding is required to get cool skins.

Although I don't like it that much myself I would encourage you to try it, BUT I just can't recommend a game that requires you to use an Epic Games account, simply ridiculous."

I want my money back! They're forcing you to make an Epic Games account to play. You also need to download Epic Games shit spyware. I despise Epic Games and their predatory practices! I purchased this game on Steam! Epic Games sells your data to the Chinese Communist Party! They scam their own customers and are overall against them!
They need to pay developers, just to be able to compete with stores like Steam, that actually give a crap about their own costumers. I will not support them in any way! What a massive disappointment, I don't have words for this!"

22043,Great game :D real fun to play with your friends.
22044,"The matchmaking is poorly optimized. 
In my opinion it is not newbie friendly.
Most of the game is waiting if you are not expert.

Since my playtime exceed the hours for refunds I cannot get my refund.
Steam do not count that for actually PLAYING the game you need to wait the matchmaking... so my playtime is less than 2h in game.

Anyway, since I wasted my money like many other users , IMOP , this game is for a target audience that likes the heavy competition even in a game where(again imop) there where no need.
The ""competitivity issue"" could be easily solvable with a score system -> who has more points win! easy peasy and way less frustrating for who is new to the game .

Again, personally I don't get the fun of losing 3294087239847 times just to learn how the Unity's physic works ^^"".

My personal 2 cents since I cannot get my refund.
Sorry Mediatonic but you need to hire a better Game Designers if you want to keep ""the face"" of a casual game with the design of a Battle Royal game with e-sports ahah.

Have a good day!"

22147,"The game is fun and frustating at the same time, love the graphic and the level designs they do.

If you think this game is for kids, you are wrong tho."
22148,"Now requires an Epic account, so they bait-and-switched us like Rocket League."
22149,Epic games account required to play a steam game..
22150,"please help i cannot win
"
22151,"Epic games account required to play a steam game?

I wish I could still refund it."
22152,beans
22153,"Was quite fun playing with mates before the latest 'update'.......which forces you to install and needing an EPIC account. I don't understand why the thought that was a good idea...as a matter of fact, i think that might be illegal forcing consumers to use certain applications which was never required nor agree to before in order to use a purchased product?????"
22154,this game is like among us and minions from despicable me 2. i like this gaem lot and enhoy it!!
22155,They are forcing epic play game. It is not fun to connecting to account to epic. It took me about 30 minutes to just to play this game
22156,Issues with Epic Games launcher doesn't even let me play the game
22157,man why epic
22158,Was a great game.  Went to play it again recently and it REQUIRES an epic games account.  Uninstalled immediately.
22159,"I just got the game recently on Steam after having not played since Season 1 on PS4, and I gotta say, I have no problems with the Epic Games Account integration, and the game is as fun as ever. With most other games with a battle pass leveling-type system, I don't typically feel like I have a chance to complete all the levels. Fall Guys is different. The game stays fun, especially with friends, and the cosmetic incentives are personally enough to keep me playing more."
22160,it is a very useless game to have in ur
22161,yes
22162,"I spent 20 dollars on this game and now its free and all i get is some cosmetics, and it took nearly 2 years for full cross-platform. The game also fell off after the first season. Mid game."
22163,Divertido con los panas
22164,i may not have played much but the times i played with my buddies was great. Now its on epic and they force me on to their platform and i refuse to use it. the fun is now over
22165,Nice posi vibes cozy game <3
22166,"its fun but the controls can feel ""floaty"" if you are use to tight platformers."
22167,.
22168,the game wont open for me!!!!!
22169,Loved the game but now requires and Epic Games Store.  Uninstalled.  Another one bites the dust along with Rocket  League.
22170,Epic bad lol.
22171,game bad
22172,Ywsd
22173,"Decent time UNTIL Epic Games bought it and put an account wall in. 
Now not so much. Tsk Tsk..
Want a refund because your game is unplayable unless you create an account with 'Epic' Games? NOPE. 
Bad practice! I don't/wont support what Epic Games promotes business wise and more."
22174,"I would say it was a sound business savvy move to sell user data AND charge a price.
Too bad steam has a review section, If it was sold on the EPIC Store we wouldn't be able to complain."
22175,now requires epic account
22176,its great with friends but it takes a long time to get in a game but overall its fun to play
22177,"I'm probably going to regret leaving comments on but I actually value feedback so here we go.

I bought this game because I wanted it.
I wanted to play the game.
That's it. 

It's 2021 currently and most services require you to sign in or sign up.
I consider myself to be a power user and I frequently use as many functionalities as I can.
That being said; I have an account for pretty much every platform I use.

Hot take warning!

Giving a company your email and password is literally the lowest possible effort thing you can do.
In exchange you get to use the service.
That's a privilege, not a right.

What ever a company's reason for requiring you to SSO or create a new account is often clearly stated.
and it seems very clear to me (a user who agrees to the terms of service) that my account is integral to the service.

Pragmatically, you have a few options.

You can say ""Epic bad"", refuse to elaborate further, and cease cooperation with the service. (Stop playing)
I promise it affects you less than it affects Fall Guys.

Or

You can link all your profiles, and never have to worry about change again.

I regularly choose the latter. 
because it's easier.

I read a comment that went something like this.

""I've not met one person who criticizes Epic's business model that is able to: 
Explain Epic's business model
or
explain to me how Steam's business model is any more consumer / developer friendly
The Epic-Bad-Give-Me-Steam-Awards reviews are pretty exhausting to sift through.""

I agree.

Now, keep in mind I don't have a preference.
as a ""power user"" I use both platforms (Steam and Epic) all the time.
I think both leave much to be desired.
but I think most people (including myself I don't want to sound pompous) lack a really deep understanding of fullstack game development.

There are more moving parts than we will ever know, and as a simple player:
I don't think a single button press is too much to ask."
22178,Now requires an Epic Games account. Then I will probably never be able to play it again. Thanks Epic Games
22179,"EPIC GAMES enforced, total bull*****"
22180,I love falling through hoops to log in to play a game
22181,Game forces you to create an Epic Games account with a recent update.
22182,"Epic games account required now, plus the game isn't that good. There's not enough variety in maps and modes, and some of them are either too easy or just unfun or unskillful. It's overpriced, its not worth more than $5-10. Check out Pummel Party instead for a good party game to play with friends."
22183,ssssssssssssss
22184,"I absolutely loved the game. Was a nice side-game to play with friends when we got tired of serious ones. Yesterday, I logged in to see that now, you need to have an Epic Game Store account to log in. I know the game was published by Epic, but having no choice to create an EGS account on Steam to play the game ? F*ck off."
22185,its good man thats just how it is
22186,"At launch this game worked great and was fun! After having not played for a while, turns out they sold the game to Epic, who then forces everything on their server. I'm literally unable to play this game now."
22187,"Why do I need to have epic games launcher to play this game....all my progress was gone, they made a dead game even more dead"
22188,"Was great fun until Epic took over, they're ruining this just like they did with Rocket League. I don't want to link Epic and Steam to allow you to use all of my Steam data."
22189,Requires an Epic account to play.
22190,"Don't bother buying this game on Steam. As of one of the most recent updates, you'll be required to sign in with an Epic Games Store account, if you want to get even as far as the title screen so you might as well either buy it on Epic or not buy it at all."
22191,This game is slowly but surely sucking the life out of me.
22192,fall guy
22193,it's okay.
22194,"Its not easy, but a fun, very different take on a game"
22195,"its fun
"
22196,"-rep
-epic"
22197,"Forcing me to make an Epic account is the last straw. Jeez.
Disgusting. Of course we aren't allowed a choice, or a refund.
Fun enough game, but not even close to fun enough to require me to connect to Epic."
22198,Great entertainment .
22199,"sucks that you have to now link EG account to play...otherwise, I love Fall Guys"
22200,You need an epic games account to play now lol not for me thx
22201,Trying everything to avoid epic and now they want me to create an epic account to play the game i bought on steam?! really?!
22202,"[h1] ADORABLE [/h1]
if you are having a bad day then play this game"
22203,Why do i suddenly need an Epic account? Uninstalling sounds like the best option here.
22204,Very fun game! Perfect for group playing.
22205,spadający kolesie

22207,Why do I need an Epic account to play a game I have on Steam?

+ epic is shit"
22210,"[h1] Pretty fun but Required Epic Games Store [/h1]
They're forcing you to make an Epic Games account to play This is a mandatory change that will make the game unplayable for me. I use Steam *specifically* 
"
22211,"This game can suck it!

"
22212,Cute game :D
22213,Awsm
22214,need epic games account so I guess it's officially dead. time to uninstall
22215,For real? Forced to use EPIC? No thanks.
22216,very fun game
22217,NICE
22218,"I would have recommended it but not anymore. I got this game on steam when you didn't need an epic games account, changing your requirements for a game is never okay. Having made this change, I cannot recommend this game due to a decision made by some corporate stooges inhibiting some peoples enjoyment of it. I sincerely hope they revert this decision."
22219,rage quits but its fun
22220,Took them 3 years to add a cart to the epic game store but they managed to kill fallguys in 1 month.  a shame honestly this game is pretty cute and fun
22221,Cool game bros
22222,THIS IS A REALLY GOOD GAME BTW SEASON 6 IS HERE
22223,"Funny game, but if you want to be good, you must be f*cking as*hole."
22224,"link epic account?
uninstall"
22225,Pog
22226,From now on game requires linking with the Epic store account. It's disgusting way of promoting the Epic platform and getting more user data. Wish they would change it back some day :c
22227,dope!!
22228,GREAT FUN if you love to bounce around and be crazy
22229,i cant play this game anymore because i live on iran and epic don't support this bullshit country..i cant even refund...i hate u and i never ever buy any game form this company
22230,"Overrated!! The match making time at the beggining is way too long , and you have to wait forever for the match to begin . Its not a easy game and its very competitive , try other games instead of this.

22232,why do i need the ebin launcher to play a game i purchased on steam?????
22233,"10/10

22234,very good game!!!!
22235,"I really enjoyed this game, then out of the blue Epic bought it and is trying to force me into creating an account on their platform.

I won't, so that was money well spent, then thrown out the window by a greedy company whose sole purpose is to artificially grow its playerbase by forcing them to log in into an unnecessary thir party platform.

Fall guys is now joining Rocket League on the list of games that were good fun, then unplayable.

Thank you Epic."
22236,it now requires an epic games account to play
22237,"crashe all the time

22238,"Cartoon wipeout, hilarious and fun to play with friends or just family members of all ages. 10/10"

22244,funny bean go first place feel serotonin rush
22245,"Forcing you to create an Epic Games account to play a game you already bought with no option to opt out is extremely anti consumer and should be illegal. If i didnt need an Epic Games account to buy the game before i shouldnt need one to play now, this is just fraud at this point."
22246,OP
22247,it's a fun time with no toxicity. i suck and i don't feel bad about it.
22248,is nice
22249,This game sucks
22250,"If I wanted to create an epic games account, I would have done already... It's one thing to make creating an account optional if you want to save your progress across platforms or change your name in game, but don't make it a requirement just to play the game. They really must need an influx of accounts or something.

It was fun while it lasted. I'll come back if they make the account thing optional."
22251,sold to epic you fucking scags
22252,Epic
22253,F**k Epic
22254,"Was pretty fun in the first months it launched we played it a lot. Now I play maybe a time or two every couple months waiting for content. I decided to try it out today since it seems like it has some content I hadn't played and it FORCE INSTALLS EPIC GAMES. Now, had it given me a notice or asked permission to install, that would be one thing. But I boot up a game that i've played hundreds of times to have them install third party software on my computer that I've been going out of my way to avoid for years. Today marks the day I never play this game again. Thanks for forcing me to use a restore point on my computer. Really appreciate it."
22255,"now I need a epic account?, but I'm on STEAM?! 
no thanks, the game was fun while it lasted"
22256,I loved this game so much. everything about it was perfect BUT THEN THEY INTRODUCED EPIC GAMES INTO THE GAME AND OH BOY WHO TF WANTS TO BE GREETED WITH THAT. The whole point of a good game is to not have bs like this. Worst decision yet by the developers. Ever since then I have held a certain type of hatred towards this game.
22257,this game is really fun and gives off mario cart vibes but with jelly beans lol and their are obstacles and it can be fun
22258,"Great party game, not too difficult to get the hang of, but quite hard to master, super fun when you need a laugh"
22259,Epic Games? Nah.
22260,i get this game in very cheap around 3$ so for me its tottaly worthy to play and if it cost to around 10$ it still worthy buy it and play
22261,Verry funny
22262,completely craps out my high end pc and has corrupted save files elsewhere when i've tried to open anything else after it crashing.  Unplayable
22263,"need epic account apparently, never playing again"
22264,Very nice
22265,"GAME WAS FUN UNTIL I GOT FORCED TO GET EPIC ACCOUNT, WHILE PLAYING THROW STEAM U FUCKING DIPSHITS"
22266,This game was fun to play casually but now I need to create an Epic games account to even play it. Nice job ruining this game Epic!

The game is still fun even if people think it's dead. Buy the game if it's on sale uwu

22295,Newest update forces You to create Epic account and insalls Epic Launcher. I didn't accept new EULA and I'm trying to get refunded.

22300,"Very enjoyable (but sometimes infuriating!) battle royale game combining classic platformers and adding a competitive element to it. The game had been improved greatly in my opinion with the addition of squad mode so it isn't all just PvP but also some cooperative play too :). Only downsides to this game might be the very high skill cap of this game due to 'win grinding' by top players mixing in with new players, plus 'team' rounds in the single player modes. Adding competitive, as well as casual mode, will give new players much more chance of winning games and not being put off to a large degree. Keep up the good work Mediatonic! Game design really takes a lot longer than most realise and I respect the work you put into each and every update to balance player satisfaction and round/show quality."

22331,"fun and friendly
"
22332,"Welp, I think this is the end now. I decided not to use the Epic Games Store because I really dislike their business practices and how they basically try force exclusivity for the sake of further monetization, and I also stopped using their store because of the fact that they banned my account and tagged it as a bot just for buying more than 4 games at once, as the store didn't have a built-in cart and buying more than 3 games in a row tagged you as dangerous. But now, Fall Guys just became unplayable to me as you are now forced to use an Epic Games Account in order to even play for a game I already paid for, just because Epic Games and their terrible business practices decided to dumb a bunch of money into the game."

22338,Was pretty good till Epic tainted it. And I don't support epic nor their anti-consumer business model so guess its another one in the pile.
22339,gud game
22340,really fun!!!
22341,"Extremely fun. I was hesitant about buying the game because I heard it was ""death"". False, it's worth the money and I don't get tired of playing it. The game is super alive and I hope it grows more and more, even if I never get all the achievements (many seem a bit impossible lol)."
22342,Trash

22347,Uses Epic game services LUL why am I even on steam then?
22348,i like the wombat
22349,"I truly did love this game when it first came out. Was really excited for it when it was shown off in devolver digital's e3 video, bought it day 1. While it had a bit of a rocky start, I had fun playing the game. Talked some friends into getting it too, and while one of them never even won a single crown, for a time we had a blast playing it.

But then the hacker wave hit, player names were removed, and over time all my friends stopped playing the game. I guess I stopped playing too when they left. But still, the game had a spot in my heart, and I always intended on going back someday.

Then Epic bought the devs. I knew from that point on I never would return to the game. It was only a matter of time until Fallguys required an epic account, the same thing happened with rocket league back in the day. I truly despise epic at this point, every scummy business practice, every broken promise, almost every single action they take justifies my dislike of them. Unless you don't care about epic, or you for some reason actually like them, stay away. Don't waste your money on this game. It is and always will be infected by epic now."
22350,Great game to just get stoned and vibe to.

Season 1-5 were great, but ever since the release of Season 6 they've put up a barrier, making it impossible to play the game if you don't link an Epic Games account. I did not pay to have my access be revoked like that.

You can hate or love EPIC, but the point remains that this change and additional requirement is just 'not done'. I've bought Fall Guys on 'Steam', and not on EPIC. For that reason... I'm not recommending this game."

22357,"Great game!
And then thin ice came out.
And then Lost temple came out.
And then they updated the game, falsely accuse me having missing files (wrong error message). Problem fixed few days later magically after I wasted time trying all the solutions available online. Meanwhile my squad mates are experiencing completely different bugs and it's more troubling with the epic account.

More game content but quality of life is dropping way too low I cannot recommend this game.

Okay fixed now thumb up.

Won't start, fps drops, bugs like ""missing files"".
Also, for some reason it is required to connect to a Epic Games Account now.

WTF.

Devs are not responding in the forums.

Will delete this review when it's fixed."
22372,An Epic Games account is now mandatory to play this game. I've played Fall Guys on and off since launch and am now locked out of it if I don't download and connect it with Epic. Ridiculous.
22373,Easy to play addictive game!
22374,Fall guys was a fun game to play every so often with friends but since you now require an epic account just to play the game even through steam I won't be playing it anymore.
22375,it is so fun
22376,a casual and fun battle royale
22377,"I just want to click play and play...have fun...on my Steam account...when i bought this game I bought it on Steam now shows up epic games and pushes for attention like ""hey hey hey I'm here cmon hey hey freeee games you want some? no?hey now I own this game and you have to come to my house to play it and maaaybe you're gonna like it here and would like to stay for more .. wanna be friends?...let's be friends bro please!!!""
all those marketing moves is just a waste of time...epic games you below the level to compete with Steam especially
with moves like these ...
P.s top search in google when you type ""why epic games ""
it gives ""why epic games is bad""
Today I was in mood to play Fall Guys but thanks to epic games game doesn't even load ..."
22378,The fact that I need an epic games account now sickens me.

Good: Its fun. I have never faced a real bug in this game.

Bad: Its reapeating, you get bored fast and it takes a long time to get into a match.

overall: This game is fun but gets boring really fast. I would give it a 6 out of 10. Buy it if its on 50% sale."

22426,after new update its bad. not even bc of epic its just unplayable even after doing all epic game stuff. too lag and i would keep respawn at checkpoint when i didnt even fall

22433,"Launch game through steam

""Please sign in""

STOP DOING THIS"
22434,"As a veteran player, I'm disgusted at the direction the game is going.

Crowns don't matter anymore, you can't grind crowns for future costumes, since they're now gated behind $$.

Before the update, you could purchase the game once, and could actively grind enough crowns to buy everything the shop had to offer without spending a penny.

After the update, crowns don't matter anymore since everything was converted to Kudos, this F2P currency doesn't give access to the nice looking costumes that $$ can buy.

It saddens me though, since I have fond memories of playing this game, it's just sad how after Epic Games acquired MT, you could tell it was the beginning of the end."
22435,"Game was a lot of fun, then Epic got involved. Since that happened, all kinds of connection issues, pointers in the middle of the screen and problems finding lobbies. Thanks Tim"
22436,You now need a epic games account to play it
22437,Think twice now that it requires Epic to function. This used to be my favorite game until Tencent Tim and the Chinese Communist Party ruined it. I gave a good crack at it for the past week despite Winnie the Pooh now being privy to my crown rank but I tried to boot it up today and it won't even load. Worked that error back to an issue with Epic Games Launcher online services being down. Fantastic.
22438,Since the last update game no longer opens. Epic integration ruined the game.
22439,fun
22440,Its fun
22441,loved this game for a very long time before they added epic launcher to it
22442,"It's a fun casual game for the whole family that has colorful and simple art style with a nice soundtrack.

Now for the bad, it seems they have recently (according to a bunch of other reviews and the Season 6 announcement) required an Epic account and linking to it, I say according to other stuff because I myself have not been able to actually GET INTO the game, likely because I do not have the Epic Launcher installed, now since it is forcing this into the players and outright not being able to work or launch without it, I will have to not recommend this.

Funny thing is if you terminate the 'Epic Services Host program' in task manager when you launch Fall guys (provided you went through the non first first time launch which installed it) the game finally does start, only to prompt you that you're missing files and then you click a button to exit the game (the only thing you CAN do)


Overall, fun casual experience if only they hadn't made it mandatory to use an epic account and (by my assumption and experience) making you have the epic launcher installed otherwise the game won't even launch or when it does it tells you you're missing files. Disgusting."
22443,"The latest update broke this game, it won't even launch. It shouldn't force you to use Epic Games tasks. It's complete BS. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it until the issues are fixed.

Edit: Epic buying this was the worst mistake ever made."
22444,fun game!
22445,"super fun no toxic people
"
22446,Haha Fall Gus
22447,"when I launch the game nothing happens. in Task Manager the only thing that shows up is epic launcher (which I don't want) after a few minutes I click ""end task"" and only then the game launches, which then tells me files are missing and I can't play.  I'd request a technical help, but when the problem is the DRM fuck that.
TL;DR: I can't run the game with the the epic launcher active, and when it's not it closes."

22454,very good very nice
22455,"For me, this is the best party game ever with plenty of maps, challenges, events and character costumes that add charm to the game. If you are afraid that the current maps will become repetitive, then you do not have to worry  because there are changing obstacles in almost every game (it doesn't change the map drastically, but it adds some little obstacles, such as rotating hammers in some exact places) and game is still updated with new content and seasons with new maps or modes."

22465,"-Really fun game to play with friends or just pass the time
-New levels get added sometimes, not very frequent but at least they're trying
-Not dead yet, I can always find a game. I don't know if it's because of bots or if there really is always people playing. Doesn't matter to me anyways, still fun
- Epic inclussion was annoying
-Fun game to not take seriously, just have a good time"
22466,"The game itself would be fun (at least it is on PlayStation), but the implementation on PC is a dumpster fire.
- First of all the game doesn't start if the ""nice"" Epic Games Launcher is not installed, not a proper warning message on this. Also I don't really want to install that piece of software if it's possible.
- Cross-play with PS players is a touted feature of the game, although I can only invite friends from my Steam friend list. That was the main reason that I've bought the game, so this is the biggest disappointment.
- Found no info on how cross-play progression could be even enabled."
22467,Jelly bean obstacle adventures ensue in this fun filled game! Bounce off your fellow jelly bean body competitors  whilst fighting your way to the finish line! Different puzzles and challenges always keep you on your toes! This game is a blast to play with friends or on your own! :)
22468,"This game is very good! It has a lot of ups and downs, like being incredibly frustrating, but still, a very fun time, And it has a big upside which is that this game is very good even if you don’t have any friends (which I don’t) and it uses a lot of concepts that I love, like races in obstacle courses, survival minigames and more, that’s why I have 1,125 hours (for now) in this game. If you’re a good sport than I recommend this game, but if you have a short temper, you might still have a fun time but I wouldn’t recommend it, trust me, it is VERY FRUSTRATING! But still an 8/10 game!"

22484,"It was a great funny game, but since you have to link your Steam account with EPIC it sucks.
I dont reccomend to even play this game until EPIC take hands off this game."
22485,"It's a good and calming game.
"
22486,"This game is charming, and competitive. It is pretty tricky for the younger generation to pick up and can be frustrating. BUT the game has a fun and spirited art design. The level design is vast filled with colorful and new obstacles that will surely make you want to return to the game. I've played this game for about 20 hours now and I find myself playing for about 10 rounds each time I sit to play. However, if you're a hardcore gamer then there are other games based on the ""last man standing"" that you may find yourself drawn to more. I would rate this 85/100 or 3.5/5."
22487,Sh*t epic doing it again...
22488,Yay....Epic
22489,"If I bought Fall Guys on Steam I don't want to have to log in with an Epic account to play it ...
Uninstalled."
22490,Its good
22491,"After the last update, the game stopped running through Steam due to «missing files». Not reinstalling, not checking the integrity will not fix the problem. Some fix instructions suggest installing the game through the Epic Launcher, so if you want to buy game on Steam, so as not to mess with the Epic's software — don't buy it, it doesn't work."
22492,very positive game i recommend it
22493,"I wouldn't have cared if an Epic games account had been required form the start (granted, it might have influenced purchasing decisions), but to require it after game release without a grandfather clause is borderline unethical.
(Angry old-timer alert) This is the kind of thing that game licensing as opposed to outright purchase gets us.(/Angry old-timer alert)"
22494,"The game is great with your friends or without, the graphics are cool, never seen many bugs.
Also you can win or buy lots of clothes which makes it a lot funnier :)
Just turns a little boring if you play for a long time, i would recommend!!


A pity that you have to login with epic..."

22525,Funny at first. But it gets boring real fast once you get to see all maps.
22526,forcing the link to epic games is unacceptable !
22527,"The game is entertaining and good for some mindless fun, the reason for why I can't recommend it is because of the recent changes done where you're forced to use an Epic Store acc to play the game, meaning that some people that bought the game here in steam may be forced to buy it again in the Epic Store to play it, a really shitty move, and not something I'm amused by, as it stands currently, I can't recommend getting this game."
22528,"An amazing and hilarious game that is no longer possible to play without creating an Epic Games account and linking it to your Steam.

F*ck Epic Games. Uninstalled."
22529,"It's a great game, but I didn't pay for it only to have to then be forced to sign in with Epic Games after the fact. I enjoy it, but not enough to sign up with Epic games and their shifty business model. I'll log in again once they make the Epic Games login optional."
22530,Squid Games for kids

22535,
22536,Super fun game. Most recent update is forcing you to make an Epic Games Account to play the game. Cannot recommend the game in it's current state.
22537,"I know the hype around this game has long gone, but I for one still love being a little jelly bean that tumbles it's way through obstacles. 

My two complaints are that it is very difficult to play this game with a keyboard (I synced up a controller to my PC and it made the game a thousand times more enjoyable) and it tends to cycle through the same maps over and over again."
22538,very similar to among us in looks great 3d game for 5 and up
22539,"fuck epic, i hope they choke on money. they make the world a worse place with their greed."

22541,Good
22542,"Very fun and competitive, i like it very much"
22543,Requires a credit card or SSN to play? GFY.
22544,"Used to be a fun and enjoyable game to play with friends upon release, we had a ton of fun until the later updates came around that made the community more toxic in-game (grabbing other players/you being grabbed, grindy events, etc.) 
But now with the new season update they force you to make an Epic games account just to play for cross-play and other content? What a joke... I used to enjoy playing this game but now I feel that won't ever be the same, the bugs have still been in the game since launch and the Devs haven't listened to the community for better changes. I really pray for this game's longevity should they revert this decision.
Edit: Also if a game forces you to use a third-party service that makes you go to unknown external websites and have to agree to another end user license agreement (EULA), this already breaches your current terms of service through Steam and before this update happened. Mediatonic should be ashamed for trying to do this to their player base on Steam without explaining these changes.."
22545,"Game requires an epic account now,its just a scam now. Stay far away from this."
22546,"fall men become friend with among sussy person, best friend forever lol."
22547,"At its core, it's a pretty fun game that is very enjoyable to play. The problem is that (although it says it's random) it just gives you the exact same games over and over and over and over and over and over again. Sometimes I want to do something new"

22549,"It was a good game but everything changed when the Epic nation attacked.

Big no now that Fall Guys requires epic"
22550,Booted up the game I had for a while. Suddenly require linking to a epic account. No thanks.
22551,the game is very fun.you idiots complain about epic games i personly like epic games its just as same as every launcher i have assassins creed valhalla it work just as well as steam game good
22552,"I used to love Fall Guys. Got it pretty soon after it came out and played it for a month or two, then didn't play again. I was looking for a game I could play kind of mindlessly, but was still fun, so I went to redownload fall guys. Unfortunately, after I launchd it, I learned that it's not possible to play the game now without an epic games account. Well, alright. Guess I'm not playing the game anymore. Too bad I'm outside my refund window, I refuse to support a developer that forces you to use a service essentially run by the CCP. Incredibly unfortunate."
22553,"I would recommend the game, but not in its current state. It's a really fun game, but there hasnt been a content update in 7 months at the time of writing. If you dont care about winning, then maybe its for you. Seems like MT has thrown its current player base to the wolves as they spend all their time on F2P. No. Mediatonic doesn't care about its players - it has bugs since launch still in the game. They dont add any new finals, the game is always broken. The sound never works in half the levels (been going on for what, a year now?) They never fix anything and when they ask for community input - they ignore it. The only people who deserve praise is the art team. Other than that - try it when it goes F2P, but dont expect a ton. Hopefully they fix the issues plaguing their game and communicate. The new season brings hope, and for the games sake, i hope it thrives.


UPDATE: Game still shit - don't play"
22554,"It could have been a great party game. But its design decisions has been getting worse and worse. Daily challenges promotes unfriendly actions (grabbing other players), and your gaming experience completely depends on if others wants to play nice or not. It can be super frustrating, and toxic. I got this game for my GF as well, hoping to have some fun time together, but instead more often I wanted to delete the game from her account because she got agitated so bad by unfriendly players and lack of rewards
New season launch was super rough, EPIC service causes nothing but problems. Account content transfer, server connectivity problem, overly grindy event (YES, THE ALOY EVENT). So far the experience is very shitty due to EPIC service.

Edit: dont play before going to bed. Unless you are really that good, otherwise you will very likely to be extremely frustrated and ruin your sleep.

Edit 2: Steam keep asking me if I would like to redo my review, so here it is: Still sucks. Had a bit of fun with Sweet Thieves, but it got ruined by all the AFK assholes.
Also, for some weird reason, a computer that used to be able to run the game with ease, suddenly struggles with the RAM and GPU requirement. Even my 1060 4GB VRAM 16GB RAM unit runs the game more labored than Starbound... What the hell did you shove in the game? how much computation is offloaded to the clients?"
22555,noice
22556,"Same great game, just had to link to epic launcher, no small problem, haven't had to use epic launcher since. Still been well worth the money I paid for the game."
22557,"Uninstalled the game, it was fun while it lasted. When you download the latest update and boot the game, it prompts you to download all sorts of additional software by EPIC Games. The game worked fine before, but now it won't even boot if you don't have their crap software installed. There's no reason they needed to do this. Oh, not a surprise, but now you also need an additional Epic account now to play. Yeah, I deleted this rancid software and won't be playing it again."
22558,good
22559,Game had great potential. Then the dev team sold out to Epic and it has been going downhill ever since. Such a shame.
22560,This is the only game I've ever refunded and I have a lot of shovelware in my library.
22561,"Bought on Steam. Now you need an Epic account to play. It wasn't possible to get a refund because I had more than 2 hours of gameplay.

If you still have under 2 hours of gameplay, I recommend asking for a refund."
22562,"if I wanted to play a game in the Epic Games store 

I would buy it in the Epic Games store.


I WOULDN'T BUY IT ON STEAM!"
22563,The game was great until Epic accounts were made mandatory. Now the game won't even let me connect to the servers.
22564,fat guy go bing boom bop
22565,Dont like Epic Store
22566,"Would rate it highly for the derpy entertainment that the game (and mainly snowball survival mode) have given me since it came out

if it, you know, consistently worked anymore... (hooray Epic!)

thanks for selling out very cool :D"
22567,Fuck EPIC GAMES!
22568,Why i suddenly need another launcher to play this game?
22569,Epic Games go home
22570,huh
22571,pretty gamering and epic
22572,"At the beginning pretty fun, but after a while it get's boring :/"
22573,PADASHTI HORA
22574,Good
22575,"fun enough game, but the latest update requires linking an epic games account to even be able to play. i don't have an epic games account and i don't want to have to create yet another account for yet another service that i don't even use, especially since it has been playable without an epic games account up until this point."
22576,"Boring, and now you had to link an epic account"
22577,"I REALLY ENJOY THE GAME . 
IT IS SO FUN. 
AND ITS BG MUSIC IS  SO SATISFYING"

22583,"imagine buying a game on steam that requires you to sign up to the very company (epic) that tries to destroy steam and kill pc gaming in general. can't even refund now. don't buy, don't support evil!"
22584,Recently requires Epic Games to login. Can't recommend this.
22585,"Somehow my connection doesn't act up even once while playing, even though I'm using the Europe server whilst based in Indonesia. I can't even notice any lag/latency issue. Quite a testament to how good the dev team has built and maintained its multiplayer servers. As for gameplay, it's pretty much the same as what I've expected. Quite an enjoyable experience overall"
22586,Noice Game
22587,"It was fun while it lasted, another game adding an unnecessary login, defeating the purpose of simplicity with steam. 

"
22588,good game
22589,"The game did bring a lot of fun and challenges throughout the last 5 challenges: New skins, daily missions, party modes and more. There were a few glitches here and there regarding the gameplay and audio but it wasn't that bothersome.

However what is bothersome is the new Epic Games implication as in you need to log in twice and force yourself to create an Epic account in order to play the game. I think you all know how I feel about the EGS launcher as well as everyone else. The cross-platforming was already fine as it is and it's disappointing on Metatonic changing that formula to make the game nearly unplayable.

If you want to get the game regardless of the Epic Games situation, that's up to you. Though you probably will have a limited time to do that when the game eventually gets pulled from the Steam Store and turned into a EGS exclusive F2P, just like what Rocket League went through. (5/16/22 update: Well look at that, twas called but doesn't ease the pain.)

It's a shame that the game went from promising race to the crown to a monopolized elimination."
22590,"Very fun game, it makes it really fun prime gaming. THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS!"
22591,"this is a fun game. buy it now or you are going to miss out on the fun.
-races 
-survival
games"
22592,"Epic Game account is required.
I realized that some Epic Games Online Services was installed on my computer which I never installed nor was I given a warning that it will install. This practice of installing software on my PC without my consent is disgusting.

They should have given us a warning and ask for our permission to install such garbage on our computers, especially since this game originally worked just fine without it.

I uninstalled the service, game still works, but seriously, this should not be a thing. Steam, fix this, you are in charge of security and this by some can be considered a vulnerability; unknowingly installing programs on your clients PC.

EDIT:

So apparently with every launch of the game, this Epic Games Online Service keeps re-installing itself, therefore I just uninstalled the game. I can't be bothered anymore. Perhaps if they would have rolled this out friendlier, I would not have cared as much."
22593,"Well, I have to agree with the current sentiment - this is not a good move and not fair to all previous customers who had no chance to agree to this before buying the game.
The Epic Games account really should be optional and only necessary if you'd want crossplay at best and at worst optional for previous players and necessary only for future customers (if it's clearly mentioned on the store page - which it now is).

At this point however I'd advice anyone who wants to play this game to maybe just wait a bit until it becomes free to play on Epic Store (which I don't have an issue with, if the game gets to the Epic Store it's obviously ok to have an Epic account there - but it should not be necessary for Steam users to even start the game).

I think it's bad when Ubisoft does it, I think it's bad when EA does it, I think it's bad when Microsoft/Xbox does it and I think it's bad when Epic does it.

👎"
22594,FUCK EPIC GAMES
22595,"Forces you to install epic games store.
ugh.

22605,"I didn't need an Epic Games account before, I won't be making one now."
22606,"I barely gave this game a chance during release but now I'm having a blast playing it. Feels like team matches rarely happen compared to release which makes me extremely happy. Controls are very simple. art style is very beautiful, great music, and very great modes to experience. This is a game I can sit down and enjoy at anytime to just relax and play. Only personal problem is how many skins have come and gone where base skins don't look as good."

22612,epic game
22613,I am a professional fall guys player and I can say with confidence that you should buy this game on the playstation5 and on steam. it is very good and has sonic the hedgehog which makes it even better. Quite a masterpiece of a game and I shall give it an 11/10 and hope to see Fall guys 2
22614,shame on epic games account requirement
22615,Feels like a bait and switch
22616,fun
22617,Don't buy this game. They force you to download Epic launcher and use Epic account to play. They even force you to use Epic game username.
22618,"during the match making you have to wait 4 or 5 even some time i wait for 10  minutes 
thats why this is the worst game that i have play ever"

Now you are forced to use an Epic account, suitable for no one. Do not buy this game in it's current state. Go play Crab game on Steam instead."
22627,If Epic could stop ruining games or let me get a refund when they do so that would be great.
22628,Was fun when it was easy to hop in and check out every couple weeks. Feels weird that I need to create an epic account to play a game I got off steam
22629,This game doesn't even work anymore. It now requires an Epic Account which I do not have or support. Steam will not refund despite the game being updated to be non-functional and me having less than 2 hours of play time.

22631,"Let me tell you what I think about sharking third party launchers on top of something I already purchased. The only reason I am not taking this to court is because I dont have the money to fight Gaben. I seethe, I'm coping pretty hard over this based on principle. what other games would I want to purchase that will do the same thing? Can i trust any company with my money now? It's a breach of trust and I do not like the streams crossing like this. I avoid Epic because I already have my phone number in the listings of about thirty Chinese burner companies and I would rather my debit card not be associated with Xi ping and his commie regime. Absolutely unacceptable. Blacklisted and blocked."
22632,Shame. :(
22633,JUMPING BEANS IN MY MOUTH
22634,"This is such a shame. I absolutely LOVED this game awhile ago. But now, they are making us sign into epic games. Why not make it a exclusive to epic at this point? Why make steam users use epic instead of, you know, STEAM????????? I am really sad, if this didn't happen I would recommend this game."
22635,very hard hehe
22636,Ya corny asf if you think I am gonna log into an Epic Games account to play this game. LOL. Good way to lose players tho gg.

Now, if you purchase it on Steam, you need to create an account on the Tencent/ Epic Games Store.

I don't think that is fair."

22648,"Another decent game forced into obsolescence by Tim Swiney and the shady business practices of Epic Games.  Regardless of who is at fault, changing the terms of access after purchase sets a terrible precedent, and creates an environment that feels way too much like dealing with an insurance company than buying a video game.  0/10 for wasted time and potential."
22649,Suddenly forces login to Epic? I guess that means uninstall time.
22650,shart
22651,"The hype train for Fall Guys took off as quickly as it came, but those who never left have been generously rewarded. With the support of current franchise owner Epic Games, the humble team at Mediatonic have continued listening to their loyal fandom and have consistently delivered fresh and fun new content, and overall improvements in gameplay.

They have delayed the development of the Switch and Xbox versions to improve on cross platform compatibility, and while it's still not perfect, the sixth season does offer one significant new feature: synchronized progression, thanks to integration with your Epic Games account. If like me you had sunk a lot of time into the PlayStation version, launched as the most downloaded free PS+ title of all time, this will provide incentive to buy the PC version and take all your saved up fame, crowns, kudos and costumes with you between platforms. Unfortunately you're still not able to create proper parties that are cross platform beyond custom lobbies, where progression cannot be achieved, but you'll finally have a good reason to play with your Steam friends.

The PC version could still benefit from more compatibility with older hardware and peripherals, lower resolutions and all that, but at the lowest settings it provides currently, most PCs that lag behind should at least get a playable framerate between 15 and 30 FPS.

If you've enjoyed any previous Fall Guys season before, season 6 brings you more or less the same experience as always. There are fun, new gimmicks on levels, but I'm hoping down the line there will be different kinds of levels beyond races, team challenges and whatever else they got now. They've been teasing a new game mode coming in the near future called ""Invisibeans"", but what that'll be like remains to be seen.

Overall, Fall Guys remains a bastion of gameplay that is cute, quirky, competitive, and fun for all ages, and still just as much fun to play on your own or with friends. Perhaps even more fun on PC, where griefers are surprisingly less present than on PlayStation. With the inevitable Steam winter sale on its way, you might want to pick this up. If you're a friend of mine and you haven't got it yet, I'd love to play with you!"
22652,"Game was alright, but with an Epic Games partnership, this brings it down to the lowest quality and shows that the devs only care about money."
22653,"The devs sold out to Epic Games and it now requires an Epic account to play.

Dead game"
22654,Epic games account is required to play
22655,AWESOME
22656,"Step 1: install the game
Step 2: Start a game
Step 3: lose the game
Step 4: uninstall the game
Step 5: repeat step 1
Step 6: asking for the meaning of life"
22657,"Requires Epic Games account now. Whats the point of buying something on Steam if I now need another account to play. Changing a product to require additional registration and agreements after people already bought it under a different agreement is a cancer of the video game industry and borderline fraud, much like removing features and support after release to get people to buy the next title in the franchise. It should immediately give buyers the option to refund their purchase if a games has new launch/play requirements. Valve needs to make a statement here.
Also, there needs to be class action lawsuits about this against all publishers that do this sort of thing. It started with Ubisoft and EA and now almost all of them do it. This is what makes me want to go back to pirating games."
22658,one of the coolest games ever to play with ur friends ! highly recommended :)
22659,bean game

22661,Suddenly requires an Epic Games account. Shame. Uninstalled.
22662,hi

If I wanted your launcher or an account with you, I'd install it."
22664,"Requires an epic games account to play, I refuse to support a company with such blatant anti-consumer practices."
22665,Timmy go brrr...
22666,...
22667,"The game itself was fun, I would usually just keep it running in the background, and quickly jump in and play a few games when procrastinating, somewhat reminds me of Mario party mini games but in a battle royale format.

However now you're required to deal with the epic games launcher and it's mandatory to make an account with them despite owning the game ON STEAM, I'm personally not going to bother with another launchers software and giving over more data just for one singular game, it's tedious, it's annoying, and it wasn't a requirement when I originally purchased the game, to make it requirement after you have my money and after I can no longer refund, shows a lack of loyalty towards the player base."
22668,"Was fun, but now I am forced to link multiple accounts to play the game, have to sign into nintendo, then have to sign into epic games, etc. Why do companies do this for a game we can't even use chat for? Uninstalled immediately, I don't know how many more accounts I have to link to the game before I can actually play it."
22669,Now need an epic account to even play.... No option at all to play without one 🥴
22670,"Epic has ruined Rocket League and now it is Fall Guys's turn. The game was fun, but its dead to me now."
22671,"Epic bad but unironically.

Edit 2022-05-16: Looks like this has become even more true - despite claiming the game would not be pulled from steam when Epic bought Mediatonic, the game is now being pulled from steam when it goes F2P in June."
22672,Nick why did you gift me this?
22673,If you have a good pc/laptop i would recommend it if not I wouldn't recommend it for me it lags alot kinda playable but still lag's But i really love this game overall its fun to me its the best game also https://imgflip.com/i/6ey3u4 also here is the shrek movie https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841824588173279252/970798240578564156/shrek_1.webm
22674,lol
22675,"Was a pretty decent and fun game if not repetitive and plagued with cheaters/hackers. I had recommended it to friends in the past, but now that this game (and the company) was bought out by Epic Games Store and is forcing people to link an Epic account just to play, I wont touch this game ever again. Epic is also adding microtransactions. 

So thanks again for ruining another fun game, Epic!"
22676,"kinda sucks that you need an epic account now. i do love the game. but with the new season the game also gets stuck sometimes, it lags or it chrashes. or sometimes the tilting things in the level get stuck. but besides all that its a good and fun game. i do like the random button now with the outfits. and the fact that i can pick my own name."
22677,good game my dudes  :[]
22678,i like epic games they give me free games and if i want a funny username i can be original c:
22679,"Thought about coming back, but then I saw they got bought out by an inferior company. GGs"
22680,Fun
22681,After selling out to Epic the devs have proven that the customers/players don't matter. Honestly can't recommend this to anyone.
22682,Prepare yourself to lose 95% of time.
22683,it's a great game
22684,Thanks Epic...
22685,"Requires an EGS account now
Such a shame what happened"

22687,Fuck Epic Games
22688,"Cursor stuck on screen is really distracting, forced Epic sign up, poor season 6 content. I think this will end my Fall Guys play time. The game was always a glitchy mess but we forgave it coz it was kinda fun n goofy. I'm over letting it slide, fix your game.

Fix for cursor issue: When the game starts and the screen with ""start"" written on it appears, move your cursor to the top right quarter. Here a little white ""X"" will appear during loading after you have pressed any button to continue. Click this ""X"" , it will return you to the start menu abandoning the load. Some claim doing this once will fix, I repeated 3 times to be sure, but it did fix the issue."
22689,Dead game but good game 7/10
22690,Epic Games Sellout

22694,now requires a fortnite account to play
22695,"i don't even dislike epic the way a lot of others do, but i bought this game on steam so i could play it on steam, not with the added condition of having to create a separate epic account just to play. it's deceitful and unfair."
22696,"it fun
"
22697,Impossible to play now since it requires an Epic Games account which I won’t have ever.
22698,Such a funny game xD without any bugs
22699,The multiplayer that you used to be able to play just fine now requires you to have an epic games account.
22700,"Oh look, another game I paid for but can no longer play."
22701,They took away my random generated name ....
22702,"I bought this for my kid on Steam. So why am I being prompted to create an Epic Games account??? Screw this, that's some shady sh*t. Uninstalling."
22703,"turkey simulator, everyone falls off while one person gets the crown"
22704,"What a disappointment this turned out to be, the devs are sellouts. Sold their souls to the Epic Corporation for a cash injection. They’re going to ruin this game even more now, why didn’t you guys look at Rocket League? Did the devs not think they were going to butcher your game too? 

Would refund if I could. I bought this game when it first came out, sneaky move on the devs part."
22705,"Fun 3d platformer with campy physics.   Over 50 levels now give a lot of replayability.

Quick game turn around so if you get eliminated easy to jump right back into another match.  Devs continue to work hard to polish the game, remove bugs, and add new content that players suggest.

"
22706,"The game was good at the begining, and then The Epic Games attack started.
Now the game force you to connect your Epic Game account if you want to play."

22710,"can't play since last update keep saying ""Missing files"" and no matter what i do i can't play"

22713,"Frustrated that the game I've paid for and supported now no longer works in the same condition as when I bought it: I will not be playing this game if it forces me over to another platform's shady account practices, poor performance, and lack of features."

22723,Sucks that you now need another account to play it
22724,"To say this was one of my favorite games is an understatement, and yeah I am one of those giving a negative review because of this stupid epic decision to FORCE me to create an account.  I’ve been playing fall guys almost every day since release… and now, I deleted the game and won’t be playing again until I can play without an epic account.  

I wake up every morning angry about this and when I told my therapist he said he wakes up angry about  this too.

I also just put in a refund request. I doubt it’s going to be refunded, but it’s the easiest direct way to let the devs know I don’t consider this kind of change post purchase acceptable. 

At least there’s crab game!"

22726,fuck epic games
22727,"Paid for the game, played 2 hours, then update came and started requiring epic account to continue. It's not optional.. No! I'll request for refund."
22728,Wow seriously f*ck off Mediatonic. They were bought by Epic Games and silently patched in that you HAVE to use an Epic Account so sign in. Also it's starting several Epic services which could be considered as spyware. There is a reason why people bought this on Steam and not on Epic Store.
22729,"No, not recommended. The time i spent in matchmaking was longer than the gameplay."
22730,yes
22731,Having to make an epic account to play when you already own the game on steam makes it not worth it to play the game anymore. Epic sucks
22732,"chaotic but very much fun, sometimes the team minigames, you cant really do anything about you losing. do like the survival minigames the most, they are always completely in your hand"

22738,I am now afraid that if Epic will get hacked again then someone may also break into my Steam account through the Epic one because I was forced to connect them :(
22739,"Still a good game. But at its current state, it requires an additional installation of Epic Online Services Application and an Epic Account. I would have been ok with just an Epic Account but I don't trust the Epic Online Services App, which is required to play. Uninstalling it will give you an ""Missing File Error""."
22740,aha
22741,good
22742,Forces you to get an Epic Games account even when you've been playing for months and paid with cash on Steam. Harvest your data somewhere else.
22743,Apparently you need an Epic Account now and I don't want one. I paid money assuming I wouldn't have to deal with Epic. Doubt I'll get my money back. Don't buy this game unless you want to deal with Epic. Fun while it lasted. Oh well.
22744,Suddenly requires an epic games account to play. THEFT! I refuse.
22745,"I've pretty legitimately been on the fence about this review for some time, and in light of recent events, I figure I may as well cast my lot with the rest of the complaints. To make a long list of complaints short, Fall Guys suffers from Dead By Daylight Syndrome. Developers who consistently ask for feedback that is then consistently rejected, community management being unresponsive and generally not servicing their purpose - a link between the devs and community - and horrible feedback after an unfortunate publisher experience. Despite constant community feedback about events, both in game and on social media, shows, and account options, mediatonic and now Epic seem to refuse to learn from their errors voiced by a very loud majority.

Needing to now have an Epic account and app downloaded to play - especially after leading people to believe the change would be optional - is the straw that broke the camel's back."
22746,"It was fun at season 1, but now it's boring,"
22747,good
22748,Very GUD
22749,"Forces you to use an Epic account, even on a purchased Steam version. 

Initially a fantastic game, but forcing users to create an account with a company with shady business practices after owning since launch is a big no from me."

22755,"It is a damn shame - but the latest changes to force you to connect an epic games account your steam account in order to play fall guys really sucks. A lot of players on steam do not WANT to be dealing with epic games, and fall guys say ""its necessary to bring in new features like cross play"" is bullshit. They already had cross play and it worked flawlessly - now there are servers issues. Not only that, but they are going all-out on the new season awards and limited time events with exclusive and time limited costumes in order to get people to sign up with an epic games account... Really poopy of the developers to force this on their long-time fans.. really really poopy."
22756,This games is loads of fun.  I rarely get bored with it.  Love playing with friends in a party.  The devs are constantly posting on twitter and coming out with new content every season to keep things fresh.  It's a nice change of pace from the same ole same ole genres out there.
22757,You'll need to connect your Epic Store account to play.
22758,Gall Fuys ? ???? ?
22759,"Just play Among Us

Fall Guys depends pretty heavily on rng, and only a small portion on skill. It also makes me hate people, but it's not that different. Controls are garbage and no better than a drunk person driving. Somehow people can grab you from a mile away while it seems like the grab mechanic is disabled for you. Trying to steal something from someone's hands is impossible because this game is so poorly made that it doesnt even pop up and they can just take it again. Drums you can bounce on are inconsistent as hell. hitting somehow slows down your momentum and not theirs. No wonder this game died so quick. This game shouldn't make me so mad but it's so horrid and the controls are explained horribly.

It's annoying to lose connection in the middle of a match
I hate it when I lose because others suck at the game
You need an epic games account like why?
Grab mechanic is actual cancer to use
Why cant you just try harder to make your game FUN TO PLAY"
22760,i really enjoyed the game
22761,"super garbage game that requires you to log into a Epic account to even play. This is steam, not epic. Garbage sellouts"
22762,Fall Guys is an action packed adventure game based off of the hit game; Among Us!
22763,cant invite friends to a cross-platform party
22764,why not fix the game???????it's been soooooooooo long!!!
22765,i hate logging in to other accounts to play games on steam and i absolutely dont want to log in to epic
22766,was an horrible desicion the epic thing.
22767,"Fun
And
Lyrically
Loveable
Game
Until
You
Started making us link Epic accounts

i dont want the fortnite devs to know my netflix login

Also, we were never told anything about the requirements of an Epic Games account upon purchase, I'm pretty sure this is just a cash grabbing scheme from Epic.
- Make Fall Guys
- Make it popular
- Make it use your Steam account (easy and flexible)
- Wait until most people have played 2+ hours
- Make it use your Epic login (ew)
Nobody can refund, it is far too late.

Honestly, want my money back. I've already been scammed once by this dumb game (tried getting it on PS4, got it for full price and didn't get the PSN discount, i need to subscribe to PSN to play)"
22768,fun game
22769,"Requires Epic Games launcher. I already have Steam, why do I need another launcher? Time to ask for a refund."
22770,fun
22771,Fall Guys is still cool
22772,very poggers game
22773,Cute and FUN
22774,fun game in short bursts ruined by epic garbage
22775,why epic game bro?
22776,"Bought this game S1, no Epic garbage store needed. now you HAVE to have epic launcher downloaded and you HAVE to make an epic account. Bait and switched, very frustrating."
22777,Good.
22778,Just say no to Epic Games
22779,Epic games cringe

22783,Fall guys is an awesome game! Season six is so fun!
22784,yart
22785,Now requires Epic Games account... yikes.
22786,------ Epic Games Login -----
22787,"Game itself is decent but the recent requirement of having an Epic account is utter nonsense. Also, crossplay with consoles is a joke. You can only create a private lobby with friends from other platforms that requires 12 people to work. Who has 12 friends?!

Small technical issue that bugs me: the popup to verify your Epic account does not support a controller so I had to quit the game, disconnect my controller, reopen the game, accept the account linking, and then turn my controller back on. And now the popup appears on every launch and locks the mouse cursor in the middle of the screen. Drives me nuts while trying to play a match."
22788,great game buy it
22789,Very good game just gets repetitive
22790,Not doing an epic account for this.
22791,beans
22792,"it is fun

22793,even tho epic games sucks ass the game is still fun
22794,"Fall Guys is one of those breakout hits that fully deserves its success, not because it’s one of the greatest games ever made, but because it’s the perfect game for its time and place. In another year, I think this would have had its fans, but in 2020, during a global pandemic, in a time in which authoritarianism was on the rise and various Western nations were collapsing into political dysfunction, Fall Guys was a soothing balm. It’s a game that takes the framework of highly competitive online games and puts a goofy skin on it so charming that it’s hard to take it seriously. Instead of the often-toxic, murder-all-your-enemies games, Fall Guys is presented as a game show, in which strange bean people clumsily jump, grab and slide towards victory.

It makes such a lovely first impression that many people are inevitably disappointed that it gets repetitive. This is true; it’s a simple and accessible game, and that means that there isn’t enormous depth to its mechanics, which means to stay engaging it needs new content in the form of new levels amd modes, which takes time and money to create. But the developer is on it, pumping out new levels regularly, and the game is only $20 at full price.

I really hope that some day they allow user-created levels and game modes, but otherwise I got no complaints."
22795,Epic games is a not trust worthy scummy company.
22796,I bought this game on Steam and now it ask a EpicGame account ? I think this will be a refund...
22797,"cool game
"
22798,It forces you to use an epic games account now to play the game.
22799,"Why do I need an Epic Games Account to play now would request a refund. Wont play it again anyway if you need an Epic Account now,"
22800,"This game is literally unplayable. Can't hardly find anybody for a session, and that's only on the rare occasion that it will let me past the 'easy anti-cheat' window, and the 'failed to log in' error screen like 40 times before I'm allowed in. Disheartening."
22801,Idk why but game is askin for Epic Games Acc. so I had one but Idk its password I was always logging in via my email. Cant login from this game so I'm kinda pissed off bcs of this kind of idiotic sh.t. So I decided to write this review maybe the devs would understand what kind of bllsh.t their doin.

22806,"Played the new season for two days. On day three, I get the error ""There is an issue with your Epic Games account (Error Code: 14)"". I try to log in to my Epic Games account through the browser and it works fine, so I restart the game and now I get the message ""Missing files required to run Fall Guys!"" I find their support page that basically asks you to reinstall Epic Online Services, do all that, and now I just get the error ""failed to login, please check your connection"". My internet connection is fine, if there was an issue with my internet connection I wouldn't be able to post this negative review."
22807,wowwie fun game hihi
22808,"Why did Mediatonic have to get into bed with Epic Games? This game was just fine until they let Epic in for season 6, funny how all the sudden it has all these issues.

22816,"Forces you to make a Epic Games account, making the game unplayable"
22817,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the game on the first day I played it, when it worked! Epic account requirement was a nasty surprise. But the game later refusing to work due to ""Missing files"" was the cherry on the top. So yeah, don't. Shame, really fun game."
22818,because idk
22819,"I now have to download and link an epic account since last update. It worked absolutely fine during season 5....as soon as 5 dropped, they fucked it. Missing files, long loading times. etc etc"

22859,"people peeing themselves over an epic account are being salty. This is a genuinely underappreciated game and deserves more attention. Music, Visuals, Gameplay, keeps me coming back because it's crafted so well.

Naming all of the obstacles after memes could be toned down though.

Update as of June 15th 2022,

I'm not sure how I feel about the direction of currency in the future free to play movement and I feel as though there's going to be a gap between players who pay and players who do not."
22860, luvely
22861,fun be ez to rage at
22862,ITS FUN and enjoyable
22863,If you like getting through obstacle courses then buy this game     10/10

22865,"Was fun, now uninstalled. What an Epic fail!"
22866,"The game was fun to play once in a while, but now you MUST make a Epic account to play... I bought it with Steam so i do not recommend the game because you have to make a 3th party account to be able to play.."

22881,"I want to love this game, but it is wildly buggy.  For about 90% of the times I play a giant cursor arrow is in the very middle of the screen that you can't get ride of.  This seems to be a recurring issue that used to have wonky fixes, but they don't work anymore.

Second, if you leave the game on the menu screen for more than 3 minutes, then it freezes, and you have to force quit and restart.

Third, the screen will randomly freeze while you can hear the game being played still, it's just that the screen freezes.

Outrageous that a game that's been out this long and is loaded with predatory microtransactions is this buggy."
22882,Epic Games account must be linked to play now sad.
22883,Great games!
22884,if u looking for fun this game is the best option for u.. <3
22885,We need to stop this epic take over at some point. They are making all good games terrible
22886,"[h1]No, Epic. Just No.[/h1]
This is different from my other reviews, but i'll let you know, as you can see my hours logged into the game i have had many fun and amazing hours playing with friends and going through the game and the updates and costumes.

But with the release of Season 6, you're REQUIRED to link up your Epic Games Account in order to PLAY THE GAME. I don't like epic and it's just annoying that they went to this measure when they didn't do this before after it finally got released on Steam. This game can be really fun, really annoying, but all the more incredibly entertaining. But my journey with this game stops here.
"
22887,"Can't recommend this game, as long you are forced to have an Epic Account to play it.


Side note:
Thanks to Epic I'm writing my first review. First of, you must link an epic account to play Fall Guys. I don't have an Epic Account and I will never get one. Because I won't support their exclusivity practice.  
Unless they change it back and you can play without an Epic Account, I won't and can't play this game anymore."
22888,"Totally unplayable after this stupid update, why you would want your game to link Epic games where the game DNE in that platform???"
22889,"Now requires a third party account to play, with a company I don't have, nor want, an account with. I would refund the game but it was gifted to me so I will see if my Husband can refund it."
22890,"Game has changed to require an account with some 3rd party platform that was not part of the original game.

"
22891,yes
22892,"New update forces you to make an account for a poor/unethical company, otherwise it is unplayable."
22893,Epic Games bs is never a good thing

22913,"Junk games, a lot of bugs, seriously affect the player experience, bad comments."
22914,"Forcing people to make an Epic Games account?
People unable to play the game they bought because its now region locked.
Letting a company from China own 40% of your shares? A country currently trying to commit genocide on its Muslim population.
I have my convictions.
Fuck you.
Give me a refund."
22915,.
22916,"If you're wondering why Mediatonic took four months to produce only five mediocre levels, well, what they were actually working on was loading multiple Epic spyware programs into the game package that install without warning or permission and continue running after the game is closed and Steam is closed. This practice is unacceptable."
22917,not a good game for 20$ it is not fun it is so lame do not waste your 20$
22918,Because i like the game and so should you
22919,"I'm glad that this game let me connect with some of my favorite Vtubers.  Unfortunately, once the forced Epic Games account stuff hit, I can no longer support this game.  I got good value out of it prior to the last update, but it looks like there's no more value to be had with Epic's terrible business practices now fully intertwined with the game.  I won't install Epic's launcher or storefront, and until those are gone from this game, I have no reason to return."
22920,"Loved this game, still do.
But forcing to create and link a non optional Epic Games Account and installing Epic Games Tools without permission for just playing the game you already bought on Steam?
Not cool Mediatonic. Not cool.

At least make it optional.
I can do without cross progression, particularly if I can't combine my progression on Playstation with my progression on PC.

I'll turn this negative review into a positive one, when I can play again without this Epic Games Stuff because the game itself is one of my favorite casual multiplayer games.
Please Mediatonic."
22921,"The game was pretty fun until I logged in and needed to make an epic account to play... no exceptions or way around this. You also need to have EGS software running on your PC while playing.

Please be aware of this prior to making any purchase."
22922,"I love this game so much. My hubby and I had tons of fun playing this one over the lockdown with friends. It's hilarious, cute and the challenges are really fun. This game is also awesome if you're ever having lots of anxiety and need a distraction. I want every outfit!!!"
22923,"I reinstalled recently and had fun playing, then I see I need an epic games account now to continue playing a game I've been playing without one already? Get lost. A hard uninstall for me and wish i could get my money back because I won't be playing it ever again"
22924,very fun and challenging
22925,What the hell? Account?
22926,Extremely funny and frustrating
22927,ok
22928,Stop trying to shove Epic Games down our throats. We want to use steam.

22930,I CANT WIN :(
22931,Very best game Iv played yet
22932,VERY FUN
22933,Don't go in expecting deep gameplay. But it's just a great little filler game where I can actually just take ten minutes to play something when I've got time to kill. Also playing with your friends sucks less with the new updates!
22934,Great game
22935,"- Game was fun. Now you need a Epic account to log in. 
- Long time for matchmaking 
- Very low player base due to Epic launcher
- Always missing files"
22936,"Used to be a fun game, but the latest update forces you to create an Epic Game account to be able to play, which completely ruins the experience.

### Update June 2022 ###
Now they also made the game free-to-play and got rid of the crown system. I paid for the game and now I have to suddenly pay for almost everything using in-game purchases.

Thanks for ruining the whole experience even more!"

22941,You just killed your game. KInda sad but need to uninstall this game.
22942,"meh
"
22943,"Game had a good run! 

I didn't really expect it to make it this far but I am happy that it did. It is very dissapointing that they are forcing you to download another launcher to play the game when it worked perfectly fine before. I don't even hate epic games but it's just so useless.

It doesn't help that the users of steam absolutely despises epic games so you basically just got alot of loyal fans angry and frustrated for no reason. I am assuming you got like a nice check or was it just for playstation crossplay? 

All in all it's a decent game but after years of not removing the awful gamemodes that everyone hated and just not knowing it's playerbase I have to give it a negative review"
22944,Guys fall !
22945,"good job guys, you sure did FALL."
22946,"i buy this game from steam bec no lag or error and now epic game if you want to play fall guys you want to have account epic and epic control fall guys that is shit error error no buy fall guys bec epic game fk t up everything i buy it from steam bec there is diff btween the luncher of epic sh**t
(faking epic game ) now i don't want to play fall guys i need my money back"
22947,Epic games required
22948,"Clearly not a PC game.
The cursor was stuck in the middle of the screen the whole time when it was supposed to be hidden. What's worse, it doesn't support ultrawide screen resolutions (in 2021, and it's clearly laziness and not some sort of 'unfair advantage' since it's not exactly an FPS game). It doesn't even support my vertical resolution!
So I get a blurry image with a useless cursor in the middle and giant black bars at the sides."
22949,foot
22950,"Epic account? Seriously?
"
22951,good game only bad thing is the lag and random crashing
22952,Fun Game. Worth every penny.
22953,Love the game. I don't like that its forced to epic games now. going to stop me from playing.
22954,"Really fun game, but the fact that I need to create an Epic account now is ridiculous. I will not be playing again until this restriction is lifted."
22955,epic games sucks
22956,"Had fun, but now you're forced to have an Epic account to play. No thanks."
22957,pretty repetitive after a while but if fast paced battle royale is what you enjoy then im sure this game is for you

Until the update that apparently installs Epic software without asking.
And requires linking with epic account to play.

(I don't trust them since my friend found out someone registered an account using her email address without her even knowing - no confirmation mail, no nothing - maybe they've upgraded their security since then... and maybe they just threw more money on free games to offer every week)"

22972,"i bought this game through steam just to get away from eic games and now epic comes around to give everyone who bought this game the middle finger and force you to either log in to your epic account or create one. The verification process on its own is extra difficult for a minor since you have to pay .50 to suppossedly prove youre an adult to get your account going. Yes they give you your money back but only after a period of 8-15 days, which makes me wonder how much money is epic handling that dont belong to them. Either that or give your full personal info with the last 4 SSN numbers...you decide."

22975,"Epic now owns this studio, and that means China owns them. They are owned by the Chinese government and I really can't have any of that with people suffering left right and center and the reeducation camps taking away culture of people. This game has gone to trash after it was bought anyways just like Rocket League."
22976,"The game was pretty fun to play with friends, but now they are forcing you to create an Epic Games account.

I'm not a fan of Epic's shady business practices, or their shitty underdeveloped storefront, so that's it for me.

23004,"TLDR:
If you allready have the game: My condolances.
If you are thinking of buying it: Just don't and buy your loved ones something nice for the otherwise wasted money.


I really enjoyed playing this game with my wife and a friend in season 5. (Without Epic Games Account)
BUT since season 6 and the need of an epic account our friend doesn't want to play the game anymore and to be honest: niether do I.

The storry behind this:
We used to play 2-3 times a week and chat on TS3 to catch up.
Then Season 6 began, the three of us loaded the update and we wanted to play two days after release.
So we wanted to start the game and had three minerly different problems:
1. Our fried has no epic accountl. Steam kindly created one with a lame name.
2. My wife struggled with her epic PW cause there you can log in with facebook/google/wtf....
3. My game just showed an error wich said that it is not able to connect to epic and I couldnt even close the game (alt + f4 worked) or update. after an houre or so steam decided it was time for an update and i could finally progress to my wifes error, too.
Aftter that, we were not motivatet to play any more. Only my wife played two rounds, but her mouse coursor was stuck in the middle of the screen and wouldn't disappear eventhough we play with gameopads.(No problem in season 5) The same problem stays with me to this day.

I still play sometimes with my wife, but only the ""connecting to epic games store"" loading screen makes me furious!!!!

Sorry for the long Post, but I am really angry about this."
23005,"I like it because its a good party game
"
23006,the new update makes it difficult to get into the game!!!!!!!!!!
23007,"Recent update stealths Epic installer on your PC without any warning or asking permission/auth before doing so.  Removing the Epic spyware stops the game from working at all. 
"
23008,"Fuck you, Epic"
23009,"the new season 6 update made users to use a Epic games account to play this game, very poor!!"
23010,"Nice one Mediatonic, forcing player to bind a EPIC account in season 6 and make 'Missing file' error on steam user's game that can only be fixed by downloading the EPIC online store"
23011,"The reason is obvious. Of all games that moved from Steam to Epic, this is the one that made the absolute shittiest move. You're forced to link it with an epic account, and by the time you launch the game it automatically install the Epic launcher and have it running on your PC.

I will absolutely never purchase or support again any game developed or published by Mediatonic."
23012,"It's Really Interesting Game To Play!
Go For It

But I Dont Know Why Whenever I Play (Start A New Match) I Only Get 3 Levels (New Season 6 Levels) But I Also Want To Play Old Levels And I cant idk Why Can Someone help Me Please it Would Be Great!

Thank You!
"
23013,"If I wanted to support Epic, I would've bought the game on Epic, not Steam. Attempting to bypass the Epic Store causes a 'Missing Files' bug."
23014,"It's such a crap game, you wait 10 minutes on the interface screen of the game, you play the game for 5 minutes. They made a waiting game. You have to wait for the menu interface transitions, they could directly make the start key for the other game. It's like they did it for the player to play by force. If a person gets bored and plays for a maximum of 30 minutes, it means wasted effort for the game."
23015,"Was a pretty cool game to kill some time when bored (Especially after though Dota 2 match). But forcing Epic Game sign-in ruined it. Ty epic games.  Not gonna play this game anymore.

(Maybe after a very long time I'll play it again or if they remove Epic Game acc sing in.)"
23016,Epic account now needed
23017,best game ever
23018,"very cool, beans"
23019,GOOD
23020,.
23021,They're forcing you to make an Epic Games account to play. This is a mandatory change that will make the game unplayable for me.
23022,"Sad. Now you need an account on ""Epic Games"" to play this."
23023,awesome
23024,"It's a good game, but they require you to use an Epic Games account. This was not the case for the last 1.5 years. Overall, this is what you call a ""Richard move"" in the industry.

As always, there's some dumb boss who had this stupid idea and forced it through the rest of the organization.
Maybe the bad reviews is a language they understand."
23025,"Fuck Epic Games. First Rocket League, now this. Fuck 'em."

23027,can't play without epic game launcher.
23028,"The leaks were right, you now need a Epic Games account to play the game as of November. The same leak also stated that it's going to get the Rocket League treatment and get removed from Steam


Anyone else finds it funny that they're going to do this when the game has a bunch of Valve crossover skins? Turns out they also removed their Devolver publishing despite the same case with Valve.

23035,Now you can't play this game if you don't have Epic Games account

23053,"I thought this could replace or compliment other games that I fall back often to, like Rocket League and CS:GO.
But far from it. The biggest issue with the game is that it takes over 2 minutes to start a match. So if you get eliminated, which will happen often, it's a 2 minutes wait in average.
Then the controls aren't responsive, and also are badly explained. It took me a while to notice that others are climbing up - then I had to look up the controls and found Right Trigger does that - something the tutorial instructions completely left out without any hing, giving a false sense of completeness."

I have, in the past, recommended this game to friends as I love it.  I have nearly 500 hours on this game, and I am incredibly disappointed in Mediatonic.  I do not see why I need to create an account for an outside service, when I already bought this game on steam years ago before the purchase of the game by EpicGames.  This is very annoying and disappointing."
23095,Epic games!
23096,"all

23097,"After linking my epic games account all of my achievements, items and crowns are gone. Even my support ID changed as though as its a brand new account. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME PLAYING THIS GAME BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER EVERYTHING YOU WORKED FOR WILL JUST DISAPPEAR. Emailed them my old support ID for help and nobody responded. Don't waste your money and time on this game."
23098,its cute fun and hilarious
23099,"After I bought this game (for myself and for friends), they added a new eula dictating what you can and can not say as interpreted by them. After trying to get around the eula, I accidentally pressed the enter key by my number pad accepting it. Then they're asking for my birth date which is none of their business. This essentially removes your ability to play the game after having purchased it if you don't want to submit to their speech dictation and taking your personal information."

23103,I love this game! it takes a little wile to load though so if the could fix that in the next update that would be great.

23105,"This game was a quick and easy fun wether you played with friends on your own. Recently they released an update to Season 6 I was super keen to discover the new maps and challenges, until it forced me to install Epic Games Launcher. I refuse to use this Launcher due to its history of leaking Data and the control they desire. Get better Developers and realise the mistake you have just made"
23106,"Epic makes awesome games aweful. 

Fall Guys is a great game but with season 6 it got an Epic binding which is unacceptable!
Thank you Epic, after Rocket League the second game you are ruined."

23112,"The game was fun even if i havnt been able to play as much it was very good and really deserved more attention. But since an update that was released today on the date of writing this you are very much forced to install epic online services and use an epic account to play the game making it practically impossible for me to play the game as my account was locked by their support as when i tried to delete it years ago they didnt believe i owned my own account and blocked me from messaging their support :D

23122,"It was a super fun game to play but then they started this Epic account thing. And that doesn't make sense, I bought the game ON STEAM, the fact that you can't play with Steam alone is just ridiculous. Plus with that change the randomized name feature was removed and that may be a silly thing to be irritated by but seeing that gone was very veeeery upsetting"
23123,: ]
23124,"Have to give this game a thumbs down. Bought it at full price to support an indie studio with a great idea right before they sold out to Epic. I was patient with Rocket League but after this newest season (season 6) I am tired of it. They are requiring an Epic account to play which is eerily similar to Rocket League and is most likely a prelude to them removing it from Steam altogether. I played season four to completion but ultimately the game is not worth it given the hassle of dealing with Epic. I just want to play video games and not have a thousand different accounts. To be honest, I would say just buy a copy of Mario Party if you're looking for your minigame fix. I'll probably still play this game from time to time but the initial excitement has faded as I have to wonder what bad business decision they'll make next. They sold it as a benefit, but honestly, who in their right mind would have a game downloaded on Steam and be like, ""Hey, I really want to play this on my Epic account, I'm so glad there's crossplay"". Not to mention Epic exclusive content for the game to pull the base away from Steam (where they found their success) and it's time to put my foot down. Real shame this is the gaming world we find ourselves in nowadays. I miss the days where I could be a Nintendo Fanboy and fight my friends for which console was better but now we have mega corporations throwing money around to cause chaos in what has been a relatively enjoyable purchasing market. All I can say is you don't see people getting mad at good old games or humble bundle."
23125,They are the among
23126,"So apparently this game now requires an Epic Games Store account...
No thanks, I don't support anti-consumer companies and practices."
23127,funny
23128,Final Nail in the coffin you need an Epic Games Account
23129,"Due to the recent change of needing a epic account to play and my steam already be linked to a epic account that no longer is able to be used, now means I cannot even play this game. It is complete Shit that this is the case."

Forces you to link your steam account to epic account. 
3 out of 4 PCs I am still not able to play and get a connection error 14 to Epic servers. Solution? You should install the complete Epic environment from their website to your PC. Then the steam game magically becomes unlocked to play as well.
Even after deinstalling Epic malware & folders remains on your PC. 
A great game being only overshadowed by an even greater enforcement of spyware. Stay away from this like the plague"

23162,"The game is alright and all but BIG CON is that you have to have an epic games launcher.. Especially bad for those who won't be able to play the game (US for example) and you won't have any other way to play without it. It's also unfair how before all this you had to have randomized name, when other users could have their own names.. Why you had to have such name you ask? Because of innapropriate names you could have.. bruh

EDIT: 

It may become f2p in june 21st.

Where's our money back?"
23163,"Hello! I have to say this game is enjoyable and has brought me a lot of fun in my spare time.

But recently I cannot enter the game anymore due to the 'missing files' troubles. I have tried many times restarting my PC or my Steam and verified the integrity of game files several times according to the notification. However, it did not help at all. 

I also tried to download the Epic launcher according to the suggestion from some forum threads. It did work last night, but I can not access the game again today, with the same 'missing files' notification. This is just so ANNOYING, which finally leads me, who actually DO enjoy the content of the game a lot, here to make this negative comment. 

As I notice many players from different countries suffering from the same problems in the recent 2 days after the new season was launched, I DO hope you can solve this issue AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
23164,f*** missing files yesterday，f*** ‘丢失文件’ today， u fix error info from EN to CN ?  fix f*** 'missing files' bugs !!
23165,Classic bait & switch. Wish I could refund this. The game works absolutely well before. Now it force you to have & install EOS account. Otherwise you could not load this up. F you Mediatonic. What a scam.

23168,I was wondering if it was worth it. It is worth it especially for 10 quid
23169,"Very fun game, it's actually my favorite game that I own on steam, I only have 26.4 hours played on it, but I definetely recommend buying it!"
23170,This is a literal scam game is unplayable and worthless also the game company is trying to froce you to give them you personal data to play. Game is directed for the young people so they are using kids for they own purpouse ot atlast they try to if you love you kids dont let them get in hands of those inhuman monsters.
23171,Now requires a Epic Games account.
23172,"It's so hard to get in and play this game,just fuck you all ."
23173,gooodddd!
23174,"it doesn't work after updating......I tried everything I can do,but it just can't run at all..."
23175,You need an Epic Games account to play this now. They betrayed their Steam users and sold out.
23176,Epic games log in can suck a fat one.
23177,"Since the update of the sixth season, I can't log in successfully, and I can't even try epic. The game is OK, but the official can't."
23178,"Do not buy, after new update you have to create an account on Epic games in order to play. The game will also automatically instal you Epic games overlay and stuff! What a scam."
23179,clever game for moron little people in every one of us
23180,They force you to create an Epic-Launcher account. Not ok.
23181,"While I have been playing / watching the game over time since launch. Season 6 has released an anti-user update that myself and many others didn't want nor want to participate in. Until the undo / implement an alternative to play the game without forcing everyone to make & connect their steam to an epic games account, I will be joining the bandwagon that is uninstalling the game, leaving a bad review and waiting for the devs to listen.
(I've also been waiting months for kitsuna ai skin to return with no goal in sight for it's return, I'm tired of waiting)

If epic were not involved, than the game is very much enjoyable, recommend playing with friends."
23182,"Formerly standalone game, now a part of Epic's sellout pen. Was decent while it lasted, now uninstall and forget."
23183,addictive fun quick game to play with friends and your kids!
23184,great game
23185,"Stupid game. Damn, I bought it for less than three hours, and when I went in, it was: login error, please check the network. All sorts of searches were done, and more than two hours were not useful. What idiot game."
23186,Two words: Casual and Fun
23187,I'm the fall guy
23188,Sussy among us
23189,Great game despite what all the Epic haters are saying. I wish they added new gameplay elements.
23190,New game. Never palyed. Can't solve Error code 14
23191,E
23192,"Why there are soooo many stupid team rounds in main show?
I love paly them with my great steam friends in squad, but not with a lot of stupit randoms.
What is the significance of  Eggs, Pushing balls ,Basketball, Football, Batterys in the main show? 
What is the significance of Hoopsie Daisy , Big Shot, Rhinos in main show?Isn't that just a random elimination of a bunch of people.
EPIC is also not friedly for us, so sad of your company.

"
23193,"So
I mean
Has been few months since i played
Now that season 6 is out
It's ok i guess now.
BUT
t seems like you NEED an Epic account to play

So Fuck you Epic
This ""account system"" also works without epic games, litterely all other steam games can handle everything fine, there is no damn reason to force an epic fail account

And i currently can't play this game anyways since i switched to Linux 99% of my PC time, and i'm too lazy to reboot into Windows just for this 1 game.
So PLEASE for gods sake just enable wine / proton support for eac.

"
23194,All I say is AA. Awesome and Annoying.
23195,Noice:D
23196,fucking missing files
23197,So good

23199,tgfdgfdgfd
23200,更新后新赛季进不去，好几个方法都试过了。还非要跟epic绑定，我无语。吃相难看！
23201,Can not you design a game without bugs?
23202,"THIS IS STEAM!!! not epic games

I want my money back :("
23203,"这一次的更新大概是所有赛季中最公平的一次了，毕竟不公平的玩家全都不让登录了。这样的大面积恶性bug不积极修复并重复出现，可以看出公司根本没有把玩家放到心里，给一个四国语言的差评。大家记得把语言改成英文，省的他们看不到。差评！差评!

This update is probably the fairest of all seasons. After all, unfair players are not allowed to log in. Such large-scale malignant bugs are not actively repaired and repeated. It can be seen that the company has not put players in mind and gave a bad comment on four languages. We remember to change the language into English, so they can't see it. negative comment! negative comment!

이번 업데이트는 아마도 모든 시즌 중 가장 공평한 것일 것이다. 왜냐하면 불공평한 게이머들은 모두 로그인을 하지 못하게 하기 때문이다.이런 대면적의 악성 버그가 적극적으로 복구되지 않고 반복적으로 나타나면 회사가 게이머를 마음속에 두지 않고 4개국 언어에 대한 혹평을 하지 않았다는 것을 알 수 있다.모두들 그들이 볼 수 없도록 언어를 영어로 바꾸는 것을 기억해라.혹평!혹평!

今回の更新はおそらくすべてのシーズンの中で最も公平なもので、結局不公平なプレイヤーはすべて登録させません。このような大面積の悪性バグは積極的に修復されず、繰り返し現れ、会社がプレイヤーを心の中に置いていないことがわかり、四国言語の悪評を与えている。みんなは言語を英語に変えたことを覚えていて、省の彼らは見えません。悪い評価!悪い評価!
"
23204,fuck epic
23205,For forcing you to link/make an Epic Games account.
23206,"There was a bug in the game I just bought yesterday, and I finally found a solution on the Internet. You updated a Chinese announcement, and I wasted two hours of effort. Thank you very much！！！！！！！
"
23207,"fuck this game,fuck you all,FFFFFFFUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKK"
23208,"missing files!! WTF??
I have verify the doc. twice and reinstall twice"
23209,"I downvoted Doom Eternal one of my favorite games while it had danuvo, I wanted to buy fall guys to friend to mess on a bit but then epic came. He hates epic more then me, downvote from me and customer less from him. So f epic...."
23210,"this game is totally made of BUG!
I've played this game since it came out and now i just wanna enjoy the new season with my friends. But now we can't even launch it. The worse thing is none of you official staff come to explain and make an apologize. ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING. If you take us Chinese players as fools , i will not be sorry for my negative comment."
23211,"OK game to waste time.  I refuse to get an Epic Games account. 
"
23212,"really good party game with a spritz of challenge, fun, bouncy music, creative, colorful maps, and interesting minigames and challenges. more fun with friends, so if you have any, grab a few and play together"
23213,laaaaagggggg season 6 very bad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! plz fix it
23214,very repetitive and boring
23215,"
This is a rubbish game, keep prompting me file lost, tried many solutions are useless, official what to eat!
"
23216,"gud gem, better than csgo
"
23217,ne stava i za chep za zele
23218,Thank you for the last 5 seasons..... but  I have to say screw you epic!!!!!!!!!
23219,"The new season has too many bugs,the experience is very bad, it took a lot of time to get into the game.now I can not get into the game, your fucking crap game!!! Your mother refunds the money!!!!"
23220,"Solid game,but gets a little boring after a couple of hours.Buy it when on sale."
23221,why i cannot play?????????????????????
23222,Fuck Epic Games requiring account linking
23223,Need to link an Epic Games account
23224,"Forced EAC after was bought on linux and still didn't acrtivate proton support.
Now forces Epic accound. Everything Epic Games touches becomes shit"
23225,EPIC FAILURE
23226,ITS BAD IT DUST LODE
23227,Forcing you to have an epic games account and link it to play it. Complete garbage.
23228,I come back every season to check out the new rounds and stuff. Good game but devs needed to fix major issues like hackin and servers while it was still huge.
23229,I like this game
23230,"I can carry a penguin while being dressed as a unicorn with a rainbow tutu.
10/10"
23231,I enjoy my time playing
23232,fall guys is an amazing game but might be a bit slow and it is tricky
23233,good game :)
23234,"good, but not as good as fall guys august 2020 good"
23235,هاغطحك
23236,You cannot play the game anymore without an Epic Games account.
23237,thinkin about them beans
23238,"Users are now forced to sign in through epic games, even when launched via steam."
23239,Fun while it lasted. I'm not getting an Epic account.
23240,this is game osm
23241,"If you like your sanity and want to enjoy life, just steer clear of this giant steaming turd. Every review for this game is 100% full of crap wish I hadn't played it as long as I did now can't refund."
23242,very fun but big pee pee
23243,Epic Store sign in can sit and spin.
23244,just no
23245,wow
23246,Forcing people to make an account with another platform to continue playing the game they purchased is scummy.
23247,"Epic games ruined it. 
Don't require a different platform's account please.
Thank you.

Otherwise great game."
23248,Loved this game was all over it when first came out and started get back into it slowly again. Only today to launch to find I require an Epic Account to play. What a waste of money now since I won't ever play it again since it requires an epic account and I refuse to get one due to having my details leaked by Epic. Get your shit together developers this isn't on.
23249,fu@king bug missing files!!!!!
23250,"Game is cool and cute, fun to play with friends - However, they now made it MANDATORY to install the Epic Games Launcher and create an account with Epic to link with steam in order to play the game. You can't play the game if you don't install this software, until now it didn't require this, and there is no way to play the game without it. I can't recommend a game that locks you out of playing it after changing its launch specifications way after the original release. I don't want to install another launcher, I didn't buy the game on steam to be forced to play it off of steam. Terrible decision on the game's end IMO"
23251,epic games bad
23252,Had so much fun playing the game even though i never won an episode. I was getting so close in the last rounds recently but now thanks to this Epic merge i will no longer be playing. Thanks Epic for ruining the fun!!
23253,Do not buy trash game owned by epic
23254,"Semua orang, berjatuhan !!!"
23255,I love the update!
23256,"i've been playing this game on ps4 since day one and only recently got this on pc just after season 5 launched or in the middle of season 5. this really is better on pc than it is on console. since season 6 launched, there have been a few new bugs. nothing game breaking but still annoying. fall guys support (which is a thing, don't bother with epic games support) has been super quick to respond about these bugs and working on them. as a whole, fall guys is insanely fun. i've been recommending it to my friends since day one. just watch out for trolls and try hards trying to ruin your fun.

btw, griping on about having to make an epic games account in order to play this is not a review of the game. get over yourselves."
23257,fuck epic games
23258,"Guy, fall down...funny."
23259,goot game
23260,Loading screens take to long
23261,"you've played 0  secons 
"
23262,.
23263,Don't even bother with this pile. Steer clear of Pathetic Games.
23264,"I use to really enjoy playing this game with my wife and friends, however now you have to link an Epic account. We've experienced unplayable game bugs and really bad customer support from Epic's game store in the past so we will no longer be playing this game. Fun while it lasted."
23265,Dendrick Gendrick Kenrick
23266,Regreting how I just wasted my money on a trend which died earlier than my iphone battery
23267,its fun
23268,I LOVE BEANS.
23269,very good game
23270,Epic games kills everything it touches.
23271,"Not sure if this is a deal breaker for most, but requires a epic games account to even play. It frustrates me because I bought in on steam with the expectations of being able to play immediately, only to be interrupted by a requirement of an epic game account. I'm not in support of epic games so I personally wouldn't recommend it, but if you don't care and are willing to go the extra mile of registering into your epic account for a STEAM product then do so."
23272,"Not only do you need an epic games account to even play now, it installs epic games services onto your computer, and if you try to uninstall it, it re-installs itself even when fall guys is not running. It is malware. Report this game until they remove their malware and revert to using steam authentication on the STEAM version of the game."
23273,Epic
23274,This game wasn't bad until they decided to make it so that you have to have an account through EPIC to play now. At least I got to free up some space on my computer
23275,Its bs that this game automatically installed epic games store online services after an update without any warning/notification.
23276,"Took me a while to get use to the game but its really fun, and chill to play."
23277,good
23278,it is so fun
23279,beany fo feany
23280,Fall guys is fun. Play it.
23281,"Mostly only ever played by anyone for the memes, or out of boredom because you've literally nothing else to do.
Epic games exists and therefore makes this an even worse experience, and every update to the game makes the game worse and worse and devs don't listen to players so don't waste your money or your life."
23282,I bought on steam because I dont want to use Epic.
23283,Make you link your Steam account to Epic now. Too bad :( I used to like this game.
23284,this game is awesome a little hard so like for pros but ya its great recommend it
23285,tHIS GAME IS THE BEST BECAUSE WHEN YOU START THE GAME AND YOU WIN ONE GAME THEN YOU WILL BE MOVATED TO KEEP PLAYING TO BE THE BEST.
23286,"Good, everyone can taste the game because it's free.
But how about us, no compensation."
23287,forces you to create an epic games account. save your money
23288,I just came back to play this game after a rather long hiatus and found that I have to create an epic store account in order to play it.  This is not going to happen.
23289,Epic screw you!
23290,I do not want an epic games account
23291,i wish i won
23292,This game was great when it came out but now they've changed so much that it's not fun anymore. Plus if you're using an ultrawide monitor it thinks your cheating and kicks you out of the game constantly.
23293,better than crab game
23294,E
23295,Requiers Epicgame activation to play.
23296,"good

23300,"WRITE A REVIEW FOR FALL GUYS: ULTIMATE KNOCKOUT
Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.
Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines.

Liked: Could have been fun.
Disliked: Epic."
23301,Requires an epic account now or else you can't play
23302,"This was (probably still is) a fun game, but the developers (just like the developers of Rocket League) decided to sell out and to FORCE their players to install a 3rd party software and create Epic account. It is a shameful, disgusting practice that insults and alienates player base, and a practice that needs to stop. I can not and will not recommend this game in good conscience to anyone. It is important to mention that Steam is also to be blamed here for not protecting it's users from this kind of atrocity and for hiding reviews that shed light on what's happening here. Sad, pitiful and spineless."
23303,"Wanted to play a game I already owned, but apparently I need to sign into another service? I play on Steam because I want as few login's as possible. Had a lot of fun with this game but wouldn't recommend it as its frankly ridiculous they expect me to sign up for a new service all of a sudden.

I've been having a lot of fun with the free to play 'Crab Game' go play that."
23304,"I only bought recently to play with my daughter and her cousins. They loved it and we played for an hour. A few days later and now I need an Epic account to play. That's some bullshit. The game worked, now I have to add another layer of nonsense? No. I hope I can get a refund because this is honestly awful."
23305,"Used to be fun before they forced me to create an EPIC account to play it. Without agreeing to EPIC's TOS and EULA, you are not allowed to play the game.
Was fun while it lasted."
23306,now that theres more than 5 minigames its actually really fun to play every now and then
23307,game gud lol
23308,11111111111111111111111111111111113we12
23309,Nice
23310,I really loved the visuals and fun simple game play of Fall guys. If you love this game you need to check out BLANKOS. Its a free to play and earn NFT game with stunning graphics and fun party vibe with friends.
23311,"With the latest update, Fall Guys now requires an Epic Store account in order to play. When I was reading the update notes for the game, I thought it was going to be optional (but you'd need to if you wanted to do cross-play) and I'd be able to play the game on Steam just as I always had.

Turns out it's not the case, and my refusal to make an Epic account means the game will no longer work."
23312,"Forces you to install Epic Games DRM. Mediatonic sold out, the game is dying. If you didn't buy this game when it came out, you've missed the boat."
23313,very good watch out for greifers
23314,"Good game. You are a guy, you fall and then get back up. A metaphor for life as life, too, is a competition."
23315,"gae, bro i nevr plya thid again. also thos hase furyrs init . aso has anme int nwo."
23316,"Used to enjoy this, then the developer got bought out by Epic Games, and as of now can't play the game without making an Epic Games account (and before that you had to agree to Epic Games ToS/Privacy Policy before playing the game).

Tencent, who owns 40% of Epic Games, are complicit in supporting/enabling the Chinese Communist Party in Mainland China, who are actively committing genocide in Xinjiang, oppressing the people of China, Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong, among other things."
23317,"Requirements for epic games account means i will not be playing again, dont buy it"
23318,yes
23319,"this is a great game but i can't recommend it because it now requires the epic games launcher, which is not disclosed anywhere. this should honestly be against twitch TOS"
23320,I mean its alright
23321,entertaining and funny also
23322,"I was quiet fond of this game. I had alot of good times with my mates playing this. However, I was heartbroken when I saw that you need to have an Epic games account. So long fall guys...."
23323,epic games xD
23324,"Fall Guys was a lovely cruise out on the Caribbean Sea to have a good time with friends and others. Then suddenly, a pirate ship with 42 broadside cannons named Season 6 sailed to the side and opened fire by needing to log into a 3rd party client to play and no longer being able to change your name with the randomizer, halting the fun cruise and sending it straight to the bottom of the Sea."
23325,fun game. if you're looking for a challenge then definitely purchase this game. lot's of different skins to customise from and a lot of different and strange levels to go through. recommend very much. and you can play with friends. (and still endofgreio won't ask me to play with him yet)  but also you could get bored once you've done everything. but still a good game to play
23326,took 3 hours to update then server crashed and made me start over when i got in
23327,"For about 112 hours I was a Fall Guy

November 30th 2021 they made mandatory to get an Epic Games account and have the Epic Games Store download with this game, which I refuse to do

Now for the next 112 hours I'll be a Crestfallen Guy"
23328,"So now we need an Epic games account to play? That's really disappointing. I'm going to hold off on playing... hopefully they can roll this back. Otherwise... I guess I had a fun time with the game before the change. All good things must come to an end, I suppose."
23329,it's great
23330,Game now requires an Epic Games account. Nil points.
23331,EPIC fail
23332,"Other games requiring 3rd party account and services publicly state this on their store pages, no mention of needing epic BS anywhere here though.

Update: Cant even launch due to Epic Games Launcher error. Why would I be contacting Epic for a game purchased through Steam..."
23333,this game os poggies
23334,"I recommend this game, yes."
23335,"Making an Epic account was not a requeriment when we bought this trash. Its a FRAUD.

We dont want nothing related to Epic Store. Also, developers are a bunch of mental illness degenerates.

Edit: Play Stumble Guys, is totally free and even funnier."
23336,Fall Men
23337,"If you don't create an Epic Games account, you will no longer be able to play the game. Why tho?"
23338,"funny bean go ""woooooooo"""
23339,OHJOH9
23340,bought it and returned it right after. It was fun playing it on the Ps4 with friends but now that the game is dead you probably have to play alone and that makes the game boring good things are that the battle pass is always free.
23341,"Why do i have to connect this to Epic.... I just want to play Fall Guys!!
"
23342,never worked for me so i wouldnt reccomend
23343,"Was good, Now we got to download epic games to play on steam. Disappoint."
23344,"Suddenly requires an Epic Games login when playing on Steam.
Requiring additional logins is bad form, requiring additional logins after it worked without is worse.

Less of an issue if you do have an Epic Games account, but awful either way."
23345,"Was good, until the most recent season 6 update where you are now required to download and install an Epic Games piece of software to run in the background whilst you play. Basically just bloatware, its DRM. You can't play without it. 

It then requires you to create an Epic Games account to play, again this is 100% required...    

It was fun whilst it lasted."
23346,"Epic account required now.

Uninstall. Ignored. Recommend no."
23347,these colors hurt my eyes
23348,have fun nc game
23349,Not that Epic anymore.
23350,poggers
23351,"This game is a lot of fun and I was looking forward to checking out the new season just to realize that you now need a Epic Games account in order to even play this game on Steam.

Seeing as I've purchased this game on steam prior to this newly implemented change it really sucks to know you can no longer buy a game on a platform and just expect to be able to play it how you did when you bought it.

Thumps up for a super fun party game
Thumps down for now requiring a Epic Games account in order to play"
23352,"I loved this game. Hours of fun, I played with my friends all the time. I was a little nervous when Epic bought them but there no change so I put it out of my mind. But today I log in, excited to play the new season, and I have to make a Epic Games account. Absolutely not. There is no reason to create ANOTHER account to play this game."
23353,Whats this epic stuff? NOOOOOOOOOOOO
23354,An Epic account is mandatory now and runs Epic Online Services bloatware with admin privileges. It's a shame because I really had fun during the launch and every season afterwards. Will be observing news around this and uninstall if this decision can't ever be rolled back on.
23355,no ultrawide support in 2021?!
23356,"Great Game.
Not a fan of Epic Games shoving it's dick down my throat!
Cheers

Edit 01/07/22: Epic have now removed crowns, added premium currency and decreased how many kudos you can get. Game is dead, Save your self some time and play something else"
23357,ye its cool
23358,Forced epic games login.
23359,"Es herrschte Frieden für 5 Seasons, bis der Epic Games Store angriff...

Also jetzt mal ernst: Das Spiel ist ein echt unterhaltsames und witziges Partyspiel, was ich immer mal gerne mit Freunden gespielt habe. Die Season 5 hab ich zum Teil auch sehr stark gesuchtet. Aber jetzt, pünktlich zum Release der Season 6, haben die Herren Entwickler gemeint, selbstverständlich zur Verbesserung des Crossplays (Komisch, ich hab schon in den Seasons davor schon immer problemlos PS4-Spieler in der Runde gehabt), sie müssten jetzt ein Epic Games Store-Login zur Spielvorraussetzung machen.

Ein Epic Games-Login für Steam. Und dann herrscht auch noch Kupplungspflicht der beiden Accounts. Wollt ihr mich eigentlich komplett verarschen? Schade um das Spiel, aber ich hab eben fix auf ""Uninstall"" geklickt."
23360,you can fall
23361,DIED
23362,Epic
23363,Needs epic games account
23364,Suddenly I need an Epic account. Fook dat. Uninstalling.
23365,Fall Dudes
23366,Epic store account? Really? You shouldn't have done that.
23367,"Played it for a couple of minutes. It was okay, but not worth the hype. But the thing is, I wanted to try it again and now I have to create an epic account? Wtf? Nope, this game´s dead to me now."
23368,jellybean fun
23369,I haven't played since initial launch but heard that an epic account is needed now lol. oops can't recommend.
23370,...
23371,"Was a fun game, but now requires an Epic account, so cannot recommend due to not wanting to support Timmy Tencent
Also installs Epic Online Services without confirmation after the update"
23372,Kinda frustrating at first but fun.
23373,Game now requires an Epic Account to use. As I do not wish to create an Epic account I cannot play the game that I have paid for.
23374,Stuck on looking for players
23375,it was good before epic login came up on startup.

23377,"I will never ever have an Epic Games account, I don't want/need one, I already decided that years ago and this game is not going to change that. 

I wish they at least had the decency to offer refunds, because if this game is going to require an Epic Games account from now on, then I'm never playing this again."
23378,"Love the game, making players require an epic games account after buying it on a different platform is incredibly cringe though. 4/10

Edit: they stole my crowns and now can only get the cool skins for paying, i'm revoking 2 rating points. 2/10"
23379,these guys are definitely falling!
23380,why
23381,"Requires an Epic Games account for a game I have owned for over a year without this requirement. Thanks for needlessly bloating my computer by sucking Tim Sweeney's dick. Also learn to implement a fucking word filter so we can have custom names.

Edit: I have now been wrongfully banned for ""software"" issues. I am on a fresh windows install."

23386,Now requires an Epic Games login.
23387,need epic account even if i only play on steam
23388,bullshit
23389,gay
23390,Forced to make an epic games account no thanks.
23391,Game is crashing to often. I have cursor in the middle of the screen which is an old bug (give it invisible sprite while I'm playing my god it's not so fucking hard) . Over the 1 year after release and it is in such a bad shape I'm impressed.
23392,i Love You Fall Guys Ultimate Knockout
23393,got molested by amogus fall guy and proceeded to die 10/10 game would recommend to everyone
23394,awesome game
23395,"Fun game to play with friends and boyfriend, but now they force you to make an Epic account and install their DRM overlay and accept everything. The worst part is that you can't even move your mose to close, accept nor anything once you have the log in screen. Such a shame"
23396,A game bought on steam now requires an epic games account to play. Wonderful.

23400," [h1]Fall Guys: Ultimate Epic Sellout [/h1]
Literally unplayable wihtout an epic account.
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !"
23401,"Mediatonic is really a genius to reduce its players by connecting it to the epic game store (EGS). 
I really avoids epic games because of some sh1t before, so thanks for suggesting me to go back there. 
Probably i cant recommend this anyone right now, just dont waste your energy here. Save your money here or go to EGS.

Thank you for accompany us for few months. This game is really great indeed, but not anymore."
23402,Forces you to get epic games account to play it on steam.
23403,"""Season 6 announced, nice!""

Starting game: ""Epic OVerlay thingy is being isntalled!""
First screen: ""new EULA and data protection thing, you have to accept BOTH, you can not decline or clsoe the game, if you do not accept, only if you use Alt+F4""
Then ""also, after saying oyu comply, AFTER we installed our additional tool on oyur system WITH elevated admin privilegs you now have to create an EPIC Account as well!""

These are three things in a row which are NOT what I like to see being pulled off by ANY game. Adding ADDITIONAL forced account with ADDITIONAL forced software months after buying it. It means basically: ""accept everything or feel free to be unable to touch this game you payed for ever again"".

I will open a refund request and hope it will go through, as this is really a big no go move in my book. What next? Games you bought forcing oyu to make a Facebook and TikTok Account? Maybe using the ""Tencent Game Launcher"" with Kernel level ""Anti cheat""."
23404,"No thanks,not gonna bother with this game if requires an account from different platform to play it"
23405,Nice Game
23406,"Very fun game, can be super challenging at times but the feeling of getting a victory is better than anything else. Also insanely fun to play with friends."
23407,5/5 very funny
23408,"best game ever
"
23409,"Out of nowhere after an update now i need an epic account to play this game?

Screw epic games! and screw fall guys!"
23410,"I once played the game at my ex's house, it was fun and therefore I just bought it during the sale.

Well, then the game glitched and I can't even start playing. It just shows ""missing_files_popup_message"" whenever I run it. 
Then, I checked online and searched for solutions. None of them helped. 
Finally, I saw that there are many complaining about such glitch after the latest update in the review section. 
Wow, nice job."
23411,epic games sucks
23412,i mean it was alright but then it wasnt ty for listening goodbye
23413,"Requires an epic games account to play. 0/10, do not recommend."

23416,bão
23417,Unf*ckingplayable after season 6.
23418,Bought game on steam to find out in a few months that i need to install EGS to play the game. Absolutely atrocious move devs. Feel scammed. If i wanted to play on EGS i would buy the game on EGS.
23419,Repetitive. Don't download this. Please.
23420,"If I wanted to play on epic game store, I would have bought the game on EGS, not on steam.
But you must have an epic account and login to play, what the hell."
23421,"Nice game, changed my mind.  Now i can grab the butt of men over 30 after hard office work."
23422,"After the new update, there are some problems around, as others have reported.
But the worst part is that the game now _forces_ you to have an Epic Games Store Account to be able to play.

"
23423,"Enter this game smiling, exit this game smiling :)
I really like this game ^^"
23424,The game is easy to play and also very fun! You can play for long periods of time and they update the game frequently and add new showrooms to play in :)
23425,Fuck epic games.
23426,Literally unplayable after the new update.
23427,Сойдет
23428,It was a fun game but they're forcing you to make an Epic Games account to play and because of this I can't play this game AND EPIC GAMES NEVER SENDS ME A EMAIL TO VERIFY MY ACCOUNT I TRIED EVERYTHING BUT IT DIDN'T WORK SO NOW I CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME. nice ):< (And also someone knocked me out in the last round so now I'm very angry)
23429,"Well then, after five seasons in, here I am, unable to play the game without an Epic Game Account.

Since season 6, you cannot play the game without an Epic Game account, which includes forced Epic apps ( not a pleasant surprise to see Epic apps installing themselves when you launch the game, not asking before if you want to install them or not ).  A trip later in the task manager to prevent any Epic app from running, and now I can't leave the game; I can only ""start"" the game, only for it to tell me that it cannot connect to Epic, so my only choice is to... Start again for it to tell me the same error ? It leads me to ALT + F4 the game as the only way to exit it.

Since I cannot play the game anymore ( without an Epic account that goes without saying ) and I cannot refund the game as well, I can only leave a negative review as a warning for anyone wanting to play the game

TD;LR : The game requires an Epic Games Account to play now, despite not being written as necessary on the store page of the game. Anyone else who already bought the game but doesn't want an Epic Games Account may as well uninstall the game."
23430,great game
23431,yes
23432,vert
23433,fun 2 play with friends. stress free environment and kawaii~ characters. <3 <3
23434,Vyžaduje Epic games login.... Nemam Epic účet a rozhodně nemam v plánu si ho zakládat...
23435,Very cheerful game for kids and frustating at the same time xD
23436,NO EPIC GAME STORE
23437,"It was a great game, I quite enjoyed it. Unique and challenging, made me rage quite a bit. But in a good way. 
But as the seasons progressed, I find that they focused hard on how to get even more out of this game, and I am not speaking quality of gameplay. There have been questionable updates, and they usually break a lot before things are sort of fixed, but not really.
There's a bug where audio cuts out in the seasaw level that's been an issue for a while, and isn't being fixed. When you play with friends and end up spectating, it used to automatically focus on one of your friends... no longer does that. Now you spend ages clicking through all the players each round to find your friend.

Crossplay is a great idea, but why does it have to be done over epic games? If I wanted to play fallguys over epic games, I would not have bought it on steam? Now you're forced to either create an account or link an existing account, and I don't quite want that cancer on my operating system, considering the kernel-level anti-cheat, and I ask myself... why does it have to be kernel level? why does it want to root itself so deep into my system, for so called ""anti-cheat""? No thank you.
I would have liked there to be an option as to whether or not I need this silly cross-play, if it means having to link another gaming library to a game that worked without it just fine.

If none of that interests you then it's still a great game to play.
But otherwise it's just something that will go to shit more and more."
23438,"This is a great game. That said, I'll write my major complains:

- No crossover with Nintendo Switch, which was promised long time ago
- Game physics are broken (I know the game was intended to be chaotic, so the gameplay is not meant to be accurate or great at all, but I do think this game would be a lot better if the beans were not so soft and fragile. I like to think that if fall guys was a 3D Platformer Battle Royale, it would be a great game)
- Grab is so unfair and unpredictable (I know if there is a mechanic on the game, we should understand it and play considering it, but a lot of times I felt that this particular mechanic is broken)
- When you're laggy, you're disconnected. I don't understand why developers had this decision of disconnecting players when their internet occilates, but it happens with me (and in countries like Brasil, where the internet is poor, it can be very frustrating), and the worst of all is that you lose the progress you make
- Seasons offers too little and lasts too long. The game gets repetitive and some season changes doesn't feel like it changes the game enough.
- The rewards of playing are really poorly made. They kept the reward system since season 1, when the number of players and the hyper were way higher. Although, the skin prices and the number of coins/crowns that you own feels unfair. You have to play a lot and be the best to follow the skin shopping. The daily-mission helped, but I guess it's not enough.
- On the same line, I feel like the rewards are only for the ""number 1's"". It's really frustrating when you make a run that gives you number 2 or 3, but you are rewardad with less than half of what number 1 gets (and most of the time you played the same amount of time as this other player).

Well, I do want to say I like this game a lot, specially when I play with my buddies, but those critics I made makes me enjoy a lot less the game. I think I should had pointed those things and I hope the developers can make it better (I actually write those things every survey they make too)."
23439,Can't even play without Epic now
23440,"Literally unplayable unless you have an Epic Games account. 
I wish I knew so I could have refunded this trash before the two weeks had passed...."
23441,"Look at how many hours my son has played. I better be good, lol!"
23442,i love this gme
23443,Fun game :)
23444,Zajebista gra tylko kidow dórzo
23445,"No, I don't want to use Epic Games app, especially on system level.
It's also BS introducing it five seasons in...
Knew nothing good would come out of the deal between Mediatonic and Epic, it was only a matter of time."
23446,"Great game that u can play casually and collect cute costumes.
The developers are very generous with the seasonal progression and rewards..."
23447,Now forces you to get an Epic Games Account.
23448,"DO NOT BUY!

Since the start of Season 6 the game requires installing and running Epic Services which demands admin privilages and can seriously mess up your system. Without an Epic accaount you can no longer play the game.

This review will stay negative until this recent change is removed."
23449,hjG
23450,"The constant breaking of physics and ridiculous decisions from Mediatonic aside, the game was fun and functional for a time. Now, with the forced installation of Epic Games and the wiping out of my custom name after years of building it up is the final straw. Oh, and I won't even get into the lack of testing before releases go out. Some are so blatant the game is broken immediately and for weeks at a time. Never again, unisntalled."
23451,GOOD GMAE
23452,"Alright, so still not happy about the epic games take over/service push, but I'm not here to rate Epic, I'm here to rate Fall guys, and now that I can play again (After some really erksome nonsense), I will admit, I'm liking the new levels. The pipes don't really add much, butt hey don't hurt things. The ""Stay in the zone Games"", both on the ground and in the air are a nice touch, and I gotta admit, it's refreshing to have a few that don't make trolling as easy or effective. That being said, the 360 see-saws are seeing people just propping up on the back end them so no one can pass for the lols I guess, so beware of that. If you are hyper-competitive, don't get this game, you WILL rip your hair out after a while."
23453,"I enjoyed the last season, played all the way through. Now with Season 6 I'm now required to make an Epic account just to play? No thank you. Its why I bought this on Steam and not Epic. Feeling rather betrayed. 
"
23454,very fun game
23455,This is the worst game ever dont play it nevet whatever hpand just do not do that!
23456,epic games supports communist china
23457,Epic account is now compulsory to play this games .
23458,"As others said, pretty fun while it lasted.

They're forcing you to make an Epic Games account to play. This is a mandatory change that will make the game unplayable for me. I use Steam *specifically* because I despise the business practices of Epic.

I understand. Its just business. You won't be getting mine from now on either.

And please process the refund. The game isn't fit for use anymore."

fxck it"
23463,i love this game. So cute af these little guys♥
23464,"Before season 6 my review would be very positive. With the ""improvements"" that the season 6 brought, it changes to very negative. I would not buy the game if I knew I would have to sign up to Epic at some point in the future and give them admin rights to my PC. My name has changed even though it was one of the automatically generated but I am not able to get it back nor am I able to change it to custom name. Mouse cursor fixed to the center of my screen even when I play with a controller. I bought this game in discount for 10 EUR. Current value, after the update to season 6 is approximately 0,05 EUR so it wasn´t worth it."
23465,"The best thing about this game is its potential to be a good game, but it fails in every other regard as the dev team continue to add more game modes that no-one wants to play that are completely different to the base game elements of racing through an obstacle course.

I think every time-trial racing based game I have played has more features, more game-play focus and is more user-friendly than this one. You can't even queue the new game modes they add in my country as they rely on people to opt in to the special game modes and still require 40 players to start, which means the server will just time out repeatedly. There are many ways that these modes could be implemented that would work around these issues, but Mediatonic are either not aware or not competent enough to figure these things out over more than a year of full game release. Some new game modes do nothing but showcase how poor their server options are, like grab the tail. 

Then they go and lock season 6 behind an Epic Games account, likely a desperate bid to get more awareness for their parent company as the game dies out forever due to a complete failure to deliver any content that would maintain interest for the player base. This game is novel, but the developers don't have a clue on how to keep it that way, and the options for different shows are terrible."
23466,"I absolutely love this game! I really rarely play multiplayer games but this oneeee..!! It's fun and it always makes me laugh! I love people who play this game, although it looks like a kids game by its design, it's definitely not lol. Of course its not perfect like all multiplayer games cause it has people who are annoying but its okay. It still worth it!!"
23467,"Total rage game but SO much FUN! I have never screamed and yelled and laughed at a single game ever! Definitely recommended for people of all ages. Besides, the beans are ADORABLE!
Only drawback is requiring an Epic games account to play. I get it, but it really wasn't user friendly. Not to mention that I had to completely disable my security software to fully install the update. Once installed, I reset my security stuff and all is working well!"
23468,Missing files
23469,this is very good game pls install it everybody
23470,"I wanna say a lot of filthy things right now but I know the review will get removed if I say something inappropriate so the only thing I'm saying is:

I guess it's just time to uninstall this game and forget about it for a while.

23481,"I heard about this game a while ago and it seemed interesting. I bought it a couple of days ago with a recent sale. I installed it, played it a little, and thought it was fun enough to play once in a while. Then I go to play it again, for a 2nd time, and I need to create an account with a 2nd service. I have zero interest in having an Epic account to play one game that is mildly amusing at best on Steam. This is a bridge too far for me. I know it seems minor and perhaps petty, but I don't want or need 2 accounts to play 1 stupid game. I'm getting a refund."
23482,Epic Aids account now required.
23483,What the hell? I liked the game since the beginning but I can't play anymore. All of sudden to even get into the menus the game requires an Epic account. I don't want one and I shouldn't need one. That's not what I ordered. I feel scammed.

I want a full refund."

23496,requires an epic games account
23497,"The game was fun and had a charm to it, then along came Epic. Now asking for an Epic Account to play the game, another background service running even though it was purchased through Steam.

Uninstalled the game, I have no time or love for Epic and this trend of separate launchers and accounts is getting tiresome!"

23502,It is fun
23503,"Was enjoying Fall Guys until Epic Games took over as of Season 6. The game now requires a 3rd party (Epic Games) account, which includes an agreement that the user to give them (Epic Games) admin rights to your PC. Not gonna happen. When I bought the game, the agreement didn't include a 3rd party account requirement and certainly did not require me to allow a company to have full access to my PC for whatever reason they please. Time to uninstall."

23510,"This game is very fun with friends or by yourself, it helps you learn the meaning of competition. it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it is about having fun. I have played this game a lot and every time I play I get sense of fun in my body. The game helps my concentration and focus as I get distracted easily. When one buys this game they can never delete this game."
23511,epic account now mandatory :(
23512,"The new update has ruined the feeling of the game and is an overall downgrade. Basically, the new update requires you to use an Epic Games account. So now all the names in game are chaotic lame gamer tags like XxFallGuysProxX. Further, the update has brought with it a large amount of new bugs and issues. Overall, it feels like the developers didn't think about or consult some of the community to see how this change would affect the game. If they fix this update and re-add random names, epic not being required, and fix the bugs that the game might be able to bounce back."
23513,Game was fun through season 5. Now requires an Epic Games account and is completely broken if you don't agree to install the Epic Games bloatware and connect your Epic games account to your steam account. Very disappointed with the direction the developers have taken the game.
23514,very good game. i love this game.
23515,Why do I have to link an epic account if I'm playing on steam you fucks
23516,WHERE IS MY FUNNY THREE-WORD USERNAME. I HATE EPIC GAMES
23517,"Edit: The store page has now been updated to show that the Epic Games account is required.

Was fun for a while but now requires a 3rd party account to play (Epic Games) and makes no mention of that requirement on the store page."
23518,"It's forcing you to put a risky Epic account on your computer. :( I bought this a year ago and liked playing it a lot but I don't want to bother saying anything good about it if it's going to force its users to do something like this so long after buying a game and making it unusable. The only way I'd change this is if they fix that, but they won't."
23519,fun
23520,"Well, I used to play it every so often, but Epic Games had to go and be Epic Games.
You need an account with them to play this game now.

23521,this game is hard at first and it still is. To be honest i have never ever won a round  but its worth it. The pain and suffering is worth it guys.
23522,"was fun till i had to get a epic games account to play, cant recommend anymore"
23523,da bes
23524,fall guys was a good time waster and while I have a epic games acount you can't play the game without a epic acount so thumbs down.

23526,"November 30th, 2021. A day that will forever live in infamy. My house was burgled and my brother had a rough day at work. We just wanted to wind down from a bad day with a light-hearted game of Fall Guys. But on the very same day my house was burgled, EPIC decided I now need to make an account to play their game. I will not do this today. Nor will I do this any day. Good bye, Fall guy."
23527,one of the best battle royale games of all time
23528,"This was a really great game. There was a sense of randomness mixed with skill. Wonderfully plagiarized outfits, silly themes and a great community. 
Then EPIC games decided to make an account required through their platforms. This has ruined this game for me. 

You could of been great. If only it wasn't for the greed."

23531,Enjoyable chaos. I don't like the wait time to get into games but its worth the chaos of seeing 60 people bash into each other fly into the air and fall off random cliffs. The levels also change so even if you think you have an advantage you don't really. Even the most experienced will still find themselves challenged. If your looking for a serious game to build up advantages and take on foes geared to the teeth this is not for you. But if your looking for a fair fight and some random fun you will enjoy this one.
23532,They suddenly made it require an Epic account.
23533,"WARNING: Forces you to make an epic games account after the most recent updates. The Devs haven't been fixing bugs that have been causing issues, and unless you have stellar internet the game is damn near unplayable. This was not always the case."
23534,Requires an epic account now. Fuck off.
23535,Great of you like pushing people and feeling claustrophobic
23536,"Season 6 was updated and now the game is telling me to allow an .exe it never popped before in the admin level. On top of that, you are forced to make an Epic Games Account in order to play the game. Inexcusable as someone who put in 100+ hours to introduce this a year after its release."
23537,"is good
"
23538,"Hey, you know what really sucks? Forcing me to interact with Epic Games for a game i bought that previously didn't require me to"
23539,Was great until they required a mandatory Epic account. Will not be coming back unless that change is reverted.
23540,"I bought this on *STEAM* after watching a bunch of VTubers play it.
It was fun for a while, until *EPIC* forced itself onto it.
I have now uninstalled it.  It's way too late to request a refund.
I'm NEVER again buying any game that requires online presence,
because if I can't actually *own* the game, I'm not paying for it."
23541,"epic games ruined yet another game

first rocket league now this lol"
23542,"I fall & there was a guy. Idk, I've never played the game. Is good but laggy & the grafics is not real 5/7. One of the best games of all time"
23543,literally obsessed
23544,"it is lit, fam"
23545,They made it so you need an Epic account and to have the Epic launcher running to play.
23546,good game
23547,"Suddenly needs an epic account to play. Enough said, tumbs down."
23548,"Epic games....
They truly are the Harvey Weinstein of the video game industry. His tactics also mostly involved going in AFTER films were produced by creative people and taking control of them with ""last in"" money."
23549,Not Recommended
23550,"Forcing player to open an Epic account was invasive.  I didn't sign up for Epic when I bought this on steam,  Keeping the negative review until there is an option to ""Opt-out of Epic""."
23551,"yeet
"
23552,"Had a lot of fun with it, but now that it requires an Epic Games account and launcher installed on the PC AND installed the Epic Online Services without even asking me, I'm uninstalling and aiming to refund it. Awful behaviour from a company I used to like a lot."
23553,That's shit pissed me off Epic Games suck my bolitas
23554,"It didn't say anywhere on the store page when I bought this that I would have to have an Epic Games account.

I've only played it for an hour and a half and I doubt I'll play any more unless they remove this requirement.  It's a real shame because I enjoyed what I played.

Would get it refunded if I could."
23555,"Hate to do it, I love the game, but I'm not making an Epic account just to continue playing a game I've spent over 40 hours on already."
23556,This has been a pretty good game but now epic games is just making this more difficult and this review is gonna stay negative until an epic games account isnt required anymore.
23557,"Loved the game, now is forcing me to use Epic Games in order to play, sad, was nice to play"
23558,Great time waster or to mess about with friends in discord. Recommend highly for casual players such as myself. <3
23559,Forcing users to use Epic Games and automatically installs stuff from epic games without letting users know. Shitty business practices.
23560,used to be good now its a mess
23561,"Fun, relaxing, competitive."
23562,Matias
23563,"it is a fun game and it is a verry funny game
"
23564,"Mediatonic, I don't know what you were/are thinking about this...

I bought this game on Steam to play it on Steam. I don't like EPIC. Neither its platform, nor its philosophy as a company. That is why I have never been interested in having an account at EPIC. And I will never do one because I am not interested in them.

I centralize all my games on STEAM. (I hate the need that all companies want to impose on us to have to use a thousand different platforms on my computer in order to play their games.) And since I bought Fall Guys in November of last year 2021, I have played an average of 20-40 minutes daily.

I was looking forward to the premiere of the 6th season. But what was my surprise when I opened the game after the update and now asks me for an obligatory EPIC account to continue playing this game on Steam?

As I have read, (because I have not even been able to enter the main menu of the game by NOT having; nor wanting to have; an EPIC account), has the Randomw naming system also been changed???

I have played more than 203 hours in a single year. But I think that if Mediatonic doesn't think about FORCE people to create an EPIC account for continue playing, they are going to lose a significant player base on Steam.

I certainly do not plan to create an EPIC account in a very far future, because I do not sympathize with that company.

And if this Mediatonic move has been forced by EPIC itself because Fall Guys is their property, I feel very sorry for them.

Please don't force us (Steam users) to create accounts with other companys when we have been playing 5 seasons of the game without problems. (And the CROSSPLAY has worked very well in Season 4 without forcing us to have anything to do with EPIC.)

Please think about it...
Don't force us to leave Fall Guys because EPIC wants to force us to register with them to continue playing this game on Steam.

It was the first multiplayer game in years that has hooked me for so long, and it really has (as dramatic as it sounds) this decision in Season 6 break my heart.

And despite everything, I am not going to create an account with EPIC, with STEAM it is more than enough for me."
23565,"Had a good time while I played it but I refuse to be forced to join the epic games ecosystem. I bought this game on steam and I wanted to play it in steam only. Id happily opt out of cross platform play if that was an option.

Removed it from my account. Sad that its come to this."
23566,It's the weirdest thing I was playing this game yesterday and having a great time.  Today when I try to play it wouldn't let me unless I install malware that will track my internet usage.
23567,"As of season 6 you have to have an Epic Games account or you can't play the game. Even after creating an account I'm getting popups after games that I need to accept their EULA and privacy policy with links to external sites. Not going to recommend this game until it goes back to the way it was without this outside requirement.

Edit 6/22/2022: You can't even buy the game on steam anymore. You have to pay real money for certain skins in game now too. Basically any skin that isn't total garbage costs real money."
23568,bad game makes no fun with friends
23569,I'm not ok with creating epic games accounts for my 8 year old children. Refund time. I didnt care about the epic drama for the most part. Now they've pushed me to the other side.
23570,"Installing stuff from EPIC and forcing me to have an EPIC account?

..."
23571,What is this Epic game online service bullshet
23572,its fun fr but i cant WIN too many people are good and they BEAT ME
23573,Really sick and disgusting business practice to make the game unplayable without an epic account when you bought it on steam while there was no such requirement. Means if you don't want an epic account you can't play the game. Pretty sure this is actually illegal and could be brought to court.
23574,Fun game
23575,Just a fun chill game
23576,fuck epic games
23577,i like it
23578,EPIC GAMES
23579,"I had fun with it, but be warned! You have to sign up for an Epic account to play it now! I won't be falling for Timmy Tencent's ruse, and I implore you to reconsider purchasing it at this point. Custom names are not worth signing up for another account"
23580,you need an epic games account to play now. bye
23581,actual epic games chinese government malware ethereum miner.
23582,"It was truly fun while it lasted. These shitheads force you to play with an epic games account. If I wanted to play it on epic games I would have bought and played it on there. Getting tired of these idiot developers releasing games on steam just to include third-party launchers. To any new buyers, please refund as soon as possible."
23583,No longer playable without an epic games account rip getting friends to play with you
23584,"guys fallin
"
23585,"Got this game for Steam, now is unplayable without an Epic account, nice going."
23586,"THIS GAME HAS IT ALL. IT'S FUN, COMPETITIVE, AND SOMETHING YOU CAN PLAY WHEN YOU ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
23587,good
23588,I purchased this game and now I cannot play it without linking to an Epic Games Store account. This shouldn't be legal. Do not buy this game.
23589,Epic Games account required now? Nah. Uninstalled.
23590,Love it and suck at it!
23591,"Why do I have to link my steam to epic games? Why can't I play on steam the game I bought on steam?
This change really sucks and I hope we won't see more of it. Even if it has it's flaws I liked steam for what it is and that is pretty far away from EG."
23592,Very fun game its kinda dead but i would recommend this game is realy fun so you should play
23593,
23594,"noice

"
23595,EPIC account WTF
23596,"An absolute fun and chill game if u play with a friend 
Totally recommended"
23597,Now requires an Epic Games account to play. Was fun while it lasted.
23598,it's still pretty fun
23599,"I recently came back to fall guys, forgetting how fun it was.
Then season 6 wants me to both have and epic account, which I will not make AND asks for System access it does not require. Until you fix this I'm out."
23600,"Don't give epic games money, please.... I bought this game before Mediatonic sold out. I'm not only unrecommending the game because of the now-required Epic Games accounts, but because the game has gotten measurably worse since the takeover. More bugs. Less balanced games. Terrible UI now. Sigh."
23601,your mom
23602,If you like colourful beans falling from the sky repetitively then you'll love this game.
23603,fun and entertaining
23604,Unable to play due to Epic Game login.
23605,Just bought it and now I can't play it. Waste of money.
23606,more like uninstall guys
23607,"The game was great before this Epic account linking. Now, it has content updates, drains my memory and is just completely awful. This was a great and fun game, but I never wanted an Epic account (otherwise I would have created it myself without the game forcing me) and this just stupid. Now it's full of bugs and errors, it's literally unplayable. Thanks Epic for making the game unplayable."
23608,"Was a fun game until they decided to toss in Epic account requirement. This is not what I've paid for, and I suggest you don't either."
23609,"Just bought the game the other day, everything was fine.
Now requires an Epic Games account, refunded.

Dirty tactics, expected nothing less from EG."
23610,"Forcing me to create an egs account in order to play, what a scam. Uninstalling"
23611,"The last update (season 6) simply LOCK the game behind an EPIC GAMES account. If you dont want to... well, to bad. they dont let you play the game."
23612,is a fun game to play with your friends
23613,Literally can't play a game I bought
23614,Fun distraction.
23615,it is amazing
23616,Great game published by an amazing publisher. But game got bought out by pure shit :(

23631,"They want me to create an Epic account to continue playing this game after a year+ of fun times without that junk.
No thank you lmao.

You've done it again, Tim. You've done it again."

"
23633,Requires an epic account now. Refuse.
23634,"You now need a EPIC GAMES account. Their terms of service can't be denied and states:

We collect some information automatically when you visit, access, or use the Epic Services. This includes information about your gameplay or application usage, purchases, entitlements, and other activity in the Epic Services, typically associated with your account. 

This also includes websites you visit and computer hardware, they can share this information with anyone. 

I want an option to opt-out of such data collection. I paid for the game, it's not a free to play. I really don't like this new norm of systems profiling me just for playing a game..."
23635,"Latest update now requires epic games to even run the game. 
A very sketchy and anti-consumer move to try and force people who bought and played on steam to migrate to another client. Many would have never bought it if it was epic exclusive but they're trying to bait and switch to get around that. 
"
23636,"Now forcing an Epic game account to play, no thanks rather rub my balls together using sandpaper!
Shame, game was good fun up until they actually went through with this massive clanger!"
23637,"Bait and switch with them now forcing an Epic account, and I don't want one. I hope the money was worth it for them."
23638,fun
23639,"Epic removed the game from the Steam store, requires an Epic account, installs Epic DRM and EAC. Also, now all the cosmetics are way too expensive"
23640,"Very cool game, it is not boring because every season is different and adding a lot of original and fun levels
worth the price!"
23641,epic games bs
23642,"forced epic account requirement patched 1 1/2 years after release, even when you have no need for the crossplay functionality"
23643,"Was all fun and games until Epic showed up.
Funny quirky nicknames are now gone and replaced with ""epic"" nicknames which is badly randomly generated unless you've got an account I assume.
If they ever change it back to how it was before I will probably play it again, as it is quite fun if you can put up with epic. Which I can't"
23644,"Why should I bind the game to external store, if it has been bought in Stream?"
23645,Epic Games account required -.-
23646,"I can't play the game I bought anymore, since it forces you to have an account with Epic Games now.
And I won't support a business, not even visit a website of a business, that uses their monetary backing by the Chinese government to engage in predatory business tactics. 
It is extremely sad that a successful developer felt the need to sell their soul and support the trampling of human rights."
23647,"Fall guys :c 

I really loved you when you first came out, but making me link and epic account :CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC. 


(๑′°︿°๑)(๑′°︿°๑)(๑′°︿°๑)(๑′°︿°๑)(๑′°︿°๑)(๑′°︿°๑)(๑′°︿°๑)(๑′°︿°๑)"
23648,Actual POG.
23649,"While not mentioned on the store page, Fall Guys now requires an Epic Games account to play. The game also immediately and automatically installs Epic Online Services on launch now and runs it as a background process, which I find incredibly disconcerting.

It was nice while it lasted.

EDIT: The Epic Games account requirement is now noted on the store page, but still no less disappointing."
23650,"The changes with Season 6 absolutely ruined the experience for everyone within the steam community out of the inconvenience of being forced to create multiple accounts to access a game you either just or already paid for. not only is it a dumb solution to bring back the highly requested ""player created names"" (which could've been easily stolen and used by someone else and you have no means of requesting it back), it also adds in a bucketload of inconveniences such as longer load time to sign into not only this games own server, but also Epic's own account service and they are known to violate the PC users security and run background apps behind the users back to gain access to information they have nothing to do with...

This small change by all account IS gatekeeping in its most vile form and it single handedly fractured the community in such a way that it might next to impossible to fully recover from because of the scummy nature that Epic is known for, and until this ""inconvenience"" for anyone that doesn't own the game on both systems is removed and changed to something better that should've been the solution in the first place... 

Consider this REVIEW my retirement from the Blunderdome for an indefinite time, which is most heartbreaking to me because its one of the best and most innovative games in its genre that i loved going back to every now and then. But i just can't bring myself to encourage others to get this game and find any enjoyment in it while its infested by an unwanted second account service that literary nobody asked for..."
23651,very gud
23652,Mandatory Epic account? No thanks.
23653,It's good for solo play if you don't have any friends....love the scenery. Tons of fun
23654,"It requires Epic Games account now, all of sudden. 
I have bought game without requirement of EGS account, I want to play game without EGS account, or give me my money back.


Ask for refund.  I know it wont help, but I hope Valve do something with sudden change of course."
23655,"Such a good game but now I am FORCED to get an Epic account to play.

No thanks."
23656,bad
23657,"Was a good game but i hate epic, why the f*ck link to my steam??? and adding sh*t maps with the new season. GG fall guys very nice....******"
23658,"After this Season (Season 6) you will be forced to have an Epic account just to even play on Steam and probably anywhere else with the added Cross play feature also got implemented, for me at least I really enjoyed the game both on the PS 4 when launch (beginning of Season 1) and even on Steam (some in Season 4 and nearly all of Season 5), wasn't around Season 2 and 3. Can't really agree with that decision by forcing people to make account just for this game alone alas it's my opinion, it might change if it's changed into optional. Stay away from the game if you don't want to be forced into creating an Epic account on the Steam version of the game."
23659,It's a game about falling beans...10/10
23660,fun game but why the fuck i need to connect to epic game services ???? dont buy it if your from country's that epic games is ban in
23661,"Epic Game store is now mandatory to play the game which is not acceptable for a game purchased on Steam. 
They install Epic Game library in background without asking your permission. I do not want to link my account to Epic Game. Admin rights is also required to install for no reason. 

I do not condomn this kind of business practice. Do not buy this game !
"
23662,"Before I played Fall Guys, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things haven't changed, but the game is pretty good

23663,"To play the game it is now REQUIRED an Epic Game account, even though it is on Steam. Unacceptable practice.
Furthermore, the background Epic process and the game now require System and admin privileges, not nice at all, kind shady too."
23664,"With Epic's Free to Play launch Fall Guys is full of bugs, cheaters, lag, players who are grinding points by losing, broken promises, and disgusting monetization(all my old premium currency was changed over to a lower one which I can't use on anything).

All Fall Guys had to be was a basic fun game, my expectations were never sky high but it's currently a mess, but well played by Epic as at least it won't be eating into Fortnite's playerbase anytime soon. 

This is a case study on how to ruin a very promising game, better yet a AA studio should make a knock off without all it's baggage and give Epic a taste of it's own medicine(what they tried to Quake with Unreal).

While I'll probably give it another go in a few months, I know one thing for certain;l Epic will never get any of my money again."

23676,"Loved the game and have been playing daily since I bought it a month ago, but I just requested a refund on Steam and I hope others do the same. They totally broke the game for me with the latest patch that requires linking to Epic. Turns out Epic bought the game dev and doesn't give a s--- about the players. The game isn't even available on Epic Store, they just want to link to your Steam account to read your Steam data and do their market research. Link your accounts at your own peril, f--- Epic and F--- Mediatronic, you're both now boycotted like EA."
23677,funny
23678,Out of a sudden it's rquired to have an epic games account to start the game. And no indication of this on store page.

No warning about that, no news, nothing.

23689,"Pretty fun and enjoyable.

For more fun, play with friends, there is a lot to enjoy in this game."
23690,Good Game but with the FORCED Epic integration no longer a game I wish to play.
23691,"Epic Games Account on Steam, well I can't play anymore....all the stuff gone. Thanks Epic Games and Mediatonic, hope you are at least happy."
23692,It's a fun game to play for a little bit
23693,"Needs an Epic Games Account since Season 6...
I bought the game on day 1, got the collectors edition, cosmetic DLCs, etc. and can't play the game anymore."
23694,very good game
23695,"Used to be fun to play, but has just gotten worse. Devs don't care about fixing any of the countless bugs/ issues or playtesting their uninspired maps, and are too busy adding in spyware for Tim Sweeney's Chinese interests.
Fuck Mediatonic and Fuck Epic Games"
23696,"Uninstalled after the latest update forces you to go through an Epic Game Store account, also installs Epic Online Services as part of the update."
23697,"epic game shit while launching on steam
understandable"
23698,"Prepurchased three copies of the game before it launched - requested a refund now.
The game won't launch without an epic games account anymore and I feel pretty cheated here."
23699,Fun game but now requires a Epic Stores Account to make it to the main menu. I refuse to make a Epic stores account because I don't agree with there business methods. It also installs something from epic which needs admin powers on your PC and I don't trust it at all. I hope they change it or the game dies a fast death because of it.
23700,good game :D
23701,"Epic Games = BAD 

Other than that good."
23702,It was cool but i want my godd*mn randomly generated username back
23703,"Do not buy this game, they now force user to use epic account for no reason.

You will need to link you steam account to epic to continue playing, and you will be forced to have epic in background while playing fall guys.

It also now require admin rights for no reason."
23704,there aren't any more hackers because there aren't any more players
23705,I've owned this game from day 1. Now I'm forced to make an Epic Games account just to play it.
23706,"Fun while it lasted, literally rocket league 2.0"
23707,wonerfull game!
23708,"really nice game. Not the best, but it is very good for what it is trying to do."
23709,This is Steam's game. Why do I have to link with Epic account!? wtf
23710,"Love it, it's so fun and the beans are so cute. fun with friends."
23711,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
23712,Now requires you link your steam account to epic games.
23713,So much fun!
23714,"Uninstalling this game for good for being forced through Epic Games Store. I bought it on steam, I wanna play it through steam. Not through some other shit that I avoided so far for more than enough reasons."
23715,epic games... also I want my in game name back
23716,Need to sign into epic while playing on steam Pog
23717,FU with your EGS
23718,love a costume in collaboration with famous games.  physics takes a bit of practice to get used to(about Mario series) but it keeps fun with the variety of random maps.
23719,Can't recommend due to the fact you have to have an epic games account now to play this.
23720,XZXXXXXXXXX
23721,"Разработчики ВЫ лучшие!!! ВЫ убили игру сделав привязку к Epic Games !!! Я искренне жалею о потраченных средствах на эту игру!

Крайне не рекомендую к покупке данный продукт!!!!

Developers YOU are the best !!! YOU killed the game by linking to Epic Games !!! I am truly sorry for the money spent on this game!
Give me back the opportunity to play without an Epic Games account !!!
I play on Steam not to pay Epic Games Company !!!
I would love to issue a refund for the game, but I have already played more than 2 hours !!!
I highly do not recommend this product for purchase !!!!"
23722,its verry nice game i like it
23723,10/10
23724,the epic games stuff makes it run worse and you have to link an epic games account to it now so I don't recommend buying this game anymore
23725,"A game that started and became a hit thanks to Steam, now requires you to create and use Epic Game Store account after they sold out to them once they lost players thanks to Among Us. Do not buy."
23726,"Was a good game ... but then you had to link an epic account.

Wouldn't recommend to anyone."

23730,guy fall

23737,it's a great game but you gotta figure out how it works first
23738,"imagine still not having proper crossplay, cringe

edit: finally, proper crossplay"
23739,"Can no longer recommend this game. Now more than a year after release, they require you to create an Epic Game Store account and hand over all of your data (along with installing some Epic software updates). Never agreed to this when I purchased the game.

If they're willing to suddenly force something like this on people who ALREADY purchased the game, who's to say they won't demand more concessions from the player base in the future? Avoid this game."
23740,Amazing game to play in your free time. Definitely Worth it!
23741,very good yes i love fall guys
23742,"Bought it last week in the sale if i knew that it would force Epic Games on me the next week i would have never bought it.

F*CK EPIC GAME"
23743,"great gameplay. Yes, it does get repetitive but it allows for practice and goofing off. It's better once you have objectives to work towards, so once you clear the season you rely on the events and daily objectives. When you are lucky you'll win a session or have a great team/duo. The Kudos shop could be expanded to allow for a higher chance that something is available that you want (after you purchase so much...)"
23744,very fun game and enjoyable with friends
23745,Fuck ya!
23746,Forces you to make a epic account now and it also forced me to uninstall.
23747,this game is bad because epic game bought it
23748,"Requires Epic Games account now which means I can't play :) since I was falsely perma-banned from Epic over 2 years ago for charging back my card after a hacker got in from one of their own data breaches :D, very epic!"
23749,fun with friends
23750,Requires an EPIC GAMES account now
23751,"is very nice

23752,Why do I need an Epic account to play on Steam? Friggin' BS

23754,"Now REQUIRES EGS login and link even if you bought this game on steam.

It had a good run."
23755,Epic store nuff said
23756,Requires an EPIC account to play the game now. For everyone who has already purchased the game can not play it without one anymore. This is not acceptable.
23757,"Game was fun for awhile but beware, a new update now has you force login to the Epic Games store or create an account with Epic to play the game. I am on Steam specifically to avoid Epic Games so I uninstalled. Also, early reports of being forced to use two factor authentication with your email address."
23758,"This game was pretty decent. They fixed a lot of issues with hackers, they kept updating with new seasons, and it was a great deal for the price. Now it's completely unplayable for me.

Fuck Epic. I now have to make an Epic account to play a game that I bought before they got their grubby little mitts on it. I refuse to make an Epic account, so this game is no longer playable to me.

What a waste."
23759,Requires an Epic login to play now. What a waste.
23760,Now requires an Epic Games account. I bought this on Steam because I don't want Epic Games. This game has gone downhill fast.
23761,go game
23762,Requires Epic games account. Don't bother anymore. I got my hours' worth. Another game I'm done with right along with rocket league.
23763,Let's just say it's fun! (most of the time)
23764,"Good game for 20$, updates come once per month and always add something fresh to make the game more exiting."

this game is for you then!"
23787,Never in a million years would I install epic so that I could play this game. Goodbye Fall Guys. It was fun while it lasted.
23788,"They've done it. Now the game requires an Epic Games Account to launch. Literally. I'm not a Steam fanatic but this is just unnecessary. They might even remove it from Steam and make it exclusive to Epic soon.

All the ""dead game"" memes and jokes will become real probably. Sad.

Edit: What I've said about 8 months ago became true. Damn."
23789,Enjoyed it a lot! Very child friendly!
23790,for me its a cool game
23791,Good concept game which forces you to install epic account automatically and have to create epic account to continue playing 6th season. Good job Epic.

23798,funnnn
23799,"well the game is cute and fun but the control and movement need time to learn.
I think the main source of fun in this game is playing with friends, unfortunately  you can't make any friends inside the game which give you less fun except you already have friends playing this game.
I was following and watching guys who was playing this game from season 1 ,it's fun to watch however there are cheating tools that some players were using each single game,  the developer said something about anti cheating system a year ago however there are still cheaters in most matches in the game until today."
23800,woo
23801,Good
23802,"Hello, First of all, Congrats on keeping it together and not buying in to the hype. I'm certain that this game will go into a full Epic games transition just like what happened with Rocket League. If you don't know what that is, it basically means that the game will move to Epic Games as an exclusive FREE title filled with Epic micro-transactions and it will no longer be sold on steam. Now this is just a speculation but if you want this game on your steam library (I don't know why would you want that) then you might have a limited number of steam sales to pick it up, otherwise I suggest to wait for it be FREE?!? 


Anyway, I'm going to list all the things that tortured me when I was playing this game so that you can feel good, gloat and mock me for being a stupid POS that I am.


[h1] In Game Name Debacle [/h1]

It took the devs more than a year to fix the in game name issue. We've been using prisoner names (aka random numbers) and random strings (3 random words) to identify ourselves for a whole year. And to pat themselves in the back for doing such a good job fixing a year old problem, they are bundling the new and improve in game name feature with an epic games account. 

By the way, this ""feature"" was a frequently asked question and they knew that people wanted their name back. It goes so far that if you ask the devs about it on the proper discord channel, a mod will delete your question and inform you why they deleted it (coz it's FAQ dammit). And if you ask the same mods if they can share any news regarding this matter, the answer that they will give you is that they don't know.

They even included this ""feature"" in a survey so that you can vote for it to be added to the game around season 4. JUST TO BE EXTRA SURE THAT THERE IS INDEED AN ACTUAL DEMAND.


[h1] Lackluster Mini Game Updates [/h1]

The extra maps that they release each season is not enough to change the overall experience at all. You would still play the same old maps and maybe once in a blue moon, if you are lucky, you will get a chance to play on the new stages. This is a recurring feeling that I had every time that a new season is released.


[h1] Uninspired Mini Games [/h1]

Some mini games are downright terrible that if you remove them from the lineup, it would improve the overall experience. It seems to me that these maps exist for quantity purposes.


[h1] Wonky Physics [/h1]

Beans just like to fall on the ground for no apparent reason. It's tolerable now but back then it was horrendous.


[h1] Launch Day Server Issues [/h1]

IMO, they don't have the immunity of being a new indie company now so I'm gonna add this. In fact, it shouldn't been excusable back then anyway.


[h1] Devaluing skins [/h1]

If you are like me and you love rare cosmetics then you didn't lose a thing when you decided to skip this game and their free season passes. All models are repurposed anyway with a new color scheme or minor model adjustments to make it seem different. Case in point, the lvl 40 caveman skin from the season pass was later recolored and released as a cheap skin.


[h1] Downtime [/h1]

There's just to much downtime in this game. From waiting on queues to fill up to 60, finishing a map early and waiting for other players to finish (only to find out that the next game is a team game and you are screwed anyway), long loading times when transitioning to a new map and the unskippable victory screen when you lost a final round to a russian roulette aka Fall Mountain and whatever the jungle variant is.   


[h1] Closing Remarks [/h1]

This is a rant but I just can't fathom how forgiving people are to this game just because it is accessible and cute. They got away with so much mediocrity where other games would've been blasted for it. The silver lining for me is that this company sell out and they removed themselves from Devolver Digital's catalog. I'm just done with this game."
23803,Yes.
23804,"Very fun with friends, but gets repetitive after a while."
23805,"Very Pog
"
23806,"DO NOT BUY IT!
Used to be a great game with malware-service-free.
Now, Epic bought Mediatonic out to apply the worst practice of game development: FORCE ACCOUNT LINKING, just for the optional cross-progression.
They now implement the malware-like Epic service into the game, force us to link our game to Epic just for nothing.
Who would buy the game on Steam and Epic at the same time? NOONE!
We don't need this cross-progression.
BOTTOMLINE: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE OF BAD DEVELOPMENT PRACTICE - MONEY OVER CUSTOMER!"
23807,yep
23808,its ok
23809,"op game
"
23810,"As a new player, stay calm and do it the ""Long"" way.
Doing so will give you a very high chance at winning the first rounds and probably second or even third.
Might not get first place but hey, you are learning."

23834,"Season 6 edit 2
Apparently you don't only need an Epic account to play you ALSO need to install their launcher for it to work.
 After days of looking for help in the discord server and official support mail, they told me you need to:
1) Close Fall Guys and Steam
2) Uninstall Epic Online Services
Start>Add or remove programs>Search for Epic Online Services and Uninstall
3) Verify files in Steam (please do this again even if you have done it before) 
4) Try to Play the game

Chances are you don't have that program so a pre requisite to their solution is to install Epic's client first, then uninstall Epic Online Services and THEN install it from settings in Epic's client. Then you will open the game and be forced to log in at Epic and merge your account.

Season 6 edit:
It WAS fun to play, now many people and me can't even login, the game says its missing files, we are constantly verifying and reinstalling and nothing. In the discord server nobody gives an answer. 
----------------------------------------
Still fun to this day. It's a game to sit back and relax with no compromises with time and scores."

23836,If you like to customize your character in video games this game is all about it! Its also about mad hops if you think your good at platforming and outsmarting a crowd then hop into the fun!

23841,"A very charming and amusing spin on the battle royale genre. Taking inspiration from slapstick game shows, you'll need to outrun, outmaneuver, and outlast a lobby of up to 60 players in order to achieve victory and claim the crown.

There are six categories of gameplay rounds. ""Race"" sends you stumbling through a gauntlet of obstacles to cross the finish line. ""Survive"" puts everyone on a platform over a pit of slime, where falling means elimination. ""Logic"" requires you to play a quick memory game to find the safe platforms. ""Hunt"" has everyone competing to rack up points in order to advance. ""Team"" divides the players into 2-4 teams, where the losing team is kicked out. And of course, ""Final"" is an intense showdown where only the best of the best (and luckiest of the lucky) can come out on top.

While you can play solo, there's also a ""squads"" mode where everyone plays with up to 3 friends (or random strangers). Success or defeat depends on the entire squad's performance, meaning that your squadmates can help you advance even if you falter, or that one poor player can cost their squad the game. No matter your skill level, luck is a big factor in determining whether you win a crown, and that's assuming you aren't pushed into the slime by dirty players.

The game's biggest highlight is its cutesy aesthetic, which includes the multi-color bean characters. There's just something so charming about the way they move and let out little ""woo""s and ""oof""s as they stumble and fall. Plus, they're highly customizable: everything from their color, skin pattern, costume, namecard, and even victory animation can be changed to your liking. Customization options are acquired either through the seasonal battle pass, in-game events, or the store. Sadly, many items are very expensive, making it hard to earn enough to buy them without resorting to microtransactions.

Despite the downsides, each major update every few months adds new themed levels and customization options, so there's always more to come back to. And I, for one, could always use more Fall Guys."
23842,Good game beans go brrrr
23843,"A bunch of jellybeans jumping around crashing into each other. You have to be super relaxed to play the team game modes, otherwise you might burst a vein in toyr head while watching your teammate repetetly do the same mistake over and over again while tring to cross the 1st obstacle

23848,this game is hilarious and i recommend this game to everyone. this game is where you basically just try and play with your friends and try to qualify all 5 rounds round 1 round 2 round 3 semi-finals then the finals. it's a great game i recommend this game to everyone! and by the time your reading this is when the last couple hours of season 5 of this game im addicted. it's great.

23907,Fun when it doesn't lag and other players don't randomly GRAB YOU AND SHOVE YOU OFF A CLIFF. 10/10 would recommend
23908,I love the challenge( some :D) and its a great game to play with my housemate for a few hours it gets you excited when playing. Only thing that currently annoys is on lily leapers with the the big 3 lily's to go up if I fall I glitch into wall sometimes and cant actually see where I'm jumping because the wall blocks my view :( but overall I love the game.
23909,good game :)

23927,"This game has me ""falling"" for it every time. I enjoy the fun mini game style and cute aesthetics. I have the itch to play more than I should but that's the fun of it. The rewards make it worth wild too."

23930,very nice
23931,Game went to Epic. I cannot even load it anymore. Some issue with corrupted files from the epic store! Oh well. I would rather not support a game that treats its long term players like this. I have hundreds of hours on this game on PS4. Its a piece of crap on PC. Upsetting tbh.
23932,"I have played over 500 hours on this game, so clearly I like it a lot. It's a colorful racing game with tons of costumes/customization. The level design is creative. The desync and lag can be a bit much sometimes... but overall I just have a lot of fun, playing by myself or with friends."
23933,cool bean fall

23966,"Fun & simple game. You can grab people & make them fall off platforms if you're an a hole

If you're at the finish line, please just touch the finish line & don't push people off, it's annoying. I almost got eliminated because of that
You'll met a holes here & there but not excessive at least. So far, the a holes are PC players

1 problem about reporting is that you can only report after you reached the finish line which the time period after that is too short if you're not 1st. It'll be nice if you can see who you played with which includes their look last time you see them & able to report them on that list

I've seen 2 griefers pulling the tallest block away from the wall that you need to climb on Wall Guys & they wore the exact same thing"

24034,"This game has it's ups and downs, but ultimately, it's a nice game to come back to when in between games or to catch up on new content. It appreciates both casual play as well as players who enjoy an intense grind."
24035,"Of course epic games had to come and ruin fall guys. First they remove it from steam, then they give veteran player just a few measly costumes and then they had to removed crowns and add their own new crown currency, show bucks. The crown is the main symbol of the game and even at the final round you have to race to grab a CROWN. (I don't mean all final rounds) Epic games also makes show bucks impossible to get and one I had 200 show bucks and epic just decided to take my show bucks away. What I'm saying is epic ruined fall guys. It's still fun I guess but it's just not the same."

24053,"[h1]Ain't Falling for This BR! [spoiler]Fell for it hundreds of times[/spoiler] [/h1]
This might be the best Battle Royale game on the Steam eventhough it's not technically a BR! It has;
[list]
[*]60 players (ninja warrior-like!?) competition in a beautifully made platforms,
[*]Squad Play (Up to 4),
[*]New seasons & challanges to keep it fresh,
[*]Cross-play (playing same game with PC & console players),
[*]Decent jammer soundtrack,
[*]Variety of cosmetics
[*]Decent netcode & controller support
[*]All the sweet (and sometimes tilting) moments.
[/list]
Although this game is (one time) Pay2Play, it is a lot cheaper compare to a F2P game these days. (These fools don't even ask any dime for things like season pass >.<) If you are into this kind of games (human fall flat is the only game comes to my mind) I highly recommend this one. You can chill with it after a tough day or get even more tilted after falling to a random  grabber.
As final words I wanna mention few missing parts;
-It has no tutorial (so you have to discover levels & obstacles yourself.),
-no rank system or leaderboard (so you can play with all newbs in your squad) ((Although it doesn't really matter since you should play this to chill anyways))
-no option to filter your cosmetics and no indication to new ones.

[b]P.S. with season 6 update you have to connect with an Epic account[/b](hope they fix / revert it asap)"

The game as it is is still very fun, lots of new boards, outfits and challenges to complete. And if you are new to the game its the PERFECT party game for a group of (4) friends to play."

24109,"Update: As of the Season 6 Update in December 1 2021, Fall Guys now requires an Epic Games account to play. Without any notice in their Steam Store Page, and I heard that it'll make you install Epic Games application if you make an account through Fall Guys. We never got a say in this, and they'll be hearing from us on their next survey if they don't accommodate the Steam players who have bought the game over a year ago, before Epic Games took over. Epic Games shouldn't be the only way for crossplatform play and custom names.

Original Review (Recommended, 11-26-2021):
This game is underrated to this day. It still gets updated with new content and mechanics. Cute characters and fun minigames. I especially appreciate the new Squad Show modes (Squads and Squads Duos) since you don't get eliminated right away when you finish late or fall off in a survival game.

This game deserves the ""Labor of Love"" Steam Award 2021."
24110,BAD BAD BAD BAD Game NOT FUN FOR EVERYONE delete the stupid game
24111,"Honestly this game has so much potential to be one of the best of the best parkour games, but since the lack of fun and enjoyment is a problem, i don't think this game really has a chance to catch up. With stuff like hackers and not amusing stages i feel like it will need get to get more much needed fixes as that most things were not fixed up, would be happy to replay this game but ever since i played it at first, i don't enjoy it one bit. overall i give this 1/5 tacos."
24112,Frustrating but fun.
24113,Great Game
24114,"A lot like Rocket League where you can just chat with your homies while you do some fun 3D platforming.

24142,One Of My Favorite Games
24143,game is just straight ass.
24144,fun
24145,It's a really fun game although i did like the way you earned the in game currency and how there wasn't really a battle pass i know that there was a pass but it was entirely free but i do like how epic gave the people who bought it a  bunch of things i also don't like the show bucks because it's just knock off v-bucks lets be real so if epic could change it back to how it used to be that would be a really nice thing
24146,Fun game. But play with friends
24147,They do be falling tho
24148,"A fun game to play in your spare time. Devs often don't listen to the community, so it's a gamble where the game takes itself. The servers can be really wonky, but if you don't take it too seriously, it's a good time."
24149,good game for fun
24150,i can only play with 2 other friends in one party wtf. Do you think i only have 2 friends? i have 3
24151,is very funny even is not that popular anymore. i have fun then i am boring and i am happy that i get this game with 50% offer. the sad thing is that i dont have friends on steam and i really want to play with somebody on discord :(. i rate this game a 9/10
24152,sooo good
24153,"This game is just great for relaxing and competing at the same time. I ve been playing fall guys for around 4 Months. I know its lame and too late, but still its great game. Very recommend to play party with your friend. The only thing that annoying is ppl that love to grab. Screw you grabber!!!  XD. 

Win around 355 crown."

📋 | [b]Personal Review[/b]:
This is a nice game to play with friends, the gameplay is pretty simple and a whole game doesn't take too long. The price is slightly high in my opinion, but it remains affordable. I found several bugs due to the synchronization to EpicGames (on Steam?) and the servers of the game that made it difficult to play. If it wasn't for these problems the game would have deserved one more star.

24180,"Loading time too long, gameplay too little. And its always the same thing over and over again."
24181,☺
24182,
24183,Is a great game for taking a break and having fun for 30 minutes. It gets updated with new seasons and the developers listen to the community.
24184,best game i have ever played! truly inspiring. the cute little bean designs got me into art too. every season is fun and like the themes. the first i got this game i did not regret. every map better then the last. if you are all looking for a fun game definitely worth it.
24185,"I'm in love with this game, it's super funky and entertaining. I don't regret buying it, I'm just so sorry that it's population got ruined so fast by ""Among us""..  Because this games deserves so much more. It has regular updates, no cheaters and its very fun to play and compete."
24186,"Fun game, I enjoy the multiplayer aspect for this game. Even though this game can be frustrating lol
The core of the game itself is good, the chars are funny, it's a good game to fill your time.

Score: 4.5/5 
after Update: 3.5/5
after EPIC F2P: 3/5

UPDATE 01-12-2021... Now this game need EPIC to run... with problem in update etc... WOW what a mess, a big no no for me!

UPDATE 2022... This game became a free-to-play game on June 21, 2022 and new player only could obtained this game via EPIC. Gzzzzzzz...."
24187,"The game is a lot of fun as they always add new content and mix up the rounds. It is best played with friends as the gameplay allows you to play the rounds as team. You can get lots of interesting and often cute costumes just by playing the game. Daily goals and seasonal events keeps you coming back. If you like the sound of an accessible battle royale game with lots of silliness, this game is right up your alley."

24193,"A solid 4 out 5 type of game. Perfect for friends or just someone who enjoys good progression structure to game. The progression can be a bit of a grind. However, it's perfect for short sessions on a daily basis. Developers did well enough keep a fresh spin on things over time.

If you need a solid casual game in your library. I suggest this"

Challenge: challenging for beginners, and some secondary shows are challenging for veterans, too,  8/10
Replayability: featured shop items keep you morivated to win, so yeah,  8/10
Personal grade: 8.5/10

To sum it up: Great game for those who want to step away from FPS games, and it's still going strong despite being overshadowed by other games. It is more fun to play with friends, and in the near future it will support cross-platform parties to enable PC & PS friends to play together. I'm looking forward to season 6. See you there, beans!"

24353,Yes.
24354,"Bro falls is a superior game, and it's free!"
24355,"Updated: Dont buy it the game now require another acc to even play the game. you buy it from steam in order to play after you done work. now you need to link your acc with epic game account for it to work. and all my hardwork before this implement gone just like that. dont buy this shit.














Best game for playing and trolling other player. it feels like tekashi castle that i watch in the tv back in those day. but filled with cute beans people. so everytime i got home after tiring work this type of game and artstyle somehow made me relax. also its fun for multiple reason."

The in game incentives to play more to earn in game money to buy outfits items is great, as well as a cash shop to buy more exclusive outfits for the company to earn money. The animations are on point and hilarious when playing with friends. A very enjoyable game for a few hours every now and then when playing with friends. or strangers in queue."
24376,"The new update they're requiring an Epic Games account to play. That's a hard no. I've had enough of dealing with Epic in the past. Not repeating it.

24388,"An incredibly cute and charming game that feels like a nice throwback to old platformers. The game tilts me beyond belief, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
24389,"Fall Guys is enjoyable game for casual play; the premise of a minigame battle royale is a truly great one, and Fall Guys executes this well with surprisingly tight controls and a slew of incredible minigames to take full advantage of this gameplay style. 

[u][b]Unfortunately developers added mandatory Epic games account. So I can´t recommended this for playing on Steam.[/b][/u]

However, the base roster of minigames is somewhat sparse, and several of them don't reach the same highs as the ones mentioned above, with many of the team minigames and Picture Perfect feeling antithetical to the game's appeal. Still, the majority of the minigames are solid, and even the worst of Fall Guys' games can provide enjoyment and fun memories. As long as Fall Guys' dedicated developers continue to release other strong minigames, this game is sure to keep some staying power and become more than the ""flavor of the month"" some claim it to be, and I look forward to seeing how they do."

There is no one game that is always alike! Item shop can be used from ingame currency from winning games, and it's heavily relied on currency, although there is an option. The devs put a lot of time and thought into each season and the remixed maps. Highly recommend!"

EDIT : Steam is denying me the right to get a refund despite having a game basically not working without a third party account that was not mandatory at the time of purchase.

This kind of behavior is anti-consumer because you have no right to refuse the new terms apparently you can't evade the gaming industry cancer that is named epic games.

I will never purchase anything from that horrible company called Mediatonic or any game dev that is vowed to screw their customers like that."

24463,"Stop the clock
Take time out
Time to regroup
Before you loose the bout
Freeze the frame
Back it up
Time to refocus
Before they wrap it up
Years are getting shorter
The lines on your face are getting longer
Feel like you're treading water
But the riptide's getting stronger
Don't panic, don't jump ship
Can't fight it, like taxes
At least it happens
Only once in your life
They're singing, ""Happy birthday""
You just want to lay down and cry
Not just another birthday, it's 30/90
Why can't you stay 29?
Hell, you still feel like you're 22
Turn 30, 1990
Bang! You're dead
What can you do?
What can you do?
What can you do?
Clear the runway
Make another pass
Try one more approach
Before you're out of gas
Friends are getting fatter
Hairs on your head are getting thinner
Feel like a clean up batter
On a team that ain't a winner
Don't freak out, don't strike out
Can't fight it, like City Hall
At least you're not alone
Your friends are there too
They're singing, ""Happy birthday""
You just wish you could run away
Who cares about a birthday?
But 30/90, hey
Can't you be optimistic?
You're no longer the ingenue
Turn 30, 1990
Voom! You're passe
What can you do?
What can you do?
What can you do?
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell
Which way to Never Never Land?
Emerald City's gone to hell
Since the wizard blew off his command
On the streets you hear the voices
Lost children, crocodiles
But you're not into
Making choices, wicked witches
Poppy fields, or men behind the curtain
Tiger lilies, ruby slippers
Clock is ticking, that's for certain
They're singing, ""Happy birthday""
I just wish it all were a dream
It feels much more like doomsday
F*%# 30/90
Seems like I'm in for a twister
I don't see a rainbow, do you?
Turn 30 in the 90's
Into my hands now
The ball has passed
I want the spoils, but not too fast
The world is calling
It's now or Neverland
Why can't I stay a child forever, and
30/90
30/90 (30/90)
30/90
30/90 (30/90)
30/90
30, 30/90
What can I do? (30/90, 30, 30/90)
What can I do?"

24471,"This game has been so much more fun ever since more rounds got added. For once I can play a battle royale and not rage every time I lose. I don't know how this game does it, but it somehow doesn't make me mad when I lose (except for team games but that is a given lol). Overall, It has vastly improved over the seasons with more content and variety. 9.5/10"
24472,squid game but cute version
24473,"My toddler daughter is at the age where she likes to watch me play games but isn't that interested in playing them herself yet.  I got this game for that reason.

PROS:

- The game is colorful and the levels are creative.
- My daughter enjoys watching it.
- There are some fun moments where you yell out loud during close calls and tight finishes.

CONS:

- No split screen.  It seems strange that a party themed game doesn't have local multiplayer support.  It would be fun to play this locally with my daughter but the game doesn't even support it.
- Too many veteran opponents to make this game fun.  It's built to have the appeal of a casual game(like Among Us) but the game has been around for a few seasons at this point.  The competition is now too stiff for casuals or new players to really get into it(for the record I consider myself a seasoned gamer).  I've been playing this game for roughly 6 hours total and have not won a single competition.  Heck, I haven't even finished first in a single round.  And I've never made it to the final round in any competition.  The game needs some kind of ranking system so that new players aren't immediately thrust into the grinder with opponents who already have multiple seasons under their belt.  Maybe the fact that you need 60 people to play a game limits the ability to implement a ranking system.
- Lot's of focus on DLC and paying for skins when the game already costs $20.  I acknowledge that DLC and paying for skins is a successful business model for keeping development teams afloat.  So this is just a minor gripe.  Developers gotta eat.  I get it.  The game isn't a pay to win model so there's that at least.  But its inclusion usually(but not always) indicates in a game that there's an emphasis on securing revenue over making a quality game.
- Since the game requires a large number of players to start, sometimes the game just isn't playable.  There are times where you are just waiting in the lobby for enough players to be online in order to start a game.  I wish there was at least a practice mode.

OVERALL:

I don't recommend the game.  It seems kinda gimmicky unfortunately.  Its fun for a few times but gets repetitive quickly.  You'll get tired of playing this before you get good enough to win.  There's enough hard core players of this game out there to make certain of that.

UPDATE(about a month after my original review):  When the new season started, it now appears that I ALSO need an EPIC Games account to continue playing Fall Guys.  Not necessarily against this if it were a game I wanted to continue to play, but it is annoyingly redundant to need to sign in to both Steam AND Epic Games to play a game.  This little nudge was enough to make me just pull the trigger and uninstall Fall Guys."

24510,This is a good game to play but you gotta be good in this game
24511,"Fun. Occasionally frustrating. More than occasionally, let's be real. But fun.

Prepare to die a lot, even on courses you've aced before. Sometimes it just do be that way. Play with a controller, it's much tighter than keyboard/mouse and much easier to do certain things. Don't ever think you're going to collect all the skins -- it's just impossible, and you'll lose your mind trying.

The character naming rules are goofy, though I understand why they are in place. I just wish it happened across all platforms, not just those playing through Steam. Trying to get a decent name is an exercise in smacking the reroll button until your eyes cross, then going ""Eh, this'll do"" and being called something dumb like ""Inflamed Codpiece"" for a while."

24528,"At last, they've decided to require an additional layer of account-based DRM starting with Season 6: EGS. This was sadly inevitable after the development studio was purchased by Epic a while back, after their explosive hit launch. 

So Fall Guys is firmly going the way of the dodo, requiring an off-site account, changing the TOS over a year after launch, and as a result, I will not even be able to play the product I originally purchased, as I will not be sharing my personal & analytical data with Epic Games. A pity that a refund will not be forthcoming, same as it wasn't when Rocket League pulled this same stunt a few years back."

24546,This game is fun when your needing a break from dead by daylight! lmfao ive put so many hours into dbd that i just needed something different and i came across fall guys. its challenging so if you dont like going up against other people this isnt the game for you. trust me when i say it takes practice and there are alot of people who have been playing alot longer then me and i have been pushed off platforms a few times or grabbed and stopped from winning a level so it can be a bit annoying but patience goes a long way and like i said practice practice and you will do fine. highly recommend for people who wanna check it out but if you are easily annoyed you might try something else. i on the otherhand love the game for more then just the obstacles the costumes are adorable and the characters are super cute.

It's really anouyng when game is no longer about completing races and other stuff as better as you cen when some players can just grab and push you out of track without any risk and consecuences and there is nothing you can do about it.

Fall Guys is a very unique game in its playstyle, and it really deserves the hype it got when it was first released. Even though it may be a little bit hectic and quite difficult to learn in the beginning, it becomes very addictive and fun the more you learn the maps and the levels. Also, squads is a big plus, since you don't have to watch your friends all the way to the finals, after disqualifying in the first level, like in main show."
24606,yes
24607,"It's a good game. It really is, it oozes with charm. But it hurts me to my very core to not recommend this game. Epic has once again done their act and is forcing users to get an Epic account. This was done all the way back with Rocket League last year, shortly before it became free to play. Now I have my own issues with Epic, but forcing stuff like this (including stuff like origin and UPlay for Ubisoft games) is just scummy, and doesn't really do anything...

Really disappointed, but hey, what can you do..."

None the less, the only cons I have with this game is it seems a tiny bit luck based. Whenever i go to one of those sliding doors, it always closes on me. I dont know if its my luck, skill, (or both, lack of) BUT i always seem to be bashing my desk when i play this game. However, it runs smoothly! The scenery is beautiful, challenges are astonishing, fun (Aggravating) none the less fun! Its like wipe out and ultimate ninja had a baby... Poof! Fall guys was born. I would recommend to anyone who wants something challenging, new, and dynamic. Worth the price in my opinion... Thumbs up!"

24617,"Still super buggy servers in Australia. REQUIRES Epic game account going forwards. Horrible user interface. No diagnostics. Vague error messages. Aggressive anti-cheat doesn't like stream deck. Super frustrating. As good as it may be, my experience sucked."
24618,"I really enjoyed playing Fall Guys despite its many flaws and shortcomings (slow content updates, bugs, no custom nicknames, problems with cheaters to name a few). It has a solid artstyle which conveys the overall goofiness and cuteness of beans. I just love it how Fall Guys is open to everyone, available for both casual players who want to simply have fun and more competitive players who try to learn new tricks and simply get crowns. There's something about Fall Guys that makes you laugh after you get eliminated and I really like it how I don't need to stress over elimination. The rounds are quick and you can always quickly start a new match.

Unfortunately, Season 6 will require an Epic account to play. As much as I'd like to play the new maps and unlock new costumes, I don't want to support Epic and their launcher. I don't want to create and use another account when I purchased the game on Steam and just for Steam. I don't want to have something imposed on me, against my wishes. Unless Mediatronic reverse this decision, this is the end of playing Fall Guys for me."

[i]as everyone expected when Epic bought MEDIATONIC... this game is on his way to be another EpicGameStore Exclusive and will require you to have an epic account to keep playing it, even when u launch it trough Steam[/i]

dont be surprised if in the coming weeks this game is removed from steam and start dying slowly

even with all of that you still want to play it, just wait a month or so, since with the new currency/shop that was datamined a month ago, everyone is sure this game will be F2P when it hits the EGS as an exclusive

[b]EDIT on June 26:[/b] just checked how the new currency system works, and its borderline predatory... Remember those collabs skins that you used to buy with 10 crowns? (like Kizuna Ai or Shovel knight?) those are around $6.50 bucks a pop!  and all your unused crowns gets converted to Kudos, sadly kudos are worthless now since 90% of the shop has prices on premium currency

24655,This game is great bc you get to go over cool obstacles and can compete with other people. It makes you tense which is great! But can be super annoying at times. I totally recommend this great and fabulous  game! Yay Fall Guys!!!!!
24656,"Having originally bought this game when it first came out, I decided to give Fall Guys another go after it went free to play since I would get the first post-F2P season's premium battle pass for free. While I am glad that there were significant improvements to matchmaking (especially with having different types of shows for playing solo, with a second player, or with three other players) and plenty of additional maps added to add more variety to each show, what ultimately kills the game for me is the F2P business model being a huge slap in the face to everyone that bought Fall Guys before going free to play. 

Simply put, Kudos are borderline useless for what you can use them on in the Item Shop, any Crowns that players earned before the transition to F2P only gives players more Kudos, Crowns earned now will increase your Crown Rank, which that in of itself becomes a chore with how many you would have to earn if you want reach the max rank and unlock everything, and everything else that you could originally exchange Crowns for? You now have to purchase the game's new premium currency, Show-Bucks, to buy the more desirable items, but with how pricey these items can be, it's not worth it unless you have some money to burn. Combine all of this with how you little Fame (XP) you get just from playing outside of daily and weekly challenges, and you have officially lost me altogether as a player. Sorry, Fall Guys, but after reaching Level 40 for the season and getting the Level 40 achievement, I'm done with you for good."

24668,"I was never really good with this game, I haven't gotten back to it for a while, and just when I was going to over a great weekend, the developers decided that an Epic account is going to be required to play it. I'm even willing to bet that they're going to remove it from Steam sooner or later, so no, thank you. I am uninstalling this. I've had enough launchers and online accounts in my PC, and not even Epic would be a good addition.

Supposedly, my purchase, my choice, but since they're going to take that away from you as well, no way!"
24669,very good cu3
24670,"Pretty fun while it lasted. 

They're forcing you to make an Epic Games account to play. This is a mandatory change that will make the game unplayable for me. I use Steam *specifically* because I despise the business practices of Epic.

I understand. Its just business. You won't be getting mine from now on."
24671,You must play Fall guys If you're finding for fun games
24672,uh its just great banter liek yano just have a great knee slappin time on this yoke and makes me not want to have anti-life thots
24673,"Are there bugs? yes. Are there annoying players? yes. Do I still recommend the game? yes
The game is fun and it can definitely make you rage but overall I like the randomness of it all."
24674,"Fall guys was an incredible game, and I had a lot of fun with it. But now that it requires an epic account... well.... that basically trashes all of the good things fall guys had been doing. I don't have an epic account, I will never have an epic account, so I guess I can't play fall guys anymore? Can I get a refund?"
24675,Epic Account required to play going forwards
24676,Like
24677,It now requires Epic games account. What a stupid decision.
24678,"The game was fun to play and a great time killer. Unfortunately, when the new season (6) starts, it will start to require you to log into an Epic Games account. It was fun while it lasted. :("
24679,"obicham cherni pishki
"
24680,"Updated to Require a Epic Games account to play even here on Steam.

Because Mediatonic sold out to Epic Games and Epic Games is a garbage company only interested in trying to manufacture a monopoly with its launcher on a chunk of the PC gaming industry by paying for exclusives, and strong-arming players into making Epic Games accounts with moves like this instead of actually making a good launcher with useful features and good discounts like Steam does."
24681,"Making the game only playable with an Epic Games account, a year and a half after the game is released?

Bad move. Dead game. The mighty have.....fallen."
24682,Fun party game with friends but only in small doses because its INFURIATING
24683,Requires an Epic Games Account in order to play now.
24684,"The game is now going to require an Epic Games account, so it's now unplayable and dead to me."

And they call it ""exciting"" news."

24689,"At one time I may have given this game a positive review but that time has since passed. Do not be surprised by my low play time I was gifted this copy and mainly play on PS4. 

The final nail in the coffin for me is the now required Epic Games account, and as I refuse to make such an account I will no longer be playing this game."
24690,Good but copied stumble guys
24691,sold to Epig.
24692,Just a casual Fall Guys enjoyer who plays one or two matches to goof around.
24693,"""Epic Games Accounts will be required in Season 6"" enough said."

24695,"It was a fun game that showed much promise.

24759,"This game has a concept that I liked from the very start, which was mixing in game show elements to create one that you can actually play through. With an oversaturation of battle-royales I can vouch for Fall Guys in particular since it's gameplay is different enough to warrant hours of playtime. 
The game is very fun, and the platforming has a fine tuned precision. Also, I recommend using a controller, though keyboard and mouse works just fine."
24760,"good

24761,I love falling with the guys
24762,Played this for a few hours. It’s really fun and easy to get into. Hopefully they will continue to add more game modes and levels.

24775,"Honestly, it's a pretty lit game if you don't mind being chill with getting thrown by other players, cheaters zooming past you in certain instances, and the-sometimes- bad luck you can have that screws up your run.

and it's really even better with friends, I usually had a laugh with my mates months ago."

It's really a shame too, I love the concept, and battle royale games def need to have more genres than just fps games."

24863,"This game was a blast and I had a ton of fun playing with friends and I would have highly recommended this game. Keyword WAS. There are so many new bugs that it seems that content is being pushed out too fast without testing it first. The report button in game hasn't worked in a year, the only report button that actually works is at the end of the game to report the winner. I can't report flyers, hoverers, griefers, and the game has gotten more and more toxic. Before it seemed a lot of fixes were happening faster, more efficient and the game was more fun, but since Epic got their greedy paws on it, fixes are slower, support tickets are vaguer, and it just doesn't seem like either company cares."
24864,"Very relaxing but also challeging gameplay, recommended"
24865,Edit: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TO BUY THIS! It's is going to be free-to-play for Epic store and removed from steam in June.
24866,The Australian servers are horrible. 3 out of 5 games everyone is rubber banding and the connection is lost. It is not my internet connection as this has been happening to everyone on reddit as well. Please fix this issue as I feel the game is unplayable without this being resolved.

Afterawhile of palying the game you'll go up against people who have the maps memorized and know how to exploit them to their advantage. Could use some sort of SBMM to balance things out.

25026,What a stupid fucking game. Actual fucking Cash grab from dogshit stupid devs. Suck my cock.
25027,"Something which most game developers seem to neglect is the fact that adding an item pass to a game with a list of collectables as the player meticulously grinds to get cosmetics that do absolutely nothing, is not what people want and is just seen as a way to desperately add new content each season to try and distract the player-base from the fact that no new major updates are happening, and yet the game company can still capitalise on the younger demographic of the game. This doesn't just apply to Fall Guys, but most other games that have these 'battle passes'. I find it completely ridiculous and just another way to milk money for themselves so they don't have to do as much work on the actual game. While still understanding that the game is not meant to be taken too seriously, it's also important to remember that a game like this one only has so much replayability value. Therefore, I'd like to say that while Fall Guys does a great job in the field of design and performance optimisation, the very nature of the game prevents you from enjoying it once you play it enough. I understand that this may be the case with almost all games, however fall guys has a shorter lifespan in the eyes of the player, which is why it's dying, in the way that among us is. Upon buying the game I had an enjoyable experience however that experience was only present when playing with friends."

25055,It's ok. Very repetitive. I take turns playing with the kids once in a while. But it could really really really really use local co-op. I wouldn't recommend as I feel like there isn't much replayability. Maybe local co-op could bring the joy way up as we could play together. I feel like of the hours logged in for this game come from waiting to play or stepping away from the PC.

25095,"Discovered the game from Miniminter's videos back in August 2020, and fell in love with the characters' and stages' design and how creative could the skins in it be. So decided that it'll be the reason I download Steam and be my first purchase of a game online. Initially wreaking with hackers, the game has now improved drastically at how the devs manages the major bugs and hindrances, and up to now, they continuously add new stages and features for players to keep coming back. Basically, I'm honestly satisfied with it. 1000 hours of gameplay is no joke."

If you've ever played Shower with your Dad Simulator - it's nothing like that game but incredible nonetheless.
Picture this: Joe Biden takin' a steamy shower and all's of a suddens he drops a hot deuce and it gets caught in the ole shower drain.
That's fall guys.
You're having a great time and somebody grabs you and you fall off a ledge.
It's nothing serious, though.
It's not like hunting deer in the woods and alls of a suddens a wolf comes up and bites your neck and you become a vampire-wolf.
It's more like eating a big box of cheese balls and the mailman comes over and slaps your ass a little bit.
It's like watching Rosie O'Donnell on the View talk about politics for 5 minutes.
It's like eating a chocolate cake and then a rainbow of leprechauns comes and attacks you before you get to the pot of gold.

[h1] Honest Review [/h1] 
[u](Review written after 99 hours spent)[/u]
The game was a lot of fun when it first came out as everyone was new to it.
The current state of the game however despite all the changes they have made can be quite stale given how competitive the player base has gotten due to what feels like an aging player base.

That being said! The game has made many improvements since launch!
Fixing bugs, and hacker issues, and finally has what I always wanted, which was a way to play with more than 4 friends at a time, and with multiple different possible game modes.

25388,"[h1] ★★☆☆☆ 2/5 [/h1]
[h1] Lots of bad UX: [/h1]
[hr][/hr]
[list]
    [*]The way it's super slow to go back to the main menu or restart is so frustrating, other than that, no complaints.
    [*]The fact that the game would assign names to us is just absurd, if you're worried about bad names, you can simply get any names filter from google, but you're choosing the worst solution instead.
    [*]We've grown to ignore tips, that's why we would do something else why the game is loading, however, the game rules here is super important for newbies, make the tips show up throughout the game, so that we can see them and read what we need to do, and then we can disable it from options.
    [*]We shouldn't be stuck in a falling animation while waiting in queue, instead, it's better to let us change outfit and browse quests while we're queuing.

I will rate it 5 when that is fixed."

25447,"Bro, the devs need to stop spending their budget updating and trying to revive this game. They need to realise it fell of in a week, make a new and original game, and move on. Seriously stop wasting time on this and do something in life. (The game was boring even before it fell of tbh + ludwig only did the event for money.) don't buy the game, I bought the 32 dollar pack when it came out and regret my decision so much, by the time I wanted to refund it I had played 2 hours (took me quite a while to reach that much because I couldn't play more than 10 minutes a day without getting bored.) so I couldn't refund. Waste of money, please anyone wanting to buy the game just rethink everything you have done in life and buy something else or save your money so you can pay rent."

25454,"Fall Guys is a fun, intense and addictive game which has beautiful level design, gameplay and amazing strategy associated with it. The game developers have clearly put a huge amount of effort into balancing both the interface & aesthetics with functionality, with virtually no bugs at all in the game, and fantastic cheat detection technologies that make the games fun and fair for everyone. All round, it's a fantastic experience and would recommend it to anyone that has a thing for round-based games!"

25461,Always enjoy playing Fall guys
25462,cool game :D
25463,The servers are garbage but i still think this is one of the best BR's ever made.
25464,"I'm still not sure whether I recommend this game or not but for now, I am going to stick with recommended. Fall Guys is a fun game especially with friends but due to needing a specific amount of players in a lobby (Note that I play in SEA servers or the equivalent of it in the game), certain gamemodes are just not playable unless we wait in the loading screen for 10 minutes or more per attempt so we're stuck with the regular gamemode which even that still takes a few minutes from time to time. 

The gameplay itself is smooth and challenging so whenever you win a game, a rush of adrenaline comes to you and makes your victory even more impactful(that or I'm just a bad player heh)

I genuinely believe Fall Guys is a fun game if we are able to play it the way we want and not face the limitations I listed down. But still take my review with a grain of salt and try it out for yourself if you're really interested.

25470,"I downloaded this game and play for about an hour. It was amazing. Why the bad review? Because that hour was the only game play I was able to get. After that, the program refused to open. I tried so many different work-arounds that I found online, seeing as this is a COMMON problem, but nothing worked. I still really, really want to play this game, but the developers need to fix the problems preventing people who spend money on it from actually using the program. Please fix it and let us know when the problem is resolved. I'm currently awaiting a refund, and will rebuy the game when I can actually use it."

25510,This game is very good. the bad part about this game is the matchmaking takes a lot time so you have to wait for too much after a match. this game is addictive and very fun to play i played for about 8 hours and i really enjoyed playing it. in minimum requirements for this game is written that you need i5 proccessor but i can easily play this game on i3 7th gen without lag at medium settings
25511,"Ugh I really hate this so much, I only downloaded it again because my friendboy pressed me really hard to do so, and I regret it.

Well it's not like I really care or anything anymore but I think Epic acquired it only to make super bad changes, like pulling it off steam, and making it free on their store, forcing you to use an Epic account to play in the first place, adding their own paid currency, not fixing bugs like the collision with other players which is totally buggy.

Plus its nature as a game is very annoying, I'm not an ill-mannered girl, I've never cussed in my life until now, it's like it unleashes the fury inside you or something, at least swearing like a sailor isn't as bad as smashing your desk with your fists like my friendboy did..."

25529,Player base is dead. Each new update at this point makes the game less fun and introduces more and more bugs. Events are incredibly boring. There just isn't a lot to do in this game.
25530,this game is pretty epic :D
25531,Bad physics and most games end in under 30 seconds. Not worth buying or playing
25532,Good game. Too bad amogus killed it
25533,"   Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout may be adorable, silly, and simple to learn, but that doesn't mean it's a low-stakes game. Despite the party game vibe, it's still a battle royale. For most of the match I'm content to goof around, take reckless chances, and stop to celebrate with emotes before crossing the finish line. Getting ragdolled or shoved out of contention usually just makes me laugh. But as the end of the final round approaches I'm suddenly taking things seriously as hell. I may be a bean wearing a frilly pink tutu, but I want to win.
   Overall it's a good and fun game."
25534,Wanna test your temper? Try this game.... I hate this game but always end up going back to it. It's a love and hate thing....don't ask.
25535,"Fall Guys is one of the best games out now and its just amazing to play such cool levels and it has a great UI.
It can work on lower level PC's"
25536,игра тооооооооп!
25537,"Fall Guys is that game where it's best to play with friends or play casually (assuming you don't go into matches always wanting to win every time), and that is 100% the case. Despite some of its game design flaws (especially with team based matches which I don't like that much) I still find myself bouncing back to the game every now and then and playing matches whenever I wish.

My Rating: 7/10; Not perfect but a good time."
25538,"Mind numbing bad. Considering that this game has a target audience for kids and the courses and stages are beyond difficult tells me they don't even know who to cater too, Pathetic. Came back to give this game one more chance and I can see why I stopped playing this garbage game. It's beyond frustrating and not even remotely close to being ""fun"". Avoid at all cost's and don't waste your time."
25539,Good game! I wish a new season!
25540,m
25541,"good
"
25542,"I wrote out two complete stories about random characters I made up but I didn't feel they conveyed the emotion I wanted to put into this review. So instead I will just put it in words:
I came across this game when it was on sale for $10, an insanely good deal for how well made this game is. I took the offer and began playing with friends, it was a great experience. However, I cannot lie when I say there is a lack of boobs in this game and I am extremely disappointed. I don't know why they thought it would be a good idea to release this game without them when they are base feature for almost every modern game. I play games based on lust because it gives me energy. It is quite disturbing seeing the thing I most enjoy in video games being absent, I've had nightmares for about a month now. I just can't bring myself to give this game a good review, even if it was one of the best party games I have ever played.

25561,"Even though this game died in like a month, that month was amazing. If you asked me a year ago, I would without a doubt say this was a amazing game. But, the devs couldn't handle the blow up and didn't keep up with the hype causing the game to die. So no, it isn't worth $20 at it's current state."

This is really doing my head in. I am filled with rage that I can't even play? And when I do play, I get FALL BALL 24/7! I have played 50 hours so far and the fact I can't play any longer is filling me with RAGE! I punched my mother in the face when she told me to eat lunch and get off the game, that's how much I love this game. And the fact we can't even play? Like seriously, this is ridiculous."

Edit: after Fall Guys became free and exclusive to the Epic Games Store, I could no longer play in through Steam, and could not use the account I already had. I didn't have more than a few skins, but I still find this unnacceptable. I'm changing my review to 'negative'."

25647,"This game has been a favourite of me and my firends... the emphasis is on HAS.

ever since the latest update this game has lost all it's fun aspects.
The body block got worse and the replacement of client sight with server sight made it the worst.

when you just run forward and randomly start to stumble, or the guy next to you changes directions and drags you all across the map without you having any chance against it, which would lead to you not being able to qualify, you'd think it would be smarter to stop playing that game all together.

That's basically what me and my friends did. 
Instead of playing it for hours on end every day, we check out the shop each day and then do something else, rather than spend our time raging about this mess.

instead of having an advantage for being a good player, the game now resembles a slot machine, where you have just the same chance to win.

it stopped being fun and instead started to be full of bugs and rushed updates, that make the game worse every time you start it.

please fix fall guys, bring back the game that we all enjoyed."

The game was fun when I first got but I started to find it repetitive after a while. Also no one actually plays it anymore. Therefore I have now come to the realisation that it was a waste of money."

25689,maybe abit repetitive after 50 times u play but if u play with friends it doesnt get boring
25690,"If you need a mindless distraction during podcasts, tv etc. The art style, music, and general aesthetic is really a treat. They also change up levels and playlists quite a bit to mix it up. But...you eventually hit a point where you realize that no matter how skilled you are, your chance of winning is still mostly the luck of the draw. 
That can either be a draw or a downside, depending on your karma :)"

25698,"Fall Guys is that one game I come back to because I want to give it another chance, thinking I'll enjoy it, but I really never do. 

It's far too easy to mess other players up which constantly leads to people failing to qualify, at which point they decide to start messing around with others in future games which creates this weird cycle where you'll constantly get people who just stand there trying to stop you from qualifying.

You repeatedly see the same courses and even in later rounds the game you play is usually just a slightly more difficult version of one you've already played 100 times. Not only that, but the same gimmicks are used over and over, you'd think with the seasons introducing some new courses that you'd see fresh mechanics and obstacles often, but you just see the same ones plastered across every new course.

I regret spending my money on this game, it would be far better as a F2P game where you could purchase some outfits and different cosmetics for real money, instead they chose to sell the currency to you in a game you've already had to pay for, which almost feels insulting, although it isn't too difficult to earn."

Pretty good balance of skill vs luck across a variety of game types. You'll laugh, you'll cry."
25722,"Fall guys was a fantastic game and i had tons of fun with it. But it is contuinuously getting worse. Especially the last update introduced so many new bugs that it's just not fun anymore.

-insane amounts of bodyblock
[strike]-stumbling is so random: sometimes you don't fall down when you land from a height, sometimes you touch something with your arm and you're rolling on the ground for 10 seconds[/strike]
[strike]-not spectating teammates after you die/qualify[/strike]
[strike]-buggy annoying sound whenever someone qualifies[/strike]
[strike]-desync between your character and the rest of the game (your position compared to other players/moving obstacles is different than what you see on screen)[/strike]
[strike]-collision check moved to serverside -> you die randomly when you're not hit on your screen but for the server[/strike]
-you get thrown out as a squad although you actually had the position to qualify
-you don't get thrown out but still don't spawn in the next round
[strike]-points in duos are completely bugged and random sometimes[/strike]

the playerbase isn't doing the game any better either:

-grabbing can ruin your round completely while you can barely do anything against it
-in squad rounds there are always guys waiting till the last second to reach the finish so you have to wait like forever

All in all a once great game that has gone downhill recently. I just hope they're gonna improve on some of that stuff, so i can enjoy it again.

EDIT 05.12.:
With the new season updates, a lot of the bugs from above were fixed (crossed out now)

Idk what exactly was changed about collision and stumbling, but playing just feels smoother again. It was an update for the better and i have now changed my review to positive. Also the new levels and skins are great.

However, there are also bugs in this update, the two most notable are the Kudos disappearing and randomly changing numbers and that you can bug out the pipes that are new introduced and then be stuck till the round ends. I hope they are fixed soon!

EDIT 22.12.:
The bug regarding Kudos is fixed and I haven't seen the one with the pipes in a while either, so good job an that!
Also i found out more about the bug where the squad is thrown out: When several squads tie on the last place for qualification, only the one that made the points first is gonna qualify, as if they were not tied."

That's it"
25781,"Great concept and great selection of mini games and character customisation, however many of the games need to be re-worked either due to bugs or latency issues. for example Button Bashers has many latency issues where one player will land on a button however the other player is rewarded with the point. other examples of this are hoopsie daisy/ hoopsie legend. 
other issues i've encountered are objects not coming into contact with character yet character is thrown off the stage sometimes meaning elimination.
as a party game with friends this can be a lot of fun however on your own this game can be a very frustrating experience especially when some players are toxic enough to stand at the end of stages and push others off, or try to ruin someones run. some players also stand at the end of stages showing off emotes with no major time penalty (besides for a very long 15 seconds end of stage count down), holding up the players waiting to move on to the next game. some players even target one person simply for the costume they have on which can ruin a gaming experience.
over all great concept, still needs work."

Save your money and sanity, this game is purely timing and luck, very very very little skill is involved. There's no fun in a game that is so poorly built since every three seconds you loose your charictor because its behind something and it gives you a blind spot. waste of $20"

25824,"After only playing this game for a while, I found absolutely fun to play. The characters are adorable and customisable, who doesn't love game like that? Additionally, there are various maps to play in (however random though) so you won't get bored easily. However I believe one drawback for me personally is how long it takes to find a game, but it is understand due to the amount of players within one main game. I rate it an 7/8 out of 10."

25889,"While i absolutely LOVE the cute fall guys, I will have to say NO to this game.

I started this game after many months just because I saw that Season 5 had been released. I downloaded the update and found there was a limited time event to join. So I selected that and clicked Play.

Unfortunately, the same problem that led me away from the game was still there.

The screen with the guy falling and the message 'Waiting for players' is frustrating.

I waited for an interminable time before it said that 'no player available'.

I then selected all available 4 episodes including the main show. But again I waited for many minutes and it still said that there were no players available.

Of the 12.5 hours that I have supposedly 'played' this game. 6 hours have been spent watching the fall guy falling down with 'waiting for players to join' screen.

The developers should have an option for fewer players to join. And/or for an option to select the level of our choice. There have been many levels I never played because it autoselects the levels and doesn't give me an option to choose.

While I absolutely love the moments while it actually worked, overall I have learned that I can't spend half my gametime just waiting for players to join.

Sad! Because I so loved this game!"
25890,Fun game but plagued with toxic players
25891,Fun game pretty good
25892,"I have about 400+ hours on PS4 and am glad to finally play the game on PC. The graphics are great, all the bright lights on the season 4 maps really shine through and show how much detail is put into every level. The soundtrack bumps as always, can't wait for the next season!"

25951,"This is a bitcoin miner, almost everyone who has tried to dispute this is modded on the Fall Gurs discord server. This game has the ability to limit FPS which I set to 60 which is lower than my hz which is 144, I lowered the resolution, and I went to the main menu then minimized the game and went to my task manager and it was at 90% on my GPU. THIS IS NOT AN OPTIMIZATION ISSUE, THIS IS A CRYPTO MINER. There is a form post talking about proof from a steam support saying that this game was not a crypto miner, here https://i.gyazo.com/90c329787d1c3e6f9205a6584c214916.png . Please remember STEAM DID NOT DENY CRYPTO-RUMORS!
This link has many typo's and I don't want to say that maybe steam support is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the dude who posted this is modded on the Fall Guys Discord so you can do the math. ""Contributing factors to high CPU..."" just to name one. You would think he would fake a better message but these miners aren't the smartest bunch. The other GLARING ERROR of this faked message is that the ticket he provided clearly states high GPU usage and not high CPU usage but the Steam Support NEVER MENTIONED HIGH GPU USAGE BUT ONLY HIGH CPU USAGE, clearly another mess-up from the people who work for Fall Guys. People generally won't see this mistakes because they most likely don't have the best GPU in the world but when I was mined for 4 hours, I had to look into this. This post might be deleted by the dev's but I thought I would get the word out.

UPDATE: I was banned Community Forms on what I am assuming the admins disliking of me. I had a post detailing shady content and actions of the Fall Guys community and I was banned for ""spreading lies"" when I was not and this act is not one of the Content & Community Guidelines.

The owner of this game is extremely shady and corrupt, his first rule on his discord is to not spread misinformation which the posts about the game mining coin is not. He also has people modded on discord with the same icon on steam who go around telling people that its not a minor in the community forms. Any owner who censors to this degree and has other people who try to counter any mention of this game being shady should not be trusted

I have submit a request to be unbanned which should be accept because I have not and will not go against the Content & Community Guidelines. If you want to take action like I am, please leave this game a negative review, report this game, and go into the discussion and post about how this game mines crytocurrency.

And lastly, STEAM DID NOT DENY CRYPTO-RUMORS"

Damn, what a shame."
25968,"Solo shows aren't fun anymore. (rumours it'ssmm and no one knows on what, so if it's on crowns you earned in squads and have zero skills yourself you're frekked over in ssmm)
A lot of cheating, like floating is back too. So you can't win even if you should've.
Show bucks (a new currency) are a overpriced joke.
2000 showbucks for 3 costume set. $8 = 1000 showbucks, while steam dlc's was $4-5 for 3 costumes and even less on sale. And sure you can earn a few in game.. if you buy the season pass... Besides that you can't earn any at all.
Kudos became a joke, which you also barely earn at all.
Some bugs returned
Body blocking and physics still a big ooooof. 
At the moment wouldn't recommand it anymore like I did before. 
If all of that changes I'll happily change my review again if I feel positive again about the game.
Not that you still can buy it at steam and my review means sh!t anymore. But tbh I'd advice to avoid it on epic and any console too till they get their sh!t in order. But that's just me *shrug* Do whateve's you feel like.

The review before the update:
[spoiler]Always the bridesmaid never the bride.. -sigh-

I have a very deep hate love relationship with this game. I hate it cause I lose so much but I love it cause well probably addiction. Besides that it’s just plain simple fun and even more with friends[/spoiler]"

I've tried to refund and can't. The game is a sesspool of boring continuously average repetitive party games which is frankly just overly terrible.

26057,"What is Fall Guys ?

As much I think party games are one of the most fun experience you could have in a coop setting my experiences with this subgenre are limited to mario party only, its good to have an alternative, not just any alternative, a successful alternative, with a big playerbase available for you to hop in at any time with no complications on pc, fall guys is pure genuine party game fun, I love everything about it, from its style, the gameplay, the charm, even the soundtrack, everything about this game is charming, great to play even by yourself but ofc as you would expect even better with friends, some people even forget that this is pretty much a battle royale game and here Ill say its the best battle royale game Ive played, a battle royale game disguised as party game or vice-versa, fall guys is here to stay, what a great game.


Edit: Fuck Epic Store."

26061,"To put it in the nicest way this game makes you want to throw your computer in front of a moving train.
But at the same time it makes you want to play until 4 AM.

Especially when challenging to see how far you'll get when playing against friends this game can be a total blast. Though Team Games seem to always be my downfall and I assume I'm not the only one with that issue, it makes me wish there was a way to not have to play a Team Game in matches but oh well.

I will say that this game can be pretty laggy if you don't have a strong computer so that is something to keep in mind and if you have a strong desire to win be prepared to be playing for a while."

Your friend that has convinced you to play the game will most likely betray you and push you out of the platform.

26098,"Toxic players, a lot of griefers, who will wait u for minutes to just cross the finish before u or just grab u (saw 5 those players in one round).
Unbalanced, u play vs guys who spent more time in this game.
Bad camera view, if something is behind u, u only see your grey figure, no idea what is in front of u.
Some level will punish u for be unlucky, 40 players run into thin hole and u cannot do anything if u weren`t spawned in first line
Control is not responsable and its hard to run at thin platforms."

26102,"The aesthetic of this game feels like they're trying to turn me into a baby or something. It's fun for a while and then I get tired of it. But it was cheap, runs well, and delivers plenty of chaotic minigames like it advertised, so thumbs up."
26103,"Fantastic time killer of a game.  Not super sweaty or a game you should ""main"", but a very fun distraction for an hour here and there."

26115,"Great fun party game, can highly recommend"
26116,"[h1]Fun with friends or over a coffee break[/h1]
This is kind of a TV show about a bunch of jellybeany runners, competing in a set of colorful elimination games until the best (or luckiest) competitor wins the crown. It's quite anticipating to see how you as a player fare against 59 others, who are doing (trying) their best to make it to the next goal. Maneuvering and observation are the key skills to make the best out of the rounds but luck also comes to play at times, when moving obstacles and crowding become a dealing matter.

The playful mood and colorful aesthetic make for a wholesome setting, contrasted by slapstick factor when moving obstacles catches you off-guard or at your poor timing. Such high-pace competition paired with unpredictability that could turn you to a rolling ragdoll makes the gameplay often exciting and anticipating but also occasionally agitating. The first few days, I've enjoyed progressing, failing and winning races at the literal rush of the moment with fellow players; afterwards, I got sneakily pushed off the edge by particularly competitive opponents more than a few times, getting eliminated as a result.

The constant updates and regular daily features proves that its community is well alive. There are a wide range of cosmetics to come by and daily tasks that reward you with currencies and milestone assets. Unless you wear stock cosmetics or features from other games, no player will be alike.

This dopamine-infused, mass obstacle course game has got its Nintendo stamp all over. Although there is a large variety of levels to get through and the competition getting unpredictable, you might feel it starting to get repetitive after a few days. I have to concur with issues of varying loading times and RNG level selection bog down the momentum of the exciting, competing sessions.

At least, I can't help but come back to this over a coffee break to get a change of gaming and some fierce, social interaction without words. And yes, I once managed to be the last guy falling."
26117,FUN !!!!
26118,"This is the best Game I have ever played and the best part is the music of this game, I love he music."
26119,a lot of fun i haveee
26120,"After coming back from the first season, all I can say is... am I in a fever dream?
Are these really humans I'm playing with? Why does the second round end with 20 people, but the final round starts with 3? Where did the other 17 go?

I feel like 95% of the players in my games are bots. They don't play like humans (even children and toddlers act differently than these ""players'). No one is wearing any crown outfits, instead everyone is wearing (without fail) a random assortment of kudos/standard outfits, and virtually NEVER a complete set.

It's bizarre, and it's not the game it used to be. I expected long queue times, not whatever feverish nightmare this game currently is."
26121,"Great game, family friendly"
26122,Does anyone even still play this? Genuinely asking
26123,My name Jeff
26124,"This game is one of those that you find yourself in a loop with, hours of fun going by without noticing. I would 10 out of 10 recommend this game to any one of any age. Definitely fairly priced as well."

26130,"This game has changed my life and saved my marriage. What was once a crumbling soul crushing negative association, has now become a flourishing, amorous, and passionate union between two individuals. And I can proudly and confidently say that all that has happened within my life over this past year has been due to this incredible game. If you are looking for any sort of enlightenment within your life, then I strongly recommend purchasing this game. Thank you."

26134,"best game 
"
26135,if u got anger issues this game aint for u my g
26136,"I really wanted to like this game. Even gave it a year to improve before I made my decision. The player base seems very thin for a game that's supposed to have 60 people per lobby. I played and had the same exact minigame come up multiple times in the same sequence. (It's like, survive 2 matches and then the final, usually.) Even after all this time there really isn't anything too crazy or interesting. I just can't recommend the game."
26137,This game is extremely fun to play with friends and its not a game that is overrun by sweats and tryhards. Its a great game. WOuld reccomend
26138,piece of crap

26168,"bean playing since launch on ps4 religiously - almost every day. super fun, chaotic, addictive, beans cute. straightforward gameplay but takes time to master a level/round. banging soundtrack since season 1. just don't forget to have fun playing the game, I've only won like 7 times after playing for more than a year... out of pure luck. I love the game's wholesome community so much (dead game meme aside), the devs are very cool people. bean game 10/10. (I'm new to steam btw, runs on my laptop pretty well)"
26169,Great game would recommend!
26170,Fuck no. don't buy this shit. sucks ass.
26171,dead game + ratio
26172,Keeps my wife busy. 10/10 would buy again
26173,I would not recommend this game to others. My Wife and I have played this game for several hours and it has resulted in us saying the F word in excess and other things that should not be mentioned. There is nothing worse than having two adults getting their @$$es kicked by a bunch of 9 year olds.
26174,Very Good Game
26175,snake is better
26176,"THE GAME NOW REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE AN EPIC ACCOUNT AS WELL AND HAS ADDED IN PREMIUM CURRENCY



Dead game, devs can't fucking program, community manager has no self awareness. They still haven't given out prizes for community giveaways they did months ago. I tried to get a refund and was denied.






































Oliver screw you You hate Kamen Rider."
26177,60 hours on the game. 5 seasons in. no wins on a childrens game.
26178,Great game recomend for all types of users
26179,"it so fun

26183,when i found out that it required epic games i got into my honda civic and ran 15 people down in a road rage incident
26184,I realy enjoy this gam it iz very fun. Kinda overpriced though
26185,Haganlo!
26186,devs make a squid game mod within a week and put this game back in top 10
26187,very fun
26188,"very fun can play for hours:)
"
26189,GG
26190,"It's fun, it's irritating, it's fun again . . . what more do you want from a PvP melee?

Oh, yeah, it's also got good variety and the devs have done a decent job with updates. They've increased variety, made it easier to report cheaters, and have even taken steps to stop hackers (although they still show up occasionally, it's pretty rare)."
26191,NICE MOOD SETTER GAME. ESPEACIALLY YOU DONT FEEL BAD AFTER LOSING A GAME THATS THE POSITIVE SIDE
26192,"I love playing as a blob
"
26193,"i love this game, its so fun and intense. yummy."
26194,cool game overall but not for the price.
26195,"Even though this a competitive game, I would say it's pretty chill since there is no text or voice chat. 
The mini games are easy to understand even if you might mess up the first attempt or two (or more).
Overall a great and fun game! :)"
26196,dead game lmao
26197,sehr gut ja
26198,very good game to play with friends =D
26199,I appreciate Propella Hat.
26200,Game has the worst events I've ever seen and the devs couldn't seem more out of touch with what the playerbase enjoys. On top of this i have never played a game that inflated the load times so much and had so many unnecessary waits for things to come up. less then half the time in game is spent actually playing.
26201,bad
26202,"Fall guys is a fun game and playing with friends is fun as well, but the one thing i hate about the game is that it really makes you rage."
26203,So fun!!
26204,my love
26205,i like it
26206,Great game if you have friends.
26207,super
26208,"Pretty fun to play if you have time to kill, but it's hard to actually win. This game makes you play matches over and over again as it gives you a feeling of ""just a little more I would have progressed further, next time I will win"". So if you have time on your hand then try. I got bored after a while. but I come back just for a match or to per week.
"
26209,"This game is full joy. It reminds me of my childhood spending my time after school on all types of Mario games. 
Such a good platformer."
26210,Solid fun with friends for in between
26211,"wacky game , many custom items and cute maps to play on . 
yes for some a game that is really difficult (i never won the last stage )  but it keeps being a fun game to run towards the end line . and feel the satisfaction you actually are on the selected team .... to be disqualified the next round .     this is a game that you can strongly love and strongly hate . and that's okay .

26255,Pure happiness.
26256,Horrible game. The game has 60 players even though it should be 30. Its not even about skill its just about getting hit by the various obstacles at the right time. Do not play.
26257,Good ol silly fun.
26258,"Really epic game. Needs more minigame variety tho

UPDATE- I genuinely believe Stumble Guys is more enjoyable as a base game"
26259,It's like League of Legends if League of Legends was an entirely different game and is a fun game
26260,"pretty damn good if i say for myself, not sure what i can say lol i'm not a critic

26314,"""Squid game for children or people who like to unwind after shooting up some black tar heroin""

I can't remember the last time I put my fist in my wall before this colorful puke covered unicorn of game. It's brought me laughter, tears and thoughts suicide. They have also introduced duos and trios so that you and all of your little/junkie friends can enjoy this migraine induced, bright jelly fest cooperatively. Make no mistake, it's not E sports material, just an hour or two of fun with friends depending on how young you are (I'm 47) or how high you are. It's also about the same price for some laced weed so you could definitely afford this game regardless of your financial situation.

Graphics: 2.5/5
Gameplay: 3.5/5
Soundtrack: 3/5
Whatever I snorted before I started this review 10/5"
26315,"The game-show concept here is great. Some of the rounds even live up to that concept. Most of the rounds I played just weren't very fun, though. Team rounds were largely pointless with no real communicative capacity (and are some of the most poorly controlling mini-games, too) and many of the rounds fail to deliver the goofy mayhem promised in trailers and the sillier games instead just being mildly frustrating until you learn the patterns or else having fairly safe pseudo-strategies that will see you through nearly every single time.

At it's best, the rounds are either wild and goofy or surprisingly tense  and competitive given the intentionally awkward controls and the bright aesthetic. When the game spends its time at either of these two extremes, it excels and it is a lot of fun. But it just doesn't get their often enough and you can spend match after match having a properly mediocre time--especially since a lot of the better rounds are further in meaning you'll slog through many of the least fun games over and over and over again whether you qualify for later rounds or not.

I love this idea, and I'd love to see more of this sort of multiplayer experience. I can't recommend this particular game, though."
26316,"Hello everyone, I am a user of a game called Fall Guys. Today i am going to share my thought regarding this game. 
This is a very wonderful and enjoyable game but the thing i dislike is that, some rounds of the game are very difficult/very difficult to reach and these rounds require much practise and u don't get the opportunity to do that. Hence, what i suggest is that this game should have practise rounds of every single type and that too should be single player. But overall, this game is very fun to play.
I hope this helped.
Thanks,
Regards 
A user of Fall Guys"

While Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout isn't nearly as popular as it was around the time it launched, it still remains a perfect video game for what it sets out to accomplish. Its presentation, gameplay, low skill floor and price tag make it accessible to anyone who'd want to give it a try. If you're looking for something refreshing to play with a group of friends, even those who might not be big on video games, then look no further. 


Gameplay-wise, it is the best Wipeout or Ninja Warrior game (n?)ever made. You know, those shows where people have to beat an obstacle course in order to win the prize money? Here it’s a bit different, with up to 60 players thrown into a match, consisting of several rounds. At the end of every round, those who fail to complete the objective in time are eliminated. Not every round is an obstacle course however, but can be anything from a vast plethora of minigames spread into six different categories. For example, Race rounds will always task you with reaching the finish line of the course before a certain number of players manage to. Survival rounds will require you to not get eliminated before a certain number of players does, or a timer runs out. These are then further differentiated by themes and obstacles. One Survival round might have you balance atop of an ever-moving platform, dodging projectiles launched at you, while another will place you in an arena with three giant Rhinos attempting to knock you out. Team rounds, which require you to work with random players towards a common goal to prevent your entire team from being eliminated are all about scoring points, but can either be a game of basketball, football (the soccer kind) or collecting as high of a number of eggs as possible. In the main game mode, a match must always start with a Race and end with a Finale – the most suspenseful, final round of the match, usually a Race that only one player can win or a Survival round that keeps going until the last man standing. Other game modes, both fixed and rotating, focus on specific categories or levels themselves. There are also custom matches you can make for you and your friends.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618963922

Even if all rounds across a category follow a certain pattern, none ultimately feel the same. Additional obstacles will sometimes appear on maps they were previously absent from, so the game can still throw you a curveball even when you think you have them all memorised. 

Still, some are clearly better designed than others. Door Dash, a Race round, is a course consisting entirely out of doors. Some of these are openable, while the others aren’t – with there being no way of telling between the two until you try going through them. It almost completely eradicates the momentum of the match. If you go for an openable door consistently enough, you’ll qualify. If you don’t, tough luck. Other levels that solely consist of multitudes of the same obstacle have a similar effect, though none are as bad as Door Dash.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618967222

The controls are quite tight due to how limited they are. You can jump, grab (players, ledges, objects and some objectives) and dive, so the game requires a total of three buttons to play – excluding movement. A controller is ideal, but the keyboard and mouse perform almost just as well.

Progression feels good, but it could feel better. Winning a round will net you a Crown, the game’s ’’premium’’ currency awarded solely through wins or milestones in the current Season’s battle pass-like progression, called Fame levels – limited to 50 per Season and increased by XP, which is awarded for each match you play. Each Crown you acquire also increases your overall player rank, which awards you cosmetics upon leveling up and is separate from your Fame level. Besides Crowns, there are Kudos, a second currency awarded at certain Fame levels, as well as upon completion of a match regardless of whether you won or not. Kudos can also be purchased through microtransactions, in bundles as costly as $50, more than twice the game’s price. While the game isn’t by any means stingy with its rewards, the progression does feel a bit staggered and the inclusion of microtransactions can’t help but make me think of some marketing analyst or currency designer figuring out how to optimize it best to incentivise a purchase. Even when they aren’t intrusive, they’re there for a reason.

Your rewards can be spent in the store for cosmetic items. Some cost Kudos, some cost Crowns. There’s a fixed number of items that can be displayed in the store at a time and they reset once a day. Simple as. Customization options for your Fall Guy are quite varied and some visually striking combinations are possible, even without playing much.

Visually, the game is a colorful joy to look at, with the audio making it all the more appealing. The Fall Guys make cute ’’oofs“ and other sounds when they collide with each other, and scream of excitement when an obstacle launches them into the air – all of it heightened by a groovy, bass driven soundtrack. It just oozes fun.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618970077

Performance wise, the game ran great on max settings, at a steady 60 FPS. However, the animation LOD distance wasn’t that great, as players and obstacles further away would be running at a notably lower framerate. I don’t know if this is simply the way the game’s optimised, or something affected by the limitations of my specs. Weirdly enough, the game would sometimes drop down to 30 FPS while waiting in the lobby or the post-match recap.
 
Reviewed on the following system:

[table][tr][td]CPU [/td][td]AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6GHz[/td][/tr][tr][td]GPU[/td][td]GeForce GTX 1050Ti[/td][/tr][tr][td]RAM [/td][td]16GB[/td][/tr][/table]

While the game’s current player numbers are a far cry from what it once had, it still maintains a healthy population, both on Steam and outside of it, thanks to cross-play. I wholeheartedly hope that Mediatonic can keep Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout in such a state, as it’s a fun game that truly anyone can play. Even if you don’t end up winning, the little animation your Fall Guy does during the post-match summary shows that he’s had a lot of fun even participating, just as you will. Here’s to hoping it can keep going strong in the years to come, at least as long until there’s a worthy successor.

If you have the misfortune of getting a hunt game in your match, just leave and re-queue, even team maps are more bearable.

26501,This game is so much fun! Especially to play it with friends. Absolutely recommend it.
26502,The game is really fun to play either you want a competitive or casual play. One of the best stress relief after work.
26503,i like
26504,this is very addicted game
26505,"Pros = +
Cons = -

+ Its a fun game to play on your own listening to a podcast or playing with friends. If you prefer keyboard and mouse (tbh i like it more than controllers in fall guys) THEN START OFF USING CONTROLLERS. Give it a try bc its easier to use controllers and you'll have a preference to k+m otherwise. 

- If you dont like competitive game then dont get it since it can be annoying at times.

- I personally haven't got gamer rage from this, but if you get gamer rage easily be aware (in any competitive game for that matter).

26511,"The game is filled with cheaters (some are able to swap teams after a round and disqualify yours to promote theirs) ; many players who don't play fair and just want to block you, push you away. Plus, there is no way to try solo stages to train ; meaning, some stages you come across on round 4 and you have no clue as to what trick awaits you."

26542,Great game to play they are always coming up with new levels and updates to current levels. My kids and I enjoy this game a lot. The only miner issue I have is that they do not have a cross-platform party mode. You just have to get luck and click play at the same time. If they could come up with a way so that friends with different systems could all join one party that would make this game elite!

26629,Mfs are attached to me way more than my girl
26630,The idea of the game is fun but its so frustrating. You have to wait 1-2 minutes on average just to load into a game and then you have the possibility of losing the first round. Its so much waiting and then losing because someone else pushes you off. Its a hard game for casual or try hard players. They should change it so you can't lose and be kicked out on any given round. and instead gain points based on how well you placed that round. Then they could maybe have the final 5 people at the end duel it out. For now this game is way too frustrating.
26631,Hope the cross party comes.

26648,"idk i havent played this gamne since like 2020
"
26649,chill
26650,"Putting this at the top since I think it will help a lot of people: 

Mouse/Keyboard: The BIGGEST TIP I have is to bind your left mouse click to DIVE and your right mouse click to GRAB. You do not use your mouse click buttons for anything else so it makes dive and grab SUPER easy to quickly press, which will make a huge difference for you. Left click is easier for me to press repeatedly, so I chose dive for that one and grab for the right click because it's not as often. You'll be diving way more than grabbing. 

If you are playing on CONTROLLER, it almost feels like cheating cause it is SO much easier. Only thing I hate is you have to micromanage the camera angles a little more for some of the courses that twist and turn, but I got the hang of it. 

OH and hold down the GRAB button when you are making a jump that you're not sure if you will make it or not- YOU CAN GRAB ONTO LEDGES. Wish I knew that sooner. When you first start out it might seem super hard but it gets super easy and fun once you get the hang of it. 

--------------------------------------------
Review:
It's like Wipe Out, the tv show. You gather ""fame"" to level up. You can dive and also grab onto other players to sabotage them, which is a lot of fun. The courses are a lot of fun and there are a ton of them. The cosmetic items are super cute, and the ones you earn in game are way better than the ones you buy through DLC imo. You get a daily random of selection of items (refreshed every day) to buy through their store using crowns or kuddos(?), both of which you earn by playing the game. They have events once a week I think? Not sure how often they are, but there's been a ton of them where you queue up for a special game that gives you a special currency to buy special items with. I love it because while the game hardly ever gets boring, the special events like that give you extra incentive to want to keep coming back. Ton of achievements through steam too. 
----------------------------------------

Here are some more random tips:

If you're playing on a team for tails, please do not steal your team members tails. Working against your own team members is counter-productive. At first I was thinking, oh okay maybe they feel super confident in being able to keep the tail or something? But almost every time they lose the tail IMMEDIATELY after stealing it lol which is hilarious, embarrassing for them, and frustrating for the whole team. Steal the OPPOSITE TEAMS tails.

If you're on a team for JINXED and you have the cooties on you, please spread the cooties onto THE OTHER COLORED TEAM, not your OWN team. XD"
26651,"This game sucks ass, do not buy

""so it turns out, the game been removed in steam, and I got curious why Fallguys got removed??,""

""I checked the reviews and that's why Fallguys got removed, cus' of Epic monetizing the game, I checked Epic and yeah, they fuckin Monetized the shit out of Fallguys, honestly.... they ruined it, from all the old players who purchased Fallguys, I'm really sorry,""

""The game is still fun, but what the fuck do we do with the crown now??, Epic Games honestly, I love you and thank you for makin' some paid games become free and can claim it free for a week, but you fucked up,""

26700,"They removed Legendary items but if you put on special items that used to be legendary it works to get head turner.  
They removed crowns and replaced them with currency you have to pay for instead of winning it by getting good. 
Crowns were impossible to buy you had to win them.
When they removed crowns I lost 83 crowns but in exchange they gave me a useless item they gave to everyone else :)"
26701,"Fun drop in/drop out party game to play with friends. Easy to pick up on, casual to play."

26706,"It's fun at the beginning but after only a few hours you feel the most disappointing thing about this game, the fact it cannot be played with friends online only, or in couch party only with the family at home. Imagine the fun !!!  Hopefully the developers will add this later... There is not even a mode where you can get familiarised with the maps in training/solo mode."

26716,"The game is great. That was until Epic Games has decided to make this experience ""better"". I might sound a bit salty, but it just shames to see a micro transaction system be put in place, with all of the old skins re-ranked. The crowns which were free from micro-transactions have been  replaced with Show Bucks, which is basically Fall Guys version of V-bucks. The game has lost its charm from being a micro transaction free battle royal. Spitting on the people who originally bought the game.

However, all isn't that bad. I believe that Epic Games will make more and better updates than Mediatonic. And I also believe that they will drastically bring the player base back up!

Unfortunately, as a person who originally bought Fall Guys, I strongly despise Mediatonics decision to leave the Fall Guys project. And my negatives for the ""New"" Fall Guys out rule the positives.

5.7/10

26785,As a new player that isn't very good at this game I find it very frustrating. I spend more time waiting for players so the next attempt can start then actually playing the game. I think this will only get worse as more and more players move onto other games. I think it would be helpful to have a single player practice mode.

26813,"As of writing this review, I have played about 15 hours, and I've reached the final probably more than 2 dozen times. I've never won though, because sometimes I messed up and sometimes I just didn't have the luck needed. It's annoying to lose a final, but I get over it in like 2 minutes.

It's fun if you play it casually (like I do). Just don't take it too seriously. Your skill is how consistently you are able to reach the final, not how many times you win. Winning is hugely dependent on luck. This is my opinion, at least.

The Season rewards can be achieved without playing much. The game motivates you to play a little daily, as daily objectives are quite easy to achieve, and give fame (for season rewards) and crown parts (main currency in the game along with a purchasable currency). Shouldn't take more than 15-30 minutes for a decent player to get the daily rewards.

There is no battle pass type system either (yet, at least). Which is a big plus, I think.

You don't need to have experience in 3D platformers to do well in the game. The controls are pretty simple, and the game plays well with both KB+M (my way) and controller (which I've seen people do well with).

There are certain levels that are well made and genuinely fun, some others which aren't. Some are downright luck based. But overall it's alright.

Team rounds are very much luck dependent. The quality of your team mainly decides whether you'll qualify to the next round or not.

You can play in a group with friends/family, which is IMO the preferable way to play. The above mentioned team events might become easier if your group is good. Solo is fun too, of course.

There is a main show, and some other shows. I found games pretty quickly (usually 1-3 minutes) in both the main show and the current time limited show (Squad Celebration).

It's a recommendation because the game is fun, and it respects your time, unlike the other Battle Royale games I've seen.

Thanks for reading, and I hope this review helps you decide.

Edit: First victory after 23 hours of playtime!"

The cheater problem is super low, the amount of time its been out means that there is so much more content to enjoy and the dev team is constantly playing their own game to try and see what would work best in future updates. Fall Guys has never been more fun, I say it's worth every penny.

26915,its made with the drink sponsored by obama run gaming xl s pro air
26916,Absolutely love this game.
26917,"Honestly don't understand the hype, just not a very interesting game."
26918,very nice game i reccomend
26919,its decent
26920,"Decent & fun game, but becomes boring very VERY quickly. I used to play similar mode on GTA San Andreas Multiplayer (MTA) and it was somehow better for me.

Not worth the money and the time."
26921,I like how laggy it is on my pc and tbh its fun even thouigh its laggy. It is fun to sbatoge people at the finish line to get them mad.
26922,pretty fun game
26923,"this game is totally life changing. All I can think about now is fall guys. I cannot sleep at night because I need to get more crowns for the ninja skin. I no longer go to school and only play fall guys. I do not shower because fall guys is more important than that. My ""friends"" no longer like me because all I talk about is fall guys and I can never attend their ""social gatherings"" because I have to play fall guys. I never needed them anyway. Sometimes I wonder if social interaction is a better alternative to fall guys. Then I remember there is no real life version of a ninja skin and keep falling. I think I have severe depresssion 10/10"

I just never really was active playing steam games so I had no reason I guess to download and play. But now that I have this game, it's been so freaking fun. Yeah, it does also drive me insane sometimes and makes me to act out, but its still a really good game! I reccommend this game for sure, though just be cautious about playing it for too long, as you might get upset. <3"

27062,"Bought this game very recently as it was on sale, I must say I am quiet enjoying it, matchmaking doesn't take as long as I thought it would seeing as it is a game which is not brand new and at least to me was somewhat forgotten. The added benefit is that they have cross-play enabled, but at the moment not a cross-platform invite system in place at the moment, but I did reach out and a support staff said it would be later implemented. But enough babbling about...I truly enjoy it albeit I haven't won yet, close calls, but sadly no victory under the belt, I can however say I can't wait for it to have cross-platform invitation/play. If you have been waiting on getting this title go for it now its currently on sale, which swayed my decision to get it and honestly can say I enjoy it, just sad I missed out on certain events. If you will play with friends hands down get it now, but if solo think it through, because although I quite enjoy it I can see others being discouraged playing solo."

27108,Good game 🎮
27109,"The game is especially fun playing during your leisure time. The server is quite good & although the player count has decreased quite drastically, you can still play with quite a full lobby.

27121,"It's a funny party game with bright colors, cheerful music and sounds. The game can get very chaotic and that's what makes it fun. The charm of the game is to dress up your fall guy with funny outfits and colors.

I bought the game on a sale for 9,99 and that's okay. I cannot say this game would be worth twice that amount.

The bad: The levels are rotated and random, but I find they get repetitive quick and some game modes are just boring or annoying. (Tail Tag) Speaking of repetitive: within 5 minutes you've heard all the music in the game and it doesn't change.

Throw in the long loading and waiting times between games and what could be a quick 15 minutes of fun, becomes a bit of a snooze fest.

The game is fun for what it is, but the bare bones package is lackluster. Should be a $5 game at best. Epic will probably make it free to play, increase the grind and bank on ingame (micro)transactions instead."

27163,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout touts itself as a fun battle royale style type of gameshow with both single player and team match modes. The fun stops there though.

This game employs a (horrible) EULA and Privacy policy that seriously should make you question intent.

The EULA states, amongst other things, that you give the game company a world wide license to them and their partners of any content you, for instance, stream or upload somewhere. In other words, they're free to benefit from, for instance, a review or impressions video you make of the game. Furthermore, the privacy policy logs all your interactions (in-game actions and what they call ""patterns"") by posting data to them. The info they collect may also be shared with third parties like holding companies or other business entities to name a few. You can read them both [url=https://fallguys.com/eula-combined]here[/url] and [url=https://fallguys.com/fall-guys-privacy-policy]here[/url].

This is just a tip of the iceberg. They also collect personal data about you from third party platforms you use, i.e Steam or Playstation. I've rarely seen such anti-consumer agreements which completely engulfs whatever privacy the user have left into oblivion. You can't opt-out of it either. 

Data collection is nothing new of course, same goes with games installing software you absolutely don't want on your computer (denuvo and easy-anti cheat amongst others). Most people sadly don't care, but for us that do this is important. Fall Guys is by no mark of the mile unique - there are many other games on Steam that carry this practice. This is about taking a stance against anti-consumer behaviour and giving a straight message to the game companies what they're doing is not okay - one game at a time.

If you want to play Fall Guys you must accept . Some people may be fine with this, but I am not."

27225,"It's repetitive and frustrating, there is no depth in it at all, the only variety lies in the skins variants."
27226,"I loved the idea of this game. Can see why people do enjoy it but this isn't for me. 

Movement is slow and when some of the obstacles are faster than what you can move it's just irritating. 
Relying on other players to be able to make logical decisions on where things are to go. 
Camera angles are mental, even with the mouse to control it, you lose your character to obstacles so can't see what way you're facing to get back on track. (yes there is a shadow through the walls to show where you are but it's not good enough to know what way you're facing.)
Shame, because I really wanted to enjoy this game :(

Improvements needed:
1. Skip button needed for every animation/load screen. (Very Crucial)
2. Improved matchmaking, lessen the time to wait on lobby fill-ups.
3. Fixing Player's camera placing, sometimes the players camera come behind objects and the player can't see anything."

27297,FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
27298,"[original review]

Season 6 update ruined the game. I'm done with these shitty companies that try hard everything to get data.

To play this game now, you are REQUIRED to:
* link an epic games account
* accept new policies and agreements which allows them to steal your data even more
* to install software ""epic games services"" that runs constantly on your pc to track stuff
* run the game as administrator

╭∩╮（︶_︶）╭∩╮

It also crashes constantly.Can't load any map

[edit]

It all started with the above, and now it ends with: the game is an exclusive only for Epic Games. Once again the gaming industy gets worse because of shi tty epic games practices :)"
27299,not so good gaym dont buy it instant refund... plech give steam points uwu

27303,Season 5 has Spelunky Guy skin. Enough said. 10/10 game.
27304,"You have people complain that the game gets old over time. While that may be true, I still had fun for much longer than other games with similar pricing. 

Besides, new content is regularly added: you'll see yourself come back from time to time!"
27305,"really fun.
most fun i've had in a game"
27306,Cute game can be relaxing if you are looking for fun in game and spending time with some friends but can be toxic as well if u are competitive and its kinda easier to play with controller but over all chill game lots of cosmetic to not fill bored after playing some hour and lots of mod and different maps too so you can experience new environment every time playing.

27325,"It's a fun game but can't recommend it until they sort the screen name issue out, because some immature people used inappropriate screen names steam users can no longer use their screen name and are instead given a random three word screen name. Some kind of in game filter would have been better."
27326,"Funny and is a great thing to play to play when you're bored. But it does bore if you play a lot, it's a very sweet game and the animations are awesome, small kids might like it : )"

27330,"This game is so fun! A while ago, fall guys was a dead game but now its amazing! All the minigames are usuallly unique as they have different obsticles. I recommend this game and everyone who purchases will not regret it! I support the Fall Guys community and hope they can develop this game even further!"
27331,wont put me in a match
27332,"Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, a game, I dislike."
27333,"Fall Guys is a great game that was unfortunately hit with the fad treatment. I don't play it much anymore because I got what I wanted out of it, but that doesn't make it bad. The laid back gameplay allows you to go in discord and just talk with friends. The hacking problem is gone, but I will say the fun hackers who would just fly around and hit people were respectable. I also think this game was perfect for my boring online classes where we just waited. Definitely a game I'll come back to when I want to take it easy."

27342,"If you like games where your amazing skills lead you to victory, don't play this.
It's worse than all the BS in Mario Kart and Mario Party combined. 
To top it off, matchmaking and loading times are slow, likely due to other players with weaker hardware and internet connections."

27345,go play on epic cause it is kinda fun now
27346,"Normally I'm averse to battle royale games, but I had my eye on this for several months because it looked fun.

I finally decided to give it a chance, and it's definitely a battle royale for people like me who don't like the genre, it's a lot of fun"

27360,its really fun!
27361,very fun fun
27362,"A cute concept for sure, but at $20 I can't recommend buying into what is essentially a F2P mobile experience with horribly imprecise platforming and lag issues. I personally didn't like how luck-based some of the minigames seemed, and overall I felt stressed and frustrated more often than I was actually enjoying myself with this game. The user experience is also not that great, with lengthy loading screens between each round, an unskippable cutscene after each match that shows you your battle pass progress, and a UI that reeks of lazy console port.

6.5/10 - Decent if you're into these sorts of games, but the exorbitant price tag for what the game actually is makes it a hard sell."

The skins from the store are easily accessible for anyone and winning is a matter of luck / knowledge. Have fun!"

Even so, at least the game will be Free-To-Play along side the release of Fall Guys on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and the Nintendo Switch, with Cross-Platform-Play and Cross-Progression by using an Epic Games account

This game is wonderful and I'm glad new player will be able to play this game with their friends even if they are in a different platform."

27486,"Unfortunately not my cup of tea. At first I thought this would be a nice casual party game, but you will quickly notice it is not. Nothing that a little time and effort can't fix, but I don't play multiplayer games anymore to avoid having to spend that much time in a game.

On some games that is not an issue, but in this game you will quickly notice that even as a beginner you will get packed into games with tons more advanced players. This creates early knock outs so at first getting knocked out in the first or second rounds will probably happen often. To top that off it feels pretty slow paced (expected faster gameplay). To me it seems a bit dull, as you will be either watching or backing out of the game and searching for your next game. Fortunately there seem to be plenty players so waiting for a game doesn't take that long, but it feels kinda dull having to get good, or spend as much on the lobby screen as in the game.

This is probably solved by just improving after some games, and getting to know the maps. However I cannot say this for certain as I already noticed this isn't for me and therefor will not be playing any further.

PS: they have also been lazy on the naming system. You can only randomize, not even remotely pick something you like. I know they apparently had users abuse being able to input names, but seriously, just ban specific names from being used rather than picking your own name completely :S"

27489,"Run, Fall, Repeat"
27490,you can kill furrys if your lucky
27491,gud
27492,I see a lot of criticism saying that its repetitive and luck based and its true in a certain sense. When you first start playing its going to feel like its all luck but once you play enough and get used to the maps and game modes it becomes more memory/skill based and fun in my opinion. There are certain modes where it is mostly luck but for the majority its experience. It is repetitive but the same can be said for the vast majority of popular online games.
27493,definitely stupid. also frustrating. Perfect for masochists.

27536,"This game was overall fun at first. The maps and ideas it had were great. I used to hop on this game with some of my friends almost every night around the time of its release. Over the past year however, I took an extended break from this game until recently, where I decided that I wanted to give the new season a try. However no matter what I do, I am unable to even start the game as it gives me a ""Failed to login, please check your connection"" error. My first thought was to restart, and do all the basic IT stuff (reinstalling the game, checking integrity of files, make sure my internet wasn't crapping itself, etc.). I was surprised when I booted them game again and still had no luck. It was then I decided to try port forwarding using a tutorial I found online. That didn't work either. (Servers are also online so it isn't that). I should also mention that I have never once cheated in this game as I saw some posts about that as well. At this point i'm at a loss, and I really don't care to try anymore for this 10 dollar game. Unless someone has a be-all end-all fix for me to try, this game isn't worth my time. If you get this error as well, I would recommend a refund :)"

Pretty much trash work, there. Game is moderate levels of fun, but total jank like that is a hard no. Fix it."

    I am writing this review for purpose is that whether add Fall Guys skin system that can let player watch all skin of Fall Guys.
   Because of  I majority design ,and I want reference to skin of Fall Guys.Some skin is so cute ! It is so fun or interesting that skin of Fall Guys,for example belong to the G2 skin, and mother hen skin,etc.
 I think Fall guys skins is an great resource that someone wanna found inspiration for design something.I try search the skin on internet,but the outcome make me sad.Because the information of Fall Guys skins are disorder,time-consuming,trivial.I can't achieve my goal.
    So,fall guys producer ,can you make some progress about Fall guys ,let some student who majority design can gaze the skin.You know ,game some time have function both teching and make fun.I am 24 years ago,like draw and Fall guys this game.I hope that fall guys become more better more gamer-friendly!

Don't buy this game. If it was free, sure, but otherwise the game is garbage and I regret the discounted 10 dollar price point I payed.


It gets worse the more you play it. Just straight toxicity because ""I MUST WIN"" and then they lose with you.

The devs must be children.....they only ever update BS and don't fix issues. Wish Mediatonic would offer refunds"
27621,yes.
27622,"There's literally no reason to hate the game UNLESS:
- It has bad lag moments
- It crashes
- Theres a bug/game issue

But those can be solved by:
- Waiting for patches / updates
- Checking your internet
- Updating your PC
- Look for a guide with your specific issue, there may be an answer!

And if you rate it bad because its ""toxic"", gtfo, dude- its supposed to be lmao. Thats why grabbing is a thing. ;)
If you also rate it bad because you cant win, also gtfo. No one wants poor sports here. >:V

Other than those stinkers you gotta watch out for at the finish line,

27633,"On sale for 9.99, can't go wrong. I like the new maps"
27634,is a very good game is reccomended
27635,Good fun platformer
27636,"I recommend this game on sale to anyone who enjoys 3D physics platforming, is comfortable with PvP of sorts, and has friends to play it with. Without friends to play with, make sure you really love the core gameplay and are good with the level & cosmetics variety (more on that later).
Here is what you need to know about items and such:
?The only Battle Pass type system is leveling up with Fame (XP) during the current season (months long), which gives the player a variety of rewards when progressing through each season-specific level, up to 50. No purchasable Battle Pass. It took me ~20 hours of gameplay to reach level 50. Fame only unlocks season levels, which earn cosmetics, Kudos currency, or crowns and fame is not used directly to purchase anything.
?3 daily reward/achievements consist of one way to get Fame (becomes crown shards when max level in season) and 2 ways to get crowns shards.  Each one ranges from around 6 to 12 shards, with higher ones being more difficult.  60 shards will turn into a crown. Nice way to get crowns without ever winning a solo game. Shards instead of a crown can be won by winning a trio or 4 player squad shows as well.
-After 30 hours, I started to notice that the occasional color, upper, and face cosmetics will very similar to others. So that adds to some of the bloat of more common cosmetics to buy.
?Crowns earned from wins unlock rewards independent of the battle pass (not sure if they reset every season?), and crowns can also be used for certain generally more rare store items.
?Kudos credits are earned alongside fame, or credits can be purchased. Credits are used to buy various cosmetics or taunts from a store that changes item types about once a day.
+Link your Amazon Prime account to get extra credits.

As for the game itself:
?A show consists of one or more levels, and each level will eliminate ~20% of the players. The final level will only have 1 winner.
+Solid variety of different levels.
?Each level has one of these conditions: Reach the end area, 2-3 teams compete and 1 team is eliminated, or free for all survival to not get eliminated (e.g. fall into slime).
?Groups of players can team up in a unique show type, but will only win crown shards instead of a whole crown if the group wins (I havent tried this mode)
+Controls are simple and well done, as there is just the right amount of a little physics chaos and control. Grab, jump, or dive are the main things you can do.
?Look, feel, and sound fits the game but is nothing special.
?Matchmaking in the morning, day, or night has been decent. I dont think I've waited more than a minute to join a show.
?Grabbing other players may be considered a jerk move. Not sure how much these result in users getting reported, but I can imagine someone salty doing that.
?I havent seen any cheaters or totally suspect physics yet. Not sure if the server authoritative or not (doubt it).
?Even if I get tired of it eventually like Rocket League, I can see myself returning to the game every so often for future shows & seasons.

Outside of the game:
+There is cross platform play support.
-The game uses Easyanticheat. I havent had any system issues with this. Even though my network router initially blocked communication to the EAC domain for a while, the game worked for at least a while before unblocking it. Mess with this at your own risk, as circumventing it or cheating could get you banned.
-The dev is owned by Epic Games. The last time Epic bought a studio (Psyconix of Rocket League fame), they turned the game into F2P, the game could only be acquired new thru EGS, and the prices of prior DLC content that were brought back to sell on EGS became many times more expensive.
?The game uses Epic Online Services, and requires either an Epic account or an SSO account.  By the latter, I mean if you had Rocket League on Steam, and used Steam to Epic SSO, then you don't have to create an account manually, and that same SSO login will be used for Fall Guys.  I didn't have a problem with doing that myself.  Just know that your Epic account name will be auto assigned. I have no idea if it can be changed if you go through the complete registration process online, which is not required by Steam to Epic SSO."

Customizable little beans to fit whatever theme you want to show off. Play through Dozens of Maps, in all differnt types to keep the game fresh and on your little toes!
Go for the crown and try not to fall!"

In reality, it is a game of ruthless competition, petty revenge, and thinly-veiled Darwinian classism."

27674,The game is just trash its not fun the mechanics suck and the community is a bunch of fat losers.
27675,"Beans?
"
27676,"Played since shortly after release. Where most games would prioritize fixing playability, the Fall Guys team has prioritized features. I hung out for a year, playing each release and spending money on optional content with the firm belief that they would fix their network layer. They never did. This is a frustrating game for all the hit-box, player-location, and lag issues you would hate a bad FPS for. Don't buy. It's all marketing."
27677,"Not my cup of tea, but it's not objectively bad, just very mediocre.
To summarize my experience: I spent an awful time in loading screens and the game didn't feel very fun.
It felt as if mastering this game to mastering specific physics glitches in the terrain and obstacle timers to optimize getting blasted forward faster rather than mastering movement the mechanics themselves.
Also, I got the same frog level A LOT in the 5 rounds I played."
27678,jelly beans go hippity hoppity and boopity boppity 10/10 cute
27679,"I guess after 300 crowns, I should review Fall Guys...

It's fun, chaotic, and a mix of luck and skill. Like all online multiplayer games which have been out for a while (over a year at time of writing), expect to get bodied. Best time to join is right after a season update!

27706,"Fall guys fun facts:

1. Most levels for the game have been designed, created and tested by inmates at sone of London's highest security prisons as part of their rehabilitation process.

2. Weeks before his murder, John McAfee posted a photo of a new back tattoo of a Fall Guys bean, receiving high praise from the Mediatonic team.

3. Season 7 of Fall Guys is scheduled for March 2022. Recent leaks show that the theme of the season is Furry Awareness, with many live events to highlight the possible dangers of vaccines.

Join now and become the ultimate legendary fall guy >.<

update 4.8.22:
really? why would you sell your soul to epic? based on the recent reviews I'm seeing, you guys made a real dumb decision forcing people to have to make an account on epic & use their launcher when WE ARE ON STEAM?!?! TF? If we're on steam we should be using the launcher steam already has. why y'all gotta make it much more complicated for people to play this game? You could've separated the launchers for people that are playing on either of the game launchers but no, you probably got offered loads of money to do this & are gonna keep it this way :T
now my score for you has lowered from 10/10 to 5/10. Do better for your audience.

POSSIBLY MY FINAL FREAKING UPDATE AND PSA!!!!! (6.17.2022): EVERYBODY!!!
ALL OF YOU THAT HAVE CROWNS ON YOUR ACCOUNT MUST MAKE THE DECISION OF SPENDING THEM OR NOT SINCE THE DEVS ARE DECIDING TO MAKE SOME BIG CHANGES (DUE TO SELLING THEIR SOULS TO EPIC). ONCE ITS JUNE 21ST, ALL OF YOUR CROWNS ARE GOING TO BE CONVERTED TO KUDOS (3000 KUDOS PER 1 CROWN) AND WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO BE USED AS SPENDABLE CURRENCY!!! THIS IS SO DISAPPOINTING!! THEY'RE NOW ONLY GOING TO USE CROWNS AS A RANKING SYSTEM.

THE CROWN CURRENCY IS BEING REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE CALLED ""SHOW BUCKS."" THIS GAME IS BASICALLY BECOMING A FUCKING FORTNITE BATTLE PASS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO MAKING THE SEASONS GO UP TO 100 TIERS. FUCKING-WOW. YOU CAN ONLY PURCHASE THE PASS WITH THESE 'SHOW-BUCKS', AND YOU HAVE TO PAY REAL MONEY FOR IT.

SO YOU SEE WHATS HAPPENING? I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TF IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS GAME IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY & ALL, BUT LIKE MANY HAVE SAID ITS GONNA BE BAD. GOING FREE TO PLAY WILL INVITE AND INFLUX OF HACKERS & UNWANTED PLAYERS TO THIS GAME. NOT SURE IF ITS GOING TO BE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE FOR STEAM USERS LIKE MYSELF. BUT- CONSIDERING EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE THEIR GAME CONNECTED TO A FUCKING EPIC ACCOUNT- PSHHH.

ITS PROBABLY GOING TO BECOME WAYYY HARDER TO GET CERTAIN ACHIEVEMENTS NOW TOO! -_-
THE DEVS REALLY SHIT ON THEIR GAME AND ITS SAD ASF TO SEE. THEY COULDN'T EVEN GET PAST SEASON 6 OR A FULL FREAKING 10 SEASONS."

27782,"Fall Guys is a game that seeks to imitate reality shows like Wipeout, wherein groups of 60 players compete to pass rounds of minigames to try to be the one winner.

The game has a colorful neon aesthetic, which naturally draws the attention of kids. The games are all very engaging and reminiscent of basic childhood games like Rob the Nest (Egg Scramble), Virus Tag (Jinxed), and Tail Tag. Some are simple ""race to the end""-type games, and others are team-based. Winning a whole game is quite difficult, and provides a sense of repeated challenge that some children may enjoy, but that others may find frustrating.

The game controls are simplistic and accessible: you can move around, jump, dive, and grab. That last mechanic allows players to grab onto ledges and even other players, which (when done with the intent of making them lose) is called griefing. Although being griefed is somewhat uncommon, it can cause your child to lose unjustly when it does happen. Talk with your child about dealing with griefers online!

Overall, this is a perfect introduction into online video games for a child, and a blast to play for all ages."
27783,I'm so happy to play this game!

27790,Can't wait to see it at EVO

27794,Worth a try (6/10)
27795,played for the first time in months and remembered why i dont play this
27796,"This game was very innovative because it brought a fresh breathe of air into the battle royal category. However. Since the Mediatonic acquisition by Epic games (not saying/implying this has to do with it just a time frame). This game now runs like shit.... Every time I get into the final rounds, hell ANY of the rounds at this point I'm constantly met with a dip in frame-rates and my camera helpfully turns a 180 degrees backwards. This is still one of my favorite MP games but holy shit does Mediatonic have to fix some of these issues cause the game becomes unplayable at points."

27820,"Fall Guys is a very fun & chaotic game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It stands out among other Battle Royale games for it's family friendly approach. Unlike other similar games in the genre, such as Fortnite & Among Us, which rely on weapons, complex puzzles and death, Fall Guys is simply silly slapstick and so will appeal to all ages and is highly unlikely to offend anyone. It can be a bit frustrating at times, especially when you're so close to winning an episode, only to lose it at the last second, but that's nothing new with Battle Royale games. Plus when you actually win an episode (I've won 5 in my 25 hours of gameplay), it's a feeling like no other.

The game is a good distraction from the outside world if needed, and the regular updates keep things fresh"
27821,good game very awsome to play with friends
27822,"It was good when it first launched (2020 August), now it became even worse (2021 September), but the big problem is that no one plays it anymore. The Devs do really care about this game, but it's dead. So now i don't recommend buying this game in 2021."
27823,i mean what do i have to say its pretty fun...just watch out for toxic people

No its not the computer it literally only occurs when playing this game and I am beyond unsatisfied with the product i purchased.( If it was free it wouldnt be as bad ) doesnt matter the quantity of updates this loathesome game wont stop bugging out randomly.

27950,"Fall Guys is chock-full of zany platforming fun.  Every bounce and near-miss was amusing and funny rather than frustrating.  There's a lot of variety in their different level/activity types, though I feel like it would greatly benefit from level ""chunks"" that are randomized, Rogue-like-style.  I also think Overwatch-style replays would be fantastic in this game, especially for the final crown levels.

While I do recommend the game, it's one of those games that you play for 1-2 hours a night, rather than binging it in a weekend."

28009,"its fun, enjoyable, and good. First, i was looking for a crack of this game...but buying it originally was a lot better. Recommend you to buy it,not crack it. the main problem is, matchmaking...it takes years to matchmake! even if i changed my reign! just fix it btw thanks for adding louie baloo and sher khan and mowgli in s5.....lov it!     (posted at 4.1 hours game time).

EDIT:- After approximately 280 hours of this game, i totally recommend it but its pay2dress now since epic bought it from mediatonic. Except this its really fun and addicting. Apparently some rounds are based on luck, but most are skill. Also the more you play, the more you get experienced and the more pro you become. Honestly you need to master the physics of this game, that's all. And for those who call this game made for kids, they are making a big mistake. There are extremely sweaty players craving for wins, and grabbers(griefers) too, so you need to watch out. That's all. Thanks (Posted at 276 hours game time)."

28027,"I've spent a ton of time playing this game, so I want to do my best to give an honest review of the game and do it justice.

A basic explanation on what the game is, would be a colorful and eye-popping battle royal style game that includes a multitude of different rounds to play - including solo race rounds, puzzle rounds, and skill based rounds. Team rounds are also a staple of the game play, pairing you up with random players in your lobby to work towards a common goal. However, there is only one crown, and therefore can only be one winner! In some cases there can be multiple winners, but for this to happen you have to have cooperation with the rest of the lobby and some skill in order to time out rounds.

The game play feels choppy at times, is the best way I can describe it. The crowd physics in the game, regarding interacting with other players through running into their character or grabbing them for different purposes, has from day one been an ongoing issue. While some games you can play with no issues and great server connection, other games will have you frustrated, especially in game modes requiring the grabbing aspect to either steal tails, hold Pegwins or trying to fight back against someone trying to grief you. I feel like it'll forever be an issue in the game, because the problem seems to be much deeper than just a simple patch can fix. I understand that this issue can be a deal breaker for new players, and I want to reiterate that it will become a problem for every player at some point.

For a game that looks colorful and fun and simple to play, there is a strong competitive player base that makes the games much more difficult for unsuspecting players. There are some people who will be able to pick up the game quickly and roll with the punches, but for most players there is a learning curve involved. I'm currently, as of this review, still under 600 crowns in total with 900 hours of playtime. I personally enjoy playing the game with friends, however, and spend a lot of time in game modes such as Squads Show and 2-3 man squads. This isn't a game that I think you can solely play competitively, and if you're going to continue coming back to the game you should find a way to have fun while playing! That can be any reason - grief other players, play with friends, or helping other players win. There's an amazing scene of streamers and players on Twitch that really got me hooked on the game, and I encourage anyone looking for other players to check out someone they like on that site! Personally I recommend DjBigRuss and CrazyyTrainn, but there are plenty of people to chat and play with!

Overall, it's a game - there will be plenty of people who enjoy it, and many others who dislike it. There's plenty of players online however, and finding a match doesn't take very long at all. With all the different levels and variations of those levels, along with an interactive media team and a development team that brings new content to the game as soon as they can. I recommend giving the game a chance at some point, if you're not willing to spend $20 for it then wait until it goes on sale. It's a wonderful game and I've met some wonderful people I don't think I would have met without this game, and it'll forever be a game that I have a ton of love for."

As everyone who reads this knows I will be doing positive, it is not just because of the fact that I got the game for free, and that I got it from working with the owners, it is the fact that this game is an instant classic, although it has been slowly dying, every time a new season drops, everyone comes back, I would suggest this game, due to the fun you can have with friends and family. It is an instant hit for me, and for my friends."

It is unfortunate that we lost so much of the player population due to the unbearable hacker problem a few seasons back, but at least the game is still here and the developers are still running a lot of content and fresh ideas for the players!"

28100,"Fall Guys is an enjoyable game for both newbies and pros alike. Although it is a mass elimination style game, it's fun regardless of whether you win or lose. Wins feel more earned than random, and you feel accomplished when you get better and better the more you play, finding yourself progressing through to the further levels. The goofy environment of Fall Guys gives it a lighthearted that's easy to love, and the controls feel responsive and satisfying. 

There are always players that will ruin your fun, such as those who intentionally grab and attempt to push you off a ledge to grief you, but the developers actively discourage this type of gameplay. It's great to see them so involved with their fans, respond to feedback with surveys, and generally are actively always making new levels and costumes to keep the game interesting. I've played since Season 1, and feel like those coming into the game now are spoiled with the variety they have these days. 

Although the game has trouble holding most people's attention for very long, I'd say it's 100% worth a try to play with friends at the very least. Run around with friends on voice chat and have fun laughing at each other."
28101,im better than bw44883
28102,Absolutely fun to play with friend xD
28103,"[b]+[/b]

I put off purchasing it as I missed the initial hype but picked it up a little after season 5 started and queues are still fast with plenty of active players. There are lots of cosmetics to collect in the shop which rotates every day, earning the credits & crowns to purchase them isn't [i]too[/i] grindy and sooner or later you'll get a decent stash. 
The events usually give you some time to complete and you don't have to 100% the goals to collect everything [i](thank goodness, squad wins can be the most frustrating thing).[/i]
There is a great rotation of mini-games and 4 game modes to choose from, which changes every few days. Plus there is an option to host or join games with your friends. [i](I recommend joining the official Discord server if you want to team up but don't have people to play with - link on the Fall Guys website).[/i]
There is no communication between players in-game. I am most certainly putting this in the good points side of things as several of the games really pit you against each other or make you rely on others to get through quickly.

[b]-[/b]

The music is very catchy but repetitive and there are quite a few noisy emotes which get spammed often so turning down the sound and popping on a podcast/your own music is best if you have a longer play session. 
You do sometimes meet trolls who will wait out the timer before crossing the finish line but it's not overly common.



I recommend watching videos/reading guides to learn the little tricks and shortcuts if you want to give yourself an edge/consistently get to the finals & win. 
There is a grabbing players mechanic so be prepared for hugs & wrestling matches, sometimes tactical, sometimes just for the sake of it. Be wary near edges!

Overall, it's an enjoyable little game to play solo or with friends."

28222,"Physics and servers are awful. constant dsync issues as well as not knowing how gravity or physics work. multiple features in game do not work and when trying to find ""local"" (a whole country) cannot find games. fix your servers and your game so the community isn't complaining about the same things since season 1."

28245,this is a great game as maddening as it can get.
28246,10/10  but could be cheaper. its fun and easy controls tho
28247,gud gam
28248,really fun to play with friends we where laughing for hours
28249,"I played this game a lot, until I couldn't because some guy spilled his water onto the live servers and I couldn't get in matches with my friends. I can't understand the new modes. Fall guys more like No Guys"
28250,"Personally, I enjoy it. It's not for everyone. You have to be willing to deal with the inconsistent (and intentional) physics of the game, and you'll definitely need to practice your platforming abilities. After almost 100 hours though, I find it rather funny and great. I recommend playing with friends and not taking it too seriously. It's best that way.

Personal Score: 8/10"
28251,"Unless you're playing with friends for laughs, this can be a very frustrating game to play if you're trying to win.

It's a two edge sword, on the one hand if you want a free, don't care, mindless game then it's perfect. You can troll others, try to play what is effectively interactive 'marbles' as you see on Twitch, mixed with the battlegrounds type game of PUBG.

On the other hand, if you're playing repeatedly in trying to win, well only 25% of the playerbase has won a game, but over 90% of the player base has hit other players, or done so while rolling around. That should tell you a lot.

It's enjoyably brainless, but that only lasts so long by yourself."

Although it can be highly addictive."
28330,good lol
28331,im bouta whip my keyboard against my monitor
28332,"This game is a good play initially but quickly turns boring. The craze is going downhill and the controls continue to be clunky, Suggested buy only if available on sale and way too cheaper than its Normal cost."
28333,"Stupidly fun and addicting as heck.  Though some of those levels are mad inducing.

Only problem I have is that the reporting button doesn't work.  People know it doesn't work so you have some cheaters and a lot of time wasters.  Time wasters are worse then the cheaters.  They'll just stand around and run the time out.  Wasting everybody's time."
28334,i am. putting. my balls. in yo jaw
28335,"Absolutely the worst, best game I've ever played. Just after turning the game on you'll be yelling at people to get out of the way or to stop grabbing you. The amount of fun you'll get out of this game is unwittingly ridiculous but you have to be weary not to punch a hole through your monitor. I hate this game so much that I've recommended it to all of my friends! 10 out of 10 the most stressful game when it comes to other people being the reason you couldn't place Top 40, 7.5 out of 10 times."
28336,fall guys is very fun
28337,well well well. where should i start. very good game. little beans race to the finish and if you do not win you are executed. reminds me a lot of the hunger games movies. fortunately i am catnis everdene and i shall claim my victory as such. let the games begin.

i dont like that you cant chang your name .
this game should allow to chang your name to something that is appropriate at least"
28353,very fun game!

28358,fun game with friends
28359,"Entertaining, family friendly and a relaxed game."
28360,gg
28361,"Fall Guys is definitely a fun game, however, I genuinely believe it reaches its true potential when you have friends to also jump in on it to try and win that crown! I am not sure to why but I have always preferred playing the game with friends when compared to being on my own.

However, it is a wonderful package of multiple interesting levels to make it feel fresh and slightly challenging. The addition of new seasons is also a nice touch and helps keep the game fresh without making the player feel a constant repetition which will led them to lose interest.

Overall, I would say its worth picking up if you have friends to play it with!"
28362,This is the best game i have ever played.I think no game is better than this one.You can enjoy with your friends.
28363,"Very good game. Buy it
"
28364,"Really like it, it's fun and competitive. Got some nice costumes too. The beans are fun but some of the game modes can be frustrating if you aren't playing with your own party of friends."

28387,Fall Guys is probably one of the most fun-filled games I've ever played. I love how much customisation options there are and how many different levels you can play. I would say it is quite rage indulging but I really enjoy it. I would recommend for 7+ as it does have some levels that would be harder for younger children. Definitely recommend. :)

28442,"This game is one of those that is stressful, but addicting. It is a very fun game with a similar concept to Fortnite as to where many people join in at the beginning of the game, and the last palyer standing wins. The character is hard to control. I enjoy many of the levels, but there are a couple which are too difficult for me such as Hoopsie Legends and Bubble Trouble. Overall, it is a fun game if you are a sucker for pain."

Played this game on PS5 and was impressed so I bought another copy on PC. The PS5 version seems to find players faster than PC, but PC has better graphics. Since few months ago there seems to be huge update on the game. So many new levels. I just wish more people play this game?

Also PC players are way better than PS5 players."

28507,Fall Guys has been a great experience for me. Although the game is a bit boring now as we have to do the same things again and again. I would suggest 7 maps per season and frequent updates. I would rte this game a 3.5/5 or 7.5/10.

"
28632,"Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.

It's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!"
28633,Very good game its fun but sometimes you get the same levels
28634,funny game :D

28662,"If your tired of playing online games that require you to actively use your brain and try your hardest to win, Fall Guys has got you covered. It's easy to pick up and play, the game's skill ceiling is incredibly low, the rounds you participate in are simple and easy to grasp, and while there are some techniques that can aid you in winning a match, they're not necessary to learn."

28732,Probably more enjoyable in groups rather than solo.
28733,They should have added a map editor as soon as possible. Hype is dead and soon the game will be as well.
28734,"Announced at E3 2019 and released at summer 2020, already making a big sensation at its release, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout quickly established itself as the reference of the Battle Royale, fun and peaceful. The principle of the game is quite simple, you start at 60 players, and you must finish first after 5 random events. A handful of players are eliminated at the end of each round. You will have to overcome the traps and obstacles that accumulate on your course. The events are more delirious and crazy each other; balance on a swing, striking open/closed doors, avoid the horns of a rhinoceros, jump over a turnstile that turns faster and faster, collecting eggs, catch a penguin, etc. The races are all fraught with pitfalls! Also, you can customize your bean (the characters in the game) with different skins and costumes using the ""Kudos"" points (the money of the game) and crowns that you earn thanks to the fruit of your hard work.

""Colorful and fun, this Battle Royale is an ocean of joy and good humor! To try it, is to adopt it. Of course, we sometimes complain; we hit each other, we catch each other, we slip, we fall, we lose... But it is always with a smile that we restart a game (the very essence of a good Battle Royale). And when you finish number one, what a satisfaction! I would compare this Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout to a sweet; pretty, colorful, generous, you want to eat it often, and eat it even more (until diabetic, I agree), but what a treat! It is also a bit of a favorite teddy bear that doesn't leave your room, he's cute and funny, why not play with him anymore!! A kind of Proust madeleine of modern video games. I recommend this game.""

Signed by Cyrille aka Angels fight devils with grace."
28735,"Its a really fun game, ideal if you are looking for a fun chaotic platform game.

It mixes the best and worst parts of a party game, the incredible anger, the joy, the weird and unexpected, its a game mostly made for fun but which lets you try to be competitive if you choose, as there are guys trying to find the quickest ways to finish the racing stages.

Winning depends on equal parts skill and luck, and the only thing to gain are silly new costumes to wow the competition. Its probably the most healthy BR style game there is."
28736,"Funny & quirky large scale multiplayer-only 3D Platform Racing game.

- Requires an EPIC Games Account to login + Mandatory Inter-Platform connection.
- New Bugs & Crashes.
- PAY 2 WIN system.
- Lots of Griefers trying to gain fame (either by stalling game time or pushing others to fail).
- Launcher crashes very often (i have to relaunch 3 times to make it work)"
28737,didnt get glizzy skin :(

28746,"Very rarely do I get angry at a video, but Fall Guys hits that sweet spot of constantly getting mad at: 
- your own performance,
- the people around you,
- the in-game physics

If you have friends to play with, then I'd definitely recommend this. If you're just gonna play by yourself, it's only fun in short bursts."

28757,"I won my first game after 40 hours. Deceivingly simple to play, hard af to win."
28758,nice
28759,"Worst game ever honestly. There is 0 skill involved in this, its all rng based due to finals being a maze where if you hit the wrong wall you wont be able to win it at all due to a 2 second mistake. Team game modes completely ruin it aswell due to it being about a solo game and so much dumb shit happens when you have a bad team. It should all be survival and elimination based. Not stupid rng hoops that spawn in and you qual depending on your position. Trust me do not buy this game, On my mums life you will play it for one night and wish you never wasted money on it. Worst game and company ever holy."
28760,"The game is really fun but it has few problems, which i believe will be fixed in the future updates. The first one is random game pick algorithm, sometimes you play the same map over and over. And the seconds is the lag, I'm talking here about time between a player’s input, and the game’s response, it is very noticeable in team maps and it is very annoying."

28858,good
28859,"Fall Guys is one of those games that I've always wished existed. Where you can just goof around on a level, not take things so seriously and just go through a simple yet fun set of obstacle courses. 

I remember when first purchasing it with friends the first thing we noticed was the price tag with many thinking it may be too high. After playing the game for over 20 hours I can safely say that I plan on spending many more hours on this game and I do believe it's worth the price tag. 

Playing with friends is going to be the better way to play and is a lot more enjoyable and it does have a lot of replayability but only in short bursts, I would say. 

Overall, the graphics, gameplay, and value of this game I would say are on point with very minimal bugs from my experience."
28860,ehhh its ok.  now is it fair?  ehhh questionable.  It's fun if you dont care to lose.  buy it when it's on sale.
28861,i like how fun it was and was not hard to run on pc and also does not take up much space
28862,How you make a 3D platformer that controls this bad is beyond me.
28863,it stinks of shit dont play if u dont have much players (crossplatform)

28869,This game is really fun but what i dislike is that it get really repetitive after a while
28870,"Do I recommend the game?  Yes but there are some things that they have to improve

I'm going to be quick : 

If you play it with friends it is much better and more fun than alone. 
You can customize your ""guy"" which I call myself bean, it has a lot of stuff for customizing, some you will get through the game (playing) and some other stuff you will buy it also with coins or crowns you will gain playing, even though that there are some things to buy, it is not a ""pay to win"" game.
-It has some scenaries, more right now because at the beginning there were the same ones and it got boring, now they are introducing more stages, which is nice for not getting the game covered by dust.
-Community is active, so your game will start soon.
-One thing I dislike is that sometimes physics are ""Sh..."" you have done everything well and darrrrrrrrrnnnnn physics...
-Another thing is that I know most of the players would like to put their names and no a randomize name that the game gives you.

In the end, is fun, some laughs, some rage and screaming, and tons of HUGS ;)"

28919,"After 650 hrs on record and 100+ crowns earned (no double crowns, surveys, season pass, or tech support help), this game is bug infested, de-synchronized, & RNG mess.  The surveys have repeated over and over again, get rid of team games and stages that are RNG dependent.   U.S. West still hasn't been fixed and there's is too much dropping of players & severe de-synchronization.  One shouldn't have to constantly e-mail tech support and provide documentation / evidence just to fix this.  The shop doesn't truly rotate and repeats the same cosmetics over and over again.  Is it any wonder why another game that involves social deduction and voting to eject people from a ship causes this game to lose 90% of it's player base?

Epic Games account required now, game is now an epic failure."

29060,"SO I've been playing this game since it came out and I can say that out of all the games that try to hit that childhood itch of being on a game show this is the one that actually hits it and hits it well. I have never booted up this game and not had a blast. My friends joining just make it better.

Out of all the things in this game there are very few things that I do not like. The only things that are not fun are the team games like Egg Scramble and the worst of the worst SeeSaws and the only reason I hate SeeSaws is because when you get into that specific part of the show you will quickly learn that people don't know how SeeSaws work.

Overall 10/10 would play again."

29149,Hilarious
29150,"Prepare to be frustrated. There are plenty of games/boards that have moments of frustration, but there are several that are literal coin flips and/or just nearly impossible for new players. The game isn't completely unfun, but there are times when you'll wonder why you bother playing this game. I wouldn't recommend this game when there are alternatives that are a lot more fun without the hassle."
29151,"I started playing since Season 1, took a break for S2 & S3, and came back in S4 and now we're in S5. I love hopping on every day to do my daily missions, make some progress in the battlepass, and grind those crown shards. Over time, I got better at the game and even managed to get my own wins! Although I may never get the golden knight at the end of the 50th crown rank, I still keep going at it :3 I think because you never know how other players will play, it's always interesting to find someone who'll grab you at the end to take the crown. 

Now that we're in S5, there's so many rounds in the rotation that there's always variety to each run. I know that I can usually expect two race rounds and then from there I have no idea what's next! I also love seeing all the different costume combinations people do :3

I think we all know that feeling of trying to make it to the finish line in the last slot only to see someone waiting there for you to come close only to take your spot at the end. There's frustrating moments, especially in squad matches when someone leaves and your squad is doomed just by sheer numbers. Yet, I think the fun I have outweighs the negatives ^_^"

29180,"This game is still fun even after the hype train left.  Queue times are still short and the added variety from all of the seasons makes the game a lot more enjoyable than when it first launched.  If you didn't enjoy it when it first came out, try it again."

29190,"I had this game set as recommended before but then Epic came in. I used to play all the time with my friends and it was loads of fun. Recently I haven't played it, so today I decided to jump in a quick game or two. Welp now they have TONS of paid content, and the stuff you can get (for actually being good at the game) is sucky stuff like flippers, gloves, sunglasses, you can't get masterchief, cuphead, cadnace, or any of the other characters without dumping a TON of real money into it. I really hope the old fall guys comes back, but I doubt it will. Thanks Epic Games..."

29194,This game is great to play whether its alone or with friends. It can be challenging at times bu i 100% reccomend it.
29195,"Love this game. Great game to kick back, relax and kill a couple hours they keep it pretty fresh it seems. at least enough for a game to play casually every couple of weeks."
29196,"This is by far the absolute WORST platforming game I have ever played. When you aren't stuck on a team with 2 worthless players who jump ship or fuck around the start the entire fucking round, you have to deal with the players who only play to stop others from having fun or getting to the finish line. 

This game had the potential to become something fun and amazing with the mechanics and style, but they chose to make the world's crappiest race-against-assholes, work extra hard to unlock shitty costumes game I have ever seen. Not one second did I enjoy this while sober, I have to be destroying my liver and kidneys with gallons of alcohol just to have a single fun round, and even then it was about as fun as having a tooth pulled with no anesthetic. I tried for hours thinking maybe its just a few bad rounds, but literally there was never a single good one.

Don't play this unless you like pointless stupid games that have no real enjoyment factor and takes you months just to get some shitty costume. I won't be playing this again and I will be telling all of my friends to avoid it."

29221,"It's a really entertaining and funny game; Like playing Mario Galaxy, but online and with a great sense of competitiveness. In contrast to Fortnite, here you can feel your own progress as you progress and know better the different levels. Also, there are levels more difficult than others, and it makes you squeeze your head. I totally recommend this game; I'd brought it because my daughter asked for it, but I'm having the same or more great amusement as she does."

29247,"Very fun game if you are ready to get frustrated!
I absolutely love the concept of playing with others who
you do not need to get to know and correspond with. 

PROS:
Family game for sure!
Prizes and sense of moving up!
Awesome animations!
Levels are fun and very interesting!

CONS:
Too many players who played forever and purposely push you out of the game!
Some of the levels are impossible to get far...
I feel like players that are lower should be playing with other players that are lower level...
it feels like the levels of different players are really making a huge difference...and if you are
at a lower level you will less likely want to play again after getting you butt kicked immediately 
by levels beyond yours.

I re downloaded and I am willing to try again....

I RECOMMEND this game to players who want a challenge and who can catch on quick and move up
VERY QUICK...also a player who does not get discouraged quickly!

I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to players who do not catch on quickly and like slow paced games...and definitely
do not recommend this game to anyone who gets frustrated quickly."

29269,Nice game!
29270,"Honestly this is one of those cases where I wish Steam had a ""mixed"" review.  I do applaud the developers for coming up with a relatively unique idea for a game and the graphics and music are well done, but that's about where the good stuff ends for me.  My main issues are:
- There are too many games that I don't find fun at all (any of the tail games, See Saw, the fruit matching one)
- Even if you advance to the final, if you're anything like me you will lose 9/10 times.  Ultimately it isn't satisfying for me to continue playing a game where ultimately I end up losing 90%+ of the time (even if you play well there is still a lot left to luck) so I ended up deciding there are better ways to spend my time.  I thought maybe the new squad mode would make it better, but most of the time I end up dragged down by my squadmates so I'm better off solo.
- Loading and queue times are longer than they should be at this point in the game's life.

Still, there is some fun to be had here.  Some of the games are actually pretty fun, and I imagine if you play it with friends it is significantly better.  But ultimately if you are a competitive person I highly recommend against this game, and even if you aren't I would watch some gameplay first before buying."
29271,"Even after a year this game continues to get better. I hope they shift away from pegwin related games as the desync issues are really frustrating, but even with that I continue to have a blast and this has become my family's go to game for a family game sesh"
29272,soooo gooooood and ith make you angry sometimes
29273,"I have this on PS4 and it's by far my most played game there. As far as multiplayer games on the PS4 go, I just don't think there's anything that can beat this.
I couldn't properly play this on my laptop due to lag issues and I honestly think the PS4 controller is probably better for this game.

I just hope they push cross-play further soon, so I could be in groups alongside my PC friends.

This game is the main reason I got PS Plus last year, and the reason I'm extending my PS Plus membership for another year.

EDIT: I decided to also purchase this on PC now that they're adding cross-play progression - it's a step in the right direction!"

I could never find a game that fitted me because ever other game in the world has complicated controls with 60 buttons. Fall Guys with 4 buttons is so incredibly simple and fun and made mine and so many others lives better in quarantine.

29435,nice ok lmao
29436,THE BEST
29437,ggood
29438,.
29439,I've been playing this game since S1. It is fun but you have to give in to Epic Games' needs for money in order to play which is dumb. I already gave in to it but I don't like how it makes you accept a few agreements all for a name. I'll play it more if epic doesn't require you to link the account and make you accept some things that might get more data out of you though
29440,Fun game

29446,I got this because i saw everyone playing it so I wanted to try it out but honestly the reason I don't recommend it is because of the random people in a match they just grab because they can but if you're going to play with friends then yeah this can be fun for a while but not by yourself
29447,The superior battle royale.

29459,"Got this game because I wanted to play with friends on their playstations, I assumed since it is considered ""cross-platform"" that I would be able to link up with them on public matches. WRONG. We would have to host a private lobby with a minimum of 12 players in the lobby to even start the game. I don't have 12 friends nor the $20 i spent on this game... want my money back."

29462,pretty cool for its price
29463,gets kinda repetitive but overall its ok

29466,I just think it's neat

29640,"not bad, -play this occationally."
29641,annoying but fun
29642,"I love this game but I hoped it had a bit more players because now what some people say, this game is dead. In my opinion though I love this game, but the amount of players now is not the best. I do still get games in there in there. Great game, honest rate 0-10, I would give it a 8-10. Also with them constintley updating the game. I hope to see even funner stuff in this game! :D"
29643,fun
29644,gets boring after a whil
29645,"Fun little game with a collection of mini games that gets repetitive after a while. Can be played on a casual day, given that loading & player finding takes a lot of time."

My wife showed me Fall Guys a few months ago and we didn't play it much after until now, despite not really being that good at the game she is a pro! Honestly most of the time I'm stuck on the same frustrating steps just to likely end up spectating her anyhow but I like to look at it like training, shes good about vocalizing her thoughts while playing and elaborating her movements, makes learning the tricks a little easier for me. 

Game definitely requires some quick thinking and reflex, consistent moving obstacles and plenty of players to harass you off the edge/drag you down or into a trap makes it even more fun and challenging than the course already can be!

Family friendly even down to the name system and the controls are simple enough that anyone any age could jump in and have a great time after some warm ups!

Goofy player models and bright wacky season rewards make it fun even out of game! I change my player around all the time! 

Over all I say it's a keeper, I don't know how long the fun will last but it hasn't subsided any yet! If you haven't already I say grab it and play with some friends! (or your S/O like I do! <3)"
29647,"You know, sometimes people ask me why I chose to get Fall Guy plastic surgery and I can't really give them an answer. It's not because I'm afraid they'll dislike me or think I'm a freak or anything, it's that I just can't pinpoint an answer. I mean, yeah, the sexual attraction was always there, but I don't think that's really it. My dad was an alcoholic. He was never really there, he was always wasting his time and money at the bar. Before he left for the bar, he would always tell me, ""You stay there and play those games and if you're not there when I get back… well boy, there'll be hell to pay"". So I played video games. My favorite game was Fall Guys. I just loved that bean; the way he talked, the way he sang and dance. It was great. I… I guess I looked at Fall Guy as the father I never had. I mean, he taught me how to ride a bike, he taught me how to swim, he taught me everything. But I didn't just want to be LIKE Fall Guy, I wanted to BE him. Well, here I am, Fall Guy. This is me, this is who I was born to be."
29648,fun with friends and alone
29649,it was fun at first ....now its just way too hard its not even remotely enjoyable anymore
29650,"Played this game since launch (on Playstation) and one year later still love this game, don't have infallible though"

29701,"fell off, used to bun af tho"
29702,"Do not waste your time in this awful game. The maps and the core idea of the game are great, but due to the awful servers and bad net coding, the game is just not fun. You will constantly be grabbed by people from miles away, or feel like you weigh nothing due to getting pushed around by all the other players constantly because for some reason they are all stronger than you."

29706,"Wasn't able to be worth the £15 it costed back when it came out but since then there has been enough updates and feature packs, also known as seasons, to make it seem more reasonably priced now. The hacking scene has also died down significantly and reporting said individuals has never been easier!

Fast paced, Action-packed battle royale platformer. Never considered battle royale style games until this one peaked my interest, good job devs! <3

They have repeatedly since season 1 refused to fix any of the fundamental flaws of the game, and because of that i've lost interest. the £15 i initially spent on it is a complete waste, do not play this game."
29707,Funny
29708,"The game stays fun, and the length of a normal game (10 minutes max) is interesting if like me you do not have a lot of time."

29720,"Having played fine initially, after the crown capers update(July 20th 2021)  this game stopped running on my pc saying my windows version and graphics card drivers were out of date, at the time of this review i was running the latest version of windows 10 and had all the updated graphics drivers from Nvidia ( running on a GTX970) and the game would still not run. customer support has been less than helpful repeatedly telling me to update my system witch i had already done. Edit : i have fixed the issue after trawling trough all the community posts someone posted a YouTube video on how to resolve the issue."
29721,F This Game
29722,"They're forcing you to make an Epic Games account to play, and installing the Epic client on your pc without asking. This is a mandatory change that will makes the game unplayable if you don't use Epic. I use Steam specifically because I despise the business practices of Epic. Do not buy!"

29735,"I really WANT to say good things about this game, the style is cute and nice, but it really, REALLY shouldn't take 10+ hours for people to get a single win in a $20 game. On average, it takes people 10-80 hours for people just to get a single win, it's insanely ridiculous. I've played it for 9 hours straight so far and have had multiple breakdowns over it, it's like 4 in the morning, y'all, my ADD ass isn't emotionally stable enough for a game like this. I still like it, but at the same time I've lost about all my self confidence over the fact I've yet to win a single round in this game. If hell is real, it's Fall Guys."

29766,"falls guys is a game about NOT falling, which is already a contradiction. if you enjoy falling, you lose. should be called climbing guys or jumping guys. also, are all of the people guys? ""y'all fall"" would be a better, more gender-inclusive name. ""y'all climb"" would be perfect.

the graphics are weird. my laptop gets really hot when i play this and it burns my thighs so i have to play on the coffee table which gets me in trouble because my parents don't want me to burn the finish off but i tell them that won't happen, but it did happen and now i cant really play this game so i don't recommend it."
